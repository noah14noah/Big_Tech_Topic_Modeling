Many were simply refuelling on the way to the next discussion at the Milken Global Conference, a gathering of the great and good rivalled perhaps only by the World Economic Forum in Davos.</p><p>It is a place where Sharon Stone brushes past Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin in the crowded halls. It is where The Edge, U2's lead guitarist, talks worthily about \"Food as Medicine\" in one room, while Rajeev Misra, chief executive of the SoftBank Vision Fund, explains how he has ploughed $80bn (\u00a360bn) into tech companies in another.</p><p>The conference is the brainchild of Michael Milken, the junk-bond billionaire who, after serving two years in prison for securities fraud in the 1990s, rebranded himself as a respected financier, philanthropist and convenor of people. Every year the confab of billionaires, politicians and Hollywood A-listers has a different theme, often saccharine. This year's was \"Driving Shared Prosperity\". Last year's was \"Navigating a World in Transition\".</p><p>In fact, three themes emerged last week. One was concern about how technology, and artificial intelligence (AI) in particular, is upending the world as we know it. The second was the sharp societal divisions that have manifested in everything from Brexit to the election of Brazil's new farright president. The third was the next recession.</p><p>While stock markets hit new records, the Masters of the Universe are fretting that the storm clouds are gathering. Debt for companies, households and governments has reached levels not seen since 2008. Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said she was \"concerned\". \"There is that new theory you can borrow your way to the future and that it doesn't matter,\" she said. \"I think it matters.\"</p><p>Ken Griffin, the founder of hedge fund giant Citadel and one of the world's richest people, voiced the concerns of many of the billionaires in attendance: that the masses would rise up and take his money. He said those calling for a dramatic redistribution of wealth \"haven't studied history\". Scott Minerd of Guggenheim Partners warned that \"the disparity in wealth is so extreme, it's feeding populism\". His colleague Alan Schwartz was more blunt: \"What's really coming is class warfare.\"</p><p>Layered on top of those worries is the rise of AI. Kai-Fu Lee, former head of Google China and founder of Sinovation Ventures, told The Sunday Times that up to 40% of jobs would, in time, be automated away by machines. The probable result will be an exacerbation of the wealth gap. According to the Brookings Institution think tank, between 1980 and 2016, a period covering the rise of the personal computer, offshoring and the internet, America generated 54m net new jobs. Yet the quality of those jobs plummeted, with \"middleskilled\" positions, often involving repetitive tasks, being supplanted by technology.</p><p>Vivienne Ming, founder of Socos Labs, said this was the tip of the iceberg. A leading AI researcher, Ming has invented a device that, when placed on the heads of people with traumatic brain injuries, is said to instantly improve their \"working memory span\" by 20%.</p><p>\"This will get commercialised,\" she said, pointing out that better memory translates to up to $30,000 more in annual earnings as well as greater longevity and health.</p><p>\"Someone, somewhere, is going to buy this and put it on their employees, put it on their kids, put it on themselves. If I turn my son into a cyborg, how do you possibly compete?\" Ming likened the lack of AI regulation to the lax oversight of the financial system in the run-up to the 2008 crisis. She said: \"Everyone knew there was a problem, but they couldn't not play the game.\"</p><p>Conspicuously absent from the conference were representatives of Big Tech. While panellists bashed Facebook and YouTube for spreading misinformation and distorting politics, there were few defenders - save for Michael Beckerman, chief executive of the Internet Association, the tech giants' lobbying group. At a panel on tech regulation, he was badly outnumbered.</p><p>It was not all existential melancholy and handwringing, however. Calvin Klein lamented on stage that Instagram, populated by \"influencers\", had \"killed the fashion magazine\". He also reflected on the changing times, recalling how, when Brooke Shields suggestively said in a 1980s advert that \"nothing\" got between her and Calvin Klein jeans, she was just 15 years old. \"Social media and the internet changed everything,\" the fashion designer said.</p><p>And what would a to-do be without a sprinkling of Brexit? Howard Shore, the City tycoon who backed leaving the EU but now spends much of his time at his Bel Air mansion, called Theresa May \"the worst leader in the UK in living memory\" for failing to implement the will of the people amid dire warnings from the media and political establishment. Lord Falconer, who shared the stage, said Shore's views typified the \"crazed paranoia of the leave' people\".</p><p>Predictably, after an hour, the panel had said much but made no progress. Perhaps they will return next year to continue the debate.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>AI research: Vivienne Ming</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STIMES-148944796</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W1V-XMJ1-JCBW-N20P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">332263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"921\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"57900\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 5, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000365</classCode><className>CONFERENCES &amp;

El autor mantiene que las<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> big tech </emphasis>pueden acabar transformando el sector de la banca de manera radical, estimulando la competencia a corto plazo, pero tambi\u00e9n aumentando la inestabilidad financiera e impulsando una concentraci\u00f3n a\u00fan mayor. </p><p>                 El autor, como ya han criticado casi todos los banqueros, explica que la entrada de las grandes tecnol\u00f3gicas en la actividad bancaria, sin que est\u00e9n sometidas a las mismas exigencias que los bancos, implica mayores riesgos para la estabilidad financiera, por eso propone, en primer lugar, \u201cnivelar el campo de juego\u201d y eliminar \u201cla brecha regulatoria\u201d.         El hecho de que por el momento las exigencias regulatorias a las<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> big tech </emphasis>sean menores distorsiona la competencia, seg\u00fan coinciden banqueros y expertos.  Pese a ello, de momento, la mayor\u00eda de los clientes no se f\u00edan a\u00fan de las<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> big tech </emphasis>para abrir una cuenta corriente. As\u00ed, el 42% de los clientes bancarios se cambiar\u00eda a una entidad que no fuera tradicional en caso de que tuviera que elegir un nuevo proveedor financiero, seg\u00fan recoge el<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Bar\u00f3metro de innovaci\u00f3n financiera </emphasis>elaborado por Funcas en colaboraci\u00f3n con Finnovating. Funcas, en otro informe destaca el \u00e9xito de la digitalizaci\u00f3n en la crisis del Covid, por lo que considera que la banca debe a\u00fan someterse a m\u00e1s cierre de oficinas en Espa\u00f1a. La red de las  entidades  espa\u00f1olas sigue siendo la m\u00e1s densa de la UE y tambi\u00e9n la m\u00e1s peque\u00f1a en t\u00e9rminos de empleados por oficina.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CINCOD-1180671</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CINCOD2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:600X-J2F1-F12V-S00S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">222705</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"423\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Estructura, Grupo De Estudios Economicos, S.A.

Adems, habra mantenido reuniones con la FTC para discutir sobre la investigaci\u00f3n a Facebook. Chris Hughes, cofundador de Facebook, tild\u00f3 como \"monopolio\" a la compa\u00f1a que ayud\u00f3 a fundar en 2004 La investigaci\u00f3n iniciada tiene como principal objetivo evaluar las condiciones competitivas en el mercado en el que estas compa\u00f1as se mueven para, en \u00faltima instancia, tomar medidas que puedan garantizar que los ciudadanos tienen acceso a mercados libres en los que las empresas compiten en igualdad de condiciones.En el caso de encontrar una situaci\u00f3n de monopolio, se podra desmantelar la actual estructura de la empresa, iniciativa por la que abog\u00f3 el propio Hughes recientemente en un artculo de opini\u00f3n. \"Es hora de romper Facebook\" El cofundador de Facebook, a lo largo de un amplio texto publicado en The New York Times, asegur\u00f3 que debera revertirse la adquisici\u00f3n de WhatsApp e Instagram por parte de Facebook[4] para favorecer la competencia en el mercado de las plataformas de mensajera y redes sociales. </p><p>La participaci\u00f3n de Chris Hughes podra resultar decisiva en la decisi\u00f3n que se tomase respecto a Facebook y su futuro Chris Hughes en 2011.

Seg\u00fan The Washington Post, los dos acadmicos a los que ayuda pretenden argumentar a favor de la desmembraci\u00f3n de Facebook en peque\u00f1as partes basndose en la compra de WhatsApp e Instagram como clave. De acuerdo con su argumentaci\u00f3n, coincidente con la de Hughes, estas adquisiciones rompieron las normas antimonopolio.Sostienen que gracias a tener en sus manos el control de WhatsApp e Instagram, Facebook acab\u00f3 con la competencia que tena y se encumbr\u00f3 en una posici\u00f3n monopolstica. No obstante, no resultar sencillo, porque como explican en The Verge[10], estas dos personas tendran que probar que la intenci\u00f3n de Facebook con las adquisiciones era acabar con las amenazas futuras en su mercado.La compa\u00f1a se defiende, a travs de uno de sus ejecutivos, justificando las compras como \"inversiones en innovaci\u00f3n\". Facebook no ha querido comentar ni con The New York Times ni con The Washington Post las informaciones sobre la colaboraci\u00f3n de Hughes en la investigaci\u00f3n antimonopolio.

Seg\u00fan The Washington Post, los dos acadmicos a los que ayuda pretenden argumentar a favor de la desmembraci\u00f3n de Facebook en peque\u00f1as partes basndose en la compra de WhatsApp e Instagram como clave. De acuerdo con su argumentaci\u00f3n, coincidente con la de Hughes, estas adquisiciones rompieron las normas antimonopolio.Sostienen que gracias a tener en sus manos el control de WhatsApp e Instagram, Facebook acab\u00f3 con la competencia que tena y se encumbr\u00f3 en una posici\u00f3n monopolstica. No obstante, no resultar sencillo, porque como explican en The Verge[10], estas dos personas tendran que probar que la intenci\u00f3n de Facebook con las adquisiciones era acabar con las amenazas futuras en su mercado.La compa\u00f1a se defiende, a travs de uno de sus ejecutivos, justificando las compras como \"inversiones en innovaci\u00f3n\". Facebook no ha querido comentar ni con The New York Times ni con The Washington Post las informaciones sobre la colaboraci\u00f3n de Hughes en la investigaci\u00f3n antimonopolio.

Las nuevas prestaciones se agregaban a la plataforma base, que a da de hoy es irreconocible. Las operaciones y procesos de soporte tambin han experimentado un cambio notable, pero tampoco encajan con las necesidades actuales. </p><p>La ventaja competitiva de los bancos ms modernos es su agilidad, que consiguen mediante la tecnologa. Esto ha reducido los costos de funcionamiento y creado nuevos modelos de negocio basados en el cobro por valor aportado y no por servicios prestados. Y es que a los clientes no les entusiasma pagar por servicios que son gratuitos en otros sectores; es como pagar por tener una cuenta de cliente frecuente con una aerolnea o un supermercado. De momento, esta amplia selecci\u00f3n de proveedores se limita a servicios bancarios menos convencionales en los que firmas FinTech se dedican a servicios rentables y especializados como el Cambio de Divisas, Financiaci\u00f3n Colectiva, Pagos Digitales, Inversiones Low Cost. Esto aporta mayor velocidad, control y comodidad a los clientes, mientras perjudica a servicios bancarios rentables, exponiendo a su vez el alto costo de funcionamiento que supone una base anticuada que no cuenta con servicios adicionales. Sin embargo, el cambio de n\u00fameros en cuentas bancarias es la \"joya de la corona\" para los bancos a la hora de retener clientes y conseguir datos de inters. Pero se ha mantenido en menos del 6% de todas las cuentas bancarias del Reino Unido desde que se lanz\u00f3 el Servicio de Cambio de Cuenta Corriente (CASS)[1] en 2013. Se espera que esto aumente tras la implementaci\u00f3n de Open Banking. En un mundo de Open Banking aumenta la amenaza para los bancos tradicionales, ya que si bien tienen ms datos sobre sus clientes a travs de mayores transacciones, esto se ve contrarrestado por menos contactos y relaciones menos personales. Esto dificulta el desarrollo de una relaci\u00f3n ms comprometida. A medida que tanto los bancos ms modernos como las firmas de BigTech atraen a ms clientes y desarrollan su potencial, la banca tradicional sufre las consecuencias. Las grandes firmas tecnol\u00f3gicas como Google, Apple, Facebook y Amazon tienen dos factores que las empresas de Fintech y los bancos ms modernos no tienen: una amplia base de clientes y su confianza en la marca, algo que los bancos tradicionales hist\u00f3ricamente consideraban su mejor atributo. La respuesta de los bancos tradicionales puede ocurrir de tres maneras. Primero, podran igualar el terreno modernizando las plataformas tecnol\u00f3gicas, que actualmente generan altos costos y ralentizan su velocidad de lanzamiento al mercado. Esto reducira su desventaja competitiva frente a los nuevos actores, pero es un camino largo, costoso y difcil. Algunos lo han intentado, ninguno lo ha logrado del todo. BBVA[2] es un gran ejemplo de un comienzo de transformaci\u00f3n digital con xito. El banco ha recibido elogios porque adapt\u00f3 los procesos, cultura corporativa, estructura de gesti\u00f3n, y se centr\u00f3 en la innovaci\u00f3n en el servicio al consumidor para afrontar los pr\u00f3ximos desafos. En segundo lugar, podran establecer un proveedor de 'Utilidades', ya sea dirigido por un solo banco o por varios. Dicha utilidad podra ofrecer los servicios bsicos de la industria que generan gran parte del costo actual y la inflexibilidad (la prevenci\u00f3n del fraude, el almacenamiento de datos, las conciliaciones, la integraci\u00f3n son algunos de los principales candidatos). Esto tiene ventajas y desventajas. Aunque un \u00fanico proveedor de servicios para la industria reducira el costo de funcionamiento y -en reas como la prevenci\u00f3n del fraude- proporcionara mejores datos para todos, los bancos siguen siendo reacios a ceder su independencia y compartir servicios con sus competidores. Un primer ejemplo de una utilidad bancaria en el Reino Unido es el servicio de verificaci\u00f3n Intelligent Processing Solutions Limited (iPSL)[3], creado en 2000 como una empresa conjunta entre Barclays, Lloyds y Unisys. Una tercera opci\u00f3n sera colaborar de forma ms activa con las firmas Big Tech como Amazon, Facebook o Google. Hasta ahora, estos titanes de la tecnologa no bancaria han ido con cuidado de no convertirse en entidades financieras como tal, por temor a regulaciones complicadas y mayor escrutinio, aunque necesitan los datos y la frecuencia de las transacciones que ofrecen los clientes bancarios. En este sentido, HSBC se ha asociado con Amazon Web Services (AWS) para habilitar sus operaciones en la nube, y Alipay ha firmado un acuerdo con BNP Paribas[4], Barclays y UniCredit, entre otros colaboradores. Colaboraciones ms profundas y ambiciosas podran llevar este modelo mucho ms all. En el futuro, los gigantes tecnol\u00f3gicos pueden sentir que esta es una industria suficientemente madura, y como tal un l\u00f3gico siguiente paso sera adentrarse en ella. Adopten la opci\u00f3n que adopten los bancos tradicionales, est claro que la fuerza de disrupci\u00f3n que tiene la tecnologa en manos de nuevos actores ya no es s\u00f3lo una posible amenaza sino una real. A medida que crece el inters de las empresas tecnol\u00f3gicas por el sector financiero, los obstculos que impedan a las firmas FinTech expander sus ofertas (falta de alcance, falta de reconocimiento, falta de fondos) comienzan a desaparecer. Superar el miedo al cambio es el principal desafo para los bancos tradicionales. Vemos tres acciones que son clave para la transformaci\u00f3n interna de los bancos, y para ganar relevancia y competitividad en el mercado bancario actual: 1. Identificar los servicios de valor a\u00f1adido que los clientes esperan de ellos. Asegurar que dichos servicios se ofrezcan al ms alto nivel. 2. Adquirir los servicios bsicos de los principales colaboradores tecnol\u00f3gicos para facilitar operaciones low-cost y a escala que se puedan adaptar a las demandas regulatorias y del mercado. 3. Proporcionar servicios de utilidad a nivel industrial para optimizar el coste/beneficio y el valor a\u00f1adido como parte de un ecosistema bancario. La gente sigue necesitando servicios bancarios, aunque ya no s\u00f3lo por parte de bancos. Los servicios en s tambin estn cambiando rpidamente, aportando valor al usuario financiero y transformando la industria bancaria. Pueden los bancos seguir siendo relevantes?

Eleanor let me ask you a kind of straight question, first of all, related to Alibaba, is Alibaba going to rescue us today? The tech story out of China has been so disappointing. Is Alibaba going to turn it around?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ELEANOR CREAGH, MARKET STRATEGIST, SAXO CAPITAL MARKETS: I think that's definitely the question on a lot of investors' mind. So I think depending on Alibaba result later today could really set the bellwether for Asian tech moving forward. Analysts start expecting Alibaba's revenue to grow at around 61% year-on-year, but this revenue growth is coming out of cost to Alibaba as their margins have decreased significantly. So Alibaba have invested heavily to achieve this growth in offline retail, therefore, supermarket and also food delivery with Ele.me. And they've also invested heavily into A.I. and logistics. And it's really whether investors will forgo this margin squeeze in the event of achieving future growth.</p><p>JOHNSON: Yes. That's sound awfully like Amazon to me, but I guess you can compare and contrast the two businesses. How out of whack is the Chinese tech sector versus the U.S. tech sector? In so many ways, they are similar, yet at the moment, they look like they're on different planets.</p><p>CREAGH: Your exactly right there. So traditionally, Chinese tech actually trade for the valuation premium to U.S. tech. And what we've seen is sentiment in China has been very negative and a lot of the individual tech companies have also suffered individual problems, like Tencent with the gaming regulations, and we've also seen that growth really hasn't lift up to expectations. So we've seen a repricing across the entire sector more broadly. And actually this has brought the valuation premium down to levels that we haven't seen for the past six years. So it could present quite opportunity for investors now.</p><p>JOHNSON: Are there going to be better entry points still to come? I guess it's the question the people are asking themselves.</p><p>CREAGH: I think so that's largely going to depend tonight on Alibaba's earnings report. And I think that would be a bellwether moving forward for Asian tech, in general. And I do think it could be a bumpy ride as a lot of the companies, they -- possibly subject to some squeeze from the trade war. But a lot of these Chinese tech companies do generate their revenues domestically, so it shouldn't be too impacted from the trade war. And I think although it could be a bumpy ride moving forward, this could really present a long-term opportunity for investors.</p><p>JOHNSON: It was interesting, I was listening to our correspondent Tom McKenzie, he joins us from Chongqing a little earlier on where there is a big tech event taking place today and Alibaba is there, Jack Ma is there, a whole bunch of the kind of tech superstars are there from China. And what he was saying and what he was hearing was that they're concerned that while the trade story is manageable, it's the impact it's having on innovation that is really where they feel the damage is going to be done. And that is where maybe the valuations don't reflect how the trade story is ultimately going to impact the bottom line.</p><p>CREAGH: I think you're exactly right there. But I do think when it comes to Chinese tech, the innovation is still there and I think the Chinese government as well have ring-fenced the industry sufficiently that we shouldn't see too much impact from the trade war moving forward, although it is a sector that I think Donald Trump is keen to put on the wraps, so I think it threatens the U.S.'s dominance in terms of the technology space.</p><p>JOHNSON: Just a final quick question. Tencent, Alibaba, these are massive stocks with a huge impact on emerging market portfolios. They make up such a huge weighting in those portfolios. How difficult is it to invest in EM right now? How we difficult that need to invest elsewhere in EM with what is happening with these stocks?</p><p>CREAGH: I think with what's happening with them, Alibaba with Tencent, it's really intended (ph) to sentiment in emerging market and in a tech sector in general, especially in China. But I do think that we are seeing valuations in the U.S. market have become very stretched relative to emerging market, and that really presents an opportunity for investors now to start averaging into emerging markets.</p><p>JOHNSON: Eleanor, great stuff, thank you very much indeed for spending some of your time with us here at Bloomberg.

Eleanor let me ask you a kind of straight question, first of all, related to Alibaba, is Alibaba going to rescue us today? The tech story out of China has been so disappointing. Is Alibaba going to turn it around?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ELEANOR CREAGH, MARKET STRATEGIST, SAXO CAPITAL MARKETS: I think that's definitely the question on a lot of investors' mind. So I think depending on Alibaba result later today could really set the bellwether for Asian tech moving forward. Analysts start expecting Alibaba's revenue to grow at around 61% year-on-year, but this revenue growth is coming out of cost to Alibaba as their margins have decreased significantly. So Alibaba have invested heavily to achieve this growth in offline retail, therefore, supermarket and also food delivery with Ele.me. And they've also invested heavily into A.I. and logistics. And it's really whether investors will forgo this margin squeeze in the event of achieving future growth.</p><p>JOHNSON: Yes. That's sound awfully like Amazon to me, but I guess you can compare and contrast the two businesses. How out of whack is the Chinese tech sector versus the U.S. tech sector? In so many ways, they are similar, yet at the moment, they look like they're on different planets.</p><p>CREAGH: Your exactly right there. So traditionally, Chinese tech actually trade for the valuation premium to U.S. tech. And what we've seen is sentiment in China has been very negative and a lot of the individual tech companies have also suffered individual problems, like Tencent with the gaming regulations, and we've also seen that growth really hasn't lift up to expectations. So we've seen a repricing across the entire sector more broadly. And actually this has brought the valuation premium down to levels that we haven't seen for the past six years. So it could present quite opportunity for investors now.</p><p>JOHNSON: Are there going to be better entry points still to come? I guess it's the question the people are asking themselves.</p><p>CREAGH: I think so that's largely going to depend tonight on Alibaba's earnings report. And I think that would be a bellwether moving forward for Asian tech, in general. And I do think it could be a bumpy ride as a lot of the companies, they -- possibly subject to some squeeze from the trade war. But a lot of these Chinese tech companies do generate their revenues domestically, so it shouldn't be too impacted from the trade war. And I think although it could be a bumpy ride moving forward, this could really present a long-term opportunity for investors.</p><p>JOHNSON: It was interesting, I was listening to our correspondent Tom McKenzie, he joins us from Chongqing a little earlier on where there is a big tech event taking place today and Alibaba is there, Jack Ma is there, a whole bunch of the kind of tech superstars are there from China. And what he was saying and what he was hearing was that they're concerned that while the trade story is manageable, it's the impact it's having on innovation that is really where they feel the damage is going to be done. And that is where maybe the valuations don't reflect how the trade story is ultimately going to impact the bottom line.</p><p>CREAGH: I think you're exactly right there. But I do think when it comes to Chinese tech, the innovation is still there and I think the Chinese government as well have ring-fenced the industry sufficiently that we shouldn't see too much impact from the trade war moving forward, although it is a sector that I think Donald Trump is keen to put on the wraps, so I think it threatens the U.S.'s dominance in terms of the technology space.</p><p>JOHNSON: Just a final quick question. Tencent, Alibaba, these are massive stocks with a huge impact on emerging market portfolios. They make up such a huge weighting in those portfolios. How difficult is it to invest in EM right now? How we difficult that need to invest elsewhere in EM with what is happening with these stocks?</p><p>CREAGH: I think with what's happening with them, Alibaba with Tencent, it's really intended (ph) to sentiment in emerging market and in a tech sector in general, especially in China. But I do think that we are seeing valuations in the U.S. market have become very stretched relative to emerging market, and that really presents an opportunity for investors now to start averaging into emerging markets.</p><p>JOHNSON: Eleanor, great stuff, thank you very much indeed for spending some of your time with us here at Bloomberg.

Eleanor let me ask you a kind of straight question, first of all, related to Alibaba, is Alibaba going to rescue us today? The tech story out of China has been so disappointing. Is Alibaba going to turn it around?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CREAGH</emphasis>:  I think that's definitely the question on a lot of investors' mind. So I think depending on Alibaba result later today could really set the bellwether for Asian tech moving forward. Analysts start expecting Alibaba's revenue to grow at around 61% year-on-year, but this revenue growth is coming out of cost to Alibaba as their margins have decreased significantly. So Alibaba have invested heavily to achieve this growth in offline retail, therefore, supermarket and also food delivery with Ele.me. And they've also invested heavily into A.I. and logistics. And it's really whether investors will forgo this margin squeeze in the event of achieving future growth.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Yes. That's sound awfully like Amazon to me, but I guess you can compare and contrast the two businesses. How out of whack is the Chinese tech sector versus the U.S. tech sector? In so many ways, they are similar, yet at the moment, they look like they're on different planets.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CREAGH</emphasis>:  Your exactly right there. So traditionally, Chinese tech actually trade for the valuation premium to U.S. tech. And what we've seen is sentiment in China has been very negative and a lot of the individual tech companies have also suffered individual problems, like Tencent with the gaming regulations, and we've also seen that growth really hasn't lift up to expectations. So we've seen a repricing across the entire sector more broadly. And actually this has brought the valuation premium down to levels that we haven't seen for the past six years. So it could present quite opportunity for investors now.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Are there going to be better entry points still to come? I guess it's the question the people are asking themselves.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CREAGH</emphasis>:  I think so that's largely going to depend tonight on Alibaba's earnings report. And I think that would be a bellwether moving forward for Asian tech, in general. And I do think it could be a bumpy ride as a lot of the companies, they -- possibly subject to some squeeze from the trade war. But a lot of these Chinese tech companies do generate their revenues domestically, so it shouldn't be too impacted from the trade war. And I think although it could be a bumpy ride moving forward, this could really present a long-term opportunity for investors.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  It was interesting, I was listening to our correspondent Tom McKenzie, he joins us from Chongqing a little earlier on where there is a big tech event taking place today and Alibaba is there, Jack Ma is there, a whole bunch of the kind of tech superstars are there from China. And what he was saying and what he was hearing was that they're concerned that while the trade story is manageable, it's the impact it's having on innovation that is really where they feel the damage is going to be done. And that is where maybe the valuations don't reflect how the trade story is ultimately going to impact the bottom line.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CREAGH</emphasis>:  I think you're exactly right there. But I do think when it comes to Chinese tech, the innovation is still there and I think the Chinese government as well have ring-fenced the industry sufficiently that we shouldn't see too much impact from the trade war moving forward, although it is a sector that I think Donald Trump is keen to put on the wraps, so I think it threatens the U.S.'s dominance in terms of the technology space.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Just a final quick question. Tencent, Alibaba, these are massive stocks with a huge impact on emerging market portfolios. They make up such a huge weighting in those portfolios. How difficult is it to invest in EM right now? How we difficult that need to invest elsewhere in EM with what is happening with these stocks?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CREAGH</emphasis>:  I think with what's happening with them, Alibaba with Tencent, it's really intended (ph) to sentiment in emerging market and in a tech sector in general, especially in China. But I do think that we are seeing valuations in the U.S. market have become very stretched relative to emerging market, and that really presents an opportunity for investors now to start averaging into emerging markets.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Eleanor, great stuff, thank you very much indeed for spending some of your time with us here at Bloomberg. Eleanor Creagh, Market Strategist joining us us from Saxo Bank.  </p><p>      END   </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FMRWRE2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T3W-SPS1-F15W-H2DH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">345281</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>Financial Markets Regulatory Wire</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

The stakes are high, and the outcome will reverberate across the world in a number of spheres, not least the economy. Yet, thus far, most discussions of candidates' economic policy proposals have been based more on feelings or ideology than rigorous analysis.Barring a major unforeseen catastrophe, US economic performance will play a decisive role in the election. If the economy remains strong, unemployment is at a 50-year low for all workers, and its lowest-ever level for African-Americans and Hispanics, President Donald Trump stands a good chance of winning a second term.Yet downside risks are mounting. </p><p>If they materialise, a Trump victory would become less likely. According to recent\u00a0models\u00a0by Moody's Analytics, it would take a tanking economy, or unusually high voter turnout among Democrats, but not Republicans, for Trump to lose in 2020.As centre-left former Vice President Joe Biden, the early frontrunner for the Democratic Party nomination, loses ground to the far-left US Senator from Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, Trump's chances of success may be rising. Then again, in the 1980 election, the most conservative Republican candidate, Ronald Reagan, whom I advised, was also labeled unelectable.If Trump does win a second term, he cannot always be expected to pursue traditionally conservative economic policies, such as his 2017\u00a0Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which brought the US corporate-tax rate in line with the OECD average. Judging by hints from him and his advisers, however, he can be expected to pursue another round of regulatory and\u00a0tax reform.Meanwhile, Democratic presidential candidates favour expanding the social safety net, beginning with health care. While some want to build on President Barack Obama's 2010 Affordable Care Act, which Trump and congressional Republicans failed to 'repeal and replace', others hope to eliminate private insurance, on which two-thirds of Americans depend.In place of private health insurance, Democrats like Warren and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders plan to introduce\u00a0a government single-payer system. The costs would be staggering, over $30 trillion in the first decade, by some\u00a0estimates. Sanders would raise taxes; Warren is trying to dodge saying so. Given the price tag, that would have to mean massive income or payroll tax hikes, or a Europe-style regressive value-added tax, any of which would fall heavily on the middle class and weaken economic incentives.But that is not all: Democrats also plan to introduce expensive subsidies, tax breaks, direct spending, loan forgiveness and other giveaways, insisting that these proposals can be funded largely by increasing taxes on the wealthiest Americans. Biden wants to double the capital gains tax; Warren would almost double the top\u00a0marginal income-tax rate\u00a0from 37 per cent to 70 per cent, and both she and Sanders favor new wealth taxes, which even most Nordic countries have abolished. But their math does not add up, by at least an\u00a0order of magnitude.There is one area where Trump and the Democrats both want to spend more: Infrastructure. Repairing and maintaining roads, ports and airports is partly the federal government's responsibility, but state, local and private finance should be expanded. Neither Trump nor any of the Democratic candidates seeking to challenge him has put forward a serious plan. With neither party focused on fiscal responsibility, the growing unfunded liabilities in Social Security and Medicare, several times the national debt, mean Americans will face far more damaging tax hikes or draconian spending cuts in the future.Trump and his Democratic opponents diverge much more sharply on government regulation. Trump has made rolling back excessive Obama-era regulations a high priority. While courts have blocked some of his efforts, as they did to Obama, he has successfully weakened or repealed a number of measures\u00a0on energy and the environment, healthcare and finance that Republicans deemed too costly.The Democratic candidates, especially Warren, hope to do just the opposite. Some favour stronger regulation and antitrust enforcement concerning Big Tech, while Sanders and Warren advocate breaking up the sector's largest companies. All support the $10 trillion\u00a0Green New Deal, an economically, scientifically, and numerically\u00a0illiterate\u00a0program, or even more radical plans. A Democratic president could also be expected to tighten financial regulation, and potentially even introduce radical changes to corporate law.On trade, Trump has placed a high priority on changing dynamics that he considers unfair. It is on these grounds that he negotiated a modest\u00a0revision\u00a0to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which awaits congressional approval, and introduced escalating tariffs on China.But the trade war against China that Trump launched last year has become a drag on business investment, dampening the positive effects of his tax and regulatory reforms. Fortunately, the US and China recently reached a temporary agreement forestalling further tariff hikes while a more comprehensive deal is negotiated. Although the Democrats have often criticised Trump's approach, they are not proposing further trade liberalisation.A final question to consider when assessing the US presidential candidates is whom each would appoint as the next chair of the US Federal Reserve. Trump, who has repeatedly criticised current chair Jerome Powell for pursuing too little monetary-policy easing, would probably select a dovish candidate.A left-leaning Democrat might do the same, given the left's fascination with risky ideas that promote massive amounts of Fed-funded debt. Centre-leftists, Biden, Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg, might reappoint Powell, who has done a good job, or select a moderate Democratic economist, such as former Fed Vice Chair\u00a0Alan Blinder\u00a0or former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers.With so many candidates still on the field, investors and financial markets seem to be awaiting stronger signals about the political future and the considerable, but different, economic and financial risks that a victory by each would entail.\u00a0Michael J.

The stakes are high, and the outcome will reverberate across the world in a number of spheres, not least the economy. Yet, thus far, most discussions of candidates' economic policy proposals have been based more on feelings or ideology than rigorous analysis.Barring a major unforeseen catastrophe, US economic performance will play a decisive role in the election. If the economy remains strong, unemployment is at a 50-year low for all workers, and its lowest-ever level for African-Americans and Hispanics, President Donald Trump stands a good chance of winning a second term.Yet downside risks are mounting. </p><p>If they materialise, a Trump victory would become less likely. According to recent\u00a0models\u00a0by Moody's Analytics, it would take a tanking economy, or unusually high voter turnout among Democrats, but not Republicans, for Trump to lose in 2020.As centre-left former Vice President Joe Biden, the early frontrunner for the Democratic Party nomination, loses ground to the far-left US Senator from Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, Trump's chances of success may be rising. Then again, in the 1980 election, the most conservative Republican candidate, Ronald Reagan, whom I advised, was also labeled unelectable.If Trump does win a second term, he cannot always be expected to pursue traditionally conservative economic policies, such as his 2017\u00a0Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which brought the US corporate-tax rate in line with the OECD average. Judging by hints from him and his advisers, however, he can be expected to pursue another round of regulatory and\u00a0tax reform.Meanwhile, Democratic presidential candidates favour expanding the social safety net, beginning with health care. While some want to build on President Barack Obama's 2010 Affordable Care Act, which Trump and congressional Republicans failed to 'repeal and replace', others hope to eliminate private insurance, on which two-thirds of Americans depend.In place of private health insurance, Democrats like Warren and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders plan to introduce\u00a0a government single-payer system. The costs would be staggering, over $30 trillion in the first decade, by some\u00a0estimates. Sanders would raise taxes; Warren is trying to dodge saying so. Given the price tag, that would have to mean massive income or payroll tax hikes, or a Europe-style regressive value-added tax, any of which would fall heavily on the middle class and weaken economic incentives.But that is not all: Democrats also plan to introduce expensive subsidies, tax breaks, direct spending, loan forgiveness and other giveaways, insisting that these proposals can be funded largely by increasing taxes on the wealthiest Americans. Biden wants to double the capital gains tax; Warren would almost double the top\u00a0marginal income-tax rate\u00a0from 37 per cent to 70 per cent, and both she and Sanders favor new wealth taxes, which even most Nordic countries have abolished. But their math does not add up, by at least an\u00a0order of magnitude.There is one area where Trump and the Democrats both want to spend more: Infrastructure. Repairing and maintaining roads, ports and airports is partly the federal government's responsibility, but state, local and private finance should be expanded. Neither Trump nor any of the Democratic candidates seeking to challenge him has put forward a serious plan. With neither party focused on fiscal responsibility, the growing unfunded liabilities in Social Security and Medicare, several times the national debt, mean Americans will face far more damaging tax hikes or draconian spending cuts in the future.Trump and his Democratic opponents diverge much more sharply on government regulation. Trump has made rolling back excessive Obama-era regulations a high priority. While courts have blocked some of his efforts, as they did to Obama, he has successfully weakened or repealed a number of measures\u00a0on energy and the environment, healthcare and finance that Republicans deemed too costly.The Democratic candidates, especially Warren, hope to do just the opposite. Some favour stronger regulation and antitrust enforcement concerning Big Tech, while Sanders and Warren advocate breaking up the sector's largest companies. All support the $10 trillion\u00a0Green New Deal, an economically, scientifically, and numerically\u00a0illiterate\u00a0program, or even more radical plans. A Democratic president could also be expected to tighten financial regulation, and potentially even introduce radical changes to corporate law.On trade, Trump has placed a high priority on changing dynamics that he considers unfair. It is on these grounds that he negotiated a modest\u00a0revision\u00a0to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which awaits congressional approval, and introduced escalating tariffs on China.But the trade war against China that Trump launched last year has become a drag on business investment, dampening the positive effects of his tax and regulatory reforms. Fortunately, the US and China recently reached a temporary agreement forestalling further tariff hikes while a more comprehensive deal is negotiated. Although the Democrats have often criticised Trump's approach, they are not proposing further trade liberalisation.A final question to consider when assessing the US presidential candidates is whom each would appoint as the next chair of the US Federal Reserve. Trump, who has repeatedly criticised current chair Jerome Powell for pursuing too little monetary-policy easing, would probably select a dovish candidate.A left-leaning Democrat might do the same, given the left's fascination with risky ideas that promote massive amounts of Fed-funded debt. Centre-leftists, Biden, Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg, might reappoint Powell, who has done a good job, or select a moderate Democratic economist, such as former Fed Vice Chair\u00a0Alan Blinder\u00a0or former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers.With so many candidates still on the field, investors and financial markets seem to be awaiting stronger signals about the political future and the considerable, but different, economic and financial risks that a victory by each would entail.\u00a0Michael J.

The man who massacred 51 people at a Christchurch, New Zealand, mosque streamed video of the attack live on Facebook. And the shooter who gunned down three people at Gilroy\u2019s garlic festival appeared to upload an Instagram post referencing a white nationalist author just hours before he opened fire.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As the death toll rises from shootings carried out by people who\u2019ve espoused white nationalist ideas, some Democratic presidential candidates are calling for social media companies to more forcefully crack down on hateful content on their platforms. Their goal is to make it harder for groups or individuals to coordinate their activities and circulate content targeting racial, ethnic and religious minorities.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> But the candidates\u2019 farthest-reaching proposals to stop extremists from weaponizing the internet have also sparked constitutional concerns over how far the government can go in policing online speech.</p><p> Social media has long been a crucial tool for extremist groups to disseminate their rhetoric and recruit new supporters \u2014 both on fringe right-wing platforms like 8chan and in dark corners of more mainstream networks.</p><p> The organizers of white nationalist protests in Charlottesville in August 2017 that left one woman dead organized their event with Facebook group chats, as well as on the chat website Discord. And the man who killed 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue last October had a history of sharing content and interacting with high-profile white nationalists on the right-wing social media network Gab in the year before his attack, an analysis by the Southern Poverty Law Center found.</p><p> The El Paso gunman cited the Christchurch massacre in a manifesto he posted online, while the Christchurch shooter, in turn, cited a 2011 mass murder in Norway carried out by an Islamophobic extremist \u2014 a sign of how one attack can inspire others in a deadly cycle.</p><p> \u201cWhite supremacists are using social media to connect and spread their hate and evil to others,\u201d said Farah Pandith, a former State Department official who focused on fighting violent extremism and has written a book on the subject. \u201cThe tech companies have been slow to act and limited in their scope \u2014 we have to be realistic about the importance and seriousness of this threat.\u201d</p><p> And it is a serious threat. Domestic right-wing terrorism is responsible for more deaths on U.S. soil since 9/11 than jihadism, according to statistics compiled by the New America think tank. Experts say many of those attacks appear to be fueled by strands of the same racist ideology that white people are being \u201creplaced\u201d by minorities or foreigners.</p><p> Former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, an El Paso native, would go farthest of the presidential candidates in rethinking legal protections for social networks.</p><p> Currently, social media companies are insulated from lawsuits about content posted by users, under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act \u2014 a provision that\u2019s been called \u201cthe 26 words that created the internet.\u201d</p><p> O\u2019Rourke\u2019s proposal would strip that legal immunity from large companies that don\u2019t set policies to block content that incites violence, intimidation, harassment, threats or defamation based on traits like race, sex or religion. And all internet companies could be held liable for knowingly promoting content that incites violence.</p><p> \u201cThis is a matter of life and death, and tech executives have a moral obligation to play an active role in banning online activities that incite violence and acts of domestic terrorism,\u201d O\u2019Rourke spokeswoman Aleigha Cavalier said in an email.</p><p> Most experts believe the First Amendment allows private companies to block content on their platforms. But it\u2019s questionable whether the government can tell social media companies what speech they should block and what they should allow, said Jeff Kosseff, a cybersecurity law professor at the United States Naval Academy who wrote a book on legal protections in the digital age.</p><p> Kosseff said it\u2019s a legal issue that hasn\u2019t been tested in the courts, and the outcome would depend on the exact language of the law O\u2019Rourke is proposing.</p><p> \u201cThere are certain types of speech that the government can regulate,\u201d such as imminent incitement of violence, or literal threats, he said. \u201cBut hate speech standing alone is really tricky.\u201d</p><p> Hate speech that isn\u2019t an imminent threat is still protected by the Constitution, noted Daphne Keller, a researcher at Stanford\u2019s Center for Internet and Society and a former associate general counsel for Google. \u201cA law can\u2019t just ban it. And Congress can\u2019t just tell platforms to ban it, either \u2014 that use of government power would still violate the First Amendment,\u201d she said.</p><p> Many of the mainstream social giants already have voluntarily set terms of service that seek to block white nationalist content. Earlier this summer, YouTube said it would remove videos that promote white nationalism and other forms of hate speech, as well as videos denying the Holocaust.</p><p> But putting those policies into effect can be tricky. Sometimes, white nationalists just create new accounts after they\u2019re banned, forcing platforms to play a game of whack-a-mole.</p><p> \u201cThis isn\u2019t something you can throw a bunch of A.I. at to fix,\u201d Kosseff said. \u201cThe types of threats are evolving so rapidly.\u201d</p><p> The law protecting social media companies from lawsuits, Section 230, has already faced criticism from both sides of the aisle in recent months, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. Increased attention on how extremist thought spreads on the platform could give critics of the law more ammunition.</p><p> To combat online extremism, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg is proposing the government work with social media companies to help them fight the spread of hateful ideology, such as providing federal funding to improve software tools to identify extremism. That work would be \u201cwithin the boundaries of internet companies\u2019 terms of service and consistent with the First Amendment,\u201d Buttigieg\u2019s plan states.</p><p> He also wants to invest $1 billion to increase the FBI\u2019s domestic counterterrorism field staff and reverse Trump administration cuts to programs.</p><p> \u201cAs an intelligence officer in the United States military who specialized in counterterrorism, I\u2019ve seen firsthand what a concerted, coordinated effort to fight terror can do and what it will take to fully confront this threat,\u201d Buttigieg wrote in his plan.</p><p> Meanwhile, both Buttigieg and California Sen. Kamala Harris have called for federal law enforcement to more actively monitor websites that are known as hotbeds of white nationalist thought.</p><p> Harris wants to expand the mandate of the National Counterterrorism Center to include domestic, white-nationalist terrorism, not just foreign threats. She\u2019d also work to pass legislation letting courts temporarily take firearms away from \u201ca suspected terrorist or individual who may imminently perpetrate a hate crime.\u201d</p><p> And O\u2019Rourke and former housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro have said the U.S. should sign on to the Christchurch Call for Action, a commitment by governments and tech companies to eliminate terrorist and violent extremist content online. The Trump administration has declined to join the pact.</p><p> The debate over online extremism is just the latest example of Democratic candidates taking a hard line on Silicon Valley, with issues like breaking up big tech companies. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who\u2019s championed that idea, says the growing influence of white supremacist groups on social media shows more needs to be done. Warren has argued that splitting up Facebook and other large companies would force them to be more accountable for their content, a campaign spokesperson said.</p><p> Former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders have called for a renewed focus by law enforcement on white nationalism, but haven\u2019t released specific plans on the issue.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">VALEJO-4417156</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2896AD05F0C801 VALEJO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WYY-0C51-JBCN-40JB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">279928</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1328\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Times-Herald All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Vallejo Times-Herald (California)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 4, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Article</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>CC000CLIC</classCode><className>SOUTHERN POVERTY LAW CENTER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>NAICS541110 OFFICES OF LAWYERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>SIC8111 LEGAL SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Many might bristle at even being asked to pose for a selfie with a Facebook executive, much less run with one.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Silicon Valley's standing in presidential politics has fallen many notches amid big-tech privacy intrusions, platform vulnerability to election interference and perceived corporate excess. The community that not long ago had candidates pining for its approval now finds its political reputation stuck somewhere between that of Wall Street and Big Pharma.</p><p>\"If the question is what role will Silicon Valley have in picking the next president, the answer is probably a lot less than it thinks,\" said Bradley Tusk, a venture capitalist who has worked as a political strategist for Uber and campaign manager for former New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. \"There are few tech leader endorsements you would even actively covet.\"</p><p>Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has taken the most aggressive posture toward the tech industry, recently launching a proposal to break up Amazon, Google and Facebook through aggressive use of antitrust laws and strictly regulate how firms amass personal data. But even the most tech-friendly candidates have adopted some of Warren's adversarial posture, if not her precise policy prescription.</p><p>Republicans offer the industry little relief. Erstwhile Silicon Valley boosters in the GOP have joined President Trump in threatening the firms over a perceived conspiracy to censor conservative voices.</p><p>Yet even if this crop of Democratic candidates does not want to be associated with the oligarchs and politically aloof innovators of Silicon Valley, it needs them just the same. Much like the bankers and brokers on Wall Street, the entrepreneurs of Silicon Valley have assets the candidates want -- in this case, knowledge of digital campaigning tools, policy expertise and big bank accounts that can be crucial to a White House bid.</p><p>The iPhones of wired Silicon Valley politicos are still ringing, with calls from the same campaigns that are using the valley as a political pinata.</p><p>\"Every day here in San Francisco, there is another presidential candidate coming through,\" said Chris Lehane, a longtime Democratic strategist who now heads global policy and public affairs at Airbnb. \"There are two or three here this week.\"</p><p>They are just circumspect.</p><p>No candidate this time around has sought a media moment by opening a satellite campaign office in a cubicle of a San Francisco incubator, as Republican Sen. Rand Paul did in the last presidential race. None are trying to prove their tech savvy by hailing an Uber en route to an appearance at the office of a gig-economy platform for plumbers, as Jeb Bush did in 2015.</p><p>Yet most of the top candidates this cycle have already been hosted by tech executives at fundraisers and are enlisting tech industry bundlers -- well-connected supporters who can tap their networks of friends and business associates to raise tens, even hundreds, of thousands of dollars for campaign accounts.</p><p>Operatives who have been around a few presidential cycles have seen similar episodes of industries falling out of political favor.</p><p>Former President Clinton aggressively and publicly courted Wall Street's approval. By the time Hillary Clinton ran, holding a campaign rally near the New York Stock Exchange, as her husband did, was extremely ill-advised for a Democrat.</p><p>\"Silicon Valley is feeling itself under the spotlight in a negative way for the first time\" since the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, said Maria Salamanca, a venture capitalist and Democratic activist who helped launch Swing Left, one of the most successful new fundraising platforms for progressives.</p><p>Yet at this early stage in the campaign, she said, tech leaders are not so much panicked as they are looking to sort out \"candidates who are attacking tech because it is a hot talking point versus candidates bringing the appropriate amount of attention to issues of concern to everyone.\"</p><p>Even as tech entrepreneurs say the hearings lawmakers are holding in Washington to berate companies like Facebook and Google have done little more than highlight how ill-prepared Capitol Hill is to regulate the sector, they are chastened by the problems that have been exposed. Their posture toward regulation is no longer resisting it at all cost. Many are eager to see the giant firms that have generated the most unwanted attention forced to improve their business practices.</p><p>\"I spent my life in Silicon Valley, and I will be the first to say a lot of the larger firms here have lost the trust of the American people,\" said venture capitalist Steve Westly, former California state controller and one of the tech industry's most prolific Democratic fundraisers. \"They need to do a better job protecting their customers.\"</p><p>Westly has already enlisted to raise money for former Vice President Joe Biden, who is expected to enter the race this month. Another star tech fundraiser, Amy Rao, is working to fill the campaign coffers of Sen. Kamala Harris. Silicon Valley power broker Ron Conway said in an email that he'll be backing Harris, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and \"likely others.\"</p><p>\"Many candidates running have relationships with Silicon Valley leaders and an understanding of the innovation economy, even if they don't always agree with the tech sector's perspective,\" he wrote.</p><p>Beyond stealthy fundraisers in the living rooms of tech titans, even candidates who are among the most sharply critical of tech have been quietly traipsing the tech circuit, stopping in at incubators, visiting the Stanford campus and meeting people at intimate events at Manny's, a social hub for innovators in San Francisco's Mission District.</p><p>Even Sen. Bernie Sanders, the self-described democratic socialist, eager to redistribute some of the wealth that big-tech executives amass, has signed on Silicon Valley Rep. Ro Khanna as a top advisor. Khanna argues that some of the hostility candidates are directing toward his district is misguided.</p><p>\"It displays a total lack of intellectual curiosity about the digital revolution,\" said Khanna, a progressive who has championed an \"internet bill of rights\" and antitrust rules opposed by some of the big firms in his district. Candidates should be focused on spreading the innovation economy to struggling parts of the country, rather than attacking it, he said. The companies, unlike Wall Street firms, remain extremely popular with voters, he added.</p><p>\"It's a mistake in the candidate messaging,\" Khanna said. \"They are disconnected from what people in Middle America want. Those voters want to partner with tech leaders to create economic opportunity. I have been with them in these places. Often, the tech leaders are treated like rock stars.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: FACEBOOK'S Mark Zuckerberg at a congressional hearing last year.

Whoever tries to distort the will of sovereign people is committing an act of treason. Identifying the rogues before they commit the act of treason is a national call of the highest order.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the past, the culprit was the area thug, who, in collusion with the area politician, forcibly collected polling cards of the people and sent impostors to the polling booth to vote for the politician over and again.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But today, in this digital era, election fraud is a highly sophisticated affair. Election officials and monitors worldwide are at a loss for a solution. If large scale fraud could mar the 2016 presidential election in the United States and the 2016 Brexit referendum, how safe can the developing nations' elections be? Who can forget the term 'computer jilmart' in the Sri Lankan context?</p><p>At the centre of this great robbery of the people's will are billion dollar Big Tech companies. One such company was the now disgraced Cambridge Analytica. The Britain-based company was accused of distorting the people's will during the 2016 US elections and the Brexit referendum. Its underhand role was also suspected in elections in India, Nigeria, Kenya, the Czech Republic and several other countries.</p><p>Donald Trump's victory was the biggest shock in US election history. Perhaps, he would not have breasted the tape, if not for the involvement of Cambridge Analytica, whose vice president was US media baron Steve Bannon, who later became the Trump White House Chief Strategist.</p><p>Cambridge Analytica's boss Alexander Nix once bragged that they were able to use the data in the company's possession and identify that there were large numbers of persuadable voters who could be influenced to vote for Trump. He displayed no remorse that his company was hijacking democracy while remaining in a dark alley of the digital world.</p><p>How did the company manipulate the people's will?</p><p>For the US election campaign, it is alleged that Cambridge Analytica improperly obtained data from up to 87 million Facebook profiles - including status updates, likes and even private messages. It then misused its data harvest to micro-target swing voters. Data harvesting companies are the online version of the Orwellion big brother. They secretly record whatever we do online. When we pay our utility bills online, book a movie ticket online, or visit a particular website regularly, our activity becomes data for Google, Facebook and other big players lurking behind the screen. Using psychographic analytics, the data harvesters then categorise us into various target groups.</p><p>\"Hillary Clinton is a danger to US National Security\" was one of the pop-up advertisements which Cambridge Analytica strategically used to influence unsuspecting swing voters to vote for Trump. Usually, political ad makers, in their attempt at behavioural manipulation, resort to fear mongering. During the Brexit campaign ahead of the referendum, this was the tactic Cambridge Analytica adopted to ensure the victory of its client -- the ultranationalist United Kingdom Independent Party (UKIP) which wanted Britain out of the European Union.</p><p>It goes without saying that any surveillance is a violation of our right to privacy. Besides, using unscrupulous means to influence our voting decision is a criminal violation of our political rights.</p><p>What's more? There is always the danger of foreign countries interfering in the election process of a target nation. A big power can hire the services of a company like Cambridge Analytica to get its preferred candidate elected in any target country. By hiring hackers, it is alleged that Russia successfully influenced the outcome of 2016 US presidential election.</p><p>To combat this violation of the people's sovereign right, US Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein is introducing a Voter Privacy Bill. It seeks to empower voters with new authority over how their data are collected and used by political campaigns. If approved, campaigns would be required to notify the voters that they have obtained their data through a data broker. This will allow voters to protect their data. Voters would also be able to ask platforms like Facebook and Google to stop sharing their data with these campaigns.</p><p>Given the magnitude of the problem and the meagre resources, how much can Sri Lanka's National Election Commission do in combating international interference and fake news campaigns?</p><p>We can only find solace in the fact that the NEC is a much independent institution today after the 19th amendment. Before the democracy-promotion amendment was introduced in 2015, the election commissioner was a virtual faint-hearted invertebrate. For instance, in 2010, he could not stop the state television being misused on the day of the presidential election by politicos supporting candidate Mahinda Rajapaksa to spread the fake news that opposition candidate Sarath Fonseka was not a registered voter and therefore the vote cast for him would be considered invalid. This blatant violation of election laws did change the outcome of the election. It is also said the Election Commissioner went missing for some time while votes were being counted. He later admitted that he was under tremendous 'tension'.</p><p>The same election commissioner should have also nullified the 2005 election results after it became clear that the LTTE, by use of threats, had prevented the northern voters from exercising their franchise. He should not have declared the winner because if the northern voters had been allowed to vote freely, the election result would have been different. Usually if the election could not be held in a polling area due to violence or if the polling in the area was nullified due to flagrant malpractices, the commissioner before declaring the winner will say that in his opinion even if every voter in that area had voted against the winner it would not have changed the result and announce the winner. This principle was not used with regard to the LTTE boycott. The United National Party did not challenge the election results in courts, probably knowing the futility of such an exercise at a time when courts were not seen to be independent.</p><p>With its independence restored, the NEC is seen to be determined to make the November 16 presidential election free and fair. Under the Constitution's Article 104B(5)(A), the NEC has issued guidelines to the media, including social media platforms, urging them to provide accurate, balanced and impartial information. It warned that the neutrality of the media would be monitored by special committees appointed for this purpose. But the NEC's Gazette notification did not spell out details of punitive measures against misbehaving media groups. It remains to be seen how tough the NEC could get with media groups which violate election laws.</p><p>In recent months, we saw certain media groups stooping so low to in promoting hate speech. The disdain these media groups had for the code of ethics of the Editors' Guild of Sri Lanka has rendered the self-regulatory mechanism ineffective.</p><p>Certain media groups still think they can make or break governments. If that is so, their attitude is as disgraceful as that of Cambridge Analytica. No media outlet should think it can be the kingmaker. The kingmakers are the people who exercise their democratic duty on election day.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily Mirror Sri Lanka.

He expects more use of this tool under Democratic control. </p><p> You ll see a broader array of remedies viewed as acceptable in a Democratic administration,  he said. </p><p>Trump s enforcers have favored structural fixes, but there are notable exceptions. </p><p>Behavioral conditions imposed on the nearly complete acquisition of Sprint Corp. (S) by T-Mobile USA Inc. (TMUS) helped stave off a legal challenge, and the FTC required behavioral fixes for the office supply marriage of  Staples Inc. and Essendant Inc. (ESND).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Checks and Balances</emphasis></p><p>Regardless of their trustbuster pronouncements on the stump, candidates face political realities once in office. </p><p> What we don t know is what the change in demeanor is from the campaign trail and the rhetoric to the actual governing process,  noted Kimmelman, senior adviser to Public Knowledge, a digital rights organization active on merger issues.</p><p>The judiciary, Congress, corporations, trade associations, advocacy groups and other stakeholders all hold sway. </p><p>Whichever party wins,  they ultimately have to go before the courts and prove their case,  Kimmelman emphasized. The judiciary must sign off on DOJ consent decrees and can torpedo legal challenges to mergers.</p><p>If enforcers reach beyond the limits of existing antitrust law,  they re just going to get shot down,  he warned, adding that over the past forty years, courts have made it more difficult for prosecutors to prevail.</p><p>Federal courts twice cleared AT&amp;T s purchase of Time Warner over DOJ objections and greenlighted T-Mobile-Sprint despite resistance from state attorneys general.</p><p> One judge s opinion can determine a lot,  Hubbard said.</p><p>Kimmelman also argued that congressional control is as important as taking the White House. </p><p> I don t think that Sen. Sanders or Sen. Warren can accomplish much of what they re asking for without amending the antitrust laws,  he cautioned. </p><p>Adding more presumptions in the law about anticompetitive behavior based on market concentration or business practices could make it easier for the government to win legal challenges, he said. </p><p>For such legislation to stand a chance, however, a Democratic House and Senate is almost certainly required. </p><p>Still, Hubbard suggested that a Democratic president could recalibrate some aspects of existing law even without congressional intervention. </p><p>A  more aggressive enforcement stance could help evolve the law in the right direction  by displacing legal precedent that makes it difficult to bring monopolization cases and other challenges, she explained.</p><p>Another variable is congressional oversight. It s usually more pronounced when led by the opposition, but friction can exist when it's conducted by the same party. </p><p>The main way presidents exert influence over competition policy is through the selection of nominees who share their priorities. </p><p> They could do a lot just by having the right people in charge at the FTC and the DOJ,  Hubbard said of the Democrats. </p><p> That alone, without changing any case law or passing any legislation, would make a very big difference,  she added, citing recent FTC merger clearances under razor-thin 3-2 margins. </p><p>A more aggressive DOJ antitrust division chief might be more willing to challenge the sorts of sizable horizontal transactions greenlighted by Trump s point man, Makan Delrahim, with conditions, Hubbard noted.</p><p>With Delrahim reportedly looking to exit, Trump might have the opportunity to appoint a second-term replacement. The DOJ didn t respond to a request for comment. </p><p>Of course, nominees can veer from White House priorities.  Unless you have a president who is willing to just fire people  who don t do exactly what he wants, enforcers can make independent judgments, Kimmelman said. </p><p>Compared with Biden, a Sanders administration would be more likely to push the limits of antitrust by taking bigger risks on litigation and interpretation of statutes and case law, both antitrust specialists agreed. </p><p>The Vermont senator also could be expected to work with a Democratic-controlled Congress to require leading digital platforms to be regulated as public utilities, a goal shared by Warren.</p><p>Even if Sanders follows Warren in dropping out, both could impact the party platform or apply pressure by joining a Biden administration. Warren already is being floated for vice president or a Cabinet post such as Treasury Secretary.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Populist Themes</emphasis></p><p>It would ve been tempting to expect sharp contrasts on antitrust between a second Trump term and a President Sanders, but in some respects, they're aligned.</p><p>While Sanders is more strident in his criticism, both have criticized large corporations as part of their populist messages. </p><p>The current administration could conclude its tech investigations with enforcement actions that dovetail with Democratic threats, such as unraveling mergers or suing over anticompetitive behavior. </p><p>In October, Sanders vowed that his FTC would thoroughly review all mergers since Trump became president and undo  those that have created highly concentrated markets, demonstrably caused harm to workers, raised prices, or reduced competition. </p><p>He'd also task the commission with evaluating all deals over the past 40 years to establish new guidelines that factor economic and job security into merger analysis. </p><p>In a related move, Trump's FTC  <url normalizedValue=\"https://pipeline.thedeal.com/article/20003929/index.dl|announced\">https://pipeline.thedeal.com/article/20003929/index.dl|announced</url> in February it would analyze hundreds of smaller, nonreportable acquisitions by five leading Silicon Valley titans over the past decade. Purchases deemed anticompetitive could be unwound. </p><p>As Democrats demand stepped-up enforcement of vertical mergers, it was the Trump administration that tried to block the acquisition of Time Warner by AT&amp;T Inc. (T), marking the DOJ s first litigated challenge of a complementary combination in more than four decades.</p><p>While some skeptics think the department sued to appease Trump's disdain for Time Warner s CNN, allegations the antitrust division denies, the fact remains that Republicans took this bold step. </p><p>As the Trump administration faces accusations of political interference on AT&amp;T and other transactions, Sanders and Warren may have opened themselves to accusations they prejudged which companies should be dismantled.</p><p>But Hubbard insisted that the progressives are on solid ground.</p><p> There s plenty of analysis out there,  she said, including academic research, hearings and her own writings on the dominance of tech giants.  I don t think you can really call it bias when it s based on evidence and research. </p><p>Kimmelman is a senior fellow at the Shorenstein Center s digital platforms &amp; democracy project, part of Harvard s Kennedy School, where he honed his vision of a new competition authority. </p><p>It s loosely modeled after a similar proposal developed for the U.K. government by a panel headed by Jason Furman, chief economic adviser to former President Barack Obama.</p><p>For now, Kimmelman s concept is encapsulated in a <url normalizedValue=\"https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/CSqbCK1mmimP6BGIM_8Zq?domain=shorensteincenter.org|scholarly\">https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/CSqbCK1mmimP6BGIM_8Zq?domain=shorensteincenter.org|scholarly</url> paper quietly posted to the center s website, patiently waiting for political stars to align. </p><h>DEAL SIZE</h><p>$ 50 Billion and Up</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DADEAL-20004714</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DADEAL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YHK-MT71-JBSN-1005-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244689</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1841\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Deal, L.L.C.

Vox is expected to near double its vote share to around 14 per cent according to the polls. Undecided voters could also prove pivotal. A healthy chunk of former S\u00e1nchez voters say they are now unsure who to back.</p><p>As the FT Big Read explains, it is the Catalan issue and the politics of secession that has blown apart Spain\u2019s political landscape. Vox has taken an unequivocally anti-secessionist line on Catalonia \u2014 gazumping other conservative forces like the PP and the liberal Ciudadanos who have used the crisis to rail against Mr S\u00e1nchez\u2019s leadership.</p><p>Vox\u2019s momentum is causing nervousness among the country\u2019s elites. <url normalizedValue=\"https://elpais.com/politica/2019/11/07/actualidad/1573136752_651047.html\"> An open letter signed by 500</url> academics and researchers on Thursday accuses the party of using falsified and manipulated academic studies to claim migration is linked to rising crime.</p><p>Miguel Otero-Iglesias, senior analyst at the Elcano Royal Institute, thinks Sunday\u2019s vote will again deliver a parliament that has no clear majority on either left or right.</p><p>\u201cSpain has a split political system and for now leaders struggle to come together and form coalitions,\u201d says Mr Otero-Iglesias.</p><p>Mr S\u00e1nchez has options but most are laden with risk and potentially unstable.

The growing use of social media platforms and services managed by big tech companies also poses a risk to democracy given these spaces are widely unregulated, according to a report published by the Electoral Reform Society (ERS). The 60-page report, titled 'Reining in the Political Wild West: Campaigning Rules for the 21st Century[1]', was published yesterday to coincide with the Facebook's 15th anniversary. In it, a range of voices have argued the firm and its rivals like Google and Twitter must be more transparent on how campaign groups use their platforms, and how personal data is used to spread information. \"With talk of a fresh general election or referendum heating up, the need to bring Britain's outdated election laws into the 21st century is urgent,\" said the ERS' director of research and policy Dr Jess Garland. </p><p>\"Make no mistake: our democracy is under threat from dark ads, dodgy donations and disinformation, but with the right rules online campaigning can be a real force for good. The government should listen to these vital proposals and take action before it's too late.\" She warned that Facebook, among other social media giants, has changed how campaigning works, yet online political campaigning \"remains an unregulated Wild West\". The next election, moreover, sees a real risk of \"foreign interference and dodgy dealings\" without urgent action.The 'one missing piece' in legislationPolitical parties spent around 1.3 million on Facebook during the 2015 general election, a figure that almost doubled during the 2017 campaign to 3.2 million, with data-driven campaigning spawning an entire industry.The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO)[2] suggests the one missing piece in legislation, now that the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)[3] has come into force, is a statutory code of practice. \"We're waiting for a response from government to that recommendation, but we feel as though this should be a statutory code in the same way as we have a code of practice on data protection in the media,\" said the ICO's deputy commissioner for policy Steve Wood. \"We also feel that this will set out a level playing field for all of the different actors who are using data for political purposes, about what they can do with data. \"It shouldn't create a chilling effect: it should enable parties to understand how they can use digital campaigning techniques, because we're not as a regulator saying, 'you can't use digital campaigning tools', but it's about how you use them safely and transparently in accordance with the law.\" The report also set out a series of recommendations for policymakers and social media companies which should, in theory, reduce the risk of any interference in political campaigning as well as the prevalence of disinformation. One effective short-term measure, according to the report, would involve extending the requirement for online advertising to be 'imprinted'; where all materials must show who produced and funded them. Creating a universal and publicly-available online database of political adverts, which would also be searchable, could also raise transparency and allow voters to identify the origins of a post or message.Advertising to an audience of oneAmong meatier recommendations include additional enforcement powers for organisations like the Electoral Commission, to match the ICO's considerably-increased powers since GDPR came into force. The ERS also echoed the ICO in suggesting political parties must work with the government to establish a legally-binding code of practice, while policymakers must urgently reform electoral law to future-proof political regulations for a digital landscape. Emerging threats to democracy may include incorporating technologies like deep learning[4] into micro-targeting, according to Demos' senior researcher with the centre for analysis of social media (CASM) Josh Smith. \"As voter profiles become increasingly detailed, use of this technology by campaigns could lead to their targeting people based on characteristics, such as health, race or sexual preference, which campaign organisers may not be aware they are using,\" he said. \"This could be true even where protected characteristics are not stored, as machine learning makes it possible to infer detailed demographic information based on seemingly innocuous data.\" \"Political groups may soon be able to incorporate data gleaned from 'wearables' the Internet of Things (IoT)[5] into their messaging, or to algorithmically generate entirely new slogans and designs.\" \"The direction of travel is towards campaigns being able to address each voter individually, based on their specific profile; advertising to an audience of one. This individual targeting risks breaking down public political discourse - having a conversation about what a party stands for in the run-up to a campaign is difficult if your neighbours and family have seen completely different messages.\" The report has been published in light of three major public investigations into the relationship between tech giants and political campaign groups, with activity during the 2016 EU Referendum, particularly under the spotlight. Both the Electoral Commission and ICO have reprimanded the pro-Brexit group Leave.EU[6]for overspending, and the misuse of data[7] respectively, in tandem with probing social media companies like Facebook and Google. Meanwhile, Parliament's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DMCS) select committee has led an ongoing investigation into the phenomenon of disinformation and fake news, which itself has recommended that government introduce tighter regulations for tech companies[8].

The government should listen to these vital proposals and take action before it's too late.\"</p><p>She warned that Facebook, among other social media giants, has changed how campaigning works, yet online political campaigning \"remains an unregulated Wild West\".</p><p>The next election, moreover, sees a real risk of \"foreign interference and dodgy dealings\" without urgent action.</p><h>The 'one missing piece' in legislation</h><p>Political parties spent around \u00a31.3 million on Facebook during the 2015 general election, a figure that almost doubled during the 2017 campaign to \u00a33.2 million, with data-driven campaigning spawning an entire industry.</p><p>      See related\u00a0</p><p>The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.itpro.co.uk/information-commissioner/31751/what-is-the-information-commissioner-s-office-ico\">Information Commissioner's Office (ICO)</url> suggests the one missing piece in legislation, now that the EU's       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.itpro.co.uk/it-legislation/27814/what-is-gdpr-everything-you-need-to-know\">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</url> has come into force, is a statutory code of practice.</p><p>\"We're waiting for a response from government to that recommendation, but we feel as though this should be a statutory code in the same way as we have a code of practice on data protection in the media,\" said the ICO's deputy commissioner for policy Steve Wood.</p><p>\"We also feel that this will set out a level playing field for all of the different actors who are using data for political purposes, about what they can do with data.</p><p>\"It shouldn't create a chilling effect: it should enable parties to understand how they can use digital campaigning techniques, because we're not as a regulator saying, 'you can't use digital campaigning tools', but it's about how you use them safely and transparently in accordance with the law.\"</p><p>The report also set out a series of recommendations for policymakers and social media companies which should, in theory, reduce the risk of any interference in political campaigning as well as the prevalence of disinformation.</p><p>One effective short-term measure, according to the report, would involve extending the requirement for online advertising to be 'imprinted'; where all materials must show who produced and funded them.</p><p>Creating a universal and publicly-available online database of political adverts, which would also be searchable, could also raise transparency and allow voters to identify the origins of a post or message.</p><h>Advertising to an audience of one</h><p>Among meatier recommendations include additional enforcement powers for organisations like the Electoral Commission, to match the ICO's considerably-increased powers since GDPR came into force.</p><p>The ERS also echoed the ICO in suggesting political parties must work with the government to establish a legally-binding code of practice, while policymakers must urgently reform electoral law to future-proof political regulations for a digital landscape.</p><p>Emerging threats to democracy may include incorporating <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.itpro.co.uk/neural-network/30250/what-is-deep-learning\">technologies like deep learning</url> into micro-targeting, according to Demos' senior researcher with the centre for analysis of social media (CASM) Josh Smith.</p><p>\"As voter profiles become increasingly detailed, use of this technology by campaigns could lead to their targeting people based on characteristics, such as health, race or sexual preference, which campaign organisers may not be aware they are using,\" he said.</p><p>\"This could be true even where protected characteristics are not stored, as machine learning makes it possible to infer detailed demographic information based on seemingly innocuous data.\"</p><p>\"Political groups may soon be able to incorporate data gleaned from 'wearables' the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.itpro.co.uk/cloud-computing/28037/what-is-iot\">Internet of Things (IoT)</url> into their messaging, or to algorithmically generate entirely new slogans and designs.\"</p><p>\"The direction of travel is towards campaigns being able to address each voter individually, based on their specific profile; advertising to an audience of one. This individual targeting risks breaking down public political discourse - having a conversation about what a party stands for in the run-up to a campaign is difficult if your neighbours and family have seen</p><p>completely different messages.\"</p><p>The report has been published in light of three major public investigations into the relationship between tech giants and political campaign groups, with activity during the 2016 EU Referendum, particularly under the spotlight.</p><p>Both the Electoral Commission and ICO have <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.itpro.co.uk/policy-legislation/31594/tech-giants-like-facebook-should-be-made-liable-for-fake-news-dcms\">reprimanded the pro-Brexit group Leave.EU</url>\u00a0for overspending, and the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.itpro.co.uk/data-insights/32900/ico-fines-leaveeu-and-arron-banks-insurance-120000-over-marketing-law-breaches\">misuse of data</url> respectively, in tandem with probing social media companies like Facebook and Google.</p><p>Meanwhile, Parliament's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DMCS) select committee has led an ongoing investigation into the phenomenon of disinformation and fake news, which itself has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.itpro.co.uk/policy-legislation/31594/tech-giants-like-facebook-should-be-made-liable-for-fake-news-dcms\">recommended that government introduce tighter regulations for tech companies</url>. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DPITPR-32913athttpswwwitprocouk</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DPITPR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VBY-YJD1-DXHJ-F3WN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464401</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"975\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Dennis Publishing Ltd.

In early June, two of JSAT's factories in the city of Rugao, Jiangsu Province, were seized by the local intermediate court, its bank account was locked and virtually all its employees resigned, placing the city's once burgeoning EV industry in limbo.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JSAT spent nearly 6 billion yuan (US$86m) on factories, employees, marketing and manufacturing, but only 31 low-end electric cars were ever sold. In the opinion of Wang Xiaolin, chairman of JSAT, the money was far from enough to make a car. \"Among all EV manufacturers in China, JSAT is the most cost-effective. We have rich experience in financial control. An electric vehicle will never be produced without an investment of 10 billion yuan (US$1.4b),\" he told China Report in the US.</p><p>According to Qiao Yudong, former senior legal manager at JSAT, Rugao had a public budget of 7 billion yuan (US$100m) in 2019, most of which was sunk into JSAT's EV project. On April 27, Qiao reported Wang Xiaolin as being \"a false technology investor who has embezzled a huge amount of State assets.\"</p><p>Chen Jianjun, deputy director of Rugao government's publicity department, told China Report that the failure of the JSAT project has become a salutary lesson for other cities in Jiangsu and government agencies. \"We should be more careful when we launch EV projects in the future and more stringent examination is needed to check the qualifications of enterprises.\"</p><p>China started boosting new energy vehicle (NEV) strategies in 2009, when it began offering support measures, which included nationwide subsidies. Government data shows that from 2015 to 2017, more than 200 NEV projects were launched in the Chinese mainland with a total investment of 1 trillion yuan (US$143b) and accumulated manufacturing capacity of over 21.24 million vehicles.</p><p>In 2019, Chinese automobile sales started to decline across the board, and government subsidies have decreased also. There are now 40 new energy vehicle manufacturers in China. Yet local governments are still enthusiastic over the prospect of investing in the NEV industry.</p><p>\"The automobile industry is so attractive to local governments because it can drive the development of an entire industrial chain,\" said Li Jinyong, deputy director of China Auto Dealers Chamber of Commerce. \"It's the biggest source of tax revenue.\"</p><p>Car-building Mania        Rugao has a population of 14.2 million people and it has become well-known in Jiangsu Province as a new energy vehicle city. In the wake of the 2008 economic crisis, the city's industrial base, which included international shipping, photovoltaic production and biological medicine, was floundering. Rugao cast its eyes at the developing NEV industry and released a package of measures to lure investment. Chen Xiaodong, Party chief of the city, said publicly that NEV manufacturing was a strategic decision.</p><p>Established in 2009, Rugao New Energy Auto Industrial Park occupies an area of 20 square kilometres with a dozen NEV manufacturers, including JSAT and GreenWheel EV. There are also more than 30 enterprises involved in the supply chain, including lithium battery makers, tires and auto parts.</p><p>The industrial park aimed to produce 800,000 vehicles with an output value of 100 billion yuan (US$14.35b) by the end of 2020, becoming China's most competitive NEV industrial base for auto manufacturing, trade, finance, culture and service in the Yangtze River Economic Belt.</p><p>In 2010, Rugao introduced its first new energy vehicle enterprise \" GreenWheel EV, with a planned investment of 4 billion yuan (US$574m) and an annual production capacity of 200,000 EVs. The company back then did not have a manufacturing licence for EVs, and it was only after intervention from the Rugao government that the firm obtained permission to produce mid-size and large electric buses.</p><p>In 2012, the provincial economic and information commission designated Rugao as the only NEV industrial base in Jiangsu Province. But the high cost of attracting auto manufacturing enterprises also generated high risks for the local government. Auto enterprises based in the industrial park have fallen one by one because of financial shortfalls, technical difficulties or poor sales.</p><p>In early 2020, GreenWheel EV halted production. According to a report released by Pingan Bank in June 2020, GreenWheel EV owed the bank 112 million yuan (US$16m) and interest payments of 1.25 million yuan (US$180,000). The bank has transferred 24 percent of the company's equity and 280,000 square metres of industrial land to other companies.</p><p>Wang Xiaoxiang, adviser to the NEV industry in Rugao, said that local governments see the automobile industry as a lucrative sector that can drive employment. \"Local governments want big projects. As long as one major project is inked and goes into production, GDP in the area will rise to a new level,\" he told China Report.</p><p>Cui Dongshu, secretary-general of the China Passenger Car Association, told China Report that the fundamental goal of any local government is to drive economic development and NEV projects have become the perfect engines. From 2015 to 2017, more than 20 NEV projects were inked in Zhejiang Province alone.</p><p>\"An economic output of 20 billion yuan (US$2.9b) will be created if 100,000 vehicles with a single price of 200,000-yuan (US$28,700) could be sold,\" he said.</p><p>Land use rights are the ace in the hole for local governments to obtain investments from auto manufacturers. Rugao provided JSAT with 1.6 square kilometres of land. GreenWheel EV also obtained 0.8 square kilometres of land from the local government.</p><p>\"Many EV manufacturers acquired land at a very low price, so even if they fail to make a single vehicle, they can still get a lot of profit from selling on the land,\" Cui said.</p><p>Struggle to Survive Starting in 2020, an increasing number of EV manufacturers in China have declared or are on the verge of bankruptcy, including Bordrin, Byton and Qiantu, all based in Jiangsu, and SD EV based in Henan Province. Many NEV companies had starry launches with funds from big tech and management connected to prominent names in auto manufacturing, including foreign firms like BMW, or in the case of JSAT, Steve Saleen, a former racing driver and designer.</p><p>Li Jinyong, deputy director of the China Auto Dealers Chamber of Commerce, told our reporter that an industrial reshuffle in the sector is unavoidable. Generally speaking, NEV enterprises have a relatively small and weak industrial chain, but traditional auto enterprises have advantages in economies of scale which are based on an output of over 10 million vehicles.</p><p>\"The production costs of NEV enterprises are still too high,\" Li said. \"It would be nice if three or five NEV enterprises could survive.\"</p><p>Nowadays, NEV enterprises are no longer highly sought after in the capital market especially after a continued reduction in government subsidies. Zhang Wei, chairman of Co-Stone Capital, argued that no NEV enterprise in China is worthy of investment.</p><p>Whether NEV enterprises can survive or not largely depends on support from local governments, who have become the largest source of finance for the NEV sector. Auto industry analyst Zhong Shi told our reporter that NEV enterprises deliberately bind themselves with State assets and shoulder risks with local governments. If there is a problem, he said, it is very difficult for State assets to retreat.</p><p>In June, Nanjing Byton Electric Vehicle Corporation said it was experiencing a crisis which reportedly meant a four-month delay to salaries. In April, its office in Shanghai was closed and in June its office in Beijing shut. Its factory in Nanjing, capital of Jiangsu, closed because of arrears in utilities.</p><p>\"We have invested billions of yuan into the Byton project. If it's declared bankrupt, it will be a great burden to repay the debt,\" an employee at the management committee of Nanjing Economic and Technology Development Zone said, on condition of anonymity.</p><p>Local governments mainly invest in land and factory buildings, so if a business fails, these means of production can be reused. Cui Dongshu said that it is the bank that suffers most. \"The investment comes from banks, and there is a high likelihood it will become a bad asset,\" he said.</p><p>Several auto industry insiders told our reporter that it is difficult for local governments to appraise the technological credentials of NEV enterprises. To make matters worse, local governments lack awareness of risk control and most of the time studying the feasibility of a joint-venture project is a formality.</p><p>Jiangxi Province was criticised by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) due to excessive investment in the NEV industry. From 2015 to 2017, Jiangxi introduced 18 NEV projects but some never even started production. Eleven did start, but seven are behind schedule.</p><p>Xia Yingjie, chairman of Jiangxi Jiangling Motors Overseas Sales Company and a member of Jiangxi Political Consultative Conference, warned that most NEV enterprises in the province have weak financial backing and R&amp;D. It is high time to raise the entry threshold for NEV enterprises, Xia said, and their design capability, manufacturing quality and marketing capacity must be subject to strict oversight in order to avoid overcapacity in low-end products.</p><p>On January 10, 2019, the NDRC issued an investment regulation on the NEV industry which states that before a new project is launched, local governments should eliminate all zombie enterprises in the sector, and existing enterprises should accomplish the scheduled output. In addition, NEV enterprises should have core technologies in design, manufacturing and battery production. The NDRC also delegated the power of examination and approval of NEV projects to the provincial government.</p><p>Jia Xinguang, chief analyst at China Automobile Industry Consulting, argued that the delegation of power has pushed provincial governments to balance NEV development in accordance with the specific circumstances of different cities and their strengths.</p><p>\"In previous years, local governments' attitude towards NEV projects was the more, the better. Nowadays, provincial governments tend to support one or two key projects,\" he said. \"If a project fails, the NDRC is quite likely to end all NEV projects in the province.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHNREP-202009029</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHNREP2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6103-2Y71-JB13-7010-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">463108</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1767\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Foremost 4 Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>China Report Magazine</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"2283\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>88th Edition</edition><publicationDate month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

On today's show, CNBC's Phil LeBeau breaks down the just-announced partnership between Nikola and General Motors. Plus, CNBC's Meg Tirrell explains why nine leading pharmaceutical CEOs made a pledge to prioritize safety during Covid-19 vaccine development.   Tesla shares crater more than 20% after S&amp;P 500 snub   Tesla shares tumbled Tuesday, after Elon Musk's electric vehicle maker was left out of the S&amp;P 500 by the committee that decides on new additions to the index.   Tesla shares were down more than 20% in afternoon trading. The stock has been on a tear this year, having risen around 400%, and the company is now worth more than some of the world's largest automakers, including Toyota and Volkswagen.   On Friday, the S&amp;P 500 Index Committee decided to add e-commerce site Etsy, automatic test equipment maker Teradyne and pharmaceutical firm Catalent to the S&amp;P 500, but stopped short of including Tesla. Some investors had expected Tesla to be included this quarter, after it reported its fourth consecutive quarter of profitability in July.   Nikola shares pop as much as 53% after General Motors takes 11% stake in electric truck maker   Shares of Nikola surged Tuesday after General Motors announced it's taking an 11% stake in the electric truck maker and will produce its marquee hydrogen fuel cell electric pickup truck the Badger by the end of 2022.   Shortly before the opening bell, Nikola shares were up 30% and GM's were 6% higher. Nikola shares had popped by as much as 53% while GM's jumped as much as 9.1% in the premarket trading.   GM is getting a $2 billion stake in Nikola and the right to nominate one board member in exchange for in-kind services. Phoenix-based Nikola specializes in building zero-emission semi trucks using battery or hydrogen fuel cell technology, but it recently introduced its Badger pickup truck for consumers. This will also make GM the exclusive supplier of Nikola's fuel cells globally, except Europe, for its class 7/8 trucks.   U.S., European drugmakers pledge to make safety the main focus in coronavirus vaccine development   Nine leading U.S. and European vaccine developers pledged on Tuesday to uphold the scientific standards that their experimental immunizations will be held against, amid a hurried global race to contain the pandemic.   The companies, including Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca, in a joint statement made a \"historic pledge... to uphold the integrity of the scientific process as they work towards potential global regulatory filings and approvals of the first Covid-19 vaccines.\"   The unusual move to promise to play by well-established rules underlines a highly politicized debate over what action is needed to quickly rein in the spread of the deadly disease and to jumpstart global business and trade.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

They are private companies worth $1  billion or more, based on fundraising. And they include companies such as  Uber, Airbnb and Fitbit. Well there are 25 unicorns this year, bringing the  total to more than 100. Uber is perhaps the most well know, with an  estimated $50 billion valuation. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So are all unicorns created equal? Roger McNamee is a successful veteran  technology investor, and Co-Founder of Elevation Partners. And he joins me  now to share his insights. Roger, thank you so much for being here. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ROGER MCNAMEE, CO-FOUNDER, ELEVATION PARTNERS: Pimm, it's a great pleasure. </p><p>PIMM: Let's start off just talking about this idea of these billion-dollar  or more private companies, but that's based on fundraising. That's not  maybe real money, in some people's eyes. Tell me.</p><p>MCNAMEE: Well it's real money -- </p><p>PIMM: Yes? </p><p>MCNAMEE: -- because they are -- people are writing checks -- </p><p>PIMM: Okay. </p><p>MCNAMEE: -- based on getting whatever percentage of the company you get at  those valuations. So clearly there is something going on here that we have  never seen before. There have been private companies with billion-dollar  valuations, Facebook was there. LinkedIn was there. Twitter was there. But  now there are more than 100. And that is clearly without precedent. </p><p>And here's the good news. When -- at some level it is a speculative mania  by venture capitalists, but the other side of the coin is every great  industry in America was built on the back of a speculative mania, starting  with the railroads in the 1830s and 1840s. And so to me the great thing  about American culture it when we decide we like something, we just we  throw out all the rules. We pretend like it really is different this time.  And we put all this money into it. </p><p>And the good news is after the market corrects, or crashes or whatever  comes later, you have this great new industry. And I do think that what's  going on now is, from an American economic point of view, a really exciting  thing. Now, personally, I look at it as an investor and I go, now hang on  just a sec, this doesn't feel like the sort of thing that's going to go on  without interruption. I think we are going to see a correction here. And  when it comes it could be really brutal. </p><p>FOX: When someone comes to Roger McNamee and says, you know what? There is  this company and we would love you to participate, -- </p><p>MCNAMEE: Yes. </p><p>FOX: -- what are some of the things in the checklist that would make you  say, yes, $1 billion, that makes sense?</p><p>MCNAMEE: Well the way I look at this is there are some that are easy. I  look at Uber and I think to myself that notwithstanding the, shall we say,  unusual personality of the CEO, the service is universally loved, and it  has plowed through regulatory barriers and political barriers very, very  easily. And I don't know what -- I don't know how to value Uber. $50  billion seems like a big number, but who knows? It could -- I can imagine a  scenario where it's worth that much. </p><p>Within that list of 100, there are bound to be a few which we look back on  and go, wow, where was the sock puppet, right? And some of these are not  going to work out well. And but the way I look at it is I think on balance  we're better off seeing investors get too excited, because at least we wind  up with a new industry. </p><p>And so when they're coming to me now, I'm looking at them all and going,  you know, I think I'm going to wait. And it's not because I don't think  they're great companies. It's because my 33 years as an investor in  technology tells me there will be a day when the good ones will be  available in the public market at a lower valuation. It's just markets go  up and they go down. And I don't know whether that's a year from now, two  years from now or five years from now, but the opportunity will come along.  Things don't grow to the sky usually. </p><p>FOX: Let me -- let me give you a name. All right let's talk Fitbit. </p><p>MCNAMEE: Well there you go. So Fitbit is a company that, if I understand  the forecast properly, is going to do over $1 billion in revenue this year.  And it has carved a position beneath Apple in the wellness market. And the  problem with the product is that the data it gives you is not accurate. The  good news of the product is the social experience is marvelous. </p><p>And people really do use it and they really do love it. Now how do you  value a situation like that, because they're always going to have to be  cheaper than Apple. And they're going to have to watch out for Apple coming  down and essentially grabbing their price point. I'm personally a  shareholder victim. I'd -- I'd like to see what they can do with it. </p><p>How is it going to turn out? I haven't a clue. And am I going to get a  chance to own it cheaper? Well once it's public the answer is inevitably,  because things are going to go up and down, but they may go up before they  go down, and that would be better for me, but I don't know that that's  what's going to happen. </p><p>FOX: Is there a unicorn out there that you don't want to play leapfrog  with? </p><p>MCNAMEE: Well the funny thing is I don't see it today, but I'm sure the  answer is yes. What's exciting now is that the technology of smartphones  for the last six or seven years was about making phones themselves. Now  it's about applying that technology to changing other sectors of the  economy, and creating use cases where people get benefit or enjoyment from  things they never had before. </p><p>Think about Uber, I mean what a transformation of transportation. And that  wave is going to last 10, 15 years fundamentally. So some of these things  are going to emerge and wind up not only in the S&amp;P 500, but if they do a  great job, maybe in the Dow that you really do get a few things that do  break through. The chances that we're going to have 100 of them that all do  that in lockstep I think round to zero. </p><p>FOX: AOL and Verizon, what do you think of the deal?</p><p>MCNAMEE: So I look at it, and I go if I'm Tim Armstrong this is a great  outcome. I mean AOL, their best case from here was just to keep hammering  away. From Verizon's point of view, there is an opportunity for them to get  some technology mojo that they haven't had. I find it highly unlikely that  they will get that, simply because they have been so successful in their  core markets that culturally the notion that they're going to adopt  \"Huffington Post\" style, TechCrunch-style culture at Verizon, I wouldn't  count on it. Most big tech deals don't work out for the buyer, but it's a  great day for the AOL shareholder and for the team there.</p><p>FOX: I want to thank you very much, Roger McNamee of Elevation Partners,  much appreciated. </p><p>1140</p><p>[*] ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

They are private companies worth $1  billion or more, based on fundraising. And they include companies such as  Uber, Airbnb and Fitbit. Well there are 25 unicorns this year, bringing the  total to more than 100. Uber is perhaps the most well know, with an  estimated $50 billion valuation. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> So are all unicorns created equal? Roger McNamee is a successful veteran  technology investor, and Co-Founder of Elevation Partners. And he joins me  now to share his insights. Roger, thank you so much for being here. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> ROGER MCNAMEE, CO-FOUNDER, ELEVATION PARTNERS: Pimm, it's a great pleasure. </p><p> PIMM: Let's start off just talking about this idea of these billion-dollar  or more private companies, but that's based on fundraising. That's not  maybe real money, in some people's eyes. Tell me.</p><p> MCNAMEE: Well it's real money -- </p><p> PIMM: Yes? </p><p> MCNAMEE: -- because they are -- people are writing checks -- </p><p> PIMM: Okay. </p><p> MCNAMEE: -- based on getting whatever percentage of the company you get at  those valuations.

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ROGER MCNAMEE, CO-FOUNDER, ELEVATION PARTNERS, IS INTERVIEWED ON BLOOMBERG TELEVISION</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MAY 14, 2015</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SPEAKERS: ROGER MCNAMEE, CO-FOUNDER, ELEVATION PARTNERS</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">PIMM FOX, BLOOMBERG NEWS</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[*] PIMM FOX, BLOOMBERG NEWS: Now they're called unicorns because once they were rare, well now not so much. They are private companies worth $1 billion or more, based on fundraising. And they include companies such as Uber, Airbnb and Fitbit. Well there are 25 unicorns this year, bringing the total to more than 100. Uber is perhaps the most well know, with an estimated $50 billion valuation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So are all unicorns created equal? Roger McNamee is a successful veteran technology investor, and Co-Founder of Elevation Partners. And he joins me now to share his insights. Roger, thank you so much for being here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ROGER MCNAMEE, CO-FOUNDER, ELEVATION PARTNERS: Pimm, it's a great pleasure.</p><p>PIMM: Let's start off just talking about this idea of these billion-dollar or more private companies, but that's based on fundraising. That's not maybe real money, in some people's eyes. Tell me.</p><p>MCNAMEE: Well it's real money --</p><p>PIMM: Yes?</p><p>MCNAMEE: -- because they are -- people are writing checks --</p><p>PIMM: Okay.</p><p>MCNAMEE: -- based on getting whatever percentage of the company you get at those valuations. So clearly there is something going on here that we have never seen before. There have been private companies with billion-dollar valuations, Facebook was there. LinkedIn was there. Twitter was there. But now there are more than 100. And that is clearly without precedent.</p><p>And here's the good news. When -- at some level it is a speculative mania by venture capitalists, but the other side of the coin is every great industry in America was built on the back of a speculative mania, starting with the railroads in the 1830s and 1840s. And so to me the great thing about American culture it when we decide we like something, we just we throw out all the rules. We pretend like it really is different this time. And we put all this money into it.</p><p>And the good news is after the market corrects, or crashes or whatever comes later, you have this great new industry. And I do think that what's going on now is, from an American economic point of view, a really exciting thing. Now, personally, I look at it as an investor and I go, now hang on just a sec, this doesn't feel like the sort of thing that's going to go on without interruption. I think we are going to see a correction here. And when it comes it could be really brutal.</p><p>FOX: When someone comes to Roger McNamee and says, you know what? There is this company and we would love you to participate, --</p><p>MCNAMEE: Yes.</p><p>FOX: -- what are some of the things in the checklist that would make you say, yes, $1 billion, that makes sense?</p><p>MCNAMEE: Well the way I look at this is there are some that are easy. I look at Uber and I think to myself that notwithstanding the, shall we say, unusual personality of the CEO, the service is universally loved, and it has plowed through regulatory barriers and political barriers very, very easily. And I don't know what -- I don't know how to value Uber. $50 billion seems like a big number, but who knows? It could -- I can imagine a scenario where it's worth that much.</p><p>Within that list of 100, there are bound to be a few which we look back on and go, wow, where was the sock puppet, right? And some of these are not going to work out well. And but the way I look at it is I think on balance we're better off seeing investors get too excited, because at least we wind up with a new industry.</p><p>And so when they're coming to me now, I'm looking at them all and going, you know, I think I'm going to wait. And it's not because I don't think they're great companies. It's because my 33 years as an investor in technology tells me there will be a day when the good ones will be available in the public market at a lower valuation. It's just markets go up and they go down. And I don't know whether that's a year from now, two years from now or five years from now, but the opportunity will come along. Things don't grow to the sky usually.</p><p>FOX: Let me -- let me give you a name. All right let's talk Fitbit.</p><p>MCNAMEE: Well there you go. So Fitbit is a company that, if I understand the forecast properly, is going to do over $1 billion in revenue this year. And it has carved a position beneath Apple in the wellness market. And the problem with the product is that the data it gives you is not accurate. The good news of the product is the social experience is marvelous.</p><p>And people really do use it and they really do love it. Now how do you value a situation like that, because they're always going to have to be cheaper than Apple. And they're going to have to watch out for Apple coming down and essentially grabbing their price point. I'm personally a shareholder victim. I'd -- I'd like to see what they can do with it.</p><p>How is it going to turn out? I haven't a clue. And am I going to get a chance to own it cheaper? Well once it's public the answer is inevitably, because things are going to go up and down, but they may go up before they go down, and that would be better for me, but I don't know that that's what's going to happen.</p><p>FOX: Is there a unicorn out there that you don't want to play leapfrog with?</p><p>MCNAMEE: Well the funny thing is I don't see it today, but I'm sure the answer is yes. What's exciting now is that the technology of smartphones for the last six or seven years was about making phones themselves. Now it's about applying that technology to changing other sectors of the economy, and creating use cases where people get benefit or enjoyment from things they never had before.</p><p>Think about Uber, I mean what a transformation of transportation. And that wave is going to last 10, 15 years fundamentally. So some of these things are going to emerge and wind up not only in the S&amp;P 500, but if they do a great job, maybe in the Dow that you really do get a few things that do break through. The chances that we're going to have 100 of them that all do that in lockstep I think round to zero.</p><p>FOX: AOL and Verizon, what do you think of the deal?</p><p>MCNAMEE: So I look at it, and I go if I'm Tim Armstrong this is a great outcome. I mean AOL, their best case from here was just to keep hammering away. From Verizon's point of view, there is an opportunity for them to get some technology mojo that they haven't had. I find it highly unlikely that they will get that, simply because they have been so successful in their core markets that culturally the notion that they're going to adopt \"Huffington Post\" style, TechCrunch-style culture at Verizon, I wouldn't count on it. Most big tech deals don't work out for the buyer, but it's a great day for the AOL shareholder and for the team there.</p><p>FOX: I want to thank you very much, Roger McNamee of Elevation Partners, much appreciated.</p><p>1140</p><p>[*] ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

And but the way I look at it is I think on balance  we're better off seeing investors get too excited, because at least we wind  up with a new industry. </p><p> And so when they're coming to me now, I'm looking at them all and going,  you know, I think I'm going to wait. And it's not because I don't think  they're great companies. It's because my 33 years as an investor in  technology tells me there will be a day when the good ones will be  available in the public market at a lower valuation. It's just markets go  up and they go down. And I don't know whether that's a year from now, two  years from now or five years from now, but the opportunity will come along.  Things don't grow to the sky usually. </p><p> FOX: Let me -- let me give you a name. All right let's talk Fitbit. </p><p> MCNAMEE: Well there you go. So Fitbit is a company that, if I understand  the forecast properly, is going to do over $1 billion in revenue this year.  And it has carved a position beneath Apple in the wellness market. And the  problem with the product is that the data it gives you is not accurate. The  good news of the product is the social experience is marvelous. </p><p> And people really do use it and they really do love it. Now how do you  value a situation like that, because they're always going to have to be  cheaper than Apple. And they're going to have to watch out for Apple coming  down and essentially grabbing their price point. I'm personally a  shareholder victim. I'd -- I'd like to see what they can do with it. </p><p> How is it going to turn out? I haven't a clue. And am I going to get a  chance to own it cheaper? Well once it's public the answer is inevitably,  because things are going to go up and down, but they may go up before they  go down, and that would be better for me, but I don't know that that's  what's going to happen. </p><p> FOX: Is there a unicorn out there that you don't want to play leapfrog  with? </p><p> MCNAMEE: Well the funny thing is I don't see it today, but I'm sure the  answer is yes. What's exciting now is that the technology of smartphones  for the last six or seven years was about making phones themselves. Now  it's about applying that technology to changing other sectors of the  economy, and creating use cases where people get benefit or enjoyment from  things they never had before. </p><p> Think about Uber, I mean what a transformation of transportation. And that  wave is going to last 10, 15 years fundamentally. So some of these things  are going to emerge and wind up not only in the S&amp;P 500, but if they do a  great job, maybe in the Dow that you really do get a few things that do  break through. The chances that we're going to have 100 of them that all do  that in lockstep I think round to zero. </p><p> FOX: AOL and Verizon, what do you think of the deal?</p><p> MCNAMEE: So I look at it, and I go if I'm Tim Armstrong this is a great  outcome. I mean AOL, their best case from here was just to keep hammering  away. From Verizon's point of view, there is an opportunity for them to get  some technology mojo that they haven't had. I find it highly unlikely that  they will get that, simply because they have been so successful in their  core markets that culturally the notion that they're going to adopt  \"Huffington Post\" style, TechCrunch-style culture at Verizon, I wouldn't  count on it. Most big tech deals don't work out for the buyer, but it's a  great day for the AOL shareholder and for the team there.</p><p> FOX: I want to thank you very much, Roger McNamee of Elevation Partners,  much appreciated. </p><p> 1140</p><p>  [*] ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p> THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ROGER MCNAMEE, CO-FOUNDER, ELEVATION PARTNERS, IS INTERVIEWED ON BLOOMBERG TELEVISION</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MAY 14, 2015</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SPEAKERS: ROGER MCNAMEE, CO-FOUNDER, ELEVATION PARTNERS</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">PIMM FOX, BLOOMBERG NEWS</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[*] PIMM FOX, BLOOMBERG NEWS: Now they're called unicorns because once they were rare, well now not so much. They are private companies worth $1 billion or more, based on fundraising. And they include companies such as Uber, Airbnb and Fitbit. Well there are 25 unicorns this year, bringing the total to more than 100. Uber is perhaps the most well know, with an estimated $50 billion valuation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So are all unicorns created equal? Roger McNamee is a successful veteran technology investor, and Co-Founder of Elevation Partners. And he joins me now to share his insights. Roger, thank you so much for being here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ROGER MCNAMEE, CO-FOUNDER, ELEVATION PARTNERS: Pimm, it's a great pleasure.</p><p>PIMM: Let's start off just talking about this idea of these billion-dollar or more private companies, but that's based on fundraising. That's not maybe real money, in some people's eyes. Tell me.</p><p>MCNAMEE: Well it's real money --</p><p>PIMM: Yes?</p><p>MCNAMEE: -- because they are -- people are writing checks --</p><p>PIMM: Okay.</p><p>MCNAMEE: -- based on getting whatever percentage of the company you get at those valuations. So clearly there is something going on here that we have never seen before. There have been private companies with billion-dollar valuations, Facebook was there. LinkedIn was there. Twitter was there. But now there are more than 100. And that is clearly without precedent.</p><p>And here's the good news. When -- at some level it is a speculative mania by venture capitalists, but the other side of the coin is every great industry in America was built on the back of a speculative mania, starting with the railroads in the 1830s and 1840s. And so to me the great thing about American culture it when we decide we like something, we just we throw out all the rules. We pretend like it really is different this time. And we put all this money into it.</p><p>And the good news is after the market corrects, or crashes or whatever comes later, you have this great new industry. And I do think that what's going on now is, from an American economic point of view, a really exciting thing. Now, personally, I look at it as an investor and I go, now hang on just a sec, this doesn't feel like the sort of thing that's going to go on without interruption. I think we are going to see a correction here. And when it comes it could be really brutal.</p><p>FOX: When someone comes to Roger McNamee and says, you know what? There is this company and we would love you to participate, --</p><p>MCNAMEE: Yes.</p><p>FOX: -- what are some of the things in the checklist that would make you say, yes, $1 billion, that makes sense?</p><p>MCNAMEE: Well the way I look at this is there are some that are easy. I look at Uber and I think to myself that notwithstanding the, shall we say, unusual personality of the CEO, the service is universally loved, and it has plowed through regulatory barriers and political barriers very, very easily. And I don't know what -- I don't know how to value Uber. $50 billion seems like a big number, but who knows? It could -- I can imagine a scenario where it's worth that much.</p><p>Within that list of 100, there are bound to be a few which we look back on and go, wow, where was the sock puppet, right? And some of these are not going to work out well. And but the way I look at it is I think on balance we're better off seeing investors get too excited, because at least we wind up with a new industry.</p><p>And so when they're coming to me now, I'm looking at them all and going, you know, I think I'm going to wait.

They are private companies worth $1 billion or more, based on fundraising. And they include companies such as Uber, Airbnb and Fitbit. Well there are 25 unicorns this year, bringing the total to more than 100. Uber is perhaps the most well know, with an estimated $50 billion valuation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So are all unicorns created equal? Roger McNamee is a successful veteran technology investor, and Co-Founder of Elevation Partners. And he joins me now to share his insights. Roger, thank you so much for being here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ROGER MCNAMEE, CO-FOUNDER, ELEVATION PARTNERS: Pimm, it's a great pleasure.</p><p>PIMM: Let's start off just talking about this idea of these billion-dollar or more private companies, but that's based on fundraising. That's not maybe real money, in some people's eyes. Tell me.</p><p>MCNAMEE: Well it's real money --</p><p>PIMM: Yes?</p><p>MCNAMEE: -- because they are -- people are writing checks --</p><p>PIMM: Okay.</p><p>MCNAMEE: -- based on getting whatever percentage of the company you get at those valuations. So clearly there is something going on here that we have never seen before. There have been private companies with billion-dollar valuations, Facebook was there. LinkedIn was there. Twitter was there. But now there are more than 100. And that is clearly without precedent.</p><p>And here's the good news. When -- at some level it is a speculative mania by venture capitalists, but the other side of the coin is every great industry in America was built on the back of a speculative mania, starting with the railroads in the 1830s and 1840s. And so to me the great thing about American culture it when we decide we like something, we just we throw out all the rules. We pretend like it really is different this time. And we put all this money into it.</p><p>And the good news is after the market corrects, or crashes or whatever comes later, you have this great new industry. And I do think that what's going on now is, from an American economic point of view, a really exciting thing. Now, personally, I look at it as an investor and I go, now hang on just a sec, this doesn't feel like the sort of thing that's going to go on without interruption. I think we are going to see a correction here. And when it comes it could be really brutal.</p><p>FOX: When someone comes to Roger McNamee and says, you know what? There is this company and we would love you to participate, --</p><p>MCNAMEE: Yes.</p><p>FOX: -- what are some of the things in the checklist that would make you say, yes, $1 billion, that makes sense?</p><p>MCNAMEE: Well the way I look at this is there are some that are easy. I look at Uber and I think to myself that notwithstanding the, shall we say, unusual personality of the CEO, the service is universally loved, and it has plowed through regulatory barriers and political barriers very, very easily. And I don't know what -- I don't know how to value Uber. $50 billion seems like a big number, but who knows? It could -- I can imagine a scenario where it's worth that much.</p><p>Within that list of 100, there are bound to be a few which we look back on and go, wow, where was the sock puppet, right? And some of these are not going to work out well. And but the way I look at it is I think on balance we're better off seeing investors get too excited, because at least we wind up with a new industry.</p><p>And so when they're coming to me now, I'm looking at them all and going, you know, I think I'm going to wait. And it's not because I don't think they're great companies. It's because my 33 years as an investor in technology tells me there will be a day when the good ones will be available in the public market at a lower valuation. It's just markets go up and they go down. And I don't know whether that's a year from now, two years from now or five years from now, but the opportunity will come along. Things don't grow to the sky usually.</p><p>FOX: Let me -- let me give you a name. All right let's talk Fitbit.</p><p>MCNAMEE: Well there you go. So Fitbit is a company that, if I understand the forecast properly, is going to do over $1 billion in revenue this year. And it has carved a position beneath Apple in the wellness market. And the problem with the product is that the data it gives you is not accurate. The good news of the product is the social experience is marvelous.</p><p>And people really do use it and they really do love it. Now how do you value a situation like that, because they're always going to have to be cheaper than Apple. And they're going to have to watch out for Apple coming down and essentially grabbing their price point. I'm personally a shareholder victim. I'd -- I'd like to see what they can do with it.</p><p>How is it going to turn out? I haven't a clue. And am I going to get a chance to own it cheaper? Well once it's public the answer is inevitably, because things are going to go up and down, but they may go up before they go down, and that would be better for me, but I don't know that that's what's going to happen.</p><p>FOX: Is there a unicorn out there that you don't want to play leapfrog with?</p><p>MCNAMEE: Well the funny thing is I don't see it today, but I'm sure the answer is yes. What's exciting now is that the technology of smartphones for the last six or seven years was about making phones themselves. Now it's about applying that technology to changing other sectors of the economy, and creating use cases where people get benefit or enjoyment from things they never had before.</p><p>Think about Uber, I mean what a transformation of transportation. And that wave is going to last 10, 15 years fundamentally. So some of these things are going to emerge and wind up not only in the S&amp;P 500, but if they do a great job, maybe in the Dow that you really do get a few things that do break through. The chances that we're going to have 100 of them that all do that in lockstep I think round to zero.</p><p>FOX: AOL and Verizon, what do you think of the deal?</p><p>MCNAMEE: So I look at it, and I go if I'm Tim Armstrong this is a great outcome. I mean AOL, their best case from here was just to keep hammering away. From Verizon's point of view, there is an opportunity for them to get some technology mojo that they haven't had. I find it highly unlikely that they will get that, simply because they have been so successful in their core markets that culturally the notion that they're going to adopt \"Huffington Post\" style, TechCrunch-style culture at Verizon, I wouldn't count on it. Most big tech deals don't work out for the buyer, but it's a great day for the AOL shareholder and for the team there.</p><p>FOX: I want to thank you very much, Roger McNamee of Elevation Partners, much appreciated.</p><p>1140</p><p>[*] ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> QUESTION:  And one more, on trade, and following up on what Blake asked  about Harley-Davidson.  They announced in an SEC filing they're moving a  significant amount of their operations to Europe because of the E.U.  tariffs that were placed on Harley-Davidson motorcycles.  Is this what the  President envisioned for what the impact would be by placing tariffs on the  E.U. and the retaliation the E.U. has put on the U. S.?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Again, the European  Union is trying to punish U.S. workers because they have engaged repeatedly  in unfair trade practices.  And the president is saying enough is enough.   We'd like to work with the E.U. to work on a level playing field. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Sorry, Steve, I did come to you.  Go ahead.  </p><p> QUESTION:  The president today in the Oval Office, sitting next to the king  of Jordan, mentioned some progress in the Middle East peace process, but he  didn't give us any specifics. </p><p> There's been quite a bit of back-channel diplomacy going on the last few  days in the Middle East, with Jared Kushner and Jason Greenblatt.  Do you  have anything concrete to -- to tell us about any sort of positive movement  whatsoever, from all of this? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Again, we -- I think that the meetings that took place  over the last week with Senior Adviser Jared Kushner and Special  Representative Jason Greenblatt, they met with a number of officials and  principals in Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, Israel and Qatar last week. </p><p> They discussed the situation in Gaza as well as the next stages of the  peace effort.  We're going to continue those conversations and we're  committed to the peace effort, and we're going to keep working forward.   But those conversations were productive. </p><p> Julie? </p><p> QUESTION:  Sarah, the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection said  today that they are no longer going to be referring people who cross the  border without authorization for criminal charges if they're traveling with  children, which is essentially a return to the Obama administration  practice and administrations before that.  Does the president support that  approach?  And if so, does he regret trying to push forward on a zero- tolerance approach in the first place? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  No.  The president certainly supports keeping families  together, which he has outlined several times over the last week.  But he's  also called on Congress to actually fix the system. </p><p> They're the only ones that ultimately have the ability to change the law.   The president's executive order has given a temporary solution to the  problem but it's not permanent, and we need Congress to step up.  We need  Democrats to stop playing political games, do their jobs, work with this  president and let's fix the problem at the border. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Jeff? </p><p> QUESTION:  Sarah, can you talk about why you tweeted from your official  account about the episode that you had at the restaurant on Friday night? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Sure.  I was responding to a number of news stories.  I  would been reached out to by over a dozen reporters, and there were  multiple news stories that had already been issued. </p><p> It was considered news of the day, so I responded in the way I would to any  other news of the day story. </p><p> Jeff? </p><p> QUESTION:  Sarah, you said just because you don't see a judge doesn't mean  you don't get due process.  Can you explain what you mean by that  specifically, and how the president envisions that this would work while  still maintaining what the Constitution upholds in having a swift  immigration system? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Again, there are other ways for removal.  There are  thousands of illegal aliens that are removed every month that don't see  judges.  Sometimes that's through voluntary removal, and sometimes that's  through expedited removal. </p><p> Again, the president's ultimate goal would be that we have actually a  secure border, and people aren't coming into the country illegally.  But  that we have a system that works and the people that come into the country  come in through a legal system. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Jill? </p><p> QUESTION:  What is the president doing specifically this week to ensure  that Congress passes a bill?  He's spent all week in Nevada talking about - - or, all weekend.  Excuse me -- on Saturday, talking about how Democrats  want open borders and crime.  But, specifically, has he made phone calls to  Republican members in the House, where the bill is pending?  Has he tried  to bring Democrats together?  What is he doing specifically to try and get  a new law passed, specifically, other than just railing against the current  law? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  The president met with a number of lawmakers last week,  talked with several over the weekend, some that he was with while he was  traveling.  Last week, he made an open invitation to Democrat lawmakers --  that they were welcome to come to the White House to discuss what they'd  like to see, because the president wants solutions. </p><p> We've yet to have any of them to show up, actually willing to have those  conversations, actually willing to fix the problem.  Instead, they'd rather  rant and rave about not allowing members of the Trump administration to  step foot in public. </p><p> The president wants to see solutions.  That's what we're focused on.  It's  Congress's job to do that, and we've laid out very clearly that we want to  be part of that and what we'd like to see in that package. </p><p> Jill? </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> QUESTION:  ... on this? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Clearly, they aren't.  If they haven't passed a law to  fix this system, then they haven't.  Republicans have laid out a number of  proposals that they support.  The president has voiced his support for  those. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> QUESTION:  ... probably fail this week, though.  The Republican bills will  probably...</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  That's because no Democrat will get on board and  actually support a solution. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> QUESTION:  ... Republican -- is your Republicans cannot pass these  Republican bills.  What is the president doing as the leader of the party  to try and get Republican...</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Jeff, these aren't Republican bills.  These are bills  that fix a broken system.  They may have Republican sponsors, but these  should be bipartisan.  This shouldn't be complicated.  Look, the House has  already passed over 500 pieces of legislation, but they can't get through  the Senate because Democrats refuse to actually find solutions. </p><p> We have 50 bills that passed just last week to address the opioid crisis --  that passed through the House.  The Senate still hasn't taken them up.   Hopefully, they will.  And, if they do, that will show that we actually can  come up with bipartisan solutions.  And that's what we'd like to see them  do on immigration, as well. </p><p> Jill? </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> QUESTION:  ... follow-up on Julia's question about the zero-tolerance  policy.  The president said, last week, after signing the executive order,  that he believed that zero tolerance was still important.  You guys made a  point of the fact that the E. O.  did not actually get rid of the policy. </p><p> How does that square with the fact that CBP is now saying that they are no  longer referring for prosecution any adults who come in with children? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Again, this is a temporary solution.  This isn't going  to last.  Congress still has to step up.  They still have to do their job.   This will only last a short amount of time because we're going to run out  of space, we're going to run out of resources in order to keep people  together, and we're asking Congress to provide those resources and do their  job.  And...</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> QUESTION:  ... temporary solution -- does that mean, at some point, you are  going to change that policy back? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  We're not changing the policy.  We're simply out of  resources, and, at some point, Congress has to do what they were elected to  do, and that is secure our border.  That is stop the crime coming into our  country. </p><p> The country has made extremely clear that they don't want open borders, and  Democrats need to understand that, and they need to work with Republicans  and find some solutions. </p><p> QUESTION:  And there...</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Annie.  Sorry, Jill, I'm going to keep going.  Annie, go  ahead. </p><p> QUESTION:  Sarah, you mentioned the state of resources and running out of  them.  Can you be specific about what the resources are right now for  housing parents and children together?  Is there enough housing right now?   Is the Pentagon stepping in?  Like, what's being done about the resources?  </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Again, we're looking at every option available.  We have  asked the Pentagon to help with additional space.  But a lot of that will  depend on our ability to stop people coming into the country illegally.   And we, again, encourage people to go through ports of entry instead of  crossing the border illegally. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  We've requested, through legislation -- we're working  with Congress, hopefully, to provide more resources and the ability to  actually enforce the law. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Ayesha? </p><p> QUESTION:  Thank you.  I just want to see if you can kind of narrow down  exactly what the president actually intends to do when it comes to this  idea of not having judges.  You say that there are instances where people  don't have judges, but my understanding is that, if you do ask for asylum,  you do have certain rights. </p><p> So is there going to be a change in that policy, or what is this  administration planning to do to make it so you don't have to see a judge?   (INAUDIBLE)  </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Again, I have addressed this a couple times.  There are  multiple instances in where you wouldn't:  voluntary removal, certain cases  have expedited removal.  If somebody comes through a port of entry seeking  asylum, those cases and that process will be heard.  But at the same time,  the president's ultimate goal is to secure the border and stop illegal  immigration. </p><p> QUESTION:  I -- I -- I understand that, but so what does that mean  practically?  Like, is the president planning to do anything differently,  or are you just saying, you don't like the way (INAUDIBLE) now? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  The president's laid out what he'd like to see.  We've  put out the things that we want to see in an immigration package months  ago.  We're still waiting on Congress to give us the ability to do that. </p><p> QUESTION:  So -- so unless Congress acts, nothing is actually going to  change?  The administration is not changing anything right now, when it  comes to judges? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  You mean, are we walking around making up laws?  No,  because we're not the Obama administration.  We're actually trying to  enforce the laws that are on the books.  We're actually asking Congress to  do their part in the process, and pass new legislation that will fix our  immigration system. </p><p> QUESTION:  So -- but nothing is actually changing on the ground.  Like,  this -- so this is -- the president's complaining about judges, and saying  that we shouldn't have all these judges, and people who come over should  just be put out, but nothing is actually going to change.  He's just saying  -- he's just complaining about the process as it stands now. </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Things that we have the ability to do administratively,  we are working to do.  But again, Congress is the only one that has the  ability to write law, and we hope they'll do that. </p><p> Steve? </p><p> QUESTION:  I'm honing in on that point.  I'm trying to understand what it  is the president understands about the current policy, because as you've  explained, expedited removal allows the government to remove hundreds of  thousands of illegal immigrants a year without seeing judges.  Did the  president know that when he issued the tweets? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Yeah, but there are still thousands that go through a  very lengthy process.  We'd like to see the process consolidated.  We'd  like to see the backlog stopped.  We'd like to see our border secured. </p><p> Sorry, Steve, I'm going to keep going. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> QUESTION:  Under current law there are a couple of things that the  president could do.  You could expand that policy.  You've said that he  would like to see more expedited removal.  Does the president intend to  expand it to the full two-year limit under the current statute? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Again, we would like to see more expedited removal, but  ultimately, we would like to see the border secured and people stop coming  into the country illegally.  That seems pretty simple to me, and it would  stop a lot of the problems, and would eliminate the need for so many of  these additional laws. </p><p> QUESTION:  Thanks, Sarah.  The gal in the briefing talking about the  importance of civility.  Do you consider it a civil policy to separate more  than two thirds of the children from their parents? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  We consider enforcing the law the role that the  administration has to play.  Certainly, the president has taken an  executive action to the furthest that he has the ability to do to minimize  the separation of families.  We're working hard to make sure families get  to stay together, and we're calling on Congress to help us in that effort,  and we're continuing to focus on the reunification, and making sure that  the families, again, stay together, and that Congress will give us a  permanent solution to fix that. </p><p> QUESTION:  But you say that you're working to make families stay together.   It was your administration that separated them in the first place. </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  It wasn't our administration that created these laws,  but it is our administration's job to enforce it, and we've done that.  If  someone breaks the law, it's our job to enforce it.  If somebody doesn't  like the law, then they need to lobby Congress and ask them to change it.  </p><p> Anita. </p><p> QUESTION:  I have, one, an immigration question, and wanted to clarify one  thing.  So I understand that not every adult with a child is going to be  prosecuted.  If there are families that are being held together, detained  together somewhere and 20 days goes by, what is going to happen then?  I  didn't get an -- an answer with that last week.  I don't understand.  The  law says you can't keep them together, keep the children, even with parents  for longer than 20 days.  So then what happens? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Hopefully, Congress will pass the law and fix the  problem. </p><p> QUESTION:  (INAUDIBLE) 20 days? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Well, why should it be so hard?  They all say that they  don't want to separate families.  Seems like it should be pretty simple to  me. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  John? </p><p> QUESTION:  I said I had a clarification...</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Go ahead. </p><p> QUESTION:  ... so Jeff asked you a question about Congress and the bill.   Were you, in your response, referring to just a stand-alone bill that deals  with family separation, or were you referring to the bigger immigration  bill that the House hopes to take up this week? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Our preference would be a bill that addresses all of the  pillars that we've laid out, that we'd like to see addressed in an  immigration package.  And that's what our focus is right now, is there's a  bill that does that on the table. </p><p> If that doesn't happen, then we'll talk about other pieces of legislation  at that point. </p><p> QUESTION:  (INAUDIBLE) the president still wants that bill to go forward  even though he said...</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Certain...</p><p> QUESTION:  ... they don't want to -- he -- they shouldn't waste their time  on it? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Look, Democrats in the Senate have made clear they're  not going to support this.  </p><p> And because we need at least some Democrats to get on board, they've made  it very clear that they don't want to work with the president, that they  don't want to fix our immigration system.  That they'd rather have open  borders and rampant crime than work with the president to create solutions.   Until they change their mind, we're going to continue looking at the best  ways that we can fix these problems but we need Congress to help us. </p><p> John. </p><p> QUESTION:  Thank you, Sarah.  This president is the first in the television  age who has yet to address the American public on nationwide television  from the Oval Office.  Many Republican consultants have said that he might  have a stronger hand in influencing Congress if he made a nationally  televised address on immigration and what changes he'd like to see, to  explain it. </p><p> Is that something that's on the table within the administration? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Certainly don't want to take anything off the table, or  any tool away from the president.  He does address the American people in a  number of different venues and formats.  And I will certainly pass along  that suggestion to him. </p><p> Nadia. </p><p> QUESTION:  Just a follow-up on the Middle East.  In the recent (INAUDIBLE)  Mr. Kushner said that if President Abbas is not willing to negotiate, he's  going to proceed with the deal.  Can you explain how the White House is  hoping to achieve any progress in the Middle East peace talks if the  principal party is not taking part in it? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  We're going to continue meeting with the other partners  in the region.  And, again, we're going to continue pushing forward in the  peace process.  We had productive meetings over the last week.  We're going  to continue those conversations. </p><p> I will take one last question.  Saagar.  </p><p> QUESTION:  Thanks, Sarah.  </p><p> To follow up on the judges -- on the issue of immigration judges, why is  the President so opposed to an increase in the number of immigration judges  when it would expedite the asylum processing -- the asylum process and  expedite deportation?  </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  We're not opposed to the speeding up the process.  What  the President would like to see, once again, is that we stop the problem at  the very beginning.  He'd like to see us secure the border and people work  through the system, through the ports of entry, so that we're not dealing  with things on the back end.  </p><p> We'd like to stop the problem before it starts, and that's what the  president's focus has been all along, is on securing the border.  And  that's what we're going to continue to do.  </p><p> Thanks so much guys.  Have a great day.  </p><p> NEIL CAVUTO, HOST:  All right, you have been listening to Sarah Sanders  here.</p><p> And it's safe to say the Washington press corps is more concerned with the  immigration issue than a lot of folks losing their shirts today on this  whole trade issue.  </p><p> Welcome, everybody.  I'm Neil Cavuto.  And you're watching \"Your World.\"</p><p> And it could have worse.  As I show you the Dow today down about 328  points, we had been down almost 500 points, and a lot of that over a  building trade war and concerns this could get worse before it gets better,  or that there are no signs of concessions on the part of any of the  principal parties, namely the Chinese and ourselves.  </p><p> All of this on the same day that Harley-Davidson was indicating, because of  these threat of tariffs, they're moving a lot of their operations outside  the U.S.</p><p> On a separate issue, General Motors has indicated that a lot of its Chevy  Blazers will now be made in Mexico, not citing just the trade issue,  but  that it's not welcome noise here.</p><p> So, again, this could have a lot been worse.  There was some confusion  early on in the markets as to whether the administration was also  recommending that they were urging the Chinese and others not to invest in  technology stocks at all.  </p><p> Then Peter Navarro ends up popping up on CNBC to say, no, no, no, no, no,  they're not going to be, nor are there plans in the works for investment  restrictions on China.</p><p> And that brought us down to the levels we're at right now, about 328 points  southward on what was a crazy day on the markets.</p><p> We're going to be at this from all angles right now.</p><p> Let's first go to FOX Business Network's Deirdre Bolton with how it all  sorted out.</p><p> Hey, Deirdre.</p><p> DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, Neil.  </p><p> You said it.  It could have been much worse.  So, the markets did close  clearly lower, but certainly off the low points of the day.  And, of  course, the big headline, the Trump administration moving to block Chinese  companies from investing in U.S. tech firms and moving to block additional  tech exports from the U.S. to China.  </p><p> Our sources are saying the Treasury Department is going to make an official  announcement at the end of this week, bring us more clarity, more details  on the plan.  </p><p> Now, the level of difficulty is, of course, much higher when you start to  talk about blocking investment than when we're just engaging in tariff  spats.  So the stock market heading for the biggest one-day slide in  months.  </p><p> That's how we finished up.  You can see red across the screen.  One area I  really wanted to highlight are the techs, because S&amp;P 500 tech companies  get about 60 percent of their revenue from overseas.  So that's the highest  foreign exposure out of any of the index's 11 sectors.  </p><p> And, of course,critics of our current trade policy say that China has been  stealing anywhere between $30 billion and $50 billion worth of intellectual  property, hard data, every year for the past decade.  But then there was  even a stronger report, a more recent one that came out from the Commission  on the Theft of American Intellectual Property.</p><p> It has a much higher number, stating that up to $600 billion in theft that  has some projections baked in is possible.  But experts say, bottom line,  the motivation to want to level the playing field is completely  understandable.  </p><p> What gets complicated is that so many American businesses are  interconnected.  So, for example, here's seven big tech American companies  that source half of their products and components from China.  </p><p> So, HP, IBM, Dell, Cisco, Unisys, Microsoft, Intel.  Even Apple has sold  more iPhones in China in the last three years than in the U.S.  And Apple  gets about 20 percent of its annual revenue from China.  </p><p> Now, the Chinese president of course says China will punch back and will  not be forced to eat the bitter fruit.  That is a translation, a direct  quote.  </p><p> But as the tension rises between the world's two biggest economies, of  course, investors really showed their anxiety.  So, we had the Nasdaq, you  can see there, closely lower, essentially 2 percent, biggest one-day  percentage decline since March.  Third day down in a row.  So, that's the  longest losing streak for that tech-heavy comp in about two months' time.</p><p> Even Asia overnight, you can see how markets reacted there.  You can see  Hong Kong's Hang Seng down by more than 1 percent.  And, then, of course,  even on our own bond market, right, there was this flight to safety in U.S.  10-year.  Investors typically, of course, buy these bonds when they're  fearful or they feel less certain of the future.  </p><p> And prices really went up, so, therefore, those yields went down, settling  2.875 percent.  And just worth noting, these yields have fallen basically  for the past four out of five weeks.  </p><p> So, Neil, what is clear is, investors really don't know what to make of it.   We have the tariffs and now we have this idea of blocking direct  investment, which is a much more muscular and, quite frankly, threatening  move than tariffs, which really only apply to very specific products, Neil.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Absolutely, especially when they go back and forth either way.</p><p> BOLTON:  Yes.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Thank you very, very much, Deirdre Bolton.</p><p> BOLTON:  Sure.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Doesn't Harley-Davidson know that?  Not so much on the tariffs  we're considering, but the response that company is getting and opting to  do something that the president probably didn't envision.  </p><p>FOX Business Network's Jeff Flock in Countryside, Illinois.  </p><p> What did they do?  </p><p> JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  They're getting a double  whammy at Harley-Davidson, Neil, because the steel and aluminum tariffs hit  their raw materials costs.</p><p> And now the European Union, of course, imposing an addition 25 percent  tariff on motorcycles made here and shipped to Europe.</p><p> And so Harley is in a tough spot.  That tariff went from 6 percent to 31  percent.  And today, in a regulatory filing, Harley said that is going to  add more than $2,000 a bike to the cost of a motorcycle made here in the  U.S. and sold in Europe.  And they can't possibly pass that along to  consumers.</p><p> So, in the short-term, they're going to have to eat it.  In the long term,  they're going to move production away from the U.S.  Europe was an  expanding market for Harley-Davidson.  They love it over there.  And U.S.  sales have been down.</p><p> You look at the first quarter of this year, U.S. sales of Harleys down  double digits, as guys like me get older and maybe give up their  motorcycles.  In Europe, it had been growing by about 7 percent.  </p><p> And so those bikes, made in the U.S. and shipped to Europe, will be no  more.  Harley has four plants here in the U.S., York, Pennsylvania, Kansas  City, Missouri, and two in their home state of Wisconsin, and now  apparently bikes destined for Europe will not be made there anymore.</p><p> Instead, they will be made in places like Brazil and elsewhere, Thailand  and Australia.  This is not, as you pointed out at the outset, what the  president had intended.  His trade policies designed to keep and create  jobs here in the U.S.  In this case, it appears they will be eliminating  them -- Neil.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Amazing.</p><p> All right, Jeff Flock, thank you very, very much.  </p><p> All right, Mattie Duppler is.  We have got Charles Payne here, Larry Shover  here as well of SFG, alternate CME trader as well.  </p><p> Charles Payne, what is going on here?  We knew the trade thing was getting  antsy, but it seemed like the bottom fell out.  </p><p> CHARLES PAYNE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  It did, but because I think this had  a little bit of a different twist.</p><p> This was investment.  This is about -- the whole thing, by the way, is  centered on made in China 2025.  The administration, which I wish they  would articulate what they're trying to do, because I understand, and I  think most -- a lot of people do -- and it's the idea of curbing this  ambition, the stated ambition by China to sort of be the world's tech  leader in a short period of time.</p><p> And one way to get there, perhaps the only way they can get their with  their own timeline, is to continue to steal our intellectual property.</p><p> So the idea is to restrict investments from companies where China has a 25  percent or more ownership.  And, again, this was just speculation.  It was  in a few media outlets, the White House trying to take -- take it back a  little bit.  It's something obviously that they have toyed around with.</p><p> Peter Navarro has talked about this kind of thing for maybe two decades, so  this is not necessarily news, per se.  But it is -- it is a different  twist, to your point.  It's not -- it's not the trade stuff anymore, as  much as it is, hey, we want to take direct aim at your ambitions to usurp  America's perch as the world's tech leader.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, Larry, what worried a lot in the markets is that, all of a  sudden, then we were putting a general wall up on Chinese investment in  general and technology period.  </p><p> That's how it was interpreted.  And then, later on, the treasury secretary,  Mnuchin, came out to say, no, no, no, it wasn't singling out China, as if  to say there's other players here, as if that eased the angst.  </p><p> It actually compounded that.  But what do you make of that?  </p><p> LARRY SHOVER, SOLUTIONS FUNDS GROUP:  Well, what I make of it is that two  things.</p><p> The whole thing lacked clarity.  Like, it didn't matter.  Like, this whole  China tweets and tirades, it didn't matter because it lacked clarity.  It  seemed like the White House is utterly unprepared to create any kind of  proposal that can go into law.</p><p> Immigration policy is a good proof of that.  Also, it lacks credibility,  because we all know -- I mean, this does -- this hurts us more than it  hurts them, the fact that it's going to kill Apple or Nike.  It really,  really hurt them manufacturing their goods there that are sent to us.</p><p> So it doesn't make any sense.  People dismissed it.  And I really think  people are definitely blaming the China trade today.  The bigger problem,  though, it's really tech.  We saw that breaking down last week.</p><p> Leadership has been very thin in the stock market.  Without five or six  super cap techs in the S&amp;P 500...</p><p> CAVUTO:  Yes.  </p><p> SHOVER:  ... we would be down 4 percent, instead of up 1.5 percent.</p><p> But it started to crack.  The Supreme Court came out last week with a  ruling on sales tax, et cetera.  That chasm between growth and value has  been very, very wide.  The market is vulnerable.  The ball will always find  you when you're out of position.</p><p> And that's really what happened today.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  And people were a little anxious on that investment angle here and  maybe finding an excuse for technology, which ran up far and fast, to sell  off some of it.</p><p> But, Mattie, it's sort of this impression that not everyone in the  administration seems to be on the same page.  I'm getting different vibes  from the Treasury secretary, different vibes from their trade  representatives, different vibes from the president.</p><p> MATTIE DUPPLER, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S FORUM:  Right.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  And I think that's the kind of thing that scares markets.  </p><p> DUPPLER:  Oh, absolutely.</p><p> You finally have consensus on this panel, Neil.  And that's, what the heck  is the administration intending to do with these trade efforts?</p><p> Charles and I don't always agree on this issue, but right now we're both  wondering, what is the objective here?  And that's what the administration  needs to clarify.  It needs to make clear what it intends to do with all of  these efforts towards China.</p><p> Now, if the objective here is to exact the most amount of pain and pressure  on China possible, they need to make sure that they're not injecting pain  on American businesses.  And that's a concern, especially when you look at  really artificially diminishing the amount of capital that can come into  this country.</p><p> I worry about the impact on businesses.  And that's not even getting to  what tariffs are doing to American businesses, where we have already seen  some of those announcements this week.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Or even the threat of them.</p><p> But, Charles, the other thing you mentioned -- and this -- you can help me  out here.  It's always been that the Chinese are in bad shape here.   They're at two-year-plus lows in their market.  They have a lot more to  lose than we do.</p><p> But they also have their pride, and they're not giving any ground.  So, how  is this resolved, if it is?</p><p> PAYNE:  And this is where I disagree with Larry.  </p><p> I don't think -- I think a lot of people are raising the white flag so  quickly that China is going to beat us at this.  They're not.  If it has to  go the whole way... </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  The whole way could be years.  </p><p> PAYNE:  Yes, Sure.</p><p> Mattie makes the right point.  It's sort of like when my pops used to take  me out in the back.  He says, it's going to hurt me as much as it hurts  you.  </p><p> No, it won't.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> PAYNE:  With that being said, let's look at what China did today, this  morning.  </p><p> Their central bank freed up banks over there to the tune of $100 billion.   Right?  This is to sort of...</p><p> CAVUTO:  It needs a stimulant.</p><p> PAYNE:  ... to do things thing on debt.  </p><p> Last week, it was $30 billion.  A week before that, it was $30 billion.   Their foreign and reserve currencies have dropped a trillion dollars.  </p><p> Their debt-to-GDP ratio is on its way to 300 percent.  We aren't going to  lose this.  China knows we're not going to lose this.  Nobody wants to  lose.  It's a matter of how, to your point, do you save face and resolve  it?</p><p> CAVUTO:  I think that's where we are.  </p><p> Larry, the Chinese, remember, today indicating, you know, we don't just  turn a cheek on this.  And we come back and we're going to fight back.  </p><p> Now, to be clear, no response to the tariffs yet with tariffs of their own.   In other words, to increase the amount to match the United States, when we  promised we would put $200 billion on top of that.</p><p> Some read into that a sign that the Chinese are trying to find a middle  ground here, where they can talk tough, but they don't have to respond in  kind and invite a war.  What do you see?  </p><p> SHOVER:  Yes.</p><p> Well, I see that they have already done that, just what we said.  Required  reserve ratio dropped 50 basis points yesterday, adding all that liquidity  into the market.  What did that do?  That dropped RMB by 1.5 percent in  five days, 3.5 percent over the last month.  </p><p> So they're already ready.  That is going to negate any kind of trade tariff  that we are going to impose.  And I think they know, at the end of the day,  that there's so lack of clarity coming out of the White House, that they're  just preparing for it.  </p><p> Also realizing that they have had a real soft patch of data coming in.  So,  perhaps Trump is trying to hit them while they're weak.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  We will see.</p><p> All right, guys, I apologize jumping on you.  We have got a lot of breaking  news here.  </p><p> I do want to bring in my next guest, the former Heinz CEO Bill Johnson, a  global read of things, if ever there were one.  </p><p> And, Bill, I'm looking at this and wondering what the signals could be for  us.  If a company, one after the other, like GM considering making all its  Blazers now in Mexico, and, of course, we have been talking about a number  of other companies that have been doing the same or considering preemptive  move like Harley-Davidson, that has got to have a domestic economic impact.</p><p> BILL JOHNSON, FORMER CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, H.J. HEINZ COMPANY:  It should, Neil.  </p><p> Nothing has happened yet to impact the economy here.  And, frankly, the  Chinese and European economies...</p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, they're already leaving.  Those guys are already making some  moves.  </p><p> JOHNSON:  I understand.  But they're more vulnerable than we are.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  True.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Having said that, this is like tic-tac-toe.  Nobody wins.  </p><p> I play tic-tac-toe with any grandkids.  And you never win.  And that's what  this is now.  We have gotten to the point on this situation...</p><p> CAVUTO:  You never won at tic-tac-toe with your grandkids?  </p><p> JOHNSON:  No.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  You're one of the most celebrated CEOs ever.  And... </p><p> JOHNSON:  Yes.  That just shows you nobody wins, Neil.  And that's where we  are right now.  Nobody wins.</p><p> CAVUTO:  So, that's where you see -- that's where we are right now?</p><p> JOHNSON:  I do think that's where we are.</p><p> I think this created a huge environment of uncertainty.  You and I have had  this conversation many times.  Uncertainty leads to volatility.  Volatility  leads to more uncertainty.  And we get in this vicious cycle.  </p><p> And I think that's where we are now.  Having said that, I think,  ultimately, saner and cooler heads will prevail, and this will somehow get  resolved.  </p><p> I hope this is not a negotiation ploy, because it's rather ham-fisted.  And  there has got to be better ways to attack this issue than the one that is  being generated right now.</p><p> CAVUTO:  What do you make -- I think it was ratcheted up a little bit today  to go after in this case the Chinese for investing in technology.</p><p> It was read as, we're not going to allow them to invest in any technology  companies.  And that might have been a prematurely wrong impression.  But  that was the one that was out there for hours in the markets.  They had to  dial that back a little bit.</p><p> But they're still looking at putting a limit to who can invest in  technology.  That's how it interpreted, hence, technology falls off a lot.   So if this is more from just goods and services to, I don't know, even  companies and stocks you invest in, then what?  </p><p> JOHNSON:  Well, then I think we have chaos, Neil. </p><p> I don't think you can stop the investment in a capitalist society.  It's  just the way the system works.  And while I understand why the  administration is going after some of these issues -- and they're sort of  going where people have been afraid to tread before -- the reality is, we  have to have some clarity in the communication of the purpose of what we're  trying to achieve and then take a step-by-step process in which to achieve  it.  </p><p> And I heard about the investment situation this morning.  Then I saw  Secretary Mnuchin's response.  And so I'm completely unclear as to what is  happening.  And there we go again.  That creates more uncertainty, which  creates more volatility, and leaves us all in the dark about what it is  we're trying to achieve.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Now, there used to be an old rule here following this president  the last 18 months that those who doubted him would be proven wrong, and  that everything ends up OK and markets come back from what look like  debacles, and people who second-guessed him have been proven wrong.  </p><p> So there was this now new -- or renewed trust that President Trump must  know what he's doing, there's a method to all of this.  </p><p> Do you subscribe to that, or is there now a reassessment, well, maybe not.   Maybe this is a little impulsive.  Maybe there's not a method to the  madness.  Maybe it's just madness.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Well, I think, historically, over his last 18 months in office,  he's done a pretty good job of bringing us back from the brink and  achieving great success.  </p><p>North Korea seems to be an example of one of those areas.  But I don't  know.  I don't like this whole approach, Neil.  I think it's so ham-fisted  and so unpredictable that sometimes you create a fire out of a smoke bomb,  and the next thing you know, you have got a real conflagration going, and  you don't know how to put it out.  And that -- I'm worried we're headed  that way.</p><p> Having said that, I will give him credit for again treading in these places  that need to be addressed.  I just think there's better ways to do it.  But  I'm not yet ready to say that we're just going to pull this one back from  the brink and everyone is going to be happy.  </p><p> I just don't know.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  We shall see, my friend.  Thank you very, very much.  </p><p> Good luck in your next tic-tac-toe game.  I give the edge to you still.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> JOHNSON:  Thank you.  Thank you.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  William Johnson, the former Heinz CEO, if anyone knows the global  landscape, it is he.  All right. </p><p> All right, when we come back here, this nastiness with Democrats saying  that we're going to get nasty no matter where Republicans gather.  </p><p> Really?  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Yikes, 25 minutes, right, a 5:00 p.m. deadline staring down now,  as House Republicans want documents from the Justice Department on that  Clinton e-mail probe and the Russian investigation.  Then what happens if  they don't get them?  </p><p> After this.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. MAXINE WATERS (D), CALIFORNIA:  And if you see anybody from that  Cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you  get out and you create a crowd.  </p><p> (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)</p><p> WATERS:  And you push back on them.  And you tell them they're not welcome.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, anyway, American Majority CEO Ned Ryun.  We have got Olympic  Media managing editor Katie Frates and Democratic strategist Christy  Setzer.</p><p> I don't know where to begin.  But, Katie, maybe you can help me with this.  </p><p> This is out of control.  This is just crazy talk.  What do you make of it?  </p><p> KATIE FRATES, OLYMPIC MEDIA:  It absolutely is.  </p><p> This is just going way too far, because she doesn't even know who she is  speaking to, Maxine Waters, when she is saying this.  What if someone sees  somebody at a gas station and takes it way too far?  </p><p> You're essentially encouraging anyone of any mental state, of any level of  discourse, to go up and potentially harm someone else because of their  political beliefs.  That's absolutely not OK.  </p><p> I'm so excited and happy to see at least Nancy Pelosi push back on this.   I'm not sure why more Democratic leaders are not speaking up and condemning  this.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, there were a good number.  To be fair, there were a good  number, Elijah Cummings and all saying...</p><p> FRATES:  Good.  Good.</p><p> CAVUTO:  ... that, even when it came to the Sanders situation, she  shouldn't have been taken out of the restaurant.  </p><p> But, Ned, I'm worried more about the increasing vitriol.  And we're seeing  more and more of it.  And anything could happen in that environment.</p><p> NED RYUN, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN MAJORITY:  No.</p><p> And I think really what we're seeing is, to sum up Charles Krauthammer, we  conservatives, we think the left is philosophically misguided, and many on  the left think we're evil.  </p><p> And I think you're seeing this rhetoric ramp up where borders are now  bigotry and American presidents standing up for the America taxpayer, well,  this is Nazism and the second coming of the Holocaust.  </p><p> And I think what the left is trying to do is say, the debate is over in our  minds because we consider your ideas to be irrational.  We don't consider  your ideas to be legitimate.  </p><p> And if they can dehumanize the other side, that's what they want to do,  because that justifies driving opposing thought from the public square.  </p><p> The thing that troubles me, Neil, about all of this, this kind of  incitement to physical intimidation and bullying is not to be normalized.   It's not normal for a constitutional republic.  It's only normal in banana  republics.  And if the left wants to beat us, try doing it at the ballot  box in 2018 and 2020.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Do you worry about that, Christy?  </p><p> As a Democratic strategist, and a darn good one, and a very calm person, I  might point out, that your party could be ruining it for itself, that it's  actually scaring some people with that kind of talk, whether you agree or  disagree with the politics behind it.  </p><p> CHRISTY SETZER, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  I just think it's impossible to put  Maxine Waters' comments like this in a vacuum like this.</p><p> The defining feature of Donald Trump's campaign was not that he was going  to shake stuff up in Washington or that he was a great businessman.  It was  this incivility.  Right?  </p><p> He started talking about how, I like people that were not captured about  John McCain.  Then you looked as his rallies, where they were filled with  him actively asking them to take violence against protesters.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  If that is what your view is, do you think that the response,  responding in kind, then, if that's your view, is justified?</p><p> SETZER:  I don't think that -- no, I don't think that we have responded in  kind.  </p><p> I think that Democrats are saying, look, we need to make it just a little  bit uncomfortable.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  You have got whole groups that target a homeland security  secretary at a restaurant.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> SETZER:  No, no, no, no.  Not with violence, Neil.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> SETZER:  That's an extraordinarily important difference.  Not with  violence.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Please listen to me.  </p><p> Sarah Sanders, her incident, Secretary Nielsen outside her home and in a  restaurant, then Maxine Waters justifying it.  I could go on to talk about  Florida's Pam Bondi and what she dealt with at a movie.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> CAVUTO:  Stephen Miller and be called a fascist while he's out.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> SETZER:  Protest is a healthy part of the American tradition, not violence,  not violence.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  You're fine with this.  You're fine with it.  </p><p> But if it were done in reverse, you wouldn't be fine with it.</p><p> SETZER:  I would be absolutely fine with it.  I would be fine with it,  because, again, protest is absolutely fine.</p><p> What is not fine...</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  You just said when you didn't like it what Donald Trump and his  people were doing the same.  </p><p> SETZER:  I'm sorry?</p><p> CAVUTO:  You didn't like it when Donald Trump was doing that.</p><p> SETZER:  No.  What Donald Trump was saying was, I want that guy to be taken  out on a stretcher.  What Donald Trump was doing was actually what Ned Ryun  was just talking about right now, which is dehumanizing the other side.</p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, I don't get it.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  All right.  OK.</p><p> Mattie, do you believe that this is going too far?  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> SETZER:  By talking about how they're animals and infesting America.</p><p> CAVUTO:  I understand.  I heard you.</p><p> SETZER:  That's very different.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Mattie, has this gone too far?  Mattie, you're in awe, aren't you?  </p><p> FRATES:  Yes, yes.  Absolutely, it is.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Katie, I apologize.  I apologize.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  See that?  I lose my place, because I get so wrapped up in it.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Is it your sense that this gets worse, though?  Are you getting a  sense it gets worse?</p><p> FRATES:  So, this is the problem.  </p><p> It's that this is escalating rhetoric.  You're essentially saying mob  someone outside of a gas station.  </p><p> RYUN:  Exactly.  </p><p> FRATES:  And, again, you don't know the intentions of the person who may  then go on to do that.  </p><p> So what if someone is attacked?  What if something violent happens?  And  then you turn around and you say, well, Maxine Waters was telling people to  do that.  It's not a good idea and it's not a healthy dialogue.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> SETZER:  Do we remember the Pizzagate conspiracy, how a crazy conspiracy  actually led someone to take a gun to my, my local pizza place, actually,  and try to shoot it up because they had heard this crazy idea on the  Internet and by Alex Jones and others that Hillary Clinton and John Podesta  were up to no good?  </p><p> That led to actual violence.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, I don't want to get in a tit for tat.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  I sometimes feel like I'm separating my teenage sons.  </p><p> But, Ned Ryun, I do know this.  We have all got to bring the octane down a  little bit on all sides here.  </p><p> RYUN:  We do.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  But how do we do that?  </p><p> And should it be incumbent people to just to say, there has got to be a  better way?  Whether the Elijah Cummings approach, this has got to stop,  whether Sarah Sanders' approach, I just politely up and left, and I tried  not to make a big deal of it at the scene, what is it?  What is the answer?</p><p> RYUN:  No.  I think we have got to start policing our own.  We have to  start policing ourselves on the right and the left.  </p><p> And I was encouraged by Nancy Pelosi saying that Maxine Waters' statement  was unacceptable.  I think we have to be honest about it on the right, too,  when we see unacceptable statements.  And I have said this again -- I have  said this before.  I will say it again.  </p><p> When Donald Trump -- I love 85 to 90 percent of his Twitter feed.  When he  is talking about bloody face-lift, you will never me defend that.  I want  him to focus on the positives and policy and all these things.</p><p> When it becomes personal, I think we need to call out our side and say,  this is not how we have more civil discourse in the public arena.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Fully agree.  Fully agree.  </p><p> At our core, guys, we're all human beings.  </p><p> RYUN:  We're all Americans.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  And we can agree to disagree.  But we don't have to be asses in  the process.  </p><p> And none of you are, by the way.  </p><p> But I want to thank you all very, very much.</p><p> And, Katie, I apologize.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> FRATES:  No, no apology needed.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  I get so apoplectic.  And I don't even know why.  And it's not  even dinnertime.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, by the way, we're close to the witching hour, 5:00 p.m.  Eastern time, that document deadline.  But right now there's indications  the people who have put out that deadline aren't going to get the response  they want in time for that deadline.  </p><p> Then what?  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right.  Between a deadline coming up in about 15 minutes from  now and, of course, this is the week we're going to see some big testimony  up on Capitol Hill, much of it is behind closed doors.</p><p> Let's get the read from former Justice Department official Tom Dupree.  </p><p> Tom, what is the biggest thing you're waiting for?  </p><p> TOM DUPREE, FORMER JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:  Well, the biggest thing  I'm waiting for in the short-term is whether the Justice Department  complies with the congressional demands.  </p><p> As you point out, the clock is ticking.  They have a document deadline,  production deadline at 5:00 p.m. this afternoon.  We will see if they turn  over what they're expected to turn over.  My guess is that they are not  going to satisfy the demands of the House Republicans.</p><p> And I think we are going to see this dispute continue to escalate in the  days ahead.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, then they would want to take even aggressive action  against Rod Rosenstein.  Right?  What would it be?  </p><p> DUPREE:  Well, let's see.</p><p> They have got a wide variety of means at their disposal.  At one end of the  spectrum is just the continued drumbeat of public criticism.  They can amp  that up several ways.</p><p> One thing they could do is, they could issue subpoenas.  Another thing they  could do is, they could actually instigate contempt proceedings.  And then  at the extreme end of the other spectrum, it would be impeachment  proceedings.</p><p> I'm hopeful that they're not going to go there and that cooler heads will  prevail and they be able to sit down and work all of this out before we get  to that point.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Where is all of this going?  </p><p> I mean, especially with the Peter Strzok testimony later on, are they more  interested in his case, finding out what he knew and what was the backdrop  for his comments he was making about then candidate Trump, or what?  </p><p> DUPREE:  Yes.  I think that's a lot of what was going on.</p><p> I mean, I think right now, from the perspective of Congress, there was so  much that was going on behind the scenes in 2016 that Congress wants to  know, what was your reason for doing this?  What was your reason for  handling the investigations the way you did? What was the reason for  getting these wiretaps and for conducting the surveillance?</p><p> Were you using an informant?  Was it a spy, that sort of thing?  And the  fact is, DOJ is not in the business normally of turning over documents.   And so I think, institutionally, there's a huge amount of reluctance to  give Congress what it wants.</p><p> But Congress is beating the drum.  They're on the warpath.  They're trying  to fulfill their oversight function here.  And so I think we have a real  collision that's not in any -- is not going to be sorted out in the near  term.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  When I have looked at a lot of the comments from those identified,  like Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, and these other unidentified individuals,  and then, of course, now I know how James Comey felt about then candidate  Trump and how Andy McCabe felt, his number two.</p><p> I have not run across one piece of evidence to show a pro-Trump person or  someone who was biased to like -- to like Donald Trump.  Now, I might have  missed it.  But, again, doesn't this feed the narrative that that was a  stacked deck, because that certainly that stacked deck mantle has been  claimed by a lot of Republicans that they were out to get him?</p><p> DUPREE:  Yes, I certainly haven't seen anything along the lines of what  you're talking about, Neil.</p><p> It all does seem to be one way.  I guess what's surprising and frankly  disappointing to me is that some of these folks, Strzok in particular, and  Page, that even though they were nominally professionals, that they just  weren't able to put aside their political biases.</p><p> Look, the fact is, is that pretty much everyone in the country harbors  inner thoughts, their own political leanings.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Right. </p><p> DUPREE:  But I think, for most people, and certainly for the vast majority  of people in the FBI historically, they been able to put these biases aside  when it comes to the sacred function of law enforcement.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  But did you share whatever opinion -- we all have opinions.  You  would be vanilla if you didn't.</p><p> But did you -- these were aggressively shared and aggressive opinions at  that.  When you were there, was that -- did you kind of know what your  colleagues felt, whether they were investigating someone or not?  </p><p> DUPREE:  No, not in this way.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Yes.  </p><p> DUPREE:  I think what is unusual about this, Neil, is that these were  political comments they were discussing in the context of an ongoing  political investigation.</p><p> It's not as though they were investigating some bank robber and trading  texts about the presidential election.  I mean, not saying that would be  OK, but that would be very different.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Right. </p><p> DUPREE:  What they were doing here is, they were carrying out  investigations involving the very candidates who were running at the same  time they're engaged in this correspondence about how they can advance  their own political views through their official duties.</p><p> That is where it crossed a line.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Yes.  </p><p> You would just love to get the context for these remarks.  What was going  on?  If it's just hatred, I don't know if that is even better or worse.  </p><p> Tom, good seeing you again, my friend.  Thank you.  </p><p> DUPREE:  Likewise.  Thank you, Neil.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p> How about just eliminating ICE?  </p><p> With all this controversy about separating kids from their parents at the  border, and then now trying to reconnect them with their parents, sometimes  far from the border, maybe just get rid of ICE.  Some people are actually  urging that -- after this.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, groups in protests all around wanting to get rid of  ICE.  </p><p> That's right.  After the separation of these kids from their parents, a lot  of folks saying, you know, the problem isn't these coming into our country.   It's the folks who are trying to keep them out and the way they go about  their business.  So, they're actually saying, get rid of ICE.  Put ICE on  ice, if you will.</p><p> Former ICE agent Claude Arnold on that.</p><p> What do you think of that?  </p><p> CLAUDE ARNOLD, FORMER ICE SPECIAL AGENT:  Well, I -- first of all, people  don't understand the breadth of ICE's mission.  </p><p> Immigration enforcement is half of the mission.  It has an entire  component, homeland security investigations, that investigates all crime  related to the border.  </p><p> It's the investigative arm for all of DHS.  It's the second largest  investigative entity in the U.S. government and it investigates a lot of  things, drug smuggling, human trafficking and smuggling, child pornography,  export of illegal technologies.</p><p> It has a huge national security responsibility.  It's the second largest  representation on the Federal Joint Terrorism Task Force after the FBI.  </p><p> So to say you just need to get rid of ICE, I think people don't understand  all that ICE does.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, a lot of them were saying, right after these apprehensions,  well, does it change and does their mission statement change given on the  administration?  It was this administration that, led by Jeff Sessions,  said, we're going to enforce a policy where we can, yes, separate kids from  their parents, something that wasn't done, at least not the same way  exactly, in the Obama administration.  </p><p> So do you have to pivot depending on the administration?  </p><p> ARNOLD:  Well, I think there was a pivot done on how enforcement was  conducted during the Obama administration.  </p><p> And, really, it's just been a return to the status quo.  But people have  been -- they have developed a sense of entitlement that you can just come  to the country illegally and expecting it's OK. </p><p> CAVUTO:  Oh, no, you're quite right.  People forget how we were  apprehending underage kids and then who were -- drugs deals and all.   You're quite right about that.</p><p> ARNOLD:  Right.  Right.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  But who calls that?  Do you answer then to whatever the  presidential directive is or what?</p><p> ARNOLD:  Yes, of course.  You're part of the executive branch.  </p><p> ICE does what the president tells them to do through the executive chain of  command.  I mean, it's the executive branch.</p><p> CAVUTO:  So, if there were no ICE, to these people's interests, the  protesters, who would handle this border stuff?  </p><p> ARNOLD:  Well, here's the important thing here, Neil.  </p><p> What is going on is, the same people who want ICE abolished, they opposed  there being any wall on the border.  They oppose changing the loopholes  that encourage and allow people to stay in the U.S. illegally.  </p><p> So, the last stand against those who make it in here illegally is ICE.  So  if you get rid of ICE, then you completely have open borders and no  immigration enforcement.  And that's by design.  They want that to happen.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Amazing.  </p><p> All right, Claude Arnold, thank you very much, former ICE agent.  He's put  himself in a lot of harm's way over the years just to deal with that.  </p><p> People should remember that, no matter what your feelings on this  particular issue.  </p><p> We will have more after this.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Thirty seconds away from that deadline.  What is Rod Rosenstein  going to do?  Is he going to give the Republicans what they want?</p><p> Tomorrow, we will get the read on all of this from Republican House  Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte.  He also was one of the fellows  who came up with a plan to settle this immigration mess.  His measure went  nowhere, but that doesn't mean that immigration progress couldn't still  come up somewhere.  </p><p> A one-on-one with probably one of the more powerful players on Capitol Hill  tomorrow, Bob Goodlatte.</p><p> We will see you then.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> QUESTION:  And one more, on trade, and following up on what Blake asked  about Harley-Davidson.  They announced in an SEC filing they're moving a  significant amount of their operations to Europe because of the E.U.  tariffs that were placed on Harley-Davidson motorcycles.  Is this what the  President envisioned for what the impact would be by placing tariffs on the  E.U. and the retaliation the E.U. has put on the U. S.?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Again, the European  Union is trying to punish U.S. workers because they have engaged repeatedly  in unfair trade practices.  And the president is saying enough is enough.   We'd like to work with the E.U. to work on a level playing field. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Sorry, Steve, I did come to you.  Go ahead.  </p><p> QUESTION:  The president today in the Oval Office, sitting next to the king  of Jordan, mentioned some progress in the Middle East peace process, but he  didn't give us any specifics. </p><p> There's been quite a bit of back-channel diplomacy going on the last few  days in the Middle East, with Jared Kushner and Jason Greenblatt.  Do you  have anything concrete to -- to tell us about any sort of positive movement  whatsoever, from all of this? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Again, we -- I think that the meetings that took place  over the last week with Senior Adviser Jared Kushner and Special  Representative Jason Greenblatt, they met with a number of officials and  principals in Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, Israel and Qatar last week. </p><p> They discussed the situation in Gaza as well as the next stages of the  peace effort.  We're going to continue those conversations and we're  committed to the peace effort, and we're going to keep working forward.   But those conversations were productive. </p><p> Julie? </p><p> QUESTION:  Sarah, the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection said  today that they are no longer going to be referring people who cross the  border without authorization for criminal charges if they're traveling with  children, which is essentially a return to the Obama administration  practice and administrations before that.  Does the president support that  approach?  And if so, does he regret trying to push forward on a zero- tolerance approach in the first place? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  No.  The president certainly supports keeping families  together, which he has outlined several times over the last week.  But he's  also called on Congress to actually fix the system. </p><p> They're the only ones that ultimately have the ability to change the law.   The president's executive order has given a temporary solution to the  problem but it's not permanent, and we need Congress to step up.  We need  Democrats to stop playing political games, do their jobs, work with this  president and let's fix the problem at the border. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Jeff? </p><p> QUESTION:  Sarah, can you talk about why you tweeted from your official  account about the episode that you had at the restaurant on Friday night? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Sure.  I was responding to a number of news stories.  I  would been reached out to by over a dozen reporters, and there were  multiple news stories that had already been issued. </p><p> It was considered news of the day, so I responded in the way I would to any  other news of the day story. </p><p> Jeff? </p><p> QUESTION:  Sarah, you said just because you don't see a judge doesn't mean  you don't get due process.  Can you explain what you mean by that  specifically, and how the president envisions that this would work while  still maintaining what the Constitution upholds in having a swift  immigration system? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Again, there are other ways for removal.  There are  thousands of illegal aliens that are removed every month that don't see  judges.  Sometimes that's through voluntary removal, and sometimes that's  through expedited removal. </p><p> Again, the president's ultimate goal would be that we have actually a  secure border, and people aren't coming into the country illegally.  But  that we have a system that works and the people that come into the country  come in through a legal system. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Jill? </p><p> QUESTION:  What is the president doing specifically this week to ensure  that Congress passes a bill?  He's spent all week in Nevada talking about - - or, all weekend.  Excuse me -- on Saturday, talking about how Democrats  want open borders and crime.  But, specifically, has he made phone calls to  Republican members in the House, where the bill is pending?  Has he tried  to bring Democrats together?  What is he doing specifically to try and get  a new law passed, specifically, other than just railing against the current  law? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  The president met with a number of lawmakers last week,  talked with several over the weekend, some that he was with while he was  traveling.  Last week, he made an open invitation to Democrat lawmakers --  that they were welcome to come to the White House to discuss what they'd  like to see, because the president wants solutions. </p><p> We've yet to have any of them to show up, actually willing to have those  conversations, actually willing to fix the problem.  Instead, they'd rather  rant and rave about not allowing members of the Trump administration to  step foot in public. </p><p> The president wants to see solutions.  That's what we're focused on.  It's  Congress's job to do that, and we've laid out very clearly that we want to  be part of that and what we'd like to see in that package. </p><p> Jill? </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> QUESTION:  ... on this? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Clearly, they aren't.  If they haven't passed a law to  fix this system, then they haven't.  Republicans have laid out a number of  proposals that they support.  The president has voiced his support for  those. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> QUESTION:  ... probably fail this week, though.  The Republican bills will  probably...</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  That's because no Democrat will get on board and  actually support a solution. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> QUESTION:  ... Republican -- is your Republicans cannot pass these  Republican bills.  What is the president doing as the leader of the party  to try and get Republican...</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Jeff, these aren't Republican bills.  These are bills  that fix a broken system.  They may have Republican sponsors, but these  should be bipartisan.  This shouldn't be complicated.  Look, the House has  already passed over 500 pieces of legislation, but they can't get through  the Senate because Democrats refuse to actually find solutions. </p><p> We have 50 bills that passed just last week to address the opioid crisis --  that passed through the House.  The Senate still hasn't taken them up.   Hopefully, they will.  And, if they do, that will show that we actually can  come up with bipartisan solutions.  And that's what we'd like to see them  do on immigration, as well. </p><p> Jill? </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> QUESTION:  ... follow-up on Julia's question about the zero-tolerance  policy.  The president said, last week, after signing the executive order,  that he believed that zero tolerance was still important.  You guys made a  point of the fact that the E. O.  did not actually get rid of the policy. </p><p> How does that square with the fact that CBP is now saying that they are no  longer referring for prosecution any adults who come in with children? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Again, this is a temporary solution.  This isn't going  to last.  Congress still has to step up.  They still have to do their job.   This will only last a short amount of time because we're going to run out  of space, we're going to run out of resources in order to keep people  together, and we're asking Congress to provide those resources and do their  job.  And...</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> QUESTION:  ... temporary solution -- does that mean, at some point, you are  going to change that policy back? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  We're not changing the policy.  We're simply out of  resources, and, at some point, Congress has to do what they were elected to  do, and that is secure our border.  That is stop the crime coming into our  country. </p><p> The country has made extremely clear that they don't want open borders, and  Democrats need to understand that, and they need to work with Republicans  and find some solutions. </p><p> QUESTION:  And there...</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Annie.  Sorry, Jill, I'm going to keep going.  Annie, go  ahead. </p><p> QUESTION:  Sarah, you mentioned the state of resources and running out of  them.  Can you be specific about what the resources are right now for  housing parents and children together?  Is there enough housing right now?   Is the Pentagon stepping in?  Like, what's being done about the resources?  </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Again, we're looking at every option available.  We have  asked the Pentagon to help with additional space.  But a lot of that will  depend on our ability to stop people coming into the country illegally.   And we, again, encourage people to go through ports of entry instead of  crossing the border illegally. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  We've requested, through legislation -- we're working  with Congress, hopefully, to provide more resources and the ability to  actually enforce the law. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Ayesha? </p><p> QUESTION:  Thank you.  I just want to see if you can kind of narrow down  exactly what the president actually intends to do when it comes to this  idea of not having judges.  You say that there are instances where people  don't have judges, but my understanding is that, if you do ask for asylum,  you do have certain rights. </p><p> So is there going to be a change in that policy, or what is this  administration planning to do to make it so you don't have to see a judge?   (INAUDIBLE)  </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Again, I have addressed this a couple times.  There are  multiple instances in where you wouldn't:  voluntary removal, certain cases  have expedited removal.  If somebody comes through a port of entry seeking  asylum, those cases and that process will be heard.  But at the same time,  the president's ultimate goal is to secure the border and stop illegal  immigration. </p><p> QUESTION:  I -- I -- I understand that, but so what does that mean  practically?  Like, is the president planning to do anything differently,  or are you just saying, you don't like the way (INAUDIBLE) now? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  The president's laid out what he'd like to see.  We've  put out the things that we want to see in an immigration package months  ago.  We're still waiting on Congress to give us the ability to do that. </p><p> QUESTION:  So -- so unless Congress acts, nothing is actually going to  change?  The administration is not changing anything right now, when it  comes to judges? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  You mean, are we walking around making up laws?  No,  because we're not the Obama administration.  We're actually trying to  enforce the laws that are on the books.  We're actually asking Congress to  do their part in the process, and pass new legislation that will fix our  immigration system. </p><p> QUESTION:  So -- but nothing is actually changing on the ground.  Like,  this -- so this is -- the president's complaining about judges, and saying  that we shouldn't have all these judges, and people who come over should  just be put out, but nothing is actually going to change.  He's just saying  -- he's just complaining about the process as it stands now. </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Things that we have the ability to do administratively,  we are working to do.  But again, Congress is the only one that has the  ability to write law, and we hope they'll do that. </p><p> Steve? </p><p> QUESTION:  I'm honing in on that point.  I'm trying to understand what it  is the president understands about the current policy, because as you've  explained, expedited removal allows the government to remove hundreds of  thousands of illegal immigrants a year without seeing judges.  Did the  president know that when he issued the tweets? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Yeah, but there are still thousands that go through a  very lengthy process.  We'd like to see the process consolidated.  We'd  like to see the backlog stopped.  We'd like to see our border secured. </p><p> Sorry, Steve, I'm going to keep going. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> QUESTION:  Under current law there are a couple of things that the  president could do.  You could expand that policy.  You've said that he  would like to see more expedited removal.  Does the president intend to  expand it to the full two-year limit under the current statute? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Again, we would like to see more expedited removal, but  ultimately, we would like to see the border secured and people stop coming  into the country illegally.  That seems pretty simple to me, and it would  stop a lot of the problems, and would eliminate the need for so many of  these additional laws. </p><p> QUESTION:  Thanks, Sarah.  The gal in the briefing talking about the  importance of civility.  Do you consider it a civil policy to separate more  than two thirds of the children from their parents? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  We consider enforcing the law the role that the  administration has to play.  Certainly, the president has taken an  executive action to the furthest that he has the ability to do to minimize  the separation of families.  We're working hard to make sure families get  to stay together, and we're calling on Congress to help us in that effort,  and we're continuing to focus on the reunification, and making sure that  the families, again, stay together, and that Congress will give us a  permanent solution to fix that. </p><p> QUESTION:  But you say that you're working to make families stay together.   It was your administration that separated them in the first place. </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  It wasn't our administration that created these laws,  but it is our administration's job to enforce it, and we've done that.  If  someone breaks the law, it's our job to enforce it.  If somebody doesn't  like the law, then they need to lobby Congress and ask them to change it.  </p><p> Anita. </p><p> QUESTION:  I have, one, an immigration question, and wanted to clarify one  thing.  So I understand that not every adult with a child is going to be  prosecuted.  If there are families that are being held together, detained  together somewhere and 20 days goes by, what is going to happen then?  I  didn't get an -- an answer with that last week.  I don't understand.  The  law says you can't keep them together, keep the children, even with parents  for longer than 20 days.  So then what happens? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Hopefully, Congress will pass the law and fix the  problem. </p><p> QUESTION:  (INAUDIBLE) 20 days? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Well, why should it be so hard?  They all say that they  don't want to separate families.  Seems like it should be pretty simple to  me. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  John? </p><p> QUESTION:  I said I had a clarification...</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Go ahead. </p><p> QUESTION:  ... so Jeff asked you a question about Congress and the bill.   Were you, in your response, referring to just a stand-alone bill that deals  with family separation, or were you referring to the bigger immigration  bill that the House hopes to take up this week? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Our preference would be a bill that addresses all of the  pillars that we've laid out, that we'd like to see addressed in an  immigration package.  And that's what our focus is right now, is there's a  bill that does that on the table. </p><p> If that doesn't happen, then we'll talk about other pieces of legislation  at that point. </p><p> QUESTION:  (INAUDIBLE) the president still wants that bill to go forward  even though he said...</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Certain...</p><p> QUESTION:  ... they don't want to -- he -- they shouldn't waste their time  on it? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Look, Democrats in the Senate have made clear they're  not going to support this.  </p><p> And because we need at least some Democrats to get on board, they've made  it very clear that they don't want to work with the president, that they  don't want to fix our immigration system.  That they'd rather have open  borders and rampant crime than work with the president to create solutions.   Until they change their mind, we're going to continue looking at the best  ways that we can fix these problems but we need Congress to help us. </p><p> John. </p><p> QUESTION:  Thank you, Sarah.  This president is the first in the television  age who has yet to address the American public on nationwide television  from the Oval Office.  Many Republican consultants have said that he might  have a stronger hand in influencing Congress if he made a nationally  televised address on immigration and what changes he'd like to see, to  explain it. </p><p> Is that something that's on the table within the administration? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Certainly don't want to take anything off the table, or  any tool away from the president.  He does address the American people in a  number of different venues and formats.  And I will certainly pass along  that suggestion to him. </p><p> Nadia. </p><p> QUESTION:  Just a follow-up on the Middle East.  In the recent (INAUDIBLE)  Mr. Kushner said that if President Abbas is not willing to negotiate, he's  going to proceed with the deal.  Can you explain how the White House is  hoping to achieve any progress in the Middle East peace talks if the  principal party is not taking part in it? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  We're going to continue meeting with the other partners  in the region.  And, again, we're going to continue pushing forward in the  peace process.  We had productive meetings over the last week.  We're going  to continue those conversations. </p><p> I will take one last question.  Saagar.  </p><p> QUESTION:  Thanks, Sarah.  </p><p> To follow up on the judges -- on the issue of immigration judges, why is  the President so opposed to an increase in the number of immigration judges  when it would expedite the asylum processing -- the asylum process and  expedite deportation?  </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  We're not opposed to the speeding up the process.  What  the President would like to see, once again, is that we stop the problem at  the very beginning.  He'd like to see us secure the border and people work  through the system, through the ports of entry, so that we're not dealing  with things on the back end.  </p><p> We'd like to stop the problem before it starts, and that's what the  president's focus has been all along, is on securing the border.  And  that's what we're going to continue to do.  </p><p> Thanks so much guys.  Have a great day.  </p><p> NEIL CAVUTO, HOST:  All right, you have been listening to Sarah Sanders  here.</p><p> And it's safe to say the Washington press corps is more concerned with the  immigration issue than a lot of folks losing their shirts today on this  whole trade issue.  </p><p> Welcome, everybody.  I'm Neil Cavuto.  And you're watching \"Your World.\"</p><p> And it could have worse.  As I show you the Dow today down about 328  points, we had been down almost 500 points, and a lot of that over a  building trade war and concerns this could get worse before it gets better,  or that there are no signs of concessions on the part of any of the  principal parties, namely the Chinese and ourselves.  </p><p> All of this on the same day that Harley-Davidson was indicating, because of  these threat of tariffs, they're moving a lot of their operations outside  the U.S.</p><p> On a separate issue, General Motors has indicated that a lot of its Chevy  Blazers will now be made in Mexico, not citing just the trade issue,  but  that it's not welcome noise here.</p><p> So, again, this could have a lot been worse.  There was some confusion  early on in the markets as to whether the administration was also  recommending that they were urging the Chinese and others not to invest in  technology stocks at all.  </p><p> Then Peter Navarro ends up popping up on CNBC to say, no, no, no, no, no,  they're not going to be, nor are there plans in the works for investment  restrictions on China.</p><p> And that brought us down to the levels we're at right now, about 328 points  southward on what was a crazy day on the markets.</p><p> We're going to be at this from all angles right now.</p><p> Let's first go to FOX Business Network's Deirdre Bolton with how it all  sorted out.</p><p> Hey, Deirdre.</p><p> DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, Neil.  </p><p> You said it.  It could have been much worse.  So, the markets did close  clearly lower, but certainly off the low points of the day.  And, of  course, the big headline, the Trump administration moving to block Chinese  companies from investing in U.S. tech firms and moving to block additional  tech exports from the U.S. to China.  </p><p> Our sources are saying the Treasury Department is going to make an official  announcement at the end of this week, bring us more clarity, more details  on the plan.  </p><p> Now, the level of difficulty is, of course, much higher when you start to  talk about blocking investment than when we're just engaging in tariff  spats.  So the stock market heading for the biggest one-day slide in  months.  </p><p> That's how we finished up.  You can see red across the screen.  One area I  really wanted to highlight are the techs, because S&amp;P 500 tech companies  get about 60 percent of their revenue from overseas.  So that's the highest  foreign exposure out of any of the index's 11 sectors.  </p><p> And, of course,critics of our current trade policy say that China has been  stealing anywhere between $30 billion and $50 billion worth of intellectual  property, hard data, every year for the past decade.  But then there was  even a stronger report, a more recent one that came out from the Commission  on the Theft of American Intellectual Property.</p><p> It has a much higher number, stating that up to $600 billion in theft that  has some projections baked in is possible.  But experts say, bottom line,  the motivation to want to level the playing field is completely  understandable.  </p><p> What gets complicated is that so many American businesses are  interconnected.  So, for example, here's seven big tech American companies  that source half of their products and components from China.  </p><p> So, HP, IBM, Dell, Cisco, Unisys, Microsoft, Intel.  Even Apple has sold  more iPhones in China in the last three years than in the U.S.  And Apple  gets about 20 percent of its annual revenue from China.  </p><p> Now, the Chinese president of course says China will punch back and will  not be forced to eat the bitter fruit.  That is a translation, a direct  quote.  </p><p> But as the tension rises between the world's two biggest economies, of  course, investors really showed their anxiety.  So, we had the Nasdaq, you  can see there, closely lower, essentially 2 percent, biggest one-day  percentage decline since March.  Third day down in a row.  So, that's the  longest losing streak for that tech-heavy comp in about two months' time.</p><p> Even Asia overnight, you can see how markets reacted there.  You can see  Hong Kong's Hang Seng down by more than 1 percent.  And, then, of course,  even on our own bond market, right, there was this flight to safety in U.S.  10-year.  Investors typically, of course, buy these bonds when they're  fearful or they feel less certain of the future.  </p><p> And prices really went up, so, therefore, those yields went down, settling  2.875 percent.  And just worth noting, these yields have fallen basically  for the past four out of five weeks.  </p><p> So, Neil, what is clear is, investors really don't know what to make of it.   We have the tariffs and now we have this idea of blocking direct  investment, which is a much more muscular and, quite frankly, threatening  move than tariffs, which really only apply to very specific products, Neil.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Absolutely, especially when they go back and forth either way.</p><p> BOLTON:  Yes.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Thank you very, very much, Deirdre Bolton.</p><p> BOLTON:  Sure.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Doesn't Harley-Davidson know that?  Not so much on the tariffs  we're considering, but the response that company is getting and opting to  do something that the president probably didn't envision.  </p><p>FOX Business Network's Jeff Flock in Countryside, Illinois.  </p><p> What did they do?  </p><p> JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  They're getting a double  whammy at Harley-Davidson, Neil, because the steel and aluminum tariffs hit  their raw materials costs.</p><p> And now the European Union, of course, imposing an addition 25 percent  tariff on motorcycles made here and shipped to Europe.</p><p> And so Harley is in a tough spot.  That tariff went from 6 percent to 31  percent.  And today, in a regulatory filing, Harley said that is going to  add more than $2,000 a bike to the cost of a motorcycle made here in the  U.S. and sold in Europe.  And they can't possibly pass that along to  consumers.</p><p> So, in the short-term, they're going to have to eat it.  In the long term,  they're going to move production away from the U.S.  Europe was an  expanding market for Harley-Davidson.  They love it over there.  And U.S.  sales have been down.</p><p> You look at the first quarter of this year, U.S. sales of Harleys down  double digits, as guys like me get older and maybe give up their  motorcycles.  In Europe, it had been growing by about 7 percent.  </p><p> And so those bikes, made in the U.S. and shipped to Europe, will be no  more.  Harley has four plants here in the U.S., York, Pennsylvania, Kansas  City, Missouri, and two in their home state of Wisconsin, and now  apparently bikes destined for Europe will not be made there anymore.</p><p> Instead, they will be made in places like Brazil and elsewhere, Thailand  and Australia.  This is not, as you pointed out at the outset, what the  president had intended.  His trade policies designed to keep and create  jobs here in the U.S.  In this case, it appears they will be eliminating  them -- Neil.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Amazing.</p><p> All right, Jeff Flock, thank you very, very much.  </p><p> All right, Mattie Duppler is.  We have got Charles Payne here, Larry Shover  here as well of SFG, alternate CME trader as well.  </p><p> Charles Payne, what is going on here?  We knew the trade thing was getting  antsy, but it seemed like the bottom fell out.  </p><p> CHARLES PAYNE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  It did, but because I think this had  a little bit of a different twist.</p><p> This was investment.  This is about -- the whole thing, by the way, is  centered on made in China 2025.  The administration, which I wish they  would articulate what they're trying to do, because I understand, and I  think most -- a lot of people do -- and it's the idea of curbing this  ambition, the stated ambition by China to sort of be the world's tech  leader in a short period of time.</p><p> And one way to get there, perhaps the only way they can get their with  their own timeline, is to continue to steal our intellectual property.</p><p> So the idea is to restrict investments from companies where China has a 25  percent or more ownership.  And, again, this was just speculation.  It was  in a few media outlets, the White House trying to take -- take it back a  little bit.  It's something obviously that they have toyed around with.</p><p> Peter Navarro has talked about this kind of thing for maybe two decades, so  this is not necessarily news, per se.  But it is -- it is a different  twist, to your point.  It's not -- it's not the trade stuff anymore, as  much as it is, hey, we want to take direct aim at your ambitions to usurp  America's perch as the world's tech leader.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, Larry, what worried a lot in the markets is that, all of a  sudden, then we were putting a general wall up on Chinese investment in  general and technology period.  </p><p> That's how it was interpreted.  And then, later on, the treasury secretary,  Mnuchin, came out to say, no, no, no, it wasn't singling out China, as if  to say there's other players here, as if that eased the angst.  </p><p> It actually compounded that.  But what do you make of that?  </p><p> LARRY SHOVER, SOLUTIONS FUNDS GROUP:  Well, what I make of it is that two  things.</p><p> The whole thing lacked clarity.  Like, it didn't matter.  Like, this whole  China tweets and tirades, it didn't matter because it lacked clarity.  It  seemed like the White House is utterly unprepared to create any kind of  proposal that can go into law.</p><p> Immigration policy is a good proof of that.  Also, it lacks credibility,  because we all know -- I mean, this does -- this hurts us more than it  hurts them, the fact that it's going to kill Apple or Nike.  It really,  really hurt them manufacturing their goods there that are sent to us.</p><p> So it doesn't make any sense.  People dismissed it.  And I really think  people are definitely blaming the China trade today.  The bigger problem,  though, it's really tech.  We saw that breaking down last week.</p><p> Leadership has been very thin in the stock market.  Without five or six  super cap techs in the S&amp;P 500...</p><p> CAVUTO:  Yes.  </p><p> SHOVER:  ... we would be down 4 percent, instead of up 1.5 percent.</p><p> But it started to crack.  The Supreme Court came out last week with a  ruling on sales tax, et cetera.  That chasm between growth and value has  been very, very wide.  The market is vulnerable.  The ball will always find  you when you're out of position.</p><p> And that's really what happened today.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  And people were a little anxious on that investment angle here and  maybe finding an excuse for technology, which ran up far and fast, to sell  off some of it.</p><p> But, Mattie, it's sort of this impression that not everyone in the  administration seems to be on the same page.  I'm getting different vibes  from the Treasury secretary, different vibes from their trade  representatives, different vibes from the president.</p><p> MATTIE DUPPLER, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S FORUM:  Right.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  And I think that's the kind of thing that scares markets.  </p><p> DUPPLER:  Oh, absolutely.</p><p> You finally have consensus on this panel, Neil.  And that's, what the heck  is the administration intending to do with these trade efforts?</p><p> Charles and I don't always agree on this issue, but right now we're both  wondering, what is the objective here?  And that's what the administration  needs to clarify.  It needs to make clear what it intends to do with all of  these efforts towards China.</p><p> Now, if the objective here is to exact the most amount of pain and pressure  on China possible, they need to make sure that they're not injecting pain  on American businesses.  And that's a concern, especially when you look at  really artificially diminishing the amount of capital that can come into  this country.</p><p> I worry about the impact on businesses.  And that's not even getting to  what tariffs are doing to American businesses, where we have already seen  some of those announcements this week.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Or even the threat of them.</p><p> But, Charles, the other thing you mentioned -- and this -- you can help me  out here.  It's always been that the Chinese are in bad shape here.   They're at two-year-plus lows in their market.  They have a lot more to  lose than we do.</p><p> But they also have their pride, and they're not giving any ground.  So, how  is this resolved, if it is?</p><p> PAYNE:  And this is where I disagree with Larry.  </p><p> I don't think -- I think a lot of people are raising the white flag so  quickly that China is going to beat us at this.  They're not.  If it has to  go the whole way... </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  The whole way could be years.  </p><p> PAYNE:  Yes, Sure.</p><p> Mattie makes the right point.  It's sort of like when my pops used to take  me out in the back.  He says, it's going to hurt me as much as it hurts  you.  </p><p> No, it won't.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> PAYNE:  With that being said, let's look at what China did today, this  morning.  </p><p> Their central bank freed up banks over there to the tune of $100 billion.   Right?  This is to sort of...</p><p> CAVUTO:  It needs a stimulant.</p><p> PAYNE:  ... to do things thing on debt.  </p><p> Last week, it was $30 billion.  A week before that, it was $30 billion.   Their foreign and reserve currencies have dropped a trillion dollars.  </p><p> Their debt-to-GDP ratio is on its way to 300 percent.  We aren't going to  lose this.  China knows we're not going to lose this.  Nobody wants to  lose.  It's a matter of how, to your point, do you save face and resolve  it?</p><p> CAVUTO:  I think that's where we are.  </p><p> Larry, the Chinese, remember, today indicating, you know, we don't just  turn a cheek on this.  And we come back and we're going to fight back.  </p><p> Now, to be clear, no response to the tariffs yet with tariffs of their own.   In other words, to increase the amount to match the United States, when we  promised we would put $200 billion on top of that.</p><p> Some read into that a sign that the Chinese are trying to find a middle  ground here, where they can talk tough, but they don't have to respond in  kind and invite a war.  What do you see?  </p><p> SHOVER:  Yes.</p><p> Well, I see that they have already done that, just what we said.  Required  reserve ratio dropped 50 basis points yesterday, adding all that liquidity  into the market.  What did that do?  That dropped RMB by 1.5 percent in  five days, 3.5 percent over the last month.  </p><p> So they're already ready.  That is going to negate any kind of trade tariff  that we are going to impose.  And I think they know, at the end of the day,  that there's so lack of clarity coming out of the White House, that they're  just preparing for it.  </p><p> Also realizing that they have had a real soft patch of data coming in.  So,  perhaps Trump is trying to hit them while they're weak.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  We will see.</p><p> All right, guys, I apologize jumping on you.  We have got a lot of breaking  news here.  </p><p> I do want to bring in my next guest, the former Heinz CEO Bill Johnson, a  global read of things, if ever there were one.  </p><p> And, Bill, I'm looking at this and wondering what the signals could be for  us.  If a company, one after the other, like GM considering making all its  Blazers now in Mexico, and, of course, we have been talking about a number  of other companies that have been doing the same or considering preemptive  move like Harley-Davidson, that has got to have a domestic economic impact.</p><p> BILL JOHNSON, FORMER CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, H.J. HEINZ COMPANY:  It should, Neil.  </p><p> Nothing has happened yet to impact the economy here.  And, frankly, the  Chinese and European economies...</p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, they're already leaving.  Those guys are already making some  moves.  </p><p> JOHNSON:  I understand.  But they're more vulnerable than we are.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  True.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Having said that, this is like tic-tac-toe.  Nobody wins.  </p><p> I play tic-tac-toe with any grandkids.  And you never win.  And that's what  this is now.  We have gotten to the point on this situation...</p><p> CAVUTO:  You never won at tic-tac-toe with your grandkids?  </p><p> JOHNSON:  No.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  You're one of the most celebrated CEOs ever.  And... </p><p> JOHNSON:  Yes.  That just shows you nobody wins, Neil.  And that's where we  are right now.  Nobody wins.</p><p> CAVUTO:  So, that's where you see -- that's where we are right now?</p><p> JOHNSON:  I do think that's where we are.</p><p> I think this created a huge environment of uncertainty.  You and I have had  this conversation many times.  Uncertainty leads to volatility.  Volatility  leads to more uncertainty.  And we get in this vicious cycle.  </p><p> And I think that's where we are now.  Having said that, I think,  ultimately, saner and cooler heads will prevail, and this will somehow get  resolved.  </p><p> I hope this is not a negotiation ploy, because it's rather ham-fisted.  And  there has got to be better ways to attack this issue than the one that is  being generated right now.</p><p> CAVUTO:  What do you make -- I think it was ratcheted up a little bit today  to go after in this case the Chinese for investing in technology.</p><p> It was read as, we're not going to allow them to invest in any technology  companies.  And that might have been a prematurely wrong impression.  But  that was the one that was out there for hours in the markets.  They had to  dial that back a little bit.</p><p> But they're still looking at putting a limit to who can invest in  technology.  That's how it interpreted, hence, technology falls off a lot.   So if this is more from just goods and services to, I don't know, even  companies and stocks you invest in, then what?  </p><p> JOHNSON:  Well, then I think we have chaos, Neil. </p><p> I don't think you can stop the investment in a capitalist society.  It's  just the way the system works.  And while I understand why the  administration is going after some of these issues -- and they're sort of  going where people have been afraid to tread before -- the reality is, we  have to have some clarity in the communication of the purpose of what we're  trying to achieve and then take a step-by-step process in which to achieve  it.  </p><p> And I heard about the investment situation this morning.  Then I saw  Secretary Mnuchin's response.  And so I'm completely unclear as to what is  happening.  And there we go again.  That creates more uncertainty, which  creates more volatility, and leaves us all in the dark about what it is  we're trying to achieve.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Now, there used to be an old rule here following this president  the last 18 months that those who doubted him would be proven wrong, and  that everything ends up OK and markets come back from what look like  debacles, and people who second-guessed him have been proven wrong.  </p><p> So there was this now new -- or renewed trust that President Trump must  know what he's doing, there's a method to all of this.  </p><p> Do you subscribe to that, or is there now a reassessment, well, maybe not.   Maybe this is a little impulsive.  Maybe there's not a method to the  madness.  Maybe it's just madness.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Well, I think, historically, over his last 18 months in office,  he's done a pretty good job of bringing us back from the brink and  achieving great success.  </p><p>North Korea seems to be an example of one of those areas.  But I don't  know.  I don't like this whole approach, Neil.  I think it's so ham-fisted  and so unpredictable that sometimes you create a fire out of a smoke bomb,  and the next thing you know, you have got a real conflagration going, and  you don't know how to put it out.  And that -- I'm worried we're headed  that way.</p><p> Having said that, I will give him credit for again treading in these places  that need to be addressed.  I just think there's better ways to do it.  But  I'm not yet ready to say that we're just going to pull this one back from  the brink and everyone is going to be happy.  </p><p> I just don't know.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  We shall see, my friend.  Thank you very, very much.  </p><p> Good luck in your next tic-tac-toe game.  I give the edge to you still.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> JOHNSON:  Thank you.  Thank you.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  William Johnson, the former Heinz CEO, if anyone knows the global  landscape, it is he.  All right. </p><p> All right, when we come back here, this nastiness with Democrats saying  that we're going to get nasty no matter where Republicans gather.  </p><p> Really?  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Yikes, 25 minutes, right, a 5:00 p.m. deadline staring down now,  as House Republicans want documents from the Justice Department on that  Clinton e-mail probe and the Russian investigation.  Then what happens if  they don't get them?  </p><p> After this.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. MAXINE WATERS (D), CALIFORNIA:  And if you see anybody from that  Cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you  get out and you create a crowd.  </p><p> (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)</p><p> WATERS:  And you push back on them.  And you tell them they're not welcome.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, anyway, American Majority CEO Ned Ryun.  We have got Olympic  Media managing editor Katie Frates and Democratic strategist Christy  Setzer.</p><p> I don't know where to begin.  But, Katie, maybe you can help me with this.  </p><p> This is out of control.  This is just crazy talk.  What do you make of it?  </p><p> KATIE FRATES, OLYMPIC MEDIA:  It absolutely is.  </p><p> This is just going way too far, because she doesn't even know who she is  speaking to, Maxine Waters, when she is saying this.  What if someone sees  somebody at a gas station and takes it way too far?  </p><p> You're essentially encouraging anyone of any mental state, of any level of  discourse, to go up and potentially harm someone else because of their  political beliefs.  That's absolutely not OK.  </p><p> I'm so excited and happy to see at least Nancy Pelosi push back on this.   I'm not sure why more Democratic leaders are not speaking up and condemning  this.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, there were a good number.  To be fair, there were a good  number, Elijah Cummings and all saying...</p><p> FRATES:  Good.  Good.</p><p> CAVUTO:  ... that, even when it came to the Sanders situation, she  shouldn't have been taken out of the restaurant.  </p><p> But, Ned, I'm worried more about the increasing vitriol.  And we're seeing  more and more of it.  And anything could happen in that environment.</p><p> NED RYUN, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN MAJORITY:  No.</p><p> And I think really what we're seeing is, to sum up Charles Krauthammer, we  conservatives, we think the left is philosophically misguided, and many on  the left think we're evil.  </p><p> And I think you're seeing this rhetoric ramp up where borders are now  bigotry and American presidents standing up for the America taxpayer, well,  this is Nazism and the second coming of the Holocaust.  </p><p> And I think what the left is trying to do is say, the debate is over in our  minds because we consider your ideas to be irrational.  We don't consider  your ideas to be legitimate.  </p><p> And if they can dehumanize the other side, that's what they want to do,  because that justifies driving opposing thought from the public square.  </p><p> The thing that troubles me, Neil, about all of this, this kind of  incitement to physical intimidation and bullying is not to be normalized.   It's not normal for a constitutional republic.  It's only normal in banana  republics.  And if the left wants to beat us, try doing it at the ballot  box in 2018 and 2020.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Do you worry about that, Christy?  </p><p> As a Democratic strategist, and a darn good one, and a very calm person, I  might point out, that your party could be ruining it for itself, that it's  actually scaring some people with that kind of talk, whether you agree or  disagree with the politics behind it.  </p><p> CHRISTY SETZER, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  I just think it's impossible to put  Maxine Waters' comments like this in a vacuum like this.</p><p> The defining feature of Donald Trump's campaign was not that he was going  to shake stuff up in Washington or that he was a great businessman.  It was  this incivility.  Right?  </p><p> He started talking about how, I like people that were not captured about  John McCain.  Then you looked as his rallies, where they were filled with  him actively asking them to take violence against protesters.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  If that is what your view is, do you think that the response,  responding in kind, then, if that's your view, is justified?</p><p> SETZER:  I don't think that -- no, I don't think that we have responded in  kind.  </p><p> I think that Democrats are saying, look, we need to make it just a little  bit uncomfortable.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  You have got whole groups that target a homeland security  secretary at a restaurant.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> SETZER:  No, no, no, no.  Not with violence, Neil.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> SETZER:  That's an extraordinarily important difference.  Not with  violence.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Please listen to me.  </p><p> Sarah Sanders, her incident, Secretary Nielsen outside her home and in a  restaurant, then Maxine Waters justifying it.  I could go on to talk about  Florida's Pam Bondi and what she dealt with at a movie.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> CAVUTO:  Stephen Miller and be called a fascist while he's out.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> SETZER:  Protest is a healthy part of the American tradition, not violence,  not violence.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  You're fine with this.  You're fine with it.  </p><p> But if it were done in reverse, you wouldn't be fine with it.</p><p> SETZER:  I would be absolutely fine with it.  I would be fine with it,  because, again, protest is absolutely fine.</p><p> What is not fine...</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  You just said when you didn't like it what Donald Trump and his  people were doing the same.  </p><p> SETZER:  I'm sorry?</p><p> CAVUTO:  You didn't like it when Donald Trump was doing that.</p><p> SETZER:  No.  What Donald Trump was saying was, I want that guy to be taken  out on a stretcher.  What Donald Trump was doing was actually what Ned Ryun  was just talking about right now, which is dehumanizing the other side.</p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, I don't get it.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  All right.  OK.</p><p> Mattie, do you believe that this is going too far?  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> SETZER:  By talking about how they're animals and infesting America.</p><p> CAVUTO:  I understand.  I heard you.</p><p> SETZER:  That's very different.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Mattie, has this gone too far?  Mattie, you're in awe, aren't you?  </p><p> FRATES:  Yes, yes.  Absolutely, it is.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Katie, I apologize.  I apologize.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  See that?  I lose my place, because I get so wrapped up in it.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Is it your sense that this gets worse, though?  Are you getting a  sense it gets worse?</p><p> FRATES:  So, this is the problem.  </p><p> It's that this is escalating rhetoric.  You're essentially saying mob  someone outside of a gas station.  </p><p> RYUN:  Exactly.  </p><p> FRATES:  And, again, you don't know the intentions of the person who may  then go on to do that.  </p><p> So what if someone is attacked?  What if something violent happens?  And  then you turn around and you say, well, Maxine Waters was telling people to  do that.  It's not a good idea and it's not a healthy dialogue.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> SETZER:  Do we remember the Pizzagate conspiracy, how a crazy conspiracy  actually led someone to take a gun to my, my local pizza place, actually,  and try to shoot it up because they had heard this crazy idea on the  Internet and by Alex Jones and others that Hillary Clinton and John Podesta  were up to no good?  </p><p> That led to actual violence.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, I don't want to get in a tit for tat.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  I sometimes feel like I'm separating my teenage sons.  </p><p> But, Ned Ryun, I do know this.  We have all got to bring the octane down a  little bit on all sides here.  </p><p> RYUN:  We do.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  But how do we do that?  </p><p> And should it be incumbent people to just to say, there has got to be a  better way?  Whether the Elijah Cummings approach, this has got to stop,  whether Sarah Sanders' approach, I just politely up and left, and I tried  not to make a big deal of it at the scene, what is it?  What is the answer?</p><p> RYUN:  No.  I think we have got to start policing our own.  We have to  start policing ourselves on the right and the left.  </p><p> And I was encouraged by Nancy Pelosi saying that Maxine Waters' statement  was unacceptable.  I think we have to be honest about it on the right, too,  when we see unacceptable statements.  And I have said this again -- I have  said this before.  I will say it again.  </p><p> When Donald Trump -- I love 85 to 90 percent of his Twitter feed.  When he  is talking about bloody face-lift, you will never me defend that.  I want  him to focus on the positives and policy and all these things.</p><p> When it becomes personal, I think we need to call out our side and say,  this is not how we have more civil discourse in the public arena.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Fully agree.  Fully agree.  </p><p> At our core, guys, we're all human beings.  </p><p> RYUN:  We're all Americans.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  And we can agree to disagree.  But we don't have to be asses in  the process.  </p><p> And none of you are, by the way.  </p><p> But I want to thank you all very, very much.</p><p> And, Katie, I apologize.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> FRATES:  No, no apology needed.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  I get so apoplectic.  And I don't even know why.  And it's not  even dinnertime.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, by the way, we're close to the witching hour, 5:00 p.m.  Eastern time, that document deadline.  But right now there's indications  the people who have put out that deadline aren't going to get the response  they want in time for that deadline.  </p><p> Then what?  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right.  Between a deadline coming up in about 15 minutes from  now and, of course, this is the week we're going to see some big testimony  up on Capitol Hill, much of it is behind closed doors.</p><p> Let's get the read from former Justice Department official Tom Dupree.  </p><p> Tom, what is the biggest thing you're waiting for?  </p><p> TOM DUPREE, FORMER JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:  Well, the biggest thing  I'm waiting for in the short-term is whether the Justice Department  complies with the congressional demands.  </p><p> As you point out, the clock is ticking.  They have a document deadline,  production deadline at 5:00 p.m. this afternoon.  We will see if they turn  over what they're expected to turn over.  My guess is that they are not  going to satisfy the demands of the House Republicans.</p><p> And I think we are going to see this dispute continue to escalate in the  days ahead.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, then they would want to take even aggressive action  against Rod Rosenstein.  Right?  What would it be?  </p><p> DUPREE:  Well, let's see.</p><p> They have got a wide variety of means at their disposal.  At one end of the  spectrum is just the continued drumbeat of public criticism.  They can amp  that up several ways.</p><p> One thing they could do is, they could issue subpoenas.  Another thing they  could do is, they could actually instigate contempt proceedings.  And then  at the extreme end of the other spectrum, it would be impeachment  proceedings.</p><p> I'm hopeful that they're not going to go there and that cooler heads will  prevail and they be able to sit down and work all of this out before we get  to that point.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Where is all of this going?  </p><p> I mean, especially with the Peter Strzok testimony later on, are they more  interested in his case, finding out what he knew and what was the backdrop  for his comments he was making about then candidate Trump, or what?  </p><p> DUPREE:  Yes.  I think that's a lot of what was going on.</p><p> I mean, I think right now, from the perspective of Congress, there was so  much that was going on behind the scenes in 2016 that Congress wants to  know, what was your reason for doing this?  What was your reason for  handling the investigations the way you did? What was the reason for  getting these wiretaps and for conducting the surveillance?</p><p> Were you using an informant?  Was it a spy, that sort of thing?  And the  fact is, DOJ is not in the business normally of turning over documents.   And so I think, institutionally, there's a huge amount of reluctance to  give Congress what it wants.</p><p> But Congress is beating the drum.  They're on the warpath.  They're trying  to fulfill their oversight function here.  And so I think we have a real  collision that's not in any -- is not going to be sorted out in the near  term.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  When I have looked at a lot of the comments from those identified,  like Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, and these other unidentified individuals,  and then, of course, now I know how James Comey felt about then candidate  Trump and how Andy McCabe felt, his number two.</p><p> I have not run across one piece of evidence to show a pro-Trump person or  someone who was biased to like -- to like Donald Trump.  Now, I might have  missed it.  But, again, doesn't this feed the narrative that that was a  stacked deck, because that certainly that stacked deck mantle has been  claimed by a lot of Republicans that they were out to get him?</p><p> DUPREE:  Yes, I certainly haven't seen anything along the lines of what  you're talking about, Neil.</p><p> It all does seem to be one way.  I guess what's surprising and frankly  disappointing to me is that some of these folks, Strzok in particular, and  Page, that even though they were nominally professionals, that they just  weren't able to put aside their political biases.</p><p> Look, the fact is, is that pretty much everyone in the country harbors  inner thoughts, their own political leanings.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Right. </p><p> DUPREE:  But I think, for most people, and certainly for the vast majority  of people in the FBI historically, they been able to put these biases aside  when it comes to the sacred function of law enforcement.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  But did you share whatever opinion -- we all have opinions.  You  would be vanilla if you didn't.</p><p> But did you -- these were aggressively shared and aggressive opinions at  that.  When you were there, was that -- did you kind of know what your  colleagues felt, whether they were investigating someone or not?  </p><p> DUPREE:  No, not in this way.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Yes.  </p><p> DUPREE:  I think what is unusual about this, Neil, is that these were  political comments they were discussing in the context of an ongoing  political investigation.</p><p> It's not as though they were investigating some bank robber and trading  texts about the presidential election.  I mean, not saying that would be  OK, but that would be very different.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Right. </p><p> DUPREE:  What they were doing here is, they were carrying out  investigations involving the very candidates who were running at the same  time they're engaged in this correspondence about how they can advance  their own political views through their official duties.</p><p> That is where it crossed a line.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Yes.  </p><p> You would just love to get the context for these remarks.  What was going  on?  If it's just hatred, I don't know if that is even better or worse.  </p><p> Tom, good seeing you again, my friend.  Thank you.  </p><p> DUPREE:  Likewise.  Thank you, Neil.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p> How about just eliminating ICE?  </p><p> With all this controversy about separating kids from their parents at the  border, and then now trying to reconnect them with their parents, sometimes  far from the border, maybe just get rid of ICE.  Some people are actually  urging that -- after this.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, groups in protests all around wanting to get rid of  ICE.  </p><p> That's right.  After the separation of these kids from their parents, a lot  of folks saying, you know, the problem isn't these coming into our country.   It's the folks who are trying to keep them out and the way they go about  their business.  So, they're actually saying, get rid of ICE.  Put ICE on  ice, if you will.</p><p> Former ICE agent Claude Arnold on that.</p><p> What do you think of that?  </p><p> CLAUDE ARNOLD, FORMER ICE SPECIAL AGENT:  Well, I -- first of all, people  don't understand the breadth of ICE's mission.  </p><p> Immigration enforcement is half of the mission.  It has an entire  component, homeland security investigations, that investigates all crime  related to the border.  </p><p> It's the investigative arm for all of DHS.  It's the second largest  investigative entity in the U.S. government and it investigates a lot of  things, drug smuggling, human trafficking and smuggling, child pornography,  export of illegal technologies.</p><p> It has a huge national security responsibility.  It's the second largest  representation on the Federal Joint Terrorism Task Force after the FBI.  </p><p> So to say you just need to get rid of ICE, I think people don't understand  all that ICE does.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, a lot of them were saying, right after these apprehensions,  well, does it change and does their mission statement change given on the  administration?  It was this administration that, led by Jeff Sessions,  said, we're going to enforce a policy where we can, yes, separate kids from  their parents, something that wasn't done, at least not the same way  exactly, in the Obama administration.  </p><p> So do you have to pivot depending on the administration?  </p><p> ARNOLD:  Well, I think there was a pivot done on how enforcement was  conducted during the Obama administration.  </p><p> And, really, it's just been a return to the status quo.  But people have  been -- they have developed a sense of entitlement that you can just come  to the country illegally and expecting it's OK. </p><p> CAVUTO:  Oh, no, you're quite right.  People forget how we were  apprehending underage kids and then who were -- drugs deals and all.   You're quite right about that.</p><p> ARNOLD:  Right.  Right.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  But who calls that?  Do you answer then to whatever the  presidential directive is or what?</p><p> ARNOLD:  Yes, of course.  You're part of the executive branch.  </p><p> ICE does what the president tells them to do through the executive chain of  command.  I mean, it's the executive branch.</p><p> CAVUTO:  So, if there were no ICE, to these people's interests, the  protesters, who would handle this border stuff?  </p><p> ARNOLD:  Well, here's the important thing here, Neil.  </p><p> What is going on is, the same people who want ICE abolished, they opposed  there being any wall on the border.  They oppose changing the loopholes  that encourage and allow people to stay in the U.S. illegally.  </p><p> So, the last stand against those who make it in here illegally is ICE.  So  if you get rid of ICE, then you completely have open borders and no  immigration enforcement.  And that's by design.  They want that to happen.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Amazing.  </p><p> All right, Claude Arnold, thank you very much, former ICE agent.  He's put  himself in a lot of harm's way over the years just to deal with that.  </p><p> People should remember that, no matter what your feelings on this  particular issue.  </p><p> We will have more after this.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Thirty seconds away from that deadline.  What is Rod Rosenstein  going to do?  Is he going to give the Republicans what they want?</p><p> Tomorrow, we will get the read on all of this from Republican House  Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte.  He also was one of the fellows  who came up with a plan to settle this immigration mess.  His measure went  nowhere, but that doesn't mean that immigration progress couldn't still  come up somewhere.  </p><p> A one-on-one with probably one of the more powerful players on Capitol Hill  tomorrow, Bob Goodlatte.</p><p> We will see you then.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> QUESTION:  And one more, on trade, and following up on what Blake asked  about Harley-Davidson.  They announced in an SEC filing they're moving a  significant amount of their operations to Europe because of the E.U.  tariffs that were placed on Harley-Davidson motorcycles.  Is this what the  President envisioned for what the impact would be by placing tariffs on the  E.U. and the retaliation the E.U. has put on the U. S.?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Again, the European  Union is trying to punish U.S. workers because they have engaged repeatedly  in unfair trade practices.  And the president is saying enough is enough.   We'd like to work with the E.U. to work on a level playing field. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Sorry, Steve, I did come to you.  Go ahead.  </p><p> QUESTION:  The president today in the Oval Office, sitting next to the king  of Jordan, mentioned some progress in the Middle East peace process, but he  didn't give us any specifics. </p><p> There's been quite a bit of back-channel diplomacy going on the last few  days in the Middle East, with Jared Kushner and Jason Greenblatt.  Do you  have anything concrete to -- to tell us about any sort of positive movement  whatsoever, from all of this? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Again, we -- I think that the meetings that took place  over the last week with Senior Adviser Jared Kushner and Special  Representative Jason Greenblatt, they met with a number of officials and  principals in Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, Israel and Qatar last week. </p><p> They discussed the situation in Gaza as well as the next stages of the  peace effort.  We're going to continue those conversations and we're  committed to the peace effort, and we're going to keep working forward.   But those conversations were productive. </p><p> Julie? </p><p> QUESTION:  Sarah, the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection said  today that they are no longer going to be referring people who cross the  border without authorization for criminal charges if they're traveling with  children, which is essentially a return to the Obama administration  practice and administrations before that.  Does the president support that  approach?  And if so, does he regret trying to push forward on a zero- tolerance approach in the first place? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  No.  The president certainly supports keeping families  together, which he has outlined several times over the last week.  But he's  also called on Congress to actually fix the system. </p><p> They're the only ones that ultimately have the ability to change the law.   The president's executive order has given a temporary solution to the  problem but it's not permanent, and we need Congress to step up.  We need  Democrats to stop playing political games, do their jobs, work with this  president and let's fix the problem at the border. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Jeff? </p><p> QUESTION:  Sarah, can you talk about why you tweeted from your official  account about the episode that you had at the restaurant on Friday night? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Sure.  I was responding to a number of news stories.  I  would been reached out to by over a dozen reporters, and there were  multiple news stories that had already been issued. </p><p> It was considered news of the day, so I responded in the way I would to any  other news of the day story. </p><p> Jeff? </p><p> QUESTION:  Sarah, you said just because you don't see a judge doesn't mean  you don't get due process.  Can you explain what you mean by that  specifically, and how the president envisions that this would work while  still maintaining what the Constitution upholds in having a swift  immigration system? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Again, there are other ways for removal.  There are  thousands of illegal aliens that are removed every month that don't see  judges.  Sometimes that's through voluntary removal, and sometimes that's  through expedited removal. </p><p> Again, the president's ultimate goal would be that we have actually a  secure border, and people aren't coming into the country illegally.  But  that we have a system that works and the people that come into the country  come in through a legal system. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Jill? </p><p> QUESTION:  What is the president doing specifically this week to ensure  that Congress passes a bill?  He's spent all week in Nevada talking about - - or, all weekend.  Excuse me -- on Saturday, talking about how Democrats  want open borders and crime.  But, specifically, has he made phone calls to  Republican members in the House, where the bill is pending?  Has he tried  to bring Democrats together?  What is he doing specifically to try and get  a new law passed, specifically, other than just railing against the current  law? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  The president met with a number of lawmakers last week,  talked with several over the weekend, some that he was with while he was  traveling.  Last week, he made an open invitation to Democrat lawmakers --  that they were welcome to come to the White House to discuss what they'd  like to see, because the president wants solutions. </p><p> We've yet to have any of them to show up, actually willing to have those  conversations, actually willing to fix the problem.  Instead, they'd rather  rant and rave about not allowing members of the Trump administration to  step foot in public. </p><p> The president wants to see solutions.  That's what we're focused on.  It's  Congress's job to do that, and we've laid out very clearly that we want to  be part of that and what we'd like to see in that package. </p><p> Jill? </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> QUESTION:  ... on this? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Clearly, they aren't.  If they haven't passed a law to  fix this system, then they haven't.  Republicans have laid out a number of  proposals that they support.  The president has voiced his support for  those. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> QUESTION:  ... probably fail this week, though.  The Republican bills will  probably...</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  That's because no Democrat will get on board and  actually support a solution. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> QUESTION:  ... Republican -- is your Republicans cannot pass these  Republican bills.  What is the president doing as the leader of the party  to try and get Republican...</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Jeff, these aren't Republican bills.  These are bills  that fix a broken system.  They may have Republican sponsors, but these  should be bipartisan.  This shouldn't be complicated.  Look, the House has  already passed over 500 pieces of legislation, but they can't get through  the Senate because Democrats refuse to actually find solutions. </p><p> We have 50 bills that passed just last week to address the opioid crisis --  that passed through the House.  The Senate still hasn't taken them up.   Hopefully, they will.  And, if they do, that will show that we actually can  come up with bipartisan solutions.  And that's what we'd like to see them  do on immigration, as well. </p><p> Jill? </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> QUESTION:  ... follow-up on Julia's question about the zero-tolerance  policy.  The president said, last week, after signing the executive order,  that he believed that zero tolerance was still important.  You guys made a  point of the fact that the E. O.  did not actually get rid of the policy. </p><p> How does that square with the fact that CBP is now saying that they are no  longer referring for prosecution any adults who come in with children? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Again, this is a temporary solution.  This isn't going  to last.  Congress still has to step up.  They still have to do their job.   This will only last a short amount of time because we're going to run out  of space, we're going to run out of resources in order to keep people  together, and we're asking Congress to provide those resources and do their  job.  And...</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> QUESTION:  ... temporary solution -- does that mean, at some point, you are  going to change that policy back? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  We're not changing the policy.  We're simply out of  resources, and, at some point, Congress has to do what they were elected to  do, and that is secure our border.  That is stop the crime coming into our  country. </p><p> The country has made extremely clear that they don't want open borders, and  Democrats need to understand that, and they need to work with Republicans  and find some solutions. </p><p> QUESTION:  And there...</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Annie.  Sorry, Jill, I'm going to keep going.  Annie, go  ahead. </p><p> QUESTION:  Sarah, you mentioned the state of resources and running out of  them.  Can you be specific about what the resources are right now for  housing parents and children together?  Is there enough housing right now?   Is the Pentagon stepping in?  Like, what's being done about the resources?  </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Again, we're looking at every option available.  We have  asked the Pentagon to help with additional space.  But a lot of that will  depend on our ability to stop people coming into the country illegally.   And we, again, encourage people to go through ports of entry instead of  crossing the border illegally. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  We've requested, through legislation -- we're working  with Congress, hopefully, to provide more resources and the ability to  actually enforce the law. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Ayesha? </p><p> QUESTION:  Thank you.  I just want to see if you can kind of narrow down  exactly what the president actually intends to do when it comes to this  idea of not having judges.  You say that there are instances where people  don't have judges, but my understanding is that, if you do ask for asylum,  you do have certain rights. </p><p> So is there going to be a change in that policy, or what is this  administration planning to do to make it so you don't have to see a judge?   (INAUDIBLE)  </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Again, I have addressed this a couple times.  There are  multiple instances in where you wouldn't:  voluntary removal, certain cases  have expedited removal.  If somebody comes through a port of entry seeking  asylum, those cases and that process will be heard.  But at the same time,  the president's ultimate goal is to secure the border and stop illegal  immigration. </p><p> QUESTION:  I -- I -- I understand that, but so what does that mean  practically?  Like, is the president planning to do anything differently,  or are you just saying, you don't like the way (INAUDIBLE) now? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  The president's laid out what he'd like to see.  We've  put out the things that we want to see in an immigration package months  ago.  We're still waiting on Congress to give us the ability to do that. </p><p> QUESTION:  So -- so unless Congress acts, nothing is actually going to  change?  The administration is not changing anything right now, when it  comes to judges? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  You mean, are we walking around making up laws?  No,  because we're not the Obama administration.  We're actually trying to  enforce the laws that are on the books.  We're actually asking Congress to  do their part in the process, and pass new legislation that will fix our  immigration system. </p><p> QUESTION:  So -- but nothing is actually changing on the ground.  Like,  this -- so this is -- the president's complaining about judges, and saying  that we shouldn't have all these judges, and people who come over should  just be put out, but nothing is actually going to change.  He's just saying  -- he's just complaining about the process as it stands now. </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Things that we have the ability to do administratively,  we are working to do.  But again, Congress is the only one that has the  ability to write law, and we hope they'll do that. </p><p> Steve? </p><p> QUESTION:  I'm honing in on that point.  I'm trying to understand what it  is the president understands about the current policy, because as you've  explained, expedited removal allows the government to remove hundreds of  thousands of illegal immigrants a year without seeing judges.  Did the  president know that when he issued the tweets? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Yeah, but there are still thousands that go through a  very lengthy process.  We'd like to see the process consolidated.  We'd  like to see the backlog stopped.  We'd like to see our border secured. </p><p> Sorry, Steve, I'm going to keep going. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> QUESTION:  Under current law there are a couple of things that the  president could do.  You could expand that policy.  You've said that he  would like to see more expedited removal.  Does the president intend to  expand it to the full two-year limit under the current statute? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Again, we would like to see more expedited removal, but  ultimately, we would like to see the border secured and people stop coming  into the country illegally.  That seems pretty simple to me, and it would  stop a lot of the problems, and would eliminate the need for so many of  these additional laws. </p><p> QUESTION:  Thanks, Sarah.  The gal in the briefing talking about the  importance of civility.  Do you consider it a civil policy to separate more  than two thirds of the children from their parents? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  We consider enforcing the law the role that the  administration has to play.  Certainly, the president has taken an  executive action to the furthest that he has the ability to do to minimize  the separation of families.  We're working hard to make sure families get  to stay together, and we're calling on Congress to help us in that effort,  and we're continuing to focus on the reunification, and making sure that  the families, again, stay together, and that Congress will give us a  permanent solution to fix that. </p><p> QUESTION:  But you say that you're working to make families stay together.   It was your administration that separated them in the first place. </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  It wasn't our administration that created these laws,  but it is our administration's job to enforce it, and we've done that.  If  someone breaks the law, it's our job to enforce it.  If somebody doesn't  like the law, then they need to lobby Congress and ask them to change it.  </p><p> Anita. </p><p> QUESTION:  I have, one, an immigration question, and wanted to clarify one  thing.  So I understand that not every adult with a child is going to be  prosecuted.  If there are families that are being held together, detained  together somewhere and 20 days goes by, what is going to happen then?  I  didn't get an -- an answer with that last week.  I don't understand.  The  law says you can't keep them together, keep the children, even with parents  for longer than 20 days.  So then what happens? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Hopefully, Congress will pass the law and fix the  problem. </p><p> QUESTION:  (INAUDIBLE) 20 days? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Well, why should it be so hard?  They all say that they  don't want to separate families.  Seems like it should be pretty simple to  me. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  John? </p><p> QUESTION:  I said I had a clarification...</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Go ahead. </p><p> QUESTION:  ... so Jeff asked you a question about Congress and the bill.   Were you, in your response, referring to just a stand-alone bill that deals  with family separation, or were you referring to the bigger immigration  bill that the House hopes to take up this week? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Our preference would be a bill that addresses all of the  pillars that we've laid out, that we'd like to see addressed in an  immigration package.  And that's what our focus is right now, is there's a  bill that does that on the table. </p><p> If that doesn't happen, then we'll talk about other pieces of legislation  at that point. </p><p> QUESTION:  (INAUDIBLE) the president still wants that bill to go forward  even though he said...</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Certain...</p><p> QUESTION:  ... they don't want to -- he -- they shouldn't waste their time  on it? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Look, Democrats in the Senate have made clear they're  not going to support this.  </p><p> And because we need at least some Democrats to get on board, they've made  it very clear that they don't want to work with the president, that they  don't want to fix our immigration system.  That they'd rather have open  borders and rampant crime than work with the president to create solutions.   Until they change their mind, we're going to continue looking at the best  ways that we can fix these problems but we need Congress to help us. </p><p> John. </p><p> QUESTION:  Thank you, Sarah.  This president is the first in the television  age who has yet to address the American public on nationwide television  from the Oval Office.  Many Republican consultants have said that he might  have a stronger hand in influencing Congress if he made a nationally  televised address on immigration and what changes he'd like to see, to  explain it. </p><p> Is that something that's on the table within the administration? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Certainly don't want to take anything off the table, or  any tool away from the president.  He does address the American people in a  number of different venues and formats.  And I will certainly pass along  that suggestion to him. </p><p> Nadia. </p><p> QUESTION:  Just a follow-up on the Middle East.  In the recent (INAUDIBLE)  Mr. Kushner said that if President Abbas is not willing to negotiate, he's  going to proceed with the deal.  Can you explain how the White House is  hoping to achieve any progress in the Middle East peace talks if the  principal party is not taking part in it? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  We're going to continue meeting with the other partners  in the region.  And, again, we're going to continue pushing forward in the  peace process.  We had productive meetings over the last week.  We're going  to continue those conversations. </p><p> I will take one last question.  Saagar.  </p><p> QUESTION:  Thanks, Sarah.  </p><p> To follow up on the judges -- on the issue of immigration judges, why is  the President so opposed to an increase in the number of immigration judges  when it would expedite the asylum processing -- the asylum process and  expedite deportation?  </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  We're not opposed to the speeding up the process.  What  the President would like to see, once again, is that we stop the problem at  the very beginning.  He'd like to see us secure the border and people work  through the system, through the ports of entry, so that we're not dealing  with things on the back end.  </p><p> We'd like to stop the problem before it starts, and that's what the  president's focus has been all along, is on securing the border.  And  that's what we're going to continue to do.  </p><p> Thanks so much guys.  Have a great day.  </p><p> NEIL CAVUTO, HOST:  All right, you have been listening to Sarah Sanders  here.</p><p> And it's safe to say the Washington press corps is more concerned with the  immigration issue than a lot of folks losing their shirts today on this  whole trade issue.  </p><p> Welcome, everybody.  I'm Neil Cavuto.  And you're watching \"Your World.\"</p><p> And it could have worse.  As I show you the Dow today down about 328  points, we had been down almost 500 points, and a lot of that over a  building trade war and concerns this could get worse before it gets better,  or that there are no signs of concessions on the part of any of the  principal parties, namely the Chinese and ourselves.  </p><p> All of this on the same day that Harley-Davidson was indicating, because of  these threat of tariffs, they're moving a lot of their operations outside  the U.S.</p><p> On a separate issue, General Motors has indicated that a lot of its Chevy  Blazers will now be made in Mexico, not citing just the trade issue,  but  that it's not welcome noise here.</p><p> So, again, this could have a lot been worse.  There was some confusion  early on in the markets as to whether the administration was also  recommending that they were urging the Chinese and others not to invest in  technology stocks at all.  </p><p> Then Peter Navarro ends up popping up on CNBC to say, no, no, no, no, no,  they're not going to be, nor are there plans in the works for investment  restrictions on China.</p><p> And that brought us down to the levels we're at right now, about 328 points  southward on what was a crazy day on the markets.</p><p> We're going to be at this from all angles right now.</p><p> Let's first go to FOX Business Network's Deirdre Bolton with how it all  sorted out.</p><p> Hey, Deirdre.</p><p> DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, Neil.  </p><p> You said it.  It could have been much worse.  So, the markets did close  clearly lower, but certainly off the low points of the day.  And, of  course, the big headline, the Trump administration moving to block Chinese  companies from investing in U.S. tech firms and moving to block additional  tech exports from the U.S. to China.  </p><p> Our sources are saying the Treasury Department is going to make an official  announcement at the end of this week, bring us more clarity, more details  on the plan.  </p><p> Now, the level of difficulty is, of course, much higher when you start to  talk about blocking investment than when we're just engaging in tariff  spats.  So the stock market heading for the biggest one-day slide in  months.  </p><p> That's how we finished up.  You can see red across the screen.  One area I  really wanted to highlight are the techs, because S&amp;P 500 tech companies  get about 60 percent of their revenue from overseas.  So that's the highest  foreign exposure out of any of the index's 11 sectors.  </p><p> And, of course,critics of our current trade policy say that China has been  stealing anywhere between $30 billion and $50 billion worth of intellectual  property, hard data, every year for the past decade.  But then there was  even a stronger report, a more recent one that came out from the Commission  on the Theft of American Intellectual Property.</p><p> It has a much higher number, stating that up to $600 billion in theft that  has some projections baked in is possible.  But experts say, bottom line,  the motivation to want to level the playing field is completely  understandable.  </p><p> What gets complicated is that so many American businesses are  interconnected.  So, for example, here's seven big tech American companies  that source half of their products and components from China.  </p><p> So, HP, IBM, Dell, Cisco, Unisys, Microsoft, Intel.  Even Apple has sold  more iPhones in China in the last three years than in the U.S.  And Apple  gets about 20 percent of its annual revenue from China.  </p><p> Now, the Chinese president of course says China will punch back and will  not be forced to eat the bitter fruit.  That is a translation, a direct  quote.  </p><p> But as the tension rises between the world's two biggest economies, of  course, investors really showed their anxiety.  So, we had the Nasdaq, you  can see there, closely lower, essentially 2 percent, biggest one-day  percentage decline since March.  Third day down in a row.  So, that's the  longest losing streak for that tech-heavy comp in about two months' time.</p><p> Even Asia overnight, you can see how markets reacted there.  You can see  Hong Kong's Hang Seng down by more than 1 percent.  And, then, of course,  even on our own bond market, right, there was this flight to safety in U.S.  10-year.  Investors typically, of course, buy these bonds when they're  fearful or they feel less certain of the future.  </p><p> And prices really went up, so, therefore, those yields went down, settling  2.875 percent.  And just worth noting, these yields have fallen basically  for the past four out of five weeks.  </p><p> So, Neil, what is clear is, investors really don't know what to make of it.   We have the tariffs and now we have this idea of blocking direct  investment, which is a much more muscular and, quite frankly, threatening  move than tariffs, which really only apply to very specific products, Neil.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Absolutely, especially when they go back and forth either way.</p><p> BOLTON:  Yes.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Thank you very, very much, Deirdre Bolton.</p><p> BOLTON:  Sure.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Doesn't Harley-Davidson know that?  Not so much on the tariffs  we're considering, but the response that company is getting and opting to  do something that the president probably didn't envision.  </p><p>FOX Business Network's Jeff Flock in Countryside, Illinois.  </p><p> What did they do?  </p><p> JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  They're getting a double  whammy at Harley-Davidson, Neil, because the steel and aluminum tariffs hit  their raw materials costs.</p><p> And now the European Union, of course, imposing an addition 25 percent  tariff on motorcycles made here and shipped to Europe.</p><p> And so Harley is in a tough spot.  That tariff went from 6 percent to 31  percent.  And today, in a regulatory filing, Harley said that is going to  add more than $2,000 a bike to the cost of a motorcycle made here in the  U.S. and sold in Europe.  And they can't possibly pass that along to  consumers.</p><p> So, in the short-term, they're going to have to eat it.  In the long term,  they're going to move production away from the U.S.  Europe was an  expanding market for Harley-Davidson.  They love it over there.  And U.S.  sales have been down.</p><p> You look at the first quarter of this year, U.S. sales of Harleys down  double digits, as guys like me get older and maybe give up their  motorcycles.  In Europe, it had been growing by about 7 percent.  </p><p> And so those bikes, made in the U.S. and shipped to Europe, will be no  more.  Harley has four plants here in the U.S., York, Pennsylvania, Kansas  City, Missouri, and two in their home state of Wisconsin, and now  apparently bikes destined for Europe will not be made there anymore.</p><p> Instead, they will be made in places like Brazil and elsewhere, Thailand  and Australia.  This is not, as you pointed out at the outset, what the  president had intended.  His trade policies designed to keep and create  jobs here in the U.S.  In this case, it appears they will be eliminating  them -- Neil.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Amazing.</p><p> All right, Jeff Flock, thank you very, very much.  </p><p> All right, Mattie Duppler is.  We have got Charles Payne here, Larry Shover  here as well of SFG, alternate CME trader as well.  </p><p> Charles Payne, what is going on here?  We knew the trade thing was getting  antsy, but it seemed like the bottom fell out.  </p><p> CHARLES PAYNE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  It did, but because I think this had  a little bit of a different twist.</p><p> This was investment.  This is about -- the whole thing, by the way, is  centered on made in China 2025.  The administration, which I wish they  would articulate what they're trying to do, because I understand, and I  think most -- a lot of people do -- and it's the idea of curbing this  ambition, the stated ambition by China to sort of be the world's tech  leader in a short period of time.</p><p> And one way to get there, perhaps the only way they can get their with  their own timeline, is to continue to steal our intellectual property.</p><p> So the idea is to restrict investments from companies where China has a 25  percent or more ownership.  And, again, this was just speculation.  It was  in a few media outlets, the White House trying to take -- take it back a  little bit.  It's something obviously that they have toyed around with.</p><p> Peter Navarro has talked about this kind of thing for maybe two decades, so  this is not necessarily news, per se.  But it is -- it is a different  twist, to your point.  It's not -- it's not the trade stuff anymore, as  much as it is, hey, we want to take direct aim at your ambitions to usurp  America's perch as the world's tech leader.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, Larry, what worried a lot in the markets is that, all of a  sudden, then we were putting a general wall up on Chinese investment in  general and technology period.  </p><p> That's how it was interpreted.  And then, later on, the treasury secretary,  Mnuchin, came out to say, no, no, no, it wasn't singling out China, as if  to say there's other players here, as if that eased the angst.  </p><p> It actually compounded that.  But what do you make of that?  </p><p> LARRY SHOVER, SOLUTIONS FUNDS GROUP:  Well, what I make of it is that two  things.</p><p> The whole thing lacked clarity.  Like, it didn't matter.  Like, this whole  China tweets and tirades, it didn't matter because it lacked clarity.  It  seemed like the White House is utterly unprepared to create any kind of  proposal that can go into law.</p><p> Immigration policy is a good proof of that.  Also, it lacks credibility,  because we all know -- I mean, this does -- this hurts us more than it  hurts them, the fact that it's going to kill Apple or Nike.  It really,  really hurt them manufacturing their goods there that are sent to us.</p><p> So it doesn't make any sense.  People dismissed it.  And I really think  people are definitely blaming the China trade today.  The bigger problem,  though, it's really tech.  We saw that breaking down last week.</p><p> Leadership has been very thin in the stock market.  Without five or six  super cap techs in the S&amp;P 500...</p><p> CAVUTO:  Yes.  </p><p> SHOVER:  ... we would be down 4 percent, instead of up 1.5 percent.</p><p> But it started to crack.  The Supreme Court came out last week with a  ruling on sales tax, et cetera.  That chasm between growth and value has  been very, very wide.  The market is vulnerable.  The ball will always find  you when you're out of position.</p><p> And that's really what happened today.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  And people were a little anxious on that investment angle here and  maybe finding an excuse for technology, which ran up far and fast, to sell  off some of it.</p><p> But, Mattie, it's sort of this impression that not everyone in the  administration seems to be on the same page.  I'm getting different vibes  from the Treasury secretary, different vibes from their trade  representatives, different vibes from the president.</p><p> MATTIE DUPPLER, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S FORUM:  Right.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  And I think that's the kind of thing that scares markets.  </p><p> DUPPLER:  Oh, absolutely.</p><p> You finally have consensus on this panel, Neil.  And that's, what the heck  is the administration intending to do with these trade efforts?</p><p> Charles and I don't always agree on this issue, but right now we're both  wondering, what is the objective here?  And that's what the administration  needs to clarify.  It needs to make clear what it intends to do with all of  these efforts towards China.</p><p> Now, if the objective here is to exact the most amount of pain and pressure  on China possible, they need to make sure that they're not injecting pain  on American businesses.  And that's a concern, especially when you look at  really artificially diminishing the amount of capital that can come into  this country.</p><p> I worry about the impact on businesses.  And that's not even getting to  what tariffs are doing to American businesses, where we have already seen  some of those announcements this week.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Or even the threat of them.</p><p> But, Charles, the other thing you mentioned -- and this -- you can help me  out here.  It's always been that the Chinese are in bad shape here.   They're at two-year-plus lows in their market.  They have a lot more to  lose than we do.</p><p> But they also have their pride, and they're not giving any ground.  So, how  is this resolved, if it is?</p><p> PAYNE:  And this is where I disagree with Larry.  </p><p> I don't think -- I think a lot of people are raising the white flag so  quickly that China is going to beat us at this.  They're not.  If it has to  go the whole way... </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  The whole way could be years.  </p><p> PAYNE:  Yes, Sure.</p><p> Mattie makes the right point.  It's sort of like when my pops used to take  me out in the back.  He says, it's going to hurt me as much as it hurts  you.  </p><p> No, it won't.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> PAYNE:  With that being said, let's look at what China did today, this  morning.  </p><p> Their central bank freed up banks over there to the tune of $100 billion.   Right?  This is to sort of...</p><p> CAVUTO:  It needs a stimulant.</p><p> PAYNE:  ... to do things thing on debt.  </p><p> Last week, it was $30 billion.  A week before that, it was $30 billion.   Their foreign and reserve currencies have dropped a trillion dollars.  </p><p> Their debt-to-GDP ratio is on its way to 300 percent.  We aren't going to  lose this.  China knows we're not going to lose this.  Nobody wants to  lose.  It's a matter of how, to your point, do you save face and resolve  it?</p><p> CAVUTO:  I think that's where we are.  </p><p> Larry, the Chinese, remember, today indicating, you know, we don't just  turn a cheek on this.  And we come back and we're going to fight back.  </p><p> Now, to be clear, no response to the tariffs yet with tariffs of their own.   In other words, to increase the amount to match the United States, when we  promised we would put $200 billion on top of that.</p><p> Some read into that a sign that the Chinese are trying to find a middle  ground here, where they can talk tough, but they don't have to respond in  kind and invite a war.  What do you see?  </p><p> SHOVER:  Yes.</p><p> Well, I see that they have already done that, just what we said.  Required  reserve ratio dropped 50 basis points yesterday, adding all that liquidity  into the market.  What did that do?  That dropped RMB by 1.5 percent in  five days, 3.5 percent over the last month.  </p><p> So they're already ready.  That is going to negate any kind of trade tariff  that we are going to impose.  And I think they know, at the end of the day,  that there's so lack of clarity coming out of the White House, that they're  just preparing for it.  </p><p> Also realizing that they have had a real soft patch of data coming in.  So,  perhaps Trump is trying to hit them while they're weak.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  We will see.</p><p> All right, guys, I apologize jumping on you.  We have got a lot of breaking  news here.  </p><p> I do want to bring in my next guest, the former Heinz CEO Bill Johnson, a  global read of things, if ever there were one.  </p><p> And, Bill, I'm looking at this and wondering what the signals could be for  us.  If a company, one after the other, like GM considering making all its  Blazers now in Mexico, and, of course, we have been talking about a number  of other companies that have been doing the same or considering preemptive  move like Harley-Davidson, that has got to have a domestic economic impact.</p><p> BILL JOHNSON, FORMER CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, H.J. HEINZ COMPANY:  It should, Neil.  </p><p> Nothing has happened yet to impact the economy here.  And, frankly, the  Chinese and European economies...</p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, they're already leaving.  Those guys are already making some  moves.  </p><p> JOHNSON:  I understand.  But they're more vulnerable than we are.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  True.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Having said that, this is like tic-tac-toe.  Nobody wins.  </p><p> I play tic-tac-toe with any grandkids.  And you never win.  And that's what  this is now.  We have gotten to the point on this situation...</p><p> CAVUTO:  You never won at tic-tac-toe with your grandkids?  </p><p> JOHNSON:  No.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  You're one of the most celebrated CEOs ever.  And... </p><p> JOHNSON:  Yes.  That just shows you nobody wins, Neil.  And that's where we  are right now.  Nobody wins.</p><p> CAVUTO:  So, that's where you see -- that's where we are right now?</p><p> JOHNSON:  I do think that's where we are.</p><p> I think this created a huge environment of uncertainty.  You and I have had  this conversation many times.  Uncertainty leads to volatility.  Volatility  leads to more uncertainty.  And we get in this vicious cycle.  </p><p> And I think that's where we are now.  Having said that, I think,  ultimately, saner and cooler heads will prevail, and this will somehow get  resolved.  </p><p> I hope this is not a negotiation ploy, because it's rather ham-fisted.  And  there has got to be better ways to attack this issue than the one that is  being generated right now.</p><p> CAVUTO:  What do you make -- I think it was ratcheted up a little bit today  to go after in this case the Chinese for investing in technology.</p><p> It was read as, we're not going to allow them to invest in any technology  companies.  And that might have been a prematurely wrong impression.  But  that was the one that was out there for hours in the markets.  They had to  dial that back a little bit.</p><p> But they're still looking at putting a limit to who can invest in  technology.  That's how it interpreted, hence, technology falls off a lot.   So if this is more from just goods and services to, I don't know, even  companies and stocks you invest in, then what?  </p><p> JOHNSON:  Well, then I think we have chaos, Neil. </p><p> I don't think you can stop the investment in a capitalist society.  It's  just the way the system works.  And while I understand why the  administration is going after some of these issues -- and they're sort of  going where people have been afraid to tread before -- the reality is, we  have to have some clarity in the communication of the purpose of what we're  trying to achieve and then take a step-by-step process in which to achieve  it.  </p><p> And I heard about the investment situation this morning.  Then I saw  Secretary Mnuchin's response.  And so I'm completely unclear as to what is  happening.  And there we go again.  That creates more uncertainty, which  creates more volatility, and leaves us all in the dark about what it is  we're trying to achieve.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Now, there used to be an old rule here following this president  the last 18 months that those who doubted him would be proven wrong, and  that everything ends up OK and markets come back from what look like  debacles, and people who second-guessed him have been proven wrong.  </p><p> So there was this now new -- or renewed trust that President Trump must  know what he's doing, there's a method to all of this.  </p><p> Do you subscribe to that, or is there now a reassessment, well, maybe not.   Maybe this is a little impulsive.  Maybe there's not a method to the  madness.  Maybe it's just madness.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Well, I think, historically, over his last 18 months in office,  he's done a pretty good job of bringing us back from the brink and  achieving great success.  </p><p>North Korea seems to be an example of one of those areas.  But I don't  know.  I don't like this whole approach, Neil.  I think it's so ham-fisted  and so unpredictable that sometimes you create a fire out of a smoke bomb,  and the next thing you know, you have got a real conflagration going, and  you don't know how to put it out.  And that -- I'm worried we're headed  that way.</p><p> Having said that, I will give him credit for again treading in these places  that need to be addressed.  I just think there's better ways to do it.  But  I'm not yet ready to say that we're just going to pull this one back from  the brink and everyone is going to be happy.  </p><p> I just don't know.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  We shall see, my friend.  Thank you very, very much.  </p><p> Good luck in your next tic-tac-toe game.  I give the edge to you still.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> JOHNSON:  Thank you.  Thank you.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  William Johnson, the former Heinz CEO, if anyone knows the global  landscape, it is he.  All right. </p><p> All right, when we come back here, this nastiness with Democrats saying  that we're going to get nasty no matter where Republicans gather.  </p><p> Really?  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Yikes, 25 minutes, right, a 5:00 p.m. deadline staring down now,  as House Republicans want documents from the Justice Department on that  Clinton e-mail probe and the Russian investigation.  Then what happens if  they don't get them?  </p><p> After this.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. MAXINE WATERS (D), CALIFORNIA:  And if you see anybody from that  Cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you  get out and you create a crowd.  </p><p> (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)</p><p> WATERS:  And you push back on them.  And you tell them they're not welcome.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, anyway, American Majority CEO Ned Ryun.  We have got Olympic  Media managing editor Katie Frates and Democratic strategist Christy  Setzer.</p><p> I don't know where to begin.  But, Katie, maybe you can help me with this.  </p><p> This is out of control.  This is just crazy talk.  What do you make of it?  </p><p> KATIE FRATES, OLYMPIC MEDIA:  It absolutely is.  </p><p> This is just going way too far, because she doesn't even know who she is  speaking to, Maxine Waters, when she is saying this.  What if someone sees  somebody at a gas station and takes it way too far?  </p><p> You're essentially encouraging anyone of any mental state, of any level of  discourse, to go up and potentially harm someone else because of their  political beliefs.  That's absolutely not OK.  </p><p> I'm so excited and happy to see at least Nancy Pelosi push back on this.   I'm not sure why more Democratic leaders are not speaking up and condemning  this.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, there were a good number.  To be fair, there were a good  number, Elijah Cummings and all saying...</p><p> FRATES:  Good.  Good.</p><p> CAVUTO:  ... that, even when it came to the Sanders situation, she  shouldn't have been taken out of the restaurant.  </p><p> But, Ned, I'm worried more about the increasing vitriol.  And we're seeing  more and more of it.  And anything could happen in that environment.</p><p> NED RYUN, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN MAJORITY:  No.</p><p> And I think really what we're seeing is, to sum up Charles Krauthammer, we  conservatives, we think the left is philosophically misguided, and many on  the left think we're evil.  </p><p> And I think you're seeing this rhetoric ramp up where borders are now  bigotry and American presidents standing up for the America taxpayer, well,  this is Nazism and the second coming of the Holocaust.  </p><p> And I think what the left is trying to do is say, the debate is over in our  minds because we consider your ideas to be irrational.  We don't consider  your ideas to be legitimate.  </p><p> And if they can dehumanize the other side, that's what they want to do,  because that justifies driving opposing thought from the public square.  </p><p> The thing that troubles me, Neil, about all of this, this kind of  incitement to physical intimidation and bullying is not to be normalized.   It's not normal for a constitutional republic.  It's only normal in banana  republics.  And if the left wants to beat us, try doing it at the ballot  box in 2018 and 2020.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Do you worry about that, Christy?  </p><p> As a Democratic strategist, and a darn good one, and a very calm person, I  might point out, that your party could be ruining it for itself, that it's  actually scaring some people with that kind of talk, whether you agree or  disagree with the politics behind it.  </p><p> CHRISTY SETZER, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  I just think it's impossible to put  Maxine Waters' comments like this in a vacuum like this.</p><p> The defining feature of Donald Trump's campaign was not that he was going  to shake stuff up in Washington or that he was a great businessman.  It was  this incivility.  Right?  </p><p> He started talking about how, I like people that were not captured about  John McCain.  Then you looked as his rallies, where they were filled with  him actively asking them to take violence against protesters.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  If that is what your view is, do you think that the response,  responding in kind, then, if that's your view, is justified?</p><p> SETZER:  I don't think that -- no, I don't think that we have responded in  kind.  </p><p> I think that Democrats are saying, look, we need to make it just a little  bit uncomfortable.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  You have got whole groups that target a homeland security  secretary at a restaurant.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> SETZER:  No, no, no, no.  Not with violence, Neil.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> SETZER:  That's an extraordinarily important difference.  Not with  violence.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Please listen to me.  </p><p> Sarah Sanders, her incident, Secretary Nielsen outside her home and in a  restaurant, then Maxine Waters justifying it.  I could go on to talk about  Florida's Pam Bondi and what she dealt with at a movie.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> CAVUTO:  Stephen Miller and be called a fascist while he's out.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> SETZER:  Protest is a healthy part of the American tradition, not violence,  not violence.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  You're fine with this.  You're fine with it.  </p><p> But if it were done in reverse, you wouldn't be fine with it.</p><p> SETZER:  I would be absolutely fine with it.  I would be fine with it,  because, again, protest is absolutely fine.</p><p> What is not fine...</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  You just said when you didn't like it what Donald Trump and his  people were doing the same.  </p><p> SETZER:  I'm sorry?</p><p> CAVUTO:  You didn't like it when Donald Trump was doing that.</p><p> SETZER:  No.  What Donald Trump was saying was, I want that guy to be taken  out on a stretcher.  What Donald Trump was doing was actually what Ned Ryun  was just talking about right now, which is dehumanizing the other side.</p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, I don't get it.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  All right.  OK.</p><p> Mattie, do you believe that this is going too far?  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> SETZER:  By talking about how they're animals and infesting America.</p><p> CAVUTO:  I understand.  I heard you.</p><p> SETZER:  That's very different.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Mattie, has this gone too far?  Mattie, you're in awe, aren't you?  </p><p> FRATES:  Yes, yes.  Absolutely, it is.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Katie, I apologize.  I apologize.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  See that?  I lose my place, because I get so wrapped up in it.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Is it your sense that this gets worse, though?  Are you getting a  sense it gets worse?</p><p> FRATES:  So, this is the problem.  </p><p> It's that this is escalating rhetoric.  You're essentially saying mob  someone outside of a gas station.  </p><p> RYUN:  Exactly.  </p><p> FRATES:  And, again, you don't know the intentions of the person who may  then go on to do that.  </p><p> So what if someone is attacked?  What if something violent happens?  And  then you turn around and you say, well, Maxine Waters was telling people to  do that.  It's not a good idea and it's not a healthy dialogue.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> SETZER:  Do we remember the Pizzagate conspiracy, how a crazy conspiracy  actually led someone to take a gun to my, my local pizza place, actually,  and try to shoot it up because they had heard this crazy idea on the  Internet and by Alex Jones and others that Hillary Clinton and John Podesta  were up to no good?  </p><p> That led to actual violence.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, I don't want to get in a tit for tat.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  I sometimes feel like I'm separating my teenage sons.  </p><p> But, Ned Ryun, I do know this.  We have all got to bring the octane down a  little bit on all sides here.  </p><p> RYUN:  We do.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  But how do we do that?  </p><p> And should it be incumbent people to just to say, there has got to be a  better way?  Whether the Elijah Cummings approach, this has got to stop,  whether Sarah Sanders' approach, I just politely up and left, and I tried  not to make a big deal of it at the scene, what is it?  What is the answer?</p><p> RYUN:  No.  I think we have got to start policing our own.  We have to  start policing ourselves on the right and the left.  </p><p> And I was encouraged by Nancy Pelosi saying that Maxine Waters' statement  was unacceptable.  I think we have to be honest about it on the right, too,  when we see unacceptable statements.  And I have said this again -- I have  said this before.  I will say it again.  </p><p> When Donald Trump -- I love 85 to 90 percent of his Twitter feed.  When he  is talking about bloody face-lift, you will never me defend that.  I want  him to focus on the positives and policy and all these things.</p><p> When it becomes personal, I think we need to call out our side and say,  this is not how we have more civil discourse in the public arena.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Fully agree.  Fully agree.  </p><p> At our core, guys, we're all human beings.  </p><p> RYUN:  We're all Americans.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  And we can agree to disagree.  But we don't have to be asses in  the process.  </p><p> And none of you are, by the way.  </p><p> But I want to thank you all very, very much.</p><p> And, Katie, I apologize.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> FRATES:  No, no apology needed.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  I get so apoplectic.  And I don't even know why.  And it's not  even dinnertime.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, by the way, we're close to the witching hour, 5:00 p.m.  Eastern time, that document deadline.  But right now there's indications  the people who have put out that deadline aren't going to get the response  they want in time for that deadline.  </p><p> Then what?  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right.  Between a deadline coming up in about 15 minutes from  now and, of course, this is the week we're going to see some big testimony  up on Capitol Hill, much of it is behind closed doors.</p><p> Let's get the read from former Justice Department official Tom Dupree.  </p><p> Tom, what is the biggest thing you're waiting for?  </p><p> TOM DUPREE, FORMER JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:  Well, the biggest thing  I'm waiting for in the short-term is whether the Justice Department  complies with the congressional demands.  </p><p> As you point out, the clock is ticking.  They have a document deadline,  production deadline at 5:00 p.m. this afternoon.  We will see if they turn  over what they're expected to turn over.  My guess is that they are not  going to satisfy the demands of the House Republicans.</p><p> And I think we are going to see this dispute continue to escalate in the  days ahead.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, then they would want to take even aggressive action  against Rod Rosenstein.  Right?  What would it be?  </p><p> DUPREE:  Well, let's see.</p><p> They have got a wide variety of means at their disposal.  At one end of the  spectrum is just the continued drumbeat of public criticism.  They can amp  that up several ways.</p><p> One thing they could do is, they could issue subpoenas.  Another thing they  could do is, they could actually instigate contempt proceedings.  And then  at the extreme end of the other spectrum, it would be impeachment  proceedings.</p><p> I'm hopeful that they're not going to go there and that cooler heads will  prevail and they be able to sit down and work all of this out before we get  to that point.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Where is all of this going?  </p><p> I mean, especially with the Peter Strzok testimony later on, are they more  interested in his case, finding out what he knew and what was the backdrop  for his comments he was making about then candidate Trump, or what?  </p><p> DUPREE:  Yes.  I think that's a lot of what was going on.</p><p> I mean, I think right now, from the perspective of Congress, there was so  much that was going on behind the scenes in 2016 that Congress wants to  know, what was your reason for doing this?  What was your reason for  handling the investigations the way you did? What was the reason for  getting these wiretaps and for conducting the surveillance?</p><p> Were you using an informant?  Was it a spy, that sort of thing?  And the  fact is, DOJ is not in the business normally of turning over documents.   And so I think, institutionally, there's a huge amount of reluctance to  give Congress what it wants.</p><p> But Congress is beating the drum.  They're on the warpath.  They're trying  to fulfill their oversight function here.  And so I think we have a real  collision that's not in any -- is not going to be sorted out in the near  term.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  When I have looked at a lot of the comments from those identified,  like Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, and these other unidentified individuals,  and then, of course, now I know how James Comey felt about then candidate  Trump and how Andy McCabe felt, his number two.</p><p> I have not run across one piece of evidence to show a pro-Trump person or  someone who was biased to like -- to like Donald Trump.  Now, I might have  missed it.  But, again, doesn't this feed the narrative that that was a  stacked deck, because that certainly that stacked deck mantle has been  claimed by a lot of Republicans that they were out to get him?</p><p> DUPREE:  Yes, I certainly haven't seen anything along the lines of what  you're talking about, Neil.</p><p> It all does seem to be one way.  I guess what's surprising and frankly  disappointing to me is that some of these folks, Strzok in particular, and  Page, that even though they were nominally professionals, that they just  weren't able to put aside their political biases.</p><p> Look, the fact is, is that pretty much everyone in the country harbors  inner thoughts, their own political leanings.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Right. </p><p> DUPREE:  But I think, for most people, and certainly for the vast majority  of people in the FBI historically, they been able to put these biases aside  when it comes to the sacred function of law enforcement.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  But did you share whatever opinion -- we all have opinions.  You  would be vanilla if you didn't.</p><p> But did you -- these were aggressively shared and aggressive opinions at  that.  When you were there, was that -- did you kind of know what your  colleagues felt, whether they were investigating someone or not?  </p><p> DUPREE:  No, not in this way.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Yes.  </p><p> DUPREE:  I think what is unusual about this, Neil, is that these were  political comments they were discussing in the context of an ongoing  political investigation.</p><p> It's not as though they were investigating some bank robber and trading  texts about the presidential election.  I mean, not saying that would be  OK, but that would be very different.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Right. </p><p> DUPREE:  What they were doing here is, they were carrying out  investigations involving the very candidates who were running at the same  time they're engaged in this correspondence about how they can advance  their own political views through their official duties.</p><p> That is where it crossed a line.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Yes.  </p><p> You would just love to get the context for these remarks.  What was going  on?  If it's just hatred, I don't know if that is even better or worse.  </p><p> Tom, good seeing you again, my friend.  Thank you.  </p><p> DUPREE:  Likewise.  Thank you, Neil.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p> How about just eliminating ICE?  </p><p> With all this controversy about separating kids from their parents at the  border, and then now trying to reconnect them with their parents, sometimes  far from the border, maybe just get rid of ICE.  Some people are actually  urging that -- after this.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, groups in protests all around wanting to get rid of  ICE.  </p><p> That's right.  After the separation of these kids from their parents, a lot  of folks saying, you know, the problem isn't these coming into our country.   It's the folks who are trying to keep them out and the way they go about  their business.  So, they're actually saying, get rid of ICE.  Put ICE on  ice, if you will.</p><p> Former ICE agent Claude Arnold on that.</p><p> What do you think of that?  </p><p> CLAUDE ARNOLD, FORMER ICE SPECIAL AGENT:  Well, I -- first of all, people  don't understand the breadth of ICE's mission.  </p><p> Immigration enforcement is half of the mission.  It has an entire  component, homeland security investigations, that investigates all crime  related to the border.  </p><p> It's the investigative arm for all of DHS.  It's the second largest  investigative entity in the U.S. government and it investigates a lot of  things, drug smuggling, human trafficking and smuggling, child pornography,  export of illegal technologies.</p><p> It has a huge national security responsibility.  It's the second largest  representation on the Federal Joint Terrorism Task Force after the FBI.  </p><p> So to say you just need to get rid of ICE, I think people don't understand  all that ICE does.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, a lot of them were saying, right after these apprehensions,  well, does it change and does their mission statement change given on the  administration?  It was this administration that, led by Jeff Sessions,  said, we're going to enforce a policy where we can, yes, separate kids from  their parents, something that wasn't done, at least not the same way  exactly, in the Obama administration.  </p><p> So do you have to pivot depending on the administration?  </p><p> ARNOLD:  Well, I think there was a pivot done on how enforcement was  conducted during the Obama administration.  </p><p> And, really, it's just been a return to the status quo.  But people have  been -- they have developed a sense of entitlement that you can just come  to the country illegally and expecting it's OK. </p><p> CAVUTO:  Oh, no, you're quite right.  People forget how we were  apprehending underage kids and then who were -- drugs deals and all.   You're quite right about that.</p><p> ARNOLD:  Right.  Right.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  But who calls that?  Do you answer then to whatever the  presidential directive is or what?</p><p> ARNOLD:  Yes, of course.  You're part of the executive branch.  </p><p> ICE does what the president tells them to do through the executive chain of  command.  I mean, it's the executive branch.</p><p> CAVUTO:  So, if there were no ICE, to these people's interests, the  protesters, who would handle this border stuff?  </p><p> ARNOLD:  Well, here's the important thing here, Neil.  </p><p> What is going on is, the same people who want ICE abolished, they opposed  there being any wall on the border.  They oppose changing the loopholes  that encourage and allow people to stay in the U.S. illegally.  </p><p> So, the last stand against those who make it in here illegally is ICE.  So  if you get rid of ICE, then you completely have open borders and no  immigration enforcement.  And that's by design.  They want that to happen.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Amazing.  </p><p> All right, Claude Arnold, thank you very much, former ICE agent.  He's put  himself in a lot of harm's way over the years just to deal with that.  </p><p> People should remember that, no matter what your feelings on this  particular issue.  </p><p> We will have more after this.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Thirty seconds away from that deadline.  What is Rod Rosenstein  going to do?  Is he going to give the Republicans what they want?</p><p> Tomorrow, we will get the read on all of this from Republican House  Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte.  He also was one of the fellows  who came up with a plan to settle this immigration mess.  His measure went  nowhere, but that doesn't mean that immigration progress couldn't still  come up somewhere.  </p><p> A one-on-one with probably one of the more powerful players on Capitol Hill  tomorrow, Bob Goodlatte.</p><p> We will see you then.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> QUESTION:  And one more, on trade, and following up on what Blake asked  about Harley-Davidson.  They announced in an SEC filing they're moving a  significant amount of their operations to Europe because of the E.U.  tariffs that were placed on Harley-Davidson motorcycles.  Is this what the  President envisioned for what the impact would be by placing tariffs on the  E.U. and the retaliation the E.U. has put on the U. S.?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Again, the European  Union is trying to punish U.S. workers because they have engaged repeatedly  in unfair trade practices.  And the president is saying enough is enough.   We'd like to work with the E.U. to work on a level playing field. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Sorry, Steve, I did come to you.  Go ahead.  </p><p> QUESTION:  The president today in the Oval Office, sitting next to the king  of Jordan, mentioned some progress in the Middle East peace process, but he  didn't give us any specifics. </p><p> There's been quite a bit of back-channel diplomacy going on the last few  days in the Middle East, with Jared Kushner and Jason Greenblatt.  Do you  have anything concrete to -- to tell us about any sort of positive movement  whatsoever, from all of this? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Again, we -- I think that the meetings that took place  over the last week with Senior Adviser Jared Kushner and Special  Representative Jason Greenblatt, they met with a number of officials and  principals in Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, Israel and Qatar last week. </p><p> They discussed the situation in Gaza as well as the next stages of the  peace effort.  We're going to continue those conversations and we're  committed to the peace effort, and we're going to keep working forward.   But those conversations were productive. </p><p> Julie? </p><p> QUESTION:  Sarah, the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection said  today that they are no longer going to be referring people who cross the  border without authorization for criminal charges if they're traveling with  children, which is essentially a return to the Obama administration  practice and administrations before that.  Does the president support that  approach?  And if so, does he regret trying to push forward on a zero- tolerance approach in the first place? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  No.  The president certainly supports keeping families  together, which he has outlined several times over the last week.  But he's  also called on Congress to actually fix the system. </p><p> They're the only ones that ultimately have the ability to change the law.   The president's executive order has given a temporary solution to the  problem but it's not permanent, and we need Congress to step up.  We need  Democrats to stop playing political games, do their jobs, work with this  president and let's fix the problem at the border. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Jeff? </p><p> QUESTION:  Sarah, can you talk about why you tweeted from your official  account about the episode that you had at the restaurant on Friday night? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Sure.  I was responding to a number of news stories.  I  would been reached out to by over a dozen reporters, and there were  multiple news stories that had already been issued. </p><p> It was considered news of the day, so I responded in the way I would to any  other news of the day story. </p><p> Jeff? </p><p> QUESTION:  Sarah, you said just because you don't see a judge doesn't mean  you don't get due process.  Can you explain what you mean by that  specifically, and how the president envisions that this would work while  still maintaining what the Constitution upholds in having a swift  immigration system? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Again, there are other ways for removal.  There are  thousands of illegal aliens that are removed every month that don't see  judges.  Sometimes that's through voluntary removal, and sometimes that's  through expedited removal. </p><p> Again, the president's ultimate goal would be that we have actually a  secure border, and people aren't coming into the country illegally.  But  that we have a system that works and the people that come into the country  come in through a legal system. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Jill? </p><p> QUESTION:  What is the president doing specifically this week to ensure  that Congress passes a bill?  He's spent all week in Nevada talking about - - or, all weekend.  Excuse me -- on Saturday, talking about how Democrats  want open borders and crime.  But, specifically, has he made phone calls to  Republican members in the House, where the bill is pending?  Has he tried  to bring Democrats together?  What is he doing specifically to try and get  a new law passed, specifically, other than just railing against the current  law? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  The president met with a number of lawmakers last week,  talked with several over the weekend, some that he was with while he was  traveling.  Last week, he made an open invitation to Democrat lawmakers --  that they were welcome to come to the White House to discuss what they'd  like to see, because the president wants solutions. </p><p> We've yet to have any of them to show up, actually willing to have those  conversations, actually willing to fix the problem.  Instead, they'd rather  rant and rave about not allowing members of the Trump administration to  step foot in public. </p><p> The president wants to see solutions.  That's what we're focused on.  It's  Congress's job to do that, and we've laid out very clearly that we want to  be part of that and what we'd like to see in that package. </p><p> Jill? </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> QUESTION:  ... on this? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Clearly, they aren't.  If they haven't passed a law to  fix this system, then they haven't.  Republicans have laid out a number of  proposals that they support.  The president has voiced his support for  those. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> QUESTION:  ... probably fail this week, though.  The Republican bills will  probably...</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  That's because no Democrat will get on board and  actually support a solution. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> QUESTION:  ... Republican -- is your Republicans cannot pass these  Republican bills.  What is the president doing as the leader of the party  to try and get Republican...</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Jeff, these aren't Republican bills.  These are bills  that fix a broken system.  They may have Republican sponsors, but these  should be bipartisan.  This shouldn't be complicated.  Look, the House has  already passed over 500 pieces of legislation, but they can't get through  the Senate because Democrats refuse to actually find solutions. </p><p> We have 50 bills that passed just last week to address the opioid crisis --  that passed through the House.  The Senate still hasn't taken them up.   Hopefully, they will.  And, if they do, that will show that we actually can  come up with bipartisan solutions.  And that's what we'd like to see them  do on immigration, as well. </p><p> Jill? </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> QUESTION:  ... follow-up on Julia's question about the zero-tolerance  policy.  The president said, last week, after signing the executive order,  that he believed that zero tolerance was still important.  You guys made a  point of the fact that the E. O.  did not actually get rid of the policy. </p><p> How does that square with the fact that CBP is now saying that they are no  longer referring for prosecution any adults who come in with children? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Again, this is a temporary solution.  This isn't going  to last.  Congress still has to step up.  They still have to do their job.   This will only last a short amount of time because we're going to run out  of space, we're going to run out of resources in order to keep people  together, and we're asking Congress to provide those resources and do their  job.  And...</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> QUESTION:  ... temporary solution -- does that mean, at some point, you are  going to change that policy back? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  We're not changing the policy.  We're simply out of  resources, and, at some point, Congress has to do what they were elected to  do, and that is secure our border.  That is stop the crime coming into our  country. </p><p> The country has made extremely clear that they don't want open borders, and  Democrats need to understand that, and they need to work with Republicans  and find some solutions. </p><p> QUESTION:  And there...</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Annie.  Sorry, Jill, I'm going to keep going.  Annie, go  ahead. </p><p> QUESTION:  Sarah, you mentioned the state of resources and running out of  them.  Can you be specific about what the resources are right now for  housing parents and children together?  Is there enough housing right now?   Is the Pentagon stepping in?  Like, what's being done about the resources?  </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Again, we're looking at every option available.  We have  asked the Pentagon to help with additional space.  But a lot of that will  depend on our ability to stop people coming into the country illegally.   And we, again, encourage people to go through ports of entry instead of  crossing the border illegally. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  We've requested, through legislation -- we're working  with Congress, hopefully, to provide more resources and the ability to  actually enforce the law. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Ayesha? </p><p> QUESTION:  Thank you.  I just want to see if you can kind of narrow down  exactly what the president actually intends to do when it comes to this  idea of not having judges.  You say that there are instances where people  don't have judges, but my understanding is that, if you do ask for asylum,  you do have certain rights. </p><p> So is there going to be a change in that policy, or what is this  administration planning to do to make it so you don't have to see a judge?   (INAUDIBLE)  </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Again, I have addressed this a couple times.  There are  multiple instances in where you wouldn't:  voluntary removal, certain cases  have expedited removal.  If somebody comes through a port of entry seeking  asylum, those cases and that process will be heard.  But at the same time,  the president's ultimate goal is to secure the border and stop illegal  immigration. </p><p> QUESTION:  I -- I -- I understand that, but so what does that mean  practically?  Like, is the president planning to do anything differently,  or are you just saying, you don't like the way (INAUDIBLE) now? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  The president's laid out what he'd like to see.  We've  put out the things that we want to see in an immigration package months  ago.  We're still waiting on Congress to give us the ability to do that. </p><p> QUESTION:  So -- so unless Congress acts, nothing is actually going to  change?  The administration is not changing anything right now, when it  comes to judges? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  You mean, are we walking around making up laws?  No,  because we're not the Obama administration.  We're actually trying to  enforce the laws that are on the books.  We're actually asking Congress to  do their part in the process, and pass new legislation that will fix our  immigration system. </p><p> QUESTION:  So -- but nothing is actually changing on the ground.  Like,  this -- so this is -- the president's complaining about judges, and saying  that we shouldn't have all these judges, and people who come over should  just be put out, but nothing is actually going to change.  He's just saying  -- he's just complaining about the process as it stands now. </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Things that we have the ability to do administratively,  we are working to do.  But again, Congress is the only one that has the  ability to write law, and we hope they'll do that. </p><p> Steve? </p><p> QUESTION:  I'm honing in on that point.  I'm trying to understand what it  is the president understands about the current policy, because as you've  explained, expedited removal allows the government to remove hundreds of  thousands of illegal immigrants a year without seeing judges.  Did the  president know that when he issued the tweets? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Yeah, but there are still thousands that go through a  very lengthy process.  We'd like to see the process consolidated.  We'd  like to see the backlog stopped.  We'd like to see our border secured. </p><p> Sorry, Steve, I'm going to keep going. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> QUESTION:  Under current law there are a couple of things that the  president could do.  You could expand that policy.  You've said that he  would like to see more expedited removal.  Does the president intend to  expand it to the full two-year limit under the current statute? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Again, we would like to see more expedited removal, but  ultimately, we would like to see the border secured and people stop coming  into the country illegally.  That seems pretty simple to me, and it would  stop a lot of the problems, and would eliminate the need for so many of  these additional laws. </p><p> QUESTION:  Thanks, Sarah.  The gal in the briefing talking about the  importance of civility.  Do you consider it a civil policy to separate more  than two thirds of the children from their parents? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  We consider enforcing the law the role that the  administration has to play.  Certainly, the president has taken an  executive action to the furthest that he has the ability to do to minimize  the separation of families.  We're working hard to make sure families get  to stay together, and we're calling on Congress to help us in that effort,  and we're continuing to focus on the reunification, and making sure that  the families, again, stay together, and that Congress will give us a  permanent solution to fix that. </p><p> QUESTION:  But you say that you're working to make families stay together.   It was your administration that separated them in the first place. </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  It wasn't our administration that created these laws,  but it is our administration's job to enforce it, and we've done that.  If  someone breaks the law, it's our job to enforce it.  If somebody doesn't  like the law, then they need to lobby Congress and ask them to change it.  </p><p> Anita. </p><p> QUESTION:  I have, one, an immigration question, and wanted to clarify one  thing.  So I understand that not every adult with a child is going to be  prosecuted.  If there are families that are being held together, detained  together somewhere and 20 days goes by, what is going to happen then?  I  didn't get an -- an answer with that last week.  I don't understand.  The  law says you can't keep them together, keep the children, even with parents  for longer than 20 days.  So then what happens? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Hopefully, Congress will pass the law and fix the  problem. </p><p> QUESTION:  (INAUDIBLE) 20 days? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Well, why should it be so hard?  They all say that they  don't want to separate families.  Seems like it should be pretty simple to  me. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  John? </p><p> QUESTION:  I said I had a clarification...</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Go ahead. </p><p> QUESTION:  ... so Jeff asked you a question about Congress and the bill.   Were you, in your response, referring to just a stand-alone bill that deals  with family separation, or were you referring to the bigger immigration  bill that the House hopes to take up this week? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Our preference would be a bill that addresses all of the  pillars that we've laid out, that we'd like to see addressed in an  immigration package.  And that's what our focus is right now, is there's a  bill that does that on the table. </p><p> If that doesn't happen, then we'll talk about other pieces of legislation  at that point. </p><p> QUESTION:  (INAUDIBLE) the president still wants that bill to go forward  even though he said...</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Certain...</p><p> QUESTION:  ... they don't want to -- he -- they shouldn't waste their time  on it? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Look, Democrats in the Senate have made clear they're  not going to support this.  </p><p> And because we need at least some Democrats to get on board, they've made  it very clear that they don't want to work with the president, that they  don't want to fix our immigration system.  That they'd rather have open  borders and rampant crime than work with the president to create solutions.   Until they change their mind, we're going to continue looking at the best  ways that we can fix these problems but we need Congress to help us. </p><p> John. </p><p> QUESTION:  Thank you, Sarah.  This president is the first in the television  age who has yet to address the American public on nationwide television  from the Oval Office.  Many Republican consultants have said that he might  have a stronger hand in influencing Congress if he made a nationally  televised address on immigration and what changes he'd like to see, to  explain it. </p><p> Is that something that's on the table within the administration? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Certainly don't want to take anything off the table, or  any tool away from the president.  He does address the American people in a  number of different venues and formats.  And I will certainly pass along  that suggestion to him. </p><p> Nadia. </p><p> QUESTION:  Just a follow-up on the Middle East.  In the recent (INAUDIBLE)  Mr. Kushner said that if President Abbas is not willing to negotiate, he's  going to proceed with the deal.  Can you explain how the White House is  hoping to achieve any progress in the Middle East peace talks if the  principal party is not taking part in it? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  We're going to continue meeting with the other partners  in the region.  And, again, we're going to continue pushing forward in the  peace process.  We had productive meetings over the last week.  We're going  to continue those conversations. </p><p> I will take one last question.  Saagar.  </p><p> QUESTION:  Thanks, Sarah.  </p><p> To follow up on the judges -- on the issue of immigration judges, why is  the President so opposed to an increase in the number of immigration judges  when it would expedite the asylum processing -- the asylum process and  expedite deportation?  </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  We're not opposed to the speeding up the process.  What  the President would like to see, once again, is that we stop the problem at  the very beginning.  He'd like to see us secure the border and people work  through the system, through the ports of entry, so that we're not dealing  with things on the back end.  </p><p> We'd like to stop the problem before it starts, and that's what the  president's focus has been all along, is on securing the border.  And  that's what we're going to continue to do.  </p><p> Thanks so much guys.  Have a great day.  </p><p> NEIL CAVUTO, HOST:  All right, you have been listening to Sarah Sanders  here.</p><p> And it's safe to say the Washington press corps is more concerned with the  immigration issue than a lot of folks losing their shirts today on this  whole trade issue.  </p><p> Welcome, everybody.  I'm Neil Cavuto.  And you're watching \"Your World.\"</p><p> And it could have worse.  As I show you the Dow today down about 328  points, we had been down almost 500 points, and a lot of that over a  building trade war and concerns this could get worse before it gets better,  or that there are no signs of concessions on the part of any of the  principal parties, namely the Chinese and ourselves.  </p><p> All of this on the same day that Harley-Davidson was indicating, because of  these threat of tariffs, they're moving a lot of their operations outside  the U.S.</p><p> On a separate issue, General Motors has indicated that a lot of its Chevy  Blazers will now be made in Mexico, not citing just the trade issue,  but  that it's not welcome noise here.</p><p> So, again, this could have a lot been worse.  There was some confusion  early on in the markets as to whether the administration was also  recommending that they were urging the Chinese and others not to invest in  technology stocks at all.  </p><p> Then Peter Navarro ends up popping up on CNBC to say, no, no, no, no, no,  they're not going to be, nor are there plans in the works for investment  restrictions on China.</p><p> And that brought us down to the levels we're at right now, about 328 points  southward on what was a crazy day on the markets.</p><p> We're going to be at this from all angles right now.</p><p> Let's first go to FOX Business Network's Deirdre Bolton with how it all  sorted out.</p><p> Hey, Deirdre.</p><p> DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, Neil.  </p><p> You said it.  It could have been much worse.  So, the markets did close  clearly lower, but certainly off the low points of the day.  And, of  course, the big headline, the Trump administration moving to block Chinese  companies from investing in U.S. tech firms and moving to block additional  tech exports from the U.S. to China.  </p><p> Our sources are saying the Treasury Department is going to make an official  announcement at the end of this week, bring us more clarity, more details  on the plan.  </p><p> Now, the level of difficulty is, of course, much higher when you start to  talk about blocking investment than when we're just engaging in tariff  spats.  So the stock market heading for the biggest one-day slide in  months.  </p><p> That's how we finished up.  You can see red across the screen.  One area I  really wanted to highlight are the techs, because S&amp;P 500 tech companies  get about 60 percent of their revenue from overseas.  So that's the highest  foreign exposure out of any of the index's 11 sectors.  </p><p> And, of course,critics of our current trade policy say that China has been  stealing anywhere between $30 billion and $50 billion worth of intellectual  property, hard data, every year for the past decade.  But then there was  even a stronger report, a more recent one that came out from the Commission  on the Theft of American Intellectual Property.</p><p> It has a much higher number, stating that up to $600 billion in theft that  has some projections baked in is possible.  But experts say, bottom line,  the motivation to want to level the playing field is completely  understandable.  </p><p> What gets complicated is that so many American businesses are  interconnected.  So, for example, here's seven big tech American companies  that source half of their products and components from China.  </p><p> So, HP, IBM, Dell, Cisco, Unisys, Microsoft, Intel.  Even Apple has sold  more iPhones in China in the last three years than in the U.S.  And Apple  gets about 20 percent of its annual revenue from China.  </p><p> Now, the Chinese president of course says China will punch back and will  not be forced to eat the bitter fruit.  That is a translation, a direct  quote.  </p><p> But as the tension rises between the world's two biggest economies, of  course, investors really showed their anxiety.  So, we had the Nasdaq, you  can see there, closely lower, essentially 2 percent, biggest one-day  percentage decline since March.  Third day down in a row.  So, that's the  longest losing streak for that tech-heavy comp in about two months' time.</p><p> Even Asia overnight, you can see how markets reacted there.  You can see  Hong Kong's Hang Seng down by more than 1 percent.  And, then, of course,  even on our own bond market, right, there was this flight to safety in U.S.  10-year.  Investors typically, of course, buy these bonds when they're  fearful or they feel less certain of the future.  </p><p> And prices really went up, so, therefore, those yields went down, settling  2.875 percent.  And just worth noting, these yields have fallen basically  for the past four out of five weeks.  </p><p> So, Neil, what is clear is, investors really don't know what to make of it.   We have the tariffs and now we have this idea of blocking direct  investment, which is a much more muscular and, quite frankly, threatening  move than tariffs, which really only apply to very specific products, Neil.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Absolutely, especially when they go back and forth either way.</p><p> BOLTON:  Yes.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Thank you very, very much, Deirdre Bolton.</p><p> BOLTON:  Sure.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Doesn't Harley-Davidson know that?  Not so much on the tariffs  we're considering, but the response that company is getting and opting to  do something that the president probably didn't envision.  </p><p>FOX Business Network's Jeff Flock in Countryside, Illinois.  </p><p> What did they do?  </p><p> JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  They're getting a double  whammy at Harley-Davidson, Neil, because the steel and aluminum tariffs hit  their raw materials costs.</p><p> And now the European Union, of course, imposing an addition 25 percent  tariff on motorcycles made here and shipped to Europe.</p><p> And so Harley is in a tough spot.  That tariff went from 6 percent to 31  percent.  And today, in a regulatory filing, Harley said that is going to  add more than $2,000 a bike to the cost of a motorcycle made here in the  U.S. and sold in Europe.  And they can't possibly pass that along to  consumers.</p><p> So, in the short-term, they're going to have to eat it.  In the long term,  they're going to move production away from the U.S.  Europe was an  expanding market for Harley-Davidson.  They love it over there.  And U.S.  sales have been down.</p><p> You look at the first quarter of this year, U.S. sales of Harleys down  double digits, as guys like me get older and maybe give up their  motorcycles.  In Europe, it had been growing by about 7 percent.  </p><p> And so those bikes, made in the U.S. and shipped to Europe, will be no  more.  Harley has four plants here in the U.S., York, Pennsylvania, Kansas  City, Missouri, and two in their home state of Wisconsin, and now  apparently bikes destined for Europe will not be made there anymore.</p><p> Instead, they will be made in places like Brazil and elsewhere, Thailand  and Australia.  This is not, as you pointed out at the outset, what the  president had intended.  His trade policies designed to keep and create  jobs here in the U.S.  In this case, it appears they will be eliminating  them -- Neil.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Amazing.</p><p> All right, Jeff Flock, thank you very, very much.  </p><p> All right, Mattie Duppler is.  We have got Charles Payne here, Larry Shover  here as well of SFG, alternate CME trader as well.  </p><p> Charles Payne, what is going on here?  We knew the trade thing was getting  antsy, but it seemed like the bottom fell out.  </p><p> CHARLES PAYNE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  It did, but because I think this had  a little bit of a different twist.</p><p> This was investment.  This is about -- the whole thing, by the way, is  centered on made in China 2025.  The administration, which I wish they  would articulate what they're trying to do, because I understand, and I  think most -- a lot of people do -- and it's the idea of curbing this  ambition, the stated ambition by China to sort of be the world's tech  leader in a short period of time.</p><p> And one way to get there, perhaps the only way they can get their with  their own timeline, is to continue to steal our intellectual property.</p><p> So the idea is to restrict investments from companies where China has a 25  percent or more ownership.  And, again, this was just speculation.  It was  in a few media outlets, the White House trying to take -- take it back a  little bit.  It's something obviously that they have toyed around with.</p><p> Peter Navarro has talked about this kind of thing for maybe two decades, so  this is not necessarily news, per se.  But it is -- it is a different  twist, to your point.  It's not -- it's not the trade stuff anymore, as  much as it is, hey, we want to take direct aim at your ambitions to usurp  America's perch as the world's tech leader.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, Larry, what worried a lot in the markets is that, all of a  sudden, then we were putting a general wall up on Chinese investment in  general and technology period.  </p><p> That's how it was interpreted.  And then, later on, the treasury secretary,  Mnuchin, came out to say, no, no, no, it wasn't singling out China, as if  to say there's other players here, as if that eased the angst.  </p><p> It actually compounded that.  But what do you make of that?  </p><p> LARRY SHOVER, SOLUTIONS FUNDS GROUP:  Well, what I make of it is that two  things.</p><p> The whole thing lacked clarity.  Like, it didn't matter.  Like, this whole  China tweets and tirades, it didn't matter because it lacked clarity.  It  seemed like the White House is utterly unprepared to create any kind of  proposal that can go into law.</p><p> Immigration policy is a good proof of that.  Also, it lacks credibility,  because we all know -- I mean, this does -- this hurts us more than it  hurts them, the fact that it's going to kill Apple or Nike.  It really,  really hurt them manufacturing their goods there that are sent to us.</p><p> So it doesn't make any sense.  People dismissed it.  And I really think  people are definitely blaming the China trade today.  The bigger problem,  though, it's really tech.  We saw that breaking down last week.</p><p> Leadership has been very thin in the stock market.  Without five or six  super cap techs in the S&amp;P 500...</p><p> CAVUTO:  Yes.  </p><p> SHOVER:  ... we would be down 4 percent, instead of up 1.5 percent.</p><p> But it started to crack.  The Supreme Court came out last week with a  ruling on sales tax, et cetera.  That chasm between growth and value has  been very, very wide.  The market is vulnerable.  The ball will always find  you when you're out of position.</p><p> And that's really what happened today.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  And people were a little anxious on that investment angle here and  maybe finding an excuse for technology, which ran up far and fast, to sell  off some of it.</p><p> But, Mattie, it's sort of this impression that not everyone in the  administration seems to be on the same page.  I'm getting different vibes  from the Treasury secretary, different vibes from their trade  representatives, different vibes from the president.</p><p> MATTIE DUPPLER, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S FORUM:  Right.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  And I think that's the kind of thing that scares markets.  </p><p> DUPPLER:  Oh, absolutely.</p><p> You finally have consensus on this panel, Neil.  And that's, what the heck  is the administration intending to do with these trade efforts?</p><p> Charles and I don't always agree on this issue, but right now we're both  wondering, what is the objective here?  And that's what the administration  needs to clarify.  It needs to make clear what it intends to do with all of  these efforts towards China.</p><p> Now, if the objective here is to exact the most amount of pain and pressure  on China possible, they need to make sure that they're not injecting pain  on American businesses.  And that's a concern, especially when you look at  really artificially diminishing the amount of capital that can come into  this country.</p><p> I worry about the impact on businesses.  And that's not even getting to  what tariffs are doing to American businesses, where we have already seen  some of those announcements this week.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Or even the threat of them.</p><p> But, Charles, the other thing you mentioned -- and this -- you can help me  out here.  It's always been that the Chinese are in bad shape here.   They're at two-year-plus lows in their market.  They have a lot more to  lose than we do.</p><p> But they also have their pride, and they're not giving any ground.  So, how  is this resolved, if it is?</p><p> PAYNE:  And this is where I disagree with Larry.  </p><p> I don't think -- I think a lot of people are raising the white flag so  quickly that China is going to beat us at this.  They're not.  If it has to  go the whole way... </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  The whole way could be years.  </p><p> PAYNE:  Yes, Sure.</p><p> Mattie makes the right point.  It's sort of like when my pops used to take  me out in the back.  He says, it's going to hurt me as much as it hurts  you.  </p><p> No, it won't.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> PAYNE:  With that being said, let's look at what China did today, this  morning.  </p><p> Their central bank freed up banks over there to the tune of $100 billion.   Right?  This is to sort of...</p><p> CAVUTO:  It needs a stimulant.</p><p> PAYNE:  ... to do things thing on debt.  </p><p> Last week, it was $30 billion.  A week before that, it was $30 billion.   Their foreign and reserve currencies have dropped a trillion dollars.  </p><p> Their debt-to-GDP ratio is on its way to 300 percent.  We aren't going to  lose this.  China knows we're not going to lose this.  Nobody wants to  lose.  It's a matter of how, to your point, do you save face and resolve  it?</p><p> CAVUTO:  I think that's where we are.  </p><p> Larry, the Chinese, remember, today indicating, you know, we don't just  turn a cheek on this.  And we come back and we're going to fight back.  </p><p> Now, to be clear, no response to the tariffs yet with tariffs of their own.   In other words, to increase the amount to match the United States, when we  promised we would put $200 billion on top of that.</p><p> Some read into that a sign that the Chinese are trying to find a middle  ground here, where they can talk tough, but they don't have to respond in  kind and invite a war.  What do you see?  </p><p> SHOVER:  Yes.</p><p> Well, I see that they have already done that, just what we said.  Required  reserve ratio dropped 50 basis points yesterday, adding all that liquidity  into the market.  What did that do?  That dropped RMB by 1.5 percent in  five days, 3.5 percent over the last month.  </p><p> So they're already ready.  That is going to negate any kind of trade tariff  that we are going to impose.  And I think they know, at the end of the day,  that there's so lack of clarity coming out of the White House, that they're  just preparing for it.  </p><p> Also realizing that they have had a real soft patch of data coming in.  So,  perhaps Trump is trying to hit them while they're weak.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  We will see.</p><p> All right, guys, I apologize jumping on you.  We have got a lot of breaking  news here.  </p><p> I do want to bring in my next guest, the former Heinz CEO Bill Johnson, a  global read of things, if ever there were one.  </p><p> And, Bill, I'm looking at this and wondering what the signals could be for  us.  If a company, one after the other, like GM considering making all its  Blazers now in Mexico, and, of course, we have been talking about a number  of other companies that have been doing the same or considering preemptive  move like Harley-Davidson, that has got to have a domestic economic impact.</p><p> BILL JOHNSON, FORMER CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, H.J. HEINZ COMPANY:  It should, Neil.  </p><p> Nothing has happened yet to impact the economy here.  And, frankly, the  Chinese and European economies...</p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, they're already leaving.  Those guys are already making some  moves.  </p><p> JOHNSON:  I understand.  But they're more vulnerable than we are.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  True.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Having said that, this is like tic-tac-toe.  Nobody wins.  </p><p> I play tic-tac-toe with any grandkids.  And you never win.  And that's what  this is now.  We have gotten to the point on this situation...</p><p> CAVUTO:  You never won at tic-tac-toe with your grandkids?  </p><p> JOHNSON:  No.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  You're one of the most celebrated CEOs ever.  And... </p><p> JOHNSON:  Yes.  That just shows you nobody wins, Neil.  And that's where we  are right now.  Nobody wins.</p><p> CAVUTO:  So, that's where you see -- that's where we are right now?</p><p> JOHNSON:  I do think that's where we are.</p><p> I think this created a huge environment of uncertainty.  You and I have had  this conversation many times.  Uncertainty leads to volatility.  Volatility  leads to more uncertainty.  And we get in this vicious cycle.  </p><p> And I think that's where we are now.  Having said that, I think,  ultimately, saner and cooler heads will prevail, and this will somehow get  resolved.  </p><p> I hope this is not a negotiation ploy, because it's rather ham-fisted.  And  there has got to be better ways to attack this issue than the one that is  being generated right now.</p><p> CAVUTO:  What do you make -- I think it was ratcheted up a little bit today  to go after in this case the Chinese for investing in technology.</p><p> It was read as, we're not going to allow them to invest in any technology  companies.  And that might have been a prematurely wrong impression.  But  that was the one that was out there for hours in the markets.  They had to  dial that back a little bit.</p><p> But they're still looking at putting a limit to who can invest in  technology.  That's how it interpreted, hence, technology falls off a lot.   So if this is more from just goods and services to, I don't know, even  companies and stocks you invest in, then what?  </p><p> JOHNSON:  Well, then I think we have chaos, Neil. </p><p> I don't think you can stop the investment in a capitalist society.  It's  just the way the system works.  And while I understand why the  administration is going after some of these issues -- and they're sort of  going where people have been afraid to tread before -- the reality is, we  have to have some clarity in the communication of the purpose of what we're  trying to achieve and then take a step-by-step process in which to achieve  it.  </p><p> And I heard about the investment situation this morning.  Then I saw  Secretary Mnuchin's response.  And so I'm completely unclear as to what is  happening.  And there we go again.  That creates more uncertainty, which  creates more volatility, and leaves us all in the dark about what it is  we're trying to achieve.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Now, there used to be an old rule here following this president  the last 18 months that those who doubted him would be proven wrong, and  that everything ends up OK and markets come back from what look like  debacles, and people who second-guessed him have been proven wrong.  </p><p> So there was this now new -- or renewed trust that President Trump must  know what he's doing, there's a method to all of this.  </p><p> Do you subscribe to that, or is there now a reassessment, well, maybe not.   Maybe this is a little impulsive.  Maybe there's not a method to the  madness.  Maybe it's just madness.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Well, I think, historically, over his last 18 months in office,  he's done a pretty good job of bringing us back from the brink and  achieving great success.  </p><p>North Korea seems to be an example of one of those areas.  But I don't  know.  I don't like this whole approach, Neil.  I think it's so ham-fisted  and so unpredictable that sometimes you create a fire out of a smoke bomb,  and the next thing you know, you have got a real conflagration going, and  you don't know how to put it out.  And that -- I'm worried we're headed  that way.</p><p> Having said that, I will give him credit for again treading in these places  that need to be addressed.  I just think there's better ways to do it.  But  I'm not yet ready to say that we're just going to pull this one back from  the brink and everyone is going to be happy.  </p><p> I just don't know.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  We shall see, my friend.  Thank you very, very much.  </p><p> Good luck in your next tic-tac-toe game.  I give the edge to you still.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> JOHNSON:  Thank you.  Thank you.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  William Johnson, the former Heinz CEO, if anyone knows the global  landscape, it is he.  All right. </p><p> All right, when we come back here, this nastiness with Democrats saying  that we're going to get nasty no matter where Republicans gather.  </p><p> Really?  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Yikes, 25 minutes, right, a 5:00 p.m. deadline staring down now,  as House Republicans want documents from the Justice Department on that  Clinton e-mail probe and the Russian investigation.  Then what happens if  they don't get them?  </p><p> After this.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. MAXINE WATERS (D), CALIFORNIA:  And if you see anybody from that  Cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you  get out and you create a crowd.  </p><p> (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)</p><p> WATERS:  And you push back on them.  And you tell them they're not welcome.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, anyway, American Majority CEO Ned Ryun.  We have got Olympic  Media managing editor Katie Frates and Democratic strategist Christy  Setzer.</p><p> I don't know where to begin.  But, Katie, maybe you can help me with this.  </p><p> This is out of control.  This is just crazy talk.  What do you make of it?  </p><p> KATIE FRATES, OLYMPIC MEDIA:  It absolutely is.  </p><p> This is just going way too far, because she doesn't even know who she is  speaking to, Maxine Waters, when she is saying this.  What if someone sees  somebody at a gas station and takes it way too far?  </p><p> You're essentially encouraging anyone of any mental state, of any level of  discourse, to go up and potentially harm someone else because of their  political beliefs.  That's absolutely not OK.  </p><p> I'm so excited and happy to see at least Nancy Pelosi push back on this.   I'm not sure why more Democratic leaders are not speaking up and condemning  this.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, there were a good number.  To be fair, there were a good  number, Elijah Cummings and all saying...</p><p> FRATES:  Good.  Good.</p><p> CAVUTO:  ... that, even when it came to the Sanders situation, she  shouldn't have been taken out of the restaurant.  </p><p> But, Ned, I'm worried more about the increasing vitriol.  And we're seeing  more and more of it.  And anything could happen in that environment.</p><p> NED RYUN, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN MAJORITY:  No.</p><p> And I think really what we're seeing is, to sum up Charles Krauthammer, we  conservatives, we think the left is philosophically misguided, and many on  the left think we're evil.  </p><p> And I think you're seeing this rhetoric ramp up where borders are now  bigotry and American presidents standing up for the America taxpayer, well,  this is Nazism and the second coming of the Holocaust.  </p><p> And I think what the left is trying to do is say, the debate is over in our  minds because we consider your ideas to be irrational.  We don't consider  your ideas to be legitimate.  </p><p> And if they can dehumanize the other side, that's what they want to do,  because that justifies driving opposing thought from the public square.  </p><p> The thing that troubles me, Neil, about all of this, this kind of  incitement to physical intimidation and bullying is not to be normalized.   It's not normal for a constitutional republic.  It's only normal in banana  republics.  And if the left wants to beat us, try doing it at the ballot  box in 2018 and 2020.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Do you worry about that, Christy?  </p><p> As a Democratic strategist, and a darn good one, and a very calm person, I  might point out, that your party could be ruining it for itself, that it's  actually scaring some people with that kind of talk, whether you agree or  disagree with the politics behind it.  </p><p> CHRISTY SETZER, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  I just think it's impossible to put  Maxine Waters' comments like this in a vacuum like this.</p><p> The defining feature of Donald Trump's campaign was not that he was going  to shake stuff up in Washington or that he was a great businessman.  It was  this incivility.  Right?  </p><p> He started talking about how, I like people that were not captured about  John McCain.  Then you looked as his rallies, where they were filled with  him actively asking them to take violence against protesters.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  If that is what your view is, do you think that the response,  responding in kind, then, if that's your view, is justified?</p><p> SETZER:  I don't think that -- no, I don't think that we have responded in  kind.  </p><p> I think that Democrats are saying, look, we need to make it just a little  bit uncomfortable.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  You have got whole groups that target a homeland security  secretary at a restaurant.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> SETZER:  No, no, no, no.  Not with violence, Neil.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> SETZER:  That's an extraordinarily important difference.  Not with  violence.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Please listen to me.  </p><p> Sarah Sanders, her incident, Secretary Nielsen outside her home and in a  restaurant, then Maxine Waters justifying it.  I could go on to talk about  Florida's Pam Bondi and what she dealt with at a movie.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> CAVUTO:  Stephen Miller and be called a fascist while he's out.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> SETZER:  Protest is a healthy part of the American tradition, not violence,  not violence.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  You're fine with this.  You're fine with it.  </p><p> But if it were done in reverse, you wouldn't be fine with it.</p><p> SETZER:  I would be absolutely fine with it.  I would be fine with it,  because, again, protest is absolutely fine.</p><p> What is not fine...</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  You just said when you didn't like it what Donald Trump and his  people were doing the same.  </p><p> SETZER:  I'm sorry?</p><p> CAVUTO:  You didn't like it when Donald Trump was doing that.</p><p> SETZER:  No.  What Donald Trump was saying was, I want that guy to be taken  out on a stretcher.  What Donald Trump was doing was actually what Ned Ryun  was just talking about right now, which is dehumanizing the other side.</p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, I don't get it.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  All right.  OK.</p><p> Mattie, do you believe that this is going too far?  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> SETZER:  By talking about how they're animals and infesting America.</p><p> CAVUTO:  I understand.  I heard you.</p><p> SETZER:  That's very different.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Mattie, has this gone too far?  Mattie, you're in awe, aren't you?  </p><p> FRATES:  Yes, yes.  Absolutely, it is.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Katie, I apologize.  I apologize.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  See that?  I lose my place, because I get so wrapped up in it.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Is it your sense that this gets worse, though?  Are you getting a  sense it gets worse?</p><p> FRATES:  So, this is the problem.  </p><p> It's that this is escalating rhetoric.  You're essentially saying mob  someone outside of a gas station.  </p><p> RYUN:  Exactly.  </p><p> FRATES:  And, again, you don't know the intentions of the person who may  then go on to do that.  </p><p> So what if someone is attacked?  What if something violent happens?  And  then you turn around and you say, well, Maxine Waters was telling people to  do that.  It's not a good idea and it's not a healthy dialogue.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> SETZER:  Do we remember the Pizzagate conspiracy, how a crazy conspiracy  actually led someone to take a gun to my, my local pizza place, actually,  and try to shoot it up because they had heard this crazy idea on the  Internet and by Alex Jones and others that Hillary Clinton and John Podesta  were up to no good?  </p><p> That led to actual violence.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, I don't want to get in a tit for tat.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  I sometimes feel like I'm separating my teenage sons.  </p><p> But, Ned Ryun, I do know this.  We have all got to bring the octane down a  little bit on all sides here.  </p><p> RYUN:  We do.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  But how do we do that?  </p><p> And should it be incumbent people to just to say, there has got to be a  better way?  Whether the Elijah Cummings approach, this has got to stop,  whether Sarah Sanders' approach, I just politely up and left, and I tried  not to make a big deal of it at the scene, what is it?  What is the answer?</p><p> RYUN:  No.  I think we have got to start policing our own.  We have to  start policing ourselves on the right and the left.  </p><p> And I was encouraged by Nancy Pelosi saying that Maxine Waters' statement  was unacceptable.  I think we have to be honest about it on the right, too,  when we see unacceptable statements.  And I have said this again -- I have  said this before.  I will say it again.  </p><p> When Donald Trump -- I love 85 to 90 percent of his Twitter feed.  When he  is talking about bloody face-lift, you will never me defend that.  I want  him to focus on the positives and policy and all these things.</p><p> When it becomes personal, I think we need to call out our side and say,  this is not how we have more civil discourse in the public arena.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Fully agree.  Fully agree.  </p><p> At our core, guys, we're all human beings.  </p><p> RYUN:  We're all Americans.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  And we can agree to disagree.  But we don't have to be asses in  the process.  </p><p> And none of you are, by the way.  </p><p> But I want to thank you all very, very much.</p><p> And, Katie, I apologize.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> FRATES:  No, no apology needed.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  I get so apoplectic.  And I don't even know why.  And it's not  even dinnertime.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, by the way, we're close to the witching hour, 5:00 p.m.  Eastern time, that document deadline.  But right now there's indications  the people who have put out that deadline aren't going to get the response  they want in time for that deadline.  </p><p> Then what?  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right.  Between a deadline coming up in about 15 minutes from  now and, of course, this is the week we're going to see some big testimony  up on Capitol Hill, much of it is behind closed doors.</p><p> Let's get the read from former Justice Department official Tom Dupree.  </p><p> Tom, what is the biggest thing you're waiting for?  </p><p> TOM DUPREE, FORMER JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:  Well, the biggest thing  I'm waiting for in the short-term is whether the Justice Department  complies with the congressional demands.  </p><p> As you point out, the clock is ticking.  They have a document deadline,  production deadline at 5:00 p.m. this afternoon.  We will see if they turn  over what they're expected to turn over.  My guess is that they are not  going to satisfy the demands of the House Republicans.</p><p> And I think we are going to see this dispute continue to escalate in the  days ahead.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, then they would want to take even aggressive action  against Rod Rosenstein.  Right?  What would it be?  </p><p> DUPREE:  Well, let's see.</p><p> They have got a wide variety of means at their disposal.  At one end of the  spectrum is just the continued drumbeat of public criticism.  They can amp  that up several ways.</p><p> One thing they could do is, they could issue subpoenas.  Another thing they  could do is, they could actually instigate contempt proceedings.  And then  at the extreme end of the other spectrum, it would be impeachment  proceedings.</p><p> I'm hopeful that they're not going to go there and that cooler heads will  prevail and they be able to sit down and work all of this out before we get  to that point.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Where is all of this going?  </p><p> I mean, especially with the Peter Strzok testimony later on, are they more  interested in his case, finding out what he knew and what was the backdrop  for his comments he was making about then candidate Trump, or what?  </p><p> DUPREE:  Yes.  I think that's a lot of what was going on.</p><p> I mean, I think right now, from the perspective of Congress, there was so  much that was going on behind the scenes in 2016 that Congress wants to  know, what was your reason for doing this?  What was your reason for  handling the investigations the way you did? What was the reason for  getting these wiretaps and for conducting the surveillance?</p><p> Were you using an informant?  Was it a spy, that sort of thing?  And the  fact is, DOJ is not in the business normally of turning over documents.   And so I think, institutionally, there's a huge amount of reluctance to  give Congress what it wants.</p><p> But Congress is beating the drum.  They're on the warpath.  They're trying  to fulfill their oversight function here.  And so I think we have a real  collision that's not in any -- is not going to be sorted out in the near  term.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  When I have looked at a lot of the comments from those identified,  like Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, and these other unidentified individuals,  and then, of course, now I know how James Comey felt about then candidate  Trump and how Andy McCabe felt, his number two.</p><p> I have not run across one piece of evidence to show a pro-Trump person or  someone who was biased to like -- to like Donald Trump.  Now, I might have  missed it.  But, again, doesn't this feed the narrative that that was a  stacked deck, because that certainly that stacked deck mantle has been  claimed by a lot of Republicans that they were out to get him?</p><p> DUPREE:  Yes, I certainly haven't seen anything along the lines of what  you're talking about, Neil.</p><p> It all does seem to be one way.  I guess what's surprising and frankly  disappointing to me is that some of these folks, Strzok in particular, and  Page, that even though they were nominally professionals, that they just  weren't able to put aside their political biases.</p><p> Look, the fact is, is that pretty much everyone in the country harbors  inner thoughts, their own political leanings.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Right. </p><p> DUPREE:  But I think, for most people, and certainly for the vast majority  of people in the FBI historically, they been able to put these biases aside  when it comes to the sacred function of law enforcement.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  But did you share whatever opinion -- we all have opinions.  You  would be vanilla if you didn't.</p><p> But did you -- these were aggressively shared and aggressive opinions at  that.  When you were there, was that -- did you kind of know what your  colleagues felt, whether they were investigating someone or not?  </p><p> DUPREE:  No, not in this way.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Yes.  </p><p> DUPREE:  I think what is unusual about this, Neil, is that these were  political comments they were discussing in the context of an ongoing  political investigation.</p><p> It's not as though they were investigating some bank robber and trading  texts about the presidential election.  I mean, not saying that would be  OK, but that would be very different.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Right. </p><p> DUPREE:  What they were doing here is, they were carrying out  investigations involving the very candidates who were running at the same  time they're engaged in this correspondence about how they can advance  their own political views through their official duties.</p><p> That is where it crossed a line.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Yes.  </p><p> You would just love to get the context for these remarks.  What was going  on?  If it's just hatred, I don't know if that is even better or worse.  </p><p> Tom, good seeing you again, my friend.  Thank you.  </p><p> DUPREE:  Likewise.  Thank you, Neil.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p> How about just eliminating ICE?  </p><p> With all this controversy about separating kids from their parents at the  border, and then now trying to reconnect them with their parents, sometimes  far from the border, maybe just get rid of ICE.  Some people are actually  urging that -- after this.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, groups in protests all around wanting to get rid of  ICE.  </p><p> That's right.  After the separation of these kids from their parents, a lot  of folks saying, you know, the problem isn't these coming into our country.   It's the folks who are trying to keep them out and the way they go about  their business.  So, they're actually saying, get rid of ICE.  Put ICE on  ice, if you will.</p><p> Former ICE agent Claude Arnold on that.</p><p> What do you think of that?  </p><p> CLAUDE ARNOLD, FORMER ICE SPECIAL AGENT:  Well, I -- first of all, people  don't understand the breadth of ICE's mission.  </p><p> Immigration enforcement is half of the mission.  It has an entire  component, homeland security investigations, that investigates all crime  related to the border.  </p><p> It's the investigative arm for all of DHS.  It's the second largest  investigative entity in the U.S. government and it investigates a lot of  things, drug smuggling, human trafficking and smuggling, child pornography,  export of illegal technologies.</p><p> It has a huge national security responsibility.  It's the second largest  representation on the Federal Joint Terrorism Task Force after the FBI.  </p><p> So to say you just need to get rid of ICE, I think people don't understand  all that ICE does.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, a lot of them were saying, right after these apprehensions,  well, does it change and does their mission statement change given on the  administration?  It was this administration that, led by Jeff Sessions,  said, we're going to enforce a policy where we can, yes, separate kids from  their parents, something that wasn't done, at least not the same way  exactly, in the Obama administration.  </p><p> So do you have to pivot depending on the administration?  </p><p> ARNOLD:  Well, I think there was a pivot done on how enforcement was  conducted during the Obama administration.  </p><p> And, really, it's just been a return to the status quo.  But people have  been -- they have developed a sense of entitlement that you can just come  to the country illegally and expecting it's OK. </p><p> CAVUTO:  Oh, no, you're quite right.  People forget how we were  apprehending underage kids and then who were -- drugs deals and all.   You're quite right about that.</p><p> ARNOLD:  Right.  Right.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  But who calls that?  Do you answer then to whatever the  presidential directive is or what?</p><p> ARNOLD:  Yes, of course.  You're part of the executive branch.  </p><p> ICE does what the president tells them to do through the executive chain of  command.  I mean, it's the executive branch.</p><p> CAVUTO:  So, if there were no ICE, to these people's interests, the  protesters, who would handle this border stuff?  </p><p> ARNOLD:  Well, here's the important thing here, Neil.  </p><p> What is going on is, the same people who want ICE abolished, they opposed  there being any wall on the border.  They oppose changing the loopholes  that encourage and allow people to stay in the U.S. illegally.  </p><p> So, the last stand against those who make it in here illegally is ICE.  So  if you get rid of ICE, then you completely have open borders and no  immigration enforcement.  And that's by design.  They want that to happen.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Amazing.  </p><p> All right, Claude Arnold, thank you very much, former ICE agent.  He's put  himself in a lot of harm's way over the years just to deal with that.  </p><p> People should remember that, no matter what your feelings on this  particular issue.  </p><p> We will have more after this.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Thirty seconds away from that deadline.  What is Rod Rosenstein  going to do?  Is he going to give the Republicans what they want?</p><p> Tomorrow, we will get the read on all of this from Republican House  Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte.  He also was one of the fellows  who came up with a plan to settle this immigration mess.  His measure went  nowhere, but that doesn't mean that immigration progress couldn't still  come up somewhere.  </p><p> A one-on-one with probably one of the more powerful players on Capitol Hill  tomorrow, Bob Goodlatte.</p><p> We will see you then.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">QUESTION: And one more, on trade, and following up on what Blake asked about Harley-Davidson. They announced in an SEC filing they're moving a significant amount of their operations to Europe because of the E.U. tariffs that were placed on Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Is this what the President envisioned for what the impact would be by placing tariffs on the E.U. and the retaliation the E.U. has put on the U. S.?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Again, the European Union is trying to punish U.S. workers because they have engaged repeatedly in unfair trade practices. And the president is saying enough is enough. We'd like to work with the E.U. to work on a level playing field.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sorry, Steve, I did come to you. Go ahead.</p><p>QUESTION: The president today in the Oval Office, sitting next to the king of Jordan, mentioned some progress in the Middle East peace process, but he didn't give us any specifics.</p><p>There's been quite a bit of back-channel diplomacy going on the last few days in the Middle East, with Jared Kushner and Jason Greenblatt. Do you have anything concrete to -- to tell us about any sort of positive movement whatsoever, from all of this?</p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS: Again, we -- I think that the meetings that took place over the last week with Senior Adviser Jared Kushner and Special Representative Jason Greenblatt, they met with a number of officials and principals in Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, Israel and Qatar last week.</p><p>They discussed the situation in Gaza as well as the next stages of the peace effort. We're going to continue those conversations and we're committed to the peace effort, and we're going to keep working forward. But those conversations were productive.</p><p>Julie?</p><p>QUESTION: Sarah, the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection said today that they are no longer going to be referring people who cross the border without authorization for criminal charges if they're traveling with children, which is essentially a return to the Obama administration practice and administrations before that. Does the president support that approach? And if so, does he regret trying to push forward on a zero- tolerance approach in the first place?</p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS: No. The president certainly supports keeping families together, which he has outlined several times over the last week. But he's also called on Congress to actually fix the system.</p><p>They're the only ones that ultimately have the ability to change the law. The president's executive order has given a temporary solution to the problem but it's not permanent, and we need Congress to step up. We need Democrats to stop playing political games, do their jobs, work with this president and let's fix the problem at the border.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS: Jeff?</p><p>QUESTION: Sarah, can you talk about why you tweeted from your official account about the episode that you had at the restaurant on Friday night?</p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS: Sure. I was responding to a number of news stories. I would been reached out to by over a dozen reporters, and there were multiple news stories that had already been issued.</p><p>It was considered news of the day, so I responded in the way I would to any other news of the day story.</p><p>Jeff?</p><p>QUESTION: Sarah, you said just because you don't see a judge doesn't mean you don't get due process. Can you explain what you mean by that specifically, and how the president envisions that this would work while still maintaining what the Constitution upholds in having a swift immigration system?</p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS: Again, there are other ways for removal. There are thousands of illegal aliens that are removed every month that don't see judges. Sometimes that's through voluntary removal, and sometimes that's through expedited removal.</p><p>Again, the president's ultimate goal would be that we have actually a secure border, and people aren't coming into the country illegally. But that we have a system that works and the people that come into the country come in through a legal system.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS: Jill?</p><p>QUESTION: What is the president doing specifically this week to ensure that Congress passes a bill? He's spent all week in Nevada talking about - - or, all weekend. Excuse me -- on Saturday, talking about how Democrats want open borders and crime. But, specifically, has he made phone calls to Republican members in the House, where the bill is pending? Has he tried to bring Democrats together? What is he doing specifically to try and get a new law passed, specifically, other than just railing against the current law?</p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS: The president met with a number of lawmakers last week, talked with several over the weekend, some that he was with while he was traveling. Last week, he made an open invitation to Democrat lawmakers -- that they were welcome to come to the White House to discuss what they'd like to see, because the president wants solutions.</p><p>We've yet to have any of them to show up, actually willing to have those conversations, actually willing to fix the problem. Instead, they'd rather rant and rave about not allowing members of the Trump administration to step foot in public.</p><p>The president wants to see solutions. That's what we're focused on. It's Congress's job to do that, and we've laid out very clearly that we want to be part of that and what we'd like to see in that package.</p><p>Jill?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>QUESTION: ... on this?</p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS: Clearly, they aren't. If they haven't passed a law to fix this system, then they haven't. Republicans have laid out a number of proposals that they support. The president has voiced his support for those.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>QUESTION: ... probably fail this week, though. The Republican bills will probably...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS: That's because no Democrat will get on board and actually support a solution.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>QUESTION: ... Republican -- is your Republicans cannot pass these Republican bills. What is the president doing as the leader of the party to try and get Republican...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS: Jeff, these aren't Republican bills. These are bills that fix a broken system. They may have Republican sponsors, but these should be bipartisan. This shouldn't be complicated. Look, the House has already passed over 500 pieces of legislation, but they can't get through the Senate because Democrats refuse to actually find solutions.</p><p>We have 50 bills that passed just last week to address the opioid crisis -- that passed through the House. The Senate still hasn't taken them up. Hopefully, they will. And, if they do, that will show that we actually can come up with bipartisan solutions. And that's what we'd like to see them do on immigration, as well.</p><p>Jill?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>QUESTION: ... follow-up on Julia's question about the zero-tolerance policy. The president said, last week, after signing the executive order, that he believed that zero tolerance was still important. You guys made a point of the fact that the E. O. did not actually get rid of the policy.</p><p>How does that square with the fact that CBP is now saying that they are no longer referring for prosecution any adults who come in with children?</p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS: Again, this is a temporary solution. This isn't going to last. Congress still has to step up. They still have to do their job. This will only last a short amount of time because we're going to run out of space, we're going to run out of resources in order to keep people together, and we're asking Congress to provide those resources and do their job. And...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>QUESTION: ... temporary solution -- does that mean, at some point, you are going to change that policy back?</p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS: We're not changing the policy. We're simply out of resources, and, at some point, Congress has to do what they were elected to do, and that is secure our border. That is stop the crime coming into our country.</p><p>The country has made extremely clear that they don't want open borders, and Democrats need to understand that, and they need to work with Republicans and find some solutions.</p><p>QUESTION: And there...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS: Annie. Sorry, Jill, I'm going to keep going. Annie, go ahead.</p><p>QUESTION: Sarah, you mentioned the state of resources and running out of them. Can you be specific about what the resources are right now for housing parents and children together? Is there enough housing right now? Is the Pentagon stepping in? Like, what's being done about the resources?</p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS: Again, we're looking at every option available. We have asked the Pentagon to help with additional space. But a lot of that will depend on our ability to stop people coming into the country illegally. And we, again, encourage people to go through ports of entry instead of crossing the border illegally.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS: We've requested, through legislation -- we're working with Congress, hopefully, to provide more resources and the ability to actually enforce the law.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS: Ayesha?</p><p>QUESTION: Thank you. I just want to see if you can kind of narrow down exactly what the president actually intends to do when it comes to this idea of not having judges. You say that there are instances where people don't have judges, but my understanding is that, if you do ask for asylum, you do have certain rights.</p><p>So is there going to be a change in that policy, or what is this administration planning to do to make it so you don't have to see a judge? (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS: Again, I have addressed this a couple times. There are multiple instances in where you wouldn't: voluntary removal, certain cases have expedited removal. If somebody comes through a port of entry seeking asylum, those cases and that process will be heard. But at the same time, the president's ultimate goal is to secure the border and stop illegal immigration.</p><p>QUESTION: I -- I -- I understand that, but so what does that mean practically? Like, is the president planning to do anything differently, or are you just saying, you don't like the way (INAUDIBLE) now?</p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS: The president's laid out what he'd like to see. We've put out the things that we want to see in an immigration package months ago. We're still waiting on Congress to give us the ability to do that.</p><p>QUESTION: So -- so unless Congress acts, nothing is actually going to change? The administration is not changing anything right now, when it comes to judges?</p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS: You mean, are we walking around making up laws? No, because we're not the Obama administration. We're actually trying to enforce the laws that are on the books. We're actually asking Congress to do their part in the process, and pass new legislation that will fix our immigration system.</p><p>QUESTION: So -- but nothing is actually changing on the ground. Like, this -- so this is -- the president's complaining about judges, and saying that we shouldn't have all these judges, and people who come over should just be put out, but nothing is actually going to change. He's just saying -- he's just complaining about the process as it stands now.</p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS: Things that we have the ability to do administratively, we are working to do. But again, Congress is the only one that has the ability to write law, and we hope they'll do that.</p><p>Steve?</p><p>QUESTION: I'm honing in on that point. I'm trying to understand what it is the president understands about the current policy, because as you've explained, expedited removal allows the government to remove hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants a year without seeing judges. Did the president know that when he issued the tweets?</p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS: Yeah, but there are still thousands that go through a very lengthy process. We'd like to see the process consolidated. We'd like to see the backlog stopped. We'd like to see our border secured.</p><p>Sorry, Steve, I'm going to keep going.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>QUESTION: Under current law there are a couple of things that the president could do. You could expand that policy. You've said that he would like to see more expedited removal. Does the president intend to expand it to the full two-year limit under the current statute?</p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS: Again, we would like to see more expedited removal, but ultimately, we would like to see the border secured and people stop coming into the country illegally. That seems pretty simple to me, and it would stop a lot of the problems, and would eliminate the need for so many of these additional laws.</p><p>QUESTION: Thanks, Sarah. The gal in the briefing talking about the importance of civility. Do you consider it a civil policy to separate more than two thirds of the children from their parents?</p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS: We consider enforcing the law the role that the administration has to play. Certainly, the president has taken an executive action to the furthest that he has the ability to do to minimize the separation of families. We're working hard to make sure families get to stay together, and we're calling on Congress to help us in that effort, and we're continuing to focus on the reunification, and making sure that the families, again, stay together, and that Congress will give us a permanent solution to fix that.</p><p>QUESTION: But you say that you're working to make families stay together. It was your administration that separated them in the first place.</p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS: It wasn't our administration that created these laws, but it is our administration's job to enforce it, and we've done that. If someone breaks the law, it's our job to enforce it. If somebody doesn't like the law, then they need to lobby Congress and ask them to change it.</p><p>Anita.</p><p>QUESTION: I have, one, an immigration question, and wanted to clarify one thing. So I understand that not every adult with a child is going to be prosecuted. If there are families that are being held together, detained together somewhere and 20 days goes by, what is going to happen then? I didn't get an -- an answer with that last week. I don't understand. The law says you can't keep them together, keep the children, even with parents for longer than 20 days. So then what happens?</p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS: Hopefully, Congress will pass the law and fix the problem.</p><p>QUESTION: (INAUDIBLE) 20 days?</p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS: Well, why should it be so hard? They all say that they don't want to separate families. Seems like it should be pretty simple to me.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS: John?</p><p>QUESTION: I said I had a clarification...</p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS: Go ahead.</p><p>QUESTION: ... so Jeff asked you a question about Congress and the bill. Were you, in your response, referring to just a stand-alone bill that deals with family separation, or were you referring to the bigger immigration bill that the House hopes to take up this week?</p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS: Our preference would be a bill that addresses all of the pillars that we've laid out, that we'd like to see addressed in an immigration package. And that's what our focus is right now, is there's a bill that does that on the table.</p><p>If that doesn't happen, then we'll talk about other pieces of legislation at that point.</p><p>QUESTION: (INAUDIBLE) the president still wants that bill to go forward even though he said...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS: Certain...</p><p>QUESTION: ... they don't want to -- he -- they shouldn't waste their time on it?</p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS: Look, Democrats in the Senate have made clear they're not going to support this.</p><p>And because we need at least some Democrats to get on board, they've made it very clear that they don't want to work with the president, that they don't want to fix our immigration system. That they'd rather have open borders and rampant crime than work with the president to create solutions. Until they change their mind, we're going to continue looking at the best ways that we can fix these problems but we need Congress to help us.</p><p>John.</p><p>QUESTION: Thank you, Sarah. This president is the first in the television age who has yet to address the American public on nationwide television from the Oval Office. Many Republican consultants have said that he might have a stronger hand in influencing Congress if he made a nationally televised address on immigration and what changes he'd like to see, to explain it.</p><p>Is that something that's on the table within the administration?</p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS: Certainly don't want to take anything off the table, or any tool away from the president. He does address the American people in a number of different venues and formats. And I will certainly pass along that suggestion to him.</p><p>Nadia.</p><p>QUESTION: Just a follow-up on the Middle East. In the recent (INAUDIBLE) Mr. Kushner said that if President Abbas is not willing to negotiate, he's going to proceed with the deal. Can you explain how the White House is hoping to achieve any progress in the Middle East peace talks if the principal party is not taking part in it?</p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS: We're going to continue meeting with the other partners in the region. And, again, we're going to continue pushing forward in the peace process. We had productive meetings over the last week. We're going to continue those conversations.</p><p>I will take one last question. Saagar.</p><p>QUESTION: Thanks, Sarah.</p><p>To follow up on the judges -- on the issue of immigration judges, why is the President so opposed to an increase in the number of immigration judges when it would expedite the asylum processing -- the asylum process and expedite deportation?</p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS: We're not opposed to the speeding up the process. What the President would like to see, once again, is that we stop the problem at the very beginning. He'd like to see us secure the border and people work through the system, through the ports of entry, so that we're not dealing with things on the back end.</p><p>We'd like to stop the problem before it starts, and that's what the president's focus has been all along, is on securing the border. And that's what we're going to continue to do.</p><p>Thanks so much guys. Have a great day.</p><p>NEIL CAVUTO, HOST: All right, you have been listening to Sarah Sanders here.</p><p>And it's safe to say the Washington press corps is more concerned with the immigration issue than a lot of folks losing their shirts today on this whole trade issue.</p><p>Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. And you're watching \"Your World.\"</p><p>And it could have worse. As I show you the Dow today down about 328 points, we had been down almost 500 points, and a lot of that over a building trade war and concerns this could get worse before it gets better, or that there are no signs of concessions on the part of any of the principal parties, namely the Chinese and ourselves.</p><p>All of this on the same day that Harley-Davidson was indicating, because of these threat of tariffs, they're moving a lot of their operations outside the U.S.</p><p>On a separate issue, General Motors has indicated that a lot of its Chevy Blazers will now be made in Mexico, not citing just the trade issue, but that it's not welcome noise here.</p><p>So, again, this could have a lot been worse. There was some confusion early on in the markets as to whether the administration was also recommending that they were urging the Chinese and others not to invest in technology stocks at all.</p><p>Then Peter Navarro ends up popping up on CNBC to say, no, no, no, no, no, they're not going to be, nor are there plans in the works for investment restrictions on China.</p><p>And that brought us down to the levels we're at right now, about 328 points southward on what was a crazy day on the markets.</p><p>We're going to be at this from all angles right now.</p><p>Let's first go to FOX Business Network's Deirdre Bolton with how it all sorted out.</p><p>Hey, Deirdre.</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Neil.</p><p>You said it. It could have been much worse. So, the markets did close clearly lower, but certainly off the low points of the day. And, of course, the big headline, the Trump administration moving to block Chinese companies from investing in U.S. tech firms and moving to block additional tech exports from the U.S. to China.</p><p>Our sources are saying the Treasury Department is going to make an official announcement at the end of this week, bring us more clarity, more details on the plan.</p><p>Now, the level of difficulty is, of course, much higher when you start to talk about blocking investment than when we're just engaging in tariff spats. So the stock market heading for the biggest one-day slide in months.</p><p>That's how we finished up. You can see red across the screen. One area I really wanted to highlight are the techs, because S&amp;P 500 tech companies get about 60 percent of their revenue from overseas. So that's the highest foreign exposure out of any of the index's 11 sectors.</p><p>And, of course,critics of our current trade policy say that China has been stealing anywhere between $30 billion and $50 billion worth of intellectual property, hard data, every year for the past decade. But then there was even a stronger report, a more recent one that came out from the Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property.</p><p>It has a much higher number, stating that up to $600 billion in theft that has some projections baked in is possible. But experts say, bottom line, the motivation to want to level the playing field is completely understandable.</p><p>What gets complicated is that so many American businesses are interconnected. So, for example, here's seven big tech American companies that source half of their products and components from China.</p><p>So, HP, IBM, Dell, Cisco, Unisys, Microsoft, Intel. Even Apple has sold more iPhones in China in the last three years than in the U.S. And Apple gets about 20 percent of its annual revenue from China.</p><p>Now, the Chinese president of course says China will punch back and will not be forced to eat the bitter fruit. That is a translation, a direct quote.</p><p>But as the tension rises between the world's two biggest economies, of course, investors really showed their anxiety. So, we had the Nasdaq, you can see there, closely lower, essentially 2 percent, biggest one-day percentage decline since March. Third day down in a row. So, that's the longest losing streak for that tech-heavy comp in about two months' time.</p><p>Even Asia overnight, you can see how markets reacted there. You can see Hong Kong's Hang Seng down by more than 1 percent. And, then, of course, even on our own bond market, right, there was this flight to safety in U.S. 10-year. Investors typically, of course, buy these bonds when they're fearful or they feel less certain of the future.</p><p>And prices really went up, so, therefore, those yields went down, settling 2.875 percent. And just worth noting, these yields have fallen basically for the past four out of five weeks.</p><p>So, Neil, what is clear is, investors really don't know what to make of it. We have the tariffs and now we have this idea of blocking direct investment, which is a much more muscular and, quite frankly, threatening move than tariffs, which really only apply to very specific products, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: Absolutely, especially when they go back and forth either way.</p><p>BOLTON: Yes.</p><p>CAVUTO: Thank you very, very much, Deirdre Bolton.</p><p>BOLTON: Sure.</p><p>CAVUTO: Doesn't Harley-Davidson know that? Not so much on the tariffs we're considering, but the response that company is getting and opting to do something that the president probably didn't envision.</p><p>FOX Business Network's Jeff Flock in Countryside, Illinois.</p><p>What did they do?</p><p>JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: They're getting a double whammy at Harley-Davidson, Neil, because the steel and aluminum tariffs hit their raw materials costs.</p><p>And now the European Union, of course, imposing an addition 25 percent tariff on motorcycles made here and shipped to Europe.</p><p>And so Harley is in a tough spot. That tariff went from 6 percent to 31 percent. And today, in a regulatory filing, Harley said that is going to add more than $2,000 a bike to the cost of a motorcycle made here in the U.S. and sold in Europe. And they can't possibly pass that along to consumers.</p><p>So, in the short-term, they're going to have to eat it. In the long term, they're going to move production away from the U.S. Europe was an expanding market for Harley-Davidson. They love it over there. And U.S. sales have been down.</p><p>You look at the first quarter of this year, U.S. sales of Harleys down double digits, as guys like me get older and maybe give up their motorcycles. In Europe, it had been growing by about 7 percent.</p><p>And so those bikes, made in the U.S. and shipped to Europe, will be no more. Harley has four plants here in the U.S., York, Pennsylvania, Kansas City, Missouri, and two in their home state of Wisconsin, and now apparently bikes destined for Europe will not be made there anymore.</p><p>Instead, they will be made in places like Brazil and elsewhere, Thailand and Australia. This is not, as you pointed out at the outset, what the president had intended. His trade policies designed to keep and create jobs here in the U.S. In this case, it appears they will be eliminating them -- Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: Amazing.</p><p>All right, Jeff Flock, thank you very, very much.</p><p>All right, Mattie Duppler is. We have got Charles Payne here, Larry Shover here as well of SFG, alternate CME trader as well.</p><p>Charles Payne, what is going on here? We knew the trade thing was getting antsy, but it seemed like the bottom fell out.</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: It did, but because I think this had a little bit of a different twist.</p><p>This was investment. This is about -- the whole thing, by the way, is centered on made in China 2025. The administration, which I wish they would articulate what they're trying to do, because I understand, and I think most -- a lot of people do -- and it's the idea of curbing this ambition, the stated ambition by China to sort of be the world's tech leader in a short period of time.</p><p>And one way to get there, perhaps the only way they can get their with their own timeline, is to continue to steal our intellectual property.</p><p>So the idea is to restrict investments from companies where China has a 25 percent or more ownership. And, again, this was just speculation. It was in a few media outlets, the White House trying to take -- take it back a little bit. It's something obviously that they have toyed around with.</p><p>Peter Navarro has talked about this kind of thing for maybe two decades, so this is not necessarily news, per se. But it is -- it is a different twist, to your point. It's not -- it's not the trade stuff anymore, as much as it is, hey, we want to take direct aim at your ambitions to usurp America's perch as the world's tech leader.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, Larry, what worried a lot in the markets is that, all of a sudden, then we were putting a general wall up on Chinese investment in general and technology period.</p><p>That's how it was interpreted. And then, later on, the treasury secretary, Mnuchin, came out to say, no, no, no, it wasn't singling out China, as if to say there's other players here, as if that eased the angst.</p><p>It actually compounded that. But what do you make of that?</p><p>LARRY SHOVER, SOLUTIONS FUNDS GROUP: Well, what I make of it is that two things.</p><p>The whole thing lacked clarity. Like, it didn't matter. Like, this whole China tweets and tirades, it didn't matter because it lacked clarity. It seemed like the White House is utterly unprepared to create any kind of proposal that can go into law.</p><p>Immigration policy is a good proof of that. Also, it lacks credibility, because we all know -- I mean, this does -- this hurts us more than it hurts them, the fact that it's going to kill Apple or Nike. It really, really hurt them manufacturing their goods there that are sent to us.</p><p>So it doesn't make any sense. People dismissed it. And I really think people are definitely blaming the China trade today. The bigger problem, though, it's really tech. We saw that breaking down last week.</p><p>Leadership has been very thin in the stock market. Without five or six super cap techs in the S&amp;P 500...</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes.</p><p>SHOVER: ... we would be down 4 percent, instead of up 1.5 percent.</p><p>But it started to crack. The Supreme Court came out last week with a ruling on sales tax, et cetera. That chasm between growth and value has been very, very wide. The market is vulnerable. The ball will always find you when you're out of position.</p><p>And that's really what happened today.</p><p>CAVUTO: And people were a little anxious on that investment angle here and maybe finding an excuse for technology, which ran up far and fast, to sell off some of it.</p><p>But, Mattie, it's sort of this impression that not everyone in the administration seems to be on the same page. I'm getting different vibes from the Treasury secretary, different vibes from their trade representatives, different vibes from the president.</p><p>MATTIE DUPPLER, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S FORUM: Right.</p><p>CAVUTO: And I think that's the kind of thing that scares markets.</p><p>DUPPLER: Oh, absolutely.</p><p>You finally have consensus on this panel, Neil. And that's, what the heck is the administration intending to do with these trade efforts?</p><p>Charles and I don't always agree on this issue, but right now we're both wondering, what is the objective here? And that's what the administration needs to clarify. It needs to make clear what it intends to do with all of these efforts towards China.</p><p>Now, if the objective here is to exact the most amount of pain and pressure on China possible, they need to make sure that they're not injecting pain on American businesses. And that's a concern, especially when you look at really artificially diminishing the amount of capital that can come into this country.</p><p>I worry about the impact on businesses. And that's not even getting to what tariffs are doing to American businesses, where we have already seen some of those announcements this week.</p><p>CAVUTO: Or even the threat of them.</p><p>But, Charles, the other thing you mentioned -- and this -- you can help me out here. It's always been that the Chinese are in bad shape here. They're at two-year-plus lows in their market. They have a lot more to lose than we do.</p><p>But they also have their pride, and they're not giving any ground. So, how is this resolved, if it is?</p><p>PAYNE: And this is where I disagree with Larry.</p><p>I don't think -- I think a lot of people are raising the white flag so quickly that China is going to beat us at this. They're not. If it has to go the whole way...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: The whole way could be years.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes, Sure.</p><p>Mattie makes the right point. It's sort of like when my pops used to take me out in the back. He says, it's going to hurt me as much as it hurts you.</p><p>No, it won't.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>PAYNE: With that being said, let's look at what China did today, this morning.</p><p>Their central bank freed up banks over there to the tune of $100 billion. Right? This is to sort of...</p><p>CAVUTO: It needs a stimulant.</p><p>PAYNE: ... to do things thing on debt.</p><p>Last week, it was $30 billion. A week before that, it was $30 billion. Their foreign and reserve currencies have dropped a trillion dollars.</p><p>Their debt-to-GDP ratio is on its way to 300 percent. We aren't going to lose this. China knows we're not going to lose this. Nobody wants to lose. It's a matter of how, to your point, do you save face and resolve it?</p><p>CAVUTO: I think that's where we are.</p><p>Larry, the Chinese, remember, today indicating, you know, we don't just turn a cheek on this. And we come back and we're going to fight back.</p><p>Now, to be clear, no response to the tariffs yet with tariffs of their own. In other words, to increase the amount to match the United States, when we promised we would put $200 billion on top of that.</p><p>Some read into that a sign that the Chinese are trying to find a middle ground here, where they can talk tough, but they don't have to respond in kind and invite a war. What do you see?</p><p>SHOVER: Yes.</p><p>Well, I see that they have already done that, just what we said. Required reserve ratio dropped 50 basis points yesterday, adding all that liquidity into the market. What did that do? That dropped RMB by 1.5 percent in five days, 3.5 percent over the last month.</p><p>So they're already ready. That is going to negate any kind of trade tariff that we are going to impose. And I think they know, at the end of the day, that there's so lack of clarity coming out of the White House, that they're just preparing for it.</p><p>Also realizing that they have had a real soft patch of data coming in. So, perhaps Trump is trying to hit them while they're weak.</p><p>CAVUTO: We will see.</p><p>All right, guys, I apologize jumping on you. We have got a lot of breaking news here.</p><p>I do want to bring in my next guest, the former Heinz CEO Bill Johnson, a global read of things, if ever there were one.</p><p>And, Bill, I'm looking at this and wondering what the signals could be for us. If a company, one after the other, like GM considering making all its Blazers now in Mexico, and, of course, we have been talking about a number of other companies that have been doing the same or considering preemptive move like Harley-Davidson, that has got to have a domestic economic impact.</p><p>BILL JOHNSON, FORMER CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, H.J. HEINZ COMPANY: It should, Neil.</p><p>Nothing has happened yet to impact the economy here. And, frankly, the Chinese and European economies...</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, they're already leaving. Those guys are already making some moves.</p><p>JOHNSON: I understand. But they're more vulnerable than we are.</p><p>CAVUTO: True.</p><p>JOHNSON: Having said that, this is like tic-tac-toe. Nobody wins.</p><p>I play tic-tac-toe with any grandkids. And you never win. And that's what this is now. We have gotten to the point on this situation...</p><p>CAVUTO: You never won at tic-tac-toe with your grandkids?</p><p>JOHNSON: No.</p><p>CAVUTO: You're one of the most celebrated CEOs ever. And...</p><p>JOHNSON: Yes. That just shows you nobody wins, Neil. And that's where we are right now. Nobody wins.</p><p>CAVUTO: So, that's where you see -- that's where we are right now?</p><p>JOHNSON: I do think that's where we are.</p><p>I think this created a huge environment of uncertainty. You and I have had this conversation many times. Uncertainty leads to volatility. Volatility leads to more uncertainty. And we get in this vicious cycle.</p><p>And I think that's where we are now. Having said that, I think, ultimately, saner and cooler heads will prevail, and this will somehow get resolved.</p><p>I hope this is not a negotiation ploy, because it's rather ham-fisted. And there has got to be better ways to attack this issue than the one that is being generated right now.</p><p>CAVUTO: What do you make -- I think it was ratcheted up a little bit today to go after in this case the Chinese for investing in technology.</p><p>It was read as, we're not going to allow them to invest in any technology companies. And that might have been a prematurely wrong impression. But that was the one that was out there for hours in the markets. They had to dial that back a little bit.</p><p>But they're still looking at putting a limit to who can invest in technology. That's how it interpreted, hence, technology falls off a lot. So if this is more from just goods and services to, I don't know, even companies and stocks you invest in, then what?</p><p>JOHNSON: Well, then I think we have chaos, Neil.</p><p>I don't think you can stop the investment in a capitalist society. It's just the way the system works. And while I understand why the administration is going after some of these issues -- and they're sort of going where people have been afraid to tread before -- the reality is, we have to have some clarity in the communication of the purpose of what we're trying to achieve and then take a step-by-step process in which to achieve it.</p><p>And I heard about the investment situation this morning. Then I saw Secretary Mnuchin's response. And so I'm completely unclear as to what is happening. And there we go again. That creates more uncertainty, which creates more volatility, and leaves us all in the dark about what it is we're trying to achieve.</p><p>CAVUTO: Now, there used to be an old rule here following this president the last 18 months that those who doubted him would be proven wrong, and that everything ends up OK and markets come back from what look like debacles, and people who second-guessed him have been proven wrong.</p><p>So there was this now new -- or renewed trust that President Trump must know what he's doing, there's a method to all of this.</p><p>Do you subscribe to that, or is there now a reassessment, well, maybe not. Maybe this is a little impulsive. Maybe there's not a method to the madness. Maybe it's just madness.</p><p>JOHNSON: Well, I think, historically, over his last 18 months in office, he's done a pretty good job of bringing us back from the brink and achieving great success.</p><p>North Korea seems to be an example of one of those areas. But I don't know. I don't like this whole approach, Neil. I think it's so ham-fisted and so unpredictable that sometimes you create a fire out of a smoke bomb, and the next thing you know, you have got a real conflagration going, and you don't know how to put it out. And that -- I'm worried we're headed that way.</p><p>Having said that, I will give him credit for again treading in these places that need to be addressed. I just think there's better ways to do it. But I'm not yet ready to say that we're just going to pull this one back from the brink and everyone is going to be happy.</p><p>I just don't know.</p><p>CAVUTO: We shall see, my friend. Thank you very, very much.</p><p>Good luck in your next tic-tac-toe game. I give the edge to you still.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>JOHNSON: Thank you. Thank you.</p><p>CAVUTO: William Johnson, the former Heinz CEO, if anyone knows the global landscape, it is he. All right.</p><p>All right, when we come back here, this nastiness with Democrats saying that we're going to get nasty no matter where Republicans gather.</p><p>Really?</p><p>CAVUTO: Yikes, 25 minutes, right, a 5:00 p.m. deadline staring down now, as House Republicans want documents from the Justice Department on that Clinton e-mail probe and the Russian investigation. Then what happens if they don't get them?</p><p>After this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. MAXINE WATERS (D), CALIFORNIA: And if you see anybody from that Cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd.</p><p>(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>WATERS: And you push back on them. And you tell them they're not welcome.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, anyway, American Majority CEO Ned Ryun. We have got Olympic Media managing editor Katie Frates and Democratic strategist Christy Setzer.</p><p>I don't know where to begin. But, Katie, maybe you can help me with this.</p><p>This is out of control. This is just crazy talk. What do you make of it?</p><p>KATIE FRATES, OLYMPIC MEDIA: It absolutely is.</p><p>This is just going way too far, because she doesn't even know who she is speaking to, Maxine Waters, when she is saying this. What if someone sees somebody at a gas station and takes it way too far?</p><p>You're essentially encouraging anyone of any mental state, of any level of discourse, to go up and potentially harm someone else because of their political beliefs. That's absolutely not OK.</p><p>I'm so excited and happy to see at least Nancy Pelosi push back on this. I'm not sure why more Democratic leaders are not speaking up and condemning this.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, there were a good number. To be fair, there were a good number, Elijah Cummings and all saying...</p><p>FRATES: Good. Good.</p><p>CAVUTO: ... that, even when it came to the Sanders situation, she shouldn't have been taken out of the restaurant.</p><p>But, Ned, I'm worried more about the increasing vitriol. And we're seeing more and more of it. And anything could happen in that environment.</p><p>NED RYUN, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN MAJORITY: No.</p><p>And I think really what we're seeing is, to sum up Charles Krauthammer, we conservatives, we think the left is philosophically misguided, and many on the left think we're evil.</p><p>And I think you're seeing this rhetoric ramp up where borders are now bigotry and American presidents standing up for the America taxpayer, well, this is Nazism and the second coming of the Holocaust.</p><p>And I think what the left is trying to do is say, the debate is over in our minds because we consider your ideas to be irrational. We don't consider your ideas to be legitimate.</p><p>And if they can dehumanize the other side, that's what they want to do, because that justifies driving opposing thought from the public square.</p><p>The thing that troubles me, Neil, about all of this, this kind of incitement to physical intimidation and bullying is not to be normalized. It's not normal for a constitutional republic. It's only normal in banana republics. And if the left wants to beat us, try doing it at the ballot box in 2018 and 2020.</p><p>CAVUTO: Do you worry about that, Christy?</p><p>As a Democratic strategist, and a darn good one, and a very calm person, I might point out, that your party could be ruining it for itself, that it's actually scaring some people with that kind of talk, whether you agree or disagree with the politics behind it.</p><p>CHRISTY SETZER, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: I just think it's impossible to put Maxine Waters' comments like this in a vacuum like this.</p><p>The defining feature of Donald Trump's campaign was not that he was going to shake stuff up in Washington or that he was a great businessman. It was this incivility. Right?</p><p>He started talking about how, I like people that were not captured about John McCain. Then you looked as his rallies, where they were filled with him actively asking them to take violence against protesters.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: If that is what your view is, do you think that the response, responding in kind, then, if that's your view, is justified?</p><p>SETZER: I don't think that -- no, I don't think that we have responded in kind.</p><p>I think that Democrats are saying, look, we need to make it just a little bit uncomfortable.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: You have got whole groups that target a homeland security secretary at a restaurant.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SETZER: No, no, no, no. Not with violence, Neil.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SETZER: That's an extraordinarily important difference. Not with violence.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Please listen to me.</p><p>Sarah Sanders, her incident, Secretary Nielsen outside her home and in a restaurant, then Maxine Waters justifying it. I could go on to talk about Florida's Pam Bondi and what she dealt with at a movie.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Stephen Miller and be called a fascist while he's out.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SETZER: Protest is a healthy part of the American tradition, not violence, not violence.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: You're fine with this. You're fine with it.</p><p>But if it were done in reverse, you wouldn't be fine with it.</p><p>SETZER: I would be absolutely fine with it. I would be fine with it, because, again, protest is absolutely fine.</p><p>What is not fine...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: You just said when you didn't like it what Donald Trump and his people were doing the same.</p><p>SETZER: I'm sorry?</p><p>CAVUTO: You didn't like it when Donald Trump was doing that.</p><p>SETZER: No. What Donald Trump was saying was, I want that guy to be taken out on a stretcher. What Donald Trump was doing was actually what Ned Ryun was just talking about right now, which is dehumanizing the other side.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, I don't get it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. OK.</p><p>Mattie, do you believe that this is going too far?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SETZER: By talking about how they're animals and infesting America.</p><p>CAVUTO: I understand. I heard you.</p><p>SETZER: That's very different.</p><p>CAVUTO: Mattie, has this gone too far? Mattie, you're in awe, aren't you?</p><p>FRATES: Yes, yes. Absolutely, it is.</p><p>CAVUTO: Katie, I apologize. I apologize.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: See that? I lose my place, because I get so wrapped up in it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Is it your sense that this gets worse, though? Are you getting a sense it gets worse?</p><p>FRATES: So, this is the problem.</p><p>It's that this is escalating rhetoric. You're essentially saying mob someone outside of a gas station.</p><p>RYUN: Exactly.</p><p>FRATES: And, again, you don't know the intentions of the person who may then go on to do that.</p><p>So what if someone is attacked? What if something violent happens? And then you turn around and you say, well, Maxine Waters was telling people to do that. It's not a good idea and it's not a healthy dialogue.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SETZER: Do we remember the Pizzagate conspiracy, how a crazy conspiracy actually led someone to take a gun to my, my local pizza place, actually, and try to shoot it up because they had heard this crazy idea on the Internet and by Alex Jones and others that Hillary Clinton and John Podesta were up to no good?</p><p>That led to actual violence.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, I don't want to get in a tit for tat.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: I sometimes feel like I'm separating my teenage sons.</p><p>But, Ned Ryun, I do know this. We have all got to bring the octane down a little bit on all sides here.</p><p>RYUN: We do.</p><p>CAVUTO: But how do we do that?</p><p>And should it be incumbent people to just to say, there has got to be a better way? Whether the Elijah Cummings approach, this has got to stop, whether Sarah Sanders' approach, I just politely up and left, and I tried not to make a big deal of it at the scene, what is it? What is the answer?</p><p>RYUN: No. I think we have got to start policing our own. We have to start policing ourselves on the right and the left.</p><p>And I was encouraged by Nancy Pelosi saying that Maxine Waters' statement was unacceptable. I think we have to be honest about it on the right, too, when we see unacceptable statements. And I have said this again -- I have said this before. I will say it again.</p><p>When Donald Trump -- I love 85 to 90 percent of his Twitter feed. When he is talking about bloody face-lift, you will never me defend that. I want him to focus on the positives and policy and all these things.</p><p>When it becomes personal, I think we need to call out our side and say, this is not how we have more civil discourse in the public arena.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Fully agree. Fully agree.</p><p>At our core, guys, we're all human beings.</p><p>RYUN: We're all Americans.</p><p>CAVUTO: And we can agree to disagree. But we don't have to be asses in the process.</p><p>And none of you are, by the way.</p><p>But I want to thank you all very, very much.</p><p>And, Katie, I apologize.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRATES: No, no apology needed.</p><p>CAVUTO: I get so apoplectic. And I don't even know why. And it's not even dinnertime.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, by the way, we're close to the witching hour, 5:00 p.m. Eastern time, that document deadline. But right now there's indications the people who have put out that deadline aren't going to get the response they want in time for that deadline.</p><p>Then what?</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. Between a deadline coming up in about 15 minutes from now and, of course, this is the week we're going to see some big testimony up on Capitol Hill, much of it is behind closed doors.</p><p>Let's get the read from former Justice Department official Tom Dupree.</p><p>Tom, what is the biggest thing you're waiting for?</p><p>TOM DUPREE, FORMER JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: Well, the biggest thing I'm waiting for in the short-term is whether the Justice Department complies with the congressional demands.</p><p>As you point out, the clock is ticking. They have a document deadline, production deadline at 5:00 p.m. this afternoon. We will see if they turn over what they're expected to turn over. My guess is that they are not going to satisfy the demands of the House Republicans.</p><p>And I think we are going to see this dispute continue to escalate in the days ahead.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, then they would want to take even aggressive action against Rod Rosenstein. Right? What would it be?</p><p>DUPREE: Well, let's see.</p><p>They have got a wide variety of means at their disposal. At one end of the spectrum is just the continued drumbeat of public criticism. They can amp that up several ways.</p><p>One thing they could do is, they could issue subpoenas. Another thing they could do is, they could actually instigate contempt proceedings. And then at the extreme end of the other spectrum, it would be impeachment proceedings.</p><p>I'm hopeful that they're not going to go there and that cooler heads will prevail and they be able to sit down and work all of this out before we get to that point.</p><p>CAVUTO: Where is all of this going?</p><p>I mean, especially with the Peter Strzok testimony later on, are they more interested in his case, finding out what he knew and what was the backdrop for his comments he was making about then candidate Trump, or what?</p><p>DUPREE: Yes. I think that's a lot of what was going on.</p><p>I mean, I think right now, from the perspective of Congress, there was so much that was going on behind the scenes in 2016 that Congress wants to know, what was your reason for doing this? What was your reason for handling the investigations the way you did? What was the reason for getting these wiretaps and for conducting the surveillance?</p><p>Were you using an informant? Was it a spy, that sort of thing? And the fact is, DOJ is not in the business normally of turning over documents. And so I think, institutionally, there's a huge amount of reluctance to give Congress what it wants.</p><p>But Congress is beating the drum. They're on the warpath. They're trying to fulfill their oversight function here. And so I think we have a real collision that's not in any -- is not going to be sorted out in the near term.</p><p>CAVUTO: When I have looked at a lot of the comments from those identified, like Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, and these other unidentified individuals, and then, of course, now I know how James Comey felt about then candidate Trump and how Andy McCabe felt, his number two.</p><p>I have not run across one piece of evidence to show a pro-Trump person or someone who was biased to like -- to like Donald Trump. Now, I might have missed it. But, again, doesn't this feed the narrative that that was a stacked deck, because that certainly that stacked deck mantle has been claimed by a lot of Republicans that they were out to get him?</p><p>DUPREE: Yes, I certainly haven't seen anything along the lines of what you're talking about, Neil.</p><p>It all does seem to be one way. I guess what's surprising and frankly disappointing to me is that some of these folks, Strzok in particular, and Page, that even though they were nominally professionals, that they just weren't able to put aside their political biases.</p><p>Look, the fact is, is that pretty much everyone in the country harbors inner thoughts, their own political leanings.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>DUPREE: But I think, for most people, and certainly for the vast majority of people in the FBI historically, they been able to put these biases aside when it comes to the sacred function of law enforcement.</p><p>CAVUTO: But did you share whatever opinion -- we all have opinions. You would be vanilla if you didn't.</p><p>But did you -- these were aggressively shared and aggressive opinions at that. When you were there, was that -- did you kind of know what your colleagues felt, whether they were investigating someone or not?</p><p>DUPREE: No, not in this way.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes.</p><p>DUPREE: I think what is unusual about this, Neil, is that these were political comments they were discussing in the context of an ongoing political investigation.</p><p>It's not as though they were investigating some bank robber and trading texts about the presidential election. I mean, not saying that would be OK, but that would be very different.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>DUPREE: What they were doing here is, they were carrying out investigations involving the very candidates who were running at the same time they're engaged in this correspondence about how they can advance their own political views through their official duties.</p><p>That is where it crossed a line.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes.</p><p>You would just love to get the context for these remarks. What was going on? If it's just hatred, I don't know if that is even better or worse.</p><p>Tom, good seeing you again, my friend. Thank you.</p><p>DUPREE: Likewise. Thank you, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right.</p><p>How about just eliminating ICE?</p><p>With all this controversy about separating kids from their parents at the border, and then now trying to reconnect them with their parents, sometimes far from the border, maybe just get rid of ICE. Some people are actually urging that -- after this.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, groups in protests all around wanting to get rid of ICE.</p><p>That's right. After the separation of these kids from their parents, a lot of folks saying, you know, the problem isn't these coming into our country. It's the folks who are trying to keep them out and the way they go about their business. So, they're actually saying, get rid of ICE. Put ICE on ice, if you will.</p><p>Former ICE agent Claude Arnold on that.</p><p>What do you think of that?</p><p>CLAUDE ARNOLD, FORMER ICE SPECIAL AGENT: Well, I -- first of all, people don't understand the breadth of ICE's mission.</p><p>Immigration enforcement is half of the mission. It has an entire component, homeland security investigations, that investigates all crime related to the border.</p><p>It's the investigative arm for all of DHS. It's the second largest investigative entity in the U.S. government and it investigates a lot of things, drug smuggling, human trafficking and smuggling, child pornography, export of illegal technologies.</p><p>It has a huge national security responsibility. It's the second largest representation on the Federal Joint Terrorism Task Force after the FBI.</p><p>So to say you just need to get rid of ICE, I think people don't understand all that ICE does.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, a lot of them were saying, right after these apprehensions, well, does it change and does their mission statement change given on the administration? It was this administration that, led by Jeff Sessions, said, we're going to enforce a policy where we can, yes, separate kids from their parents, something that wasn't done, at least not the same way exactly, in the Obama administration.</p><p>So do you have to pivot depending on the administration?</p><p>ARNOLD: Well, I think there was a pivot done on how enforcement was conducted during the Obama administration.</p><p>And, really, it's just been a return to the status quo. But people have been -- they have developed a sense of entitlement that you can just come to the country illegally and expecting it's OK.</p><p>CAVUTO: Oh, no, you're quite right. People forget how we were apprehending underage kids and then who were -- drugs deals and all. You're quite right about that.</p><p>ARNOLD: Right. Right.</p><p>CAVUTO: But who calls that? Do you answer then to whatever the presidential directive is or what?</p><p>ARNOLD: Yes, of course. You're part of the executive branch.</p><p>ICE does what the president tells them to do through the executive chain of command. I mean, it's the executive branch.</p><p>CAVUTO: So, if there were no ICE, to these people's interests, the protesters, who would handle this border stuff?</p><p>ARNOLD: Well, here's the important thing here, Neil.</p><p>What is going on is, the same people who want ICE abolished, they opposed there being any wall on the border. They oppose changing the loopholes that encourage and allow people to stay in the U.S. illegally.</p><p>So, the last stand against those who make it in here illegally is ICE. So if you get rid of ICE, then you completely have open borders and no immigration enforcement. And that's by design. They want that to happen.</p><p>CAVUTO: Amazing.</p><p>All right, Claude Arnold, thank you very much, former ICE agent. He's put himself in a lot of harm's way over the years just to deal with that.</p><p>People should remember that, no matter what your feelings on this particular issue.</p><p>We will have more after this.</p><p>CAVUTO: Thirty seconds away from that deadline. What is Rod Rosenstein going to do? Is he going to give the Republicans what they want?</p><p>Tomorrow, we will get the read on all of this from Republican House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte. He also was one of the fellows who came up with a plan to settle this immigration mess. His measure went nowhere, but that doesn't mean that immigration progress couldn't still come up somewhere.</p><p>A one-on-one with probably one of the more powerful players on Capitol Hill tomorrow, Bob Goodlatte.</p><p>We will see you then.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2018062502cb140</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SN3-J2B1-DXH2-60Y9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"9281\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"06\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>June 25, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0001O4C</classCode><className>H J HEINZ CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002I8J</classCode><className>HARLEY-DAVIDSON INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>US IMMIGRATION &amp;

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">QUESTION:  And one more, on trade, and following up on what Blake asked  about Harley-Davidson.  They announced in an SEC filing they're moving a  significant amount of their operations to Europe because of the E.U.  tariffs that were placed on Harley-Davidson motorcycles.  Is this what the  President envisioned for what the impact would be by placing tariffs on the  E.U. and the retaliation the E.U. has put on the U. S.?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Again, the European  Union is trying to punish U.S. workers because they have engaged repeatedly  in unfair trade practices.  And the president is saying enough is enough.   We'd like to work with the E.U. to work on a level playing field. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sorry, Steve, I did come to you.  Go ahead.  </p><p>QUESTION:  The president today in the Oval Office, sitting next to the king  of Jordan, mentioned some progress in the Middle East peace process, but he  didn't give us any specifics. </p><p>There's been quite a bit of back-channel diplomacy going on the last few  days in the Middle East, with Jared Kushner and Jason Greenblatt.  Do you  have anything concrete to -- to tell us about any sort of positive movement  whatsoever, from all of this? </p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Again, we -- I think that the meetings that took place  over the last week with Senior Adviser Jared Kushner and Special  Representative Jason Greenblatt, they met with a number of officials and  principals in Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, Israel and Qatar last week. </p><p>They discussed the situation in Gaza as well as the next stages of the  peace effort.  We're going to continue those conversations and we're  committed to the peace effort, and we're going to keep working forward.   But those conversations were productive. </p><p>Julie? </p><p>QUESTION:  Sarah, the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection said  today that they are no longer going to be referring people who cross the  border without authorization for criminal charges if they're traveling with  children, which is essentially a return to the Obama administration  practice and administrations before that.  Does the president support that  approach?  And if so, does he regret trying to push forward on a zero- tolerance approach in the first place? </p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS:  No.  The president certainly supports keeping families  together, which he has outlined several times over the last week.  But he's  also called on Congress to actually fix the system. </p><p>They're the only ones that ultimately have the ability to change the law.   The president's executive order has given a temporary solution to the  problem but it's not permanent, and we need Congress to step up.  We need  Democrats to stop playing political games, do their jobs, work with this  president and let's fix the problem at the border. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Jeff? </p><p>QUESTION:  Sarah, can you talk about why you tweeted from your official  account about the episode that you had at the restaurant on Friday night? </p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Sure.  I was responding to a number of news stories.  I  would been reached out to by over a dozen reporters, and there were  multiple news stories that had already been issued. </p><p>It was considered news of the day, so I responded in the way I would to any  other news of the day story. </p><p>Jeff? </p><p>QUESTION:  Sarah, you said just because you don't see a judge doesn't mean  you don't get due process.  Can you explain what you mean by that  specifically, and how the president envisions that this would work while  still maintaining what the Constitution upholds in having a swift  immigration system? </p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Again, there are other ways for removal.  There are  thousands of illegal aliens that are removed every month that don't see  judges.  Sometimes that's through voluntary removal, and sometimes that's  through expedited removal. </p><p>Again, the president's ultimate goal would be that we have actually a  secure border, and people aren't coming into the country illegally.  But  that we have a system that works and the people that come into the country  come in through a legal system. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Jill? </p><p>QUESTION:  What is the president doing specifically this week to ensure  that Congress passes a bill?  He's spent all week in Nevada talking about - - or, all weekend.  Excuse me -- on Saturday, talking about how Democrats  want open borders and crime.  But, specifically, has he made phone calls to  Republican members in the House, where the bill is pending?  Has he tried  to bring Democrats together?  What is he doing specifically to try and get  a new law passed, specifically, other than just railing against the current  law? </p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS:  The president met with a number of lawmakers last week,  talked with several over the weekend, some that he was with while he was  traveling.  Last week, he made an open invitation to Democrat lawmakers --  that they were welcome to come to the White House to discuss what they'd  like to see, because the president wants solutions. </p><p>We've yet to have any of them to show up, actually willing to have those  conversations, actually willing to fix the problem.  Instead, they'd rather  rant and rave about not allowing members of the Trump administration to  step foot in public. </p><p>The president wants to see solutions.  That's what we're focused on.  It's  Congress's job to do that, and we've laid out very clearly that we want to  be part of that and what we'd like to see in that package. </p><p>Jill? </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>QUESTION:  ... on this? </p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Clearly, they aren't.  If they haven't passed a law to  fix this system, then they haven't.  Republicans have laid out a number of  proposals that they support.  The president has voiced his support for  those. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>QUESTION:  ... probably fail this week, though.  The Republican bills will  probably...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS:  That's because no Democrat will get on board and  actually support a solution. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>QUESTION:  ... Republican -- is your Republicans cannot pass these  Republican bills.  What is the president doing as the leader of the party  to try and get Republican...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Jeff, these aren't Republican bills.  These are bills  that fix a broken system.  They may have Republican sponsors, but these  should be bipartisan.  This shouldn't be complicated.  Look, the House has  already passed over 500 pieces of legislation, but they can't get through  the Senate because Democrats refuse to actually find solutions. </p><p>We have 50 bills that passed just last week to address the opioid crisis --  that passed through the House.  The Senate still hasn't taken them up.   Hopefully, they will.  And, if they do, that will show that we actually can  come up with bipartisan solutions.  And that's what we'd like to see them  do on immigration, as well. </p><p>Jill? </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>QUESTION:  ... follow-up on Julia's question about the zero-tolerance  policy.  The president said, last week, after signing the executive order,  that he believed that zero tolerance was still important.  You guys made a  point of the fact that the E. O.  did not actually get rid of the policy. </p><p>How does that square with the fact that CBP is now saying that they are no  longer referring for prosecution any adults who come in with children? </p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Again, this is a temporary solution.  This isn't going  to last.  Congress still has to step up.  They still have to do their job.   This will only last a short amount of time because we're going to run out  of space, we're going to run out of resources in order to keep people  together, and we're asking Congress to provide those resources and do their  job.  And...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>QUESTION:  ... temporary solution -- does that mean, at some point, you are  going to change that policy back? </p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS:  We're not changing the policy.  We're simply out of  resources, and, at some point, Congress has to do what they were elected to  do, and that is secure our border.  That is stop the crime coming into our  country. </p><p>The country has made extremely clear that they don't want open borders, and  Democrats need to understand that, and they need to work with Republicans  and find some solutions. </p><p>QUESTION:  And there...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Annie.  Sorry, Jill, I'm going to keep going.  Annie, go  ahead. </p><p>QUESTION:  Sarah, you mentioned the state of resources and running out of  them.  Can you be specific about what the resources are right now for  housing parents and children together?  Is there enough housing right now?   Is the Pentagon stepping in?  Like, what's being done about the resources?  </p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Again, we're looking at every option available.  We have  asked the Pentagon to help with additional space.  But a lot of that will  depend on our ability to stop people coming into the country illegally.   And we, again, encourage people to go through ports of entry instead of  crossing the border illegally. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS:  We've requested, through legislation -- we're working  with Congress, hopefully, to provide more resources and the ability to  actually enforce the law. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Ayesha? </p><p>QUESTION:  Thank you.  I just want to see if you can kind of narrow down  exactly what the president actually intends to do when it comes to this  idea of not having judges.  You say that there are instances where people  don't have judges, but my understanding is that, if you do ask for asylum,  you do have certain rights. </p><p>So is there going to be a change in that policy, or what is this  administration planning to do to make it so you don't have to see a judge?   (INAUDIBLE)  </p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Again, I have addressed this a couple times.  There are  multiple instances in where you wouldn't:  voluntary removal, certain cases  have expedited removal.  If somebody comes through a port of entry seeking  asylum, those cases and that process will be heard.  But at the same time,  the president's ultimate goal is to secure the border and stop illegal  immigration. </p><p>QUESTION:  I -- I -- I understand that, but so what does that mean  practically?  Like, is the president planning to do anything differently,  or are you just saying, you don't like the way (INAUDIBLE) now? </p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS:  The president's laid out what he'd like to see.  We've  put out the things that we want to see in an immigration package months  ago.  We're still waiting on Congress to give us the ability to do that. </p><p>QUESTION:  So -- so unless Congress acts, nothing is actually going to  change?  The administration is not changing anything right now, when it  comes to judges? </p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS:  You mean, are we walking around making up laws?  No,  because we're not the Obama administration.  We're actually trying to  enforce the laws that are on the books.  We're actually asking Congress to  do their part in the process, and pass new legislation that will fix our  immigration system. </p><p>QUESTION:  So -- but nothing is actually changing on the ground.  Like,  this -- so this is -- the president's complaining about judges, and saying  that we shouldn't have all these judges, and people who come over should  just be put out, but nothing is actually going to change.  He's just saying  -- he's just complaining about the process as it stands now. </p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Things that we have the ability to do administratively,  we are working to do.  But again, Congress is the only one that has the  ability to write law, and we hope they'll do that. </p><p>Steve? </p><p>QUESTION:  I'm honing in on that point.  I'm trying to understand what it  is the president understands about the current policy, because as you've  explained, expedited removal allows the government to remove hundreds of  thousands of illegal immigrants a year without seeing judges.  Did the  president know that when he issued the tweets? </p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Yeah, but there are still thousands that go through a  very lengthy process.  We'd like to see the process consolidated.  We'd  like to see the backlog stopped.  We'd like to see our border secured. </p><p>Sorry, Steve, I'm going to keep going. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>QUESTION:  Under current law there are a couple of things that the  president could do.  You could expand that policy.  You've said that he  would like to see more expedited removal.  Does the president intend to  expand it to the full two-year limit under the current statute? </p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Again, we would like to see more expedited removal, but  ultimately, we would like to see the border secured and people stop coming  into the country illegally.  That seems pretty simple to me, and it would  stop a lot of the problems, and would eliminate the need for so many of  these additional laws. </p><p>QUESTION:  Thanks, Sarah.  The gal in the briefing talking about the  importance of civility.  Do you consider it a civil policy to separate more  than two thirds of the children from their parents? </p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS:  We consider enforcing the law the role that the  administration has to play.  Certainly, the president has taken an  executive action to the furthest that he has the ability to do to minimize  the separation of families.  We're working hard to make sure families get  to stay together, and we're calling on Congress to help us in that effort,  and we're continuing to focus on the reunification, and making sure that  the families, again, stay together, and that Congress will give us a  permanent solution to fix that. </p><p>QUESTION:  But you say that you're working to make families stay together.   It was your administration that separated them in the first place. </p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS:  It wasn't our administration that created these laws,  but it is our administration's job to enforce it, and we've done that.  If  someone breaks the law, it's our job to enforce it.  If somebody doesn't  like the law, then they need to lobby Congress and ask them to change it.  </p><p>Anita. </p><p>QUESTION:  I have, one, an immigration question, and wanted to clarify one  thing.  So I understand that not every adult with a child is going to be  prosecuted.  If there are families that are being held together, detained  together somewhere and 20 days goes by, what is going to happen then?  I  didn't get an -- an answer with that last week.  I don't understand.  The  law says you can't keep them together, keep the children, even with parents  for longer than 20 days.  So then what happens? </p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Hopefully, Congress will pass the law and fix the  problem. </p><p>QUESTION:  (INAUDIBLE) 20 days? </p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Well, why should it be so hard?  They all say that they  don't want to separate families.  Seems like it should be pretty simple to  me. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS:  John? </p><p>QUESTION:  I said I had a clarification...</p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Go ahead. </p><p>QUESTION:  ... so Jeff asked you a question about Congress and the bill.   Were you, in your response, referring to just a stand-alone bill that deals  with family separation, or were you referring to the bigger immigration  bill that the House hopes to take up this week? </p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Our preference would be a bill that addresses all of the  pillars that we've laid out, that we'd like to see addressed in an  immigration package.  And that's what our focus is right now, is there's a  bill that does that on the table. </p><p>If that doesn't happen, then we'll talk about other pieces of legislation  at that point. </p><p>QUESTION:  (INAUDIBLE) the president still wants that bill to go forward  even though he said...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Certain...</p><p>QUESTION:  ... they don't want to -- he -- they shouldn't waste their time  on it? </p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Look, Democrats in the Senate have made clear they're  not going to support this.  </p><p>And because we need at least some Democrats to get on board, they've made  it very clear that they don't want to work with the president, that they  don't want to fix our immigration system.  That they'd rather have open  borders and rampant crime than work with the president to create solutions.   Until they change their mind, we're going to continue looking at the best  ways that we can fix these problems but we need Congress to help us. </p><p>John. </p><p>QUESTION:  Thank you, Sarah.  This president is the first in the television  age who has yet to address the American public on nationwide television  from the Oval Office.  Many Republican consultants have said that he might  have a stronger hand in influencing Congress if he made a nationally  televised address on immigration and what changes he'd like to see, to  explain it. </p><p>Is that something that's on the table within the administration? </p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Certainly don't want to take anything off the table, or  any tool away from the president.  He does address the American people in a  number of different venues and formats.  And I will certainly pass along  that suggestion to him. </p><p>Nadia. </p><p>QUESTION:  Just a follow-up on the Middle East.  In the recent (INAUDIBLE)  Mr. Kushner said that if President Abbas is not willing to negotiate, he's  going to proceed with the deal.  Can you explain how the White House is  hoping to achieve any progress in the Middle East peace talks if the  principal party is not taking part in it? </p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS:  We're going to continue meeting with the other partners  in the region.  And, again, we're going to continue pushing forward in the  peace process.  We had productive meetings over the last week.  We're going  to continue those conversations. </p><p>I will take one last question.  Saagar.  </p><p>QUESTION:  Thanks, Sarah.  </p><p>To follow up on the judges -- on the issue of immigration judges, why is  the President so opposed to an increase in the number of immigration judges  when it would expedite the asylum processing -- the asylum process and  expedite deportation?  </p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS:  We're not opposed to the speeding up the process.  What  the President would like to see, once again, is that we stop the problem at  the very beginning.  He'd like to see us secure the border and people work  through the system, through the ports of entry, so that we're not dealing  with things on the back end.  </p><p>We'd like to stop the problem before it starts, and that's what the  president's focus has been all along, is on securing the border.  And  that's what we're going to continue to do.  </p><p>Thanks so much guys.  Have a great day.  </p><p>NEIL CAVUTO, HOST:  All right, you have been listening to Sarah Sanders  here.</p><p>And it's safe to say the Washington press corps is more concerned with the  immigration issue than a lot of folks losing their shirts today on this  whole trade issue.  </p><p>Welcome, everybody.  I'm Neil Cavuto.  And you're watching \"Your World.\"</p><p>And it could have worse.  As I show you the Dow today down about 328  points, we had been down almost 500 points, and a lot of that over a  building trade war and concerns this could get worse before it gets better,  or that there are no signs of concessions on the part of any of the  principal parties, namely the Chinese and ourselves.  </p><p>All of this on the same day that Harley-Davidson was indicating, because of  these threat of tariffs, they're moving a lot of their operations outside  the U.S.</p><p>On a separate issue, General Motors has indicated that a lot of its Chevy  Blazers will now be made in Mexico, not citing just the trade issue,  but  that it's not welcome noise here.</p><p>So, again, this could have a lot been worse.  There was some confusion  early on in the markets as to whether the administration was also  recommending that they were urging the Chinese and others not to invest in  technology stocks at all.  </p><p>Then Peter Navarro ends up popping up on CNBC to say, no, no, no, no, no,  they're not going to be, nor are there plans in the works for investment  restrictions on China.</p><p>And that brought us down to the levels we're at right now, about 328 points  southward on what was a crazy day on the markets.</p><p>We're going to be at this from all angles right now.</p><p>Let's first go to FOX Business Network's Deirdre Bolton with how it all  sorted out.</p><p>Hey, Deirdre.</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, Neil.  </p><p>You said it.  It could have been much worse.  So, the markets did close  clearly lower, but certainly off the low points of the day.  And, of  course, the big headline, the Trump administration moving to block Chinese  companies from investing in U.S. tech firms and moving to block additional  tech exports from the U.S. to China.  </p><p>Our sources are saying the Treasury Department is going to make an official  announcement at the end of this week, bring us more clarity, more details  on the plan.  </p><p>Now, the level of difficulty is, of course, much higher when you start to  talk about blocking investment than when we're just engaging in tariff  spats.  So the stock market heading for the biggest one-day slide in  months.  </p><p>That's how we finished up.  You can see red across the screen.  One area I  really wanted to highlight are the techs, because S&amp;P 500 tech companies  get about 60 percent of their revenue from overseas.  So that's the highest  foreign exposure out of any of the index's 11 sectors.  </p><p>And, of course,critics of our current trade policy say that China has been  stealing anywhere between $30 billion and $50 billion worth of intellectual  property, hard data, every year for the past decade.  But then there was  even a stronger report, a more recent one that came out from the Commission  on the Theft of American Intellectual Property.</p><p>It has a much higher number, stating that up to $600 billion in theft that  has some projections baked in is possible.  But experts say, bottom line,  the motivation to want to level the playing field is completely  understandable.  </p><p>What gets complicated is that so many American businesses are  interconnected.  So, for example, here's seven big tech American companies  that source half of their products and components from China.  </p><p>So, HP, IBM, Dell, Cisco, Unisys, Microsoft, Intel.  Even Apple has sold  more iPhones in China in the last three years than in the U.S.  And Apple  gets about 20 percent of its annual revenue from China.  </p><p>Now, the Chinese president of course says China will punch back and will  not be forced to eat the bitter fruit.  That is a translation, a direct  quote.  </p><p>But as the tension rises between the world's two biggest economies, of  course, investors really showed their anxiety.  So, we had the Nasdaq, you  can see there, closely lower, essentially 2 percent, biggest one-day  percentage decline since March.  Third day down in a row.  So, that's the  longest losing streak for that tech-heavy comp in about two months' time.</p><p>Even Asia overnight, you can see how markets reacted there.  You can see  Hong Kong's Hang Seng down by more than 1 percent.  And, then, of course,  even on our own bond market, right, there was this flight to safety in U.S.  10-year.  Investors typically, of course, buy these bonds when they're  fearful or they feel less certain of the future.  </p><p>And prices really went up, so, therefore, those yields went down, settling  2.875 percent.  And just worth noting, these yields have fallen basically  for the past four out of five weeks.  </p><p>So, Neil, what is clear is, investors really don't know what to make of it.   We have the tariffs and now we have this idea of blocking direct  investment, which is a much more muscular and, quite frankly, threatening  move than tariffs, which really only apply to very specific products, Neil.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Absolutely, especially when they go back and forth either way.</p><p>BOLTON:  Yes.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Thank you very, very much, Deirdre Bolton.</p><p>BOLTON:  Sure.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Doesn't Harley-Davidson know that?  Not so much on the tariffs  we're considering, but the response that company is getting and opting to  do something that the president probably didn't envision.  </p><p>FOX Business Network's Jeff Flock in Countryside, Illinois.  </p><p>What did they do?  </p><p>JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  They're getting a double  whammy at Harley-Davidson, Neil, because the steel and aluminum tariffs hit  their raw materials costs.</p><p>And now the European Union, of course, imposing an addition 25 percent  tariff on motorcycles made here and shipped to Europe.</p><p>And so Harley is in a tough spot.  That tariff went from 6 percent to 31  percent.  And today, in a regulatory filing, Harley said that is going to  add more than $2,000 a bike to the cost of a motorcycle made here in the  U.S. and sold in Europe.  And they can't possibly pass that along to  consumers.</p><p>So, in the short-term, they're going to have to eat it.  In the long term,  they're going to move production away from the U.S.  Europe was an  expanding market for Harley-Davidson.  They love it over there.  And U.S.  sales have been down.</p><p>You look at the first quarter of this year, U.S. sales of Harleys down  double digits, as guys like me get older and maybe give up their  motorcycles.  In Europe, it had been growing by about 7 percent.  </p><p>And so those bikes, made in the U.S. and shipped to Europe, will be no  more.  Harley has four plants here in the U.S., York, Pennsylvania, Kansas  City, Missouri, and two in their home state of Wisconsin, and now  apparently bikes destined for Europe will not be made there anymore.</p><p>Instead, they will be made in places like Brazil and elsewhere, Thailand  and Australia.  This is not, as you pointed out at the outset, what the  president had intended.  His trade policies designed to keep and create  jobs here in the U.S.  In this case, it appears they will be eliminating  them -- Neil.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Amazing.</p><p>All right, Jeff Flock, thank you very, very much.  </p><p>All right, Mattie Duppler is.  We have got Charles Payne here, Larry Shover  here as well of SFG, alternate CME trader as well.  </p><p>Charles Payne, what is going on here?  We knew the trade thing was getting  antsy, but it seemed like the bottom fell out.  </p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  It did, but because I think this had  a little bit of a different twist.</p><p>This was investment.  This is about -- the whole thing, by the way, is  centered on made in China 2025.  The administration, which I wish they  would articulate what they're trying to do, because I understand, and I  think most -- a lot of people do -- and it's the idea of curbing this  ambition, the stated ambition by China to sort of be the world's tech  leader in a short period of time.</p><p>And one way to get there, perhaps the only way they can get their with  their own timeline, is to continue to steal our intellectual property.</p><p>So the idea is to restrict investments from companies where China has a 25  percent or more ownership.  And, again, this was just speculation.  It was  in a few media outlets, the White House trying to take -- take it back a  little bit.  It's something obviously that they have toyed around with.</p><p>Peter Navarro has talked about this kind of thing for maybe two decades, so  this is not necessarily news, per se.  But it is -- it is a different  twist, to your point.  It's not -- it's not the trade stuff anymore, as  much as it is, hey, we want to take direct aim at your ambitions to usurp  America's perch as the world's tech leader.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, Larry, what worried a lot in the markets is that, all of a  sudden, then we were putting a general wall up on Chinese investment in  general and technology period.  </p><p>That's how it was interpreted.  And then, later on, the treasury secretary,  Mnuchin, came out to say, no, no, no, it wasn't singling out China, as if  to say there's other players here, as if that eased the angst.  </p><p>It actually compounded that.  But what do you make of that?  </p><p>LARRY SHOVER, SOLUTIONS FUNDS GROUP:  Well, what I make of it is that two  things.</p><p>The whole thing lacked clarity.  Like, it didn't matter.  Like, this whole  China tweets and tirades, it didn't matter because it lacked clarity.  It  seemed like the White House is utterly unprepared to create any kind of  proposal that can go into law.</p><p>Immigration policy is a good proof of that.  Also, it lacks credibility,  because we all know -- I mean, this does -- this hurts us more than it  hurts them, the fact that it's going to kill Apple or Nike.  It really,  really hurt them manufacturing their goods there that are sent to us.</p><p>So it doesn't make any sense.  People dismissed it.  And I really think  people are definitely blaming the China trade today.  The bigger problem,  though, it's really tech.  We saw that breaking down last week.</p><p>Leadership has been very thin in the stock market.  Without five or six  super cap techs in the S&amp;P 500...</p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes.  </p><p>SHOVER:  ... we would be down 4 percent, instead of up 1.5 percent.</p><p>But it started to crack.  The Supreme Court came out last week with a  ruling on sales tax, et cetera.  That chasm between growth and value has  been very, very wide.  The market is vulnerable.  The ball will always find  you when you're out of position.</p><p>And that's really what happened today.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  And people were a little anxious on that investment angle here and  maybe finding an excuse for technology, which ran up far and fast, to sell  off some of it.</p><p>But, Mattie, it's sort of this impression that not everyone in the  administration seems to be on the same page.  I'm getting different vibes  from the Treasury secretary, different vibes from their trade  representatives, different vibes from the president.</p><p>MATTIE DUPPLER, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S FORUM:  Right.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  And I think that's the kind of thing that scares markets.  </p><p>DUPPLER:  Oh, absolutely.</p><p>You finally have consensus on this panel, Neil.  And that's, what the heck  is the administration intending to do with these trade efforts?</p><p>Charles and I don't always agree on this issue, but right now we're both  wondering, what is the objective here?  And that's what the administration  needs to clarify.  It needs to make clear what it intends to do with all of  these efforts towards China.</p><p>Now, if the objective here is to exact the most amount of pain and pressure  on China possible, they need to make sure that they're not injecting pain  on American businesses.  And that's a concern, especially when you look at  really artificially diminishing the amount of capital that can come into  this country.</p><p>I worry about the impact on businesses.  And that's not even getting to  what tariffs are doing to American businesses, where we have already seen  some of those announcements this week.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Or even the threat of them.</p><p>But, Charles, the other thing you mentioned -- and this -- you can help me  out here.  It's always been that the Chinese are in bad shape here.   They're at two-year-plus lows in their market.  They have a lot more to  lose than we do.</p><p>But they also have their pride, and they're not giving any ground.  So, how  is this resolved, if it is?</p><p>PAYNE:  And this is where I disagree with Larry.  </p><p>I don't think -- I think a lot of people are raising the white flag so  quickly that China is going to beat us at this.  They're not.  If it has to  go the whole way... </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  The whole way could be years.  </p><p>PAYNE:  Yes, Sure.</p><p>Mattie makes the right point.  It's sort of like when my pops used to take  me out in the back.  He says, it's going to hurt me as much as it hurts  you.  </p><p>No, it won't.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>PAYNE:  With that being said, let's look at what China did today, this  morning.  </p><p>Their central bank freed up banks over there to the tune of $100 billion.   Right?  This is to sort of...</p><p>CAVUTO:  It needs a stimulant.</p><p>PAYNE:  ... to do things thing on debt.  </p><p>Last week, it was $30 billion.  A week before that, it was $30 billion.   Their foreign and reserve currencies have dropped a trillion dollars.  </p><p>Their debt-to-GDP ratio is on its way to 300 percent.  We aren't going to  lose this.  China knows we're not going to lose this.  Nobody wants to  lose.  It's a matter of how, to your point, do you save face and resolve  it?</p><p>CAVUTO:  I think that's where we are.  </p><p>Larry, the Chinese, remember, today indicating, you know, we don't just  turn a cheek on this.  And we come back and we're going to fight back.  </p><p>Now, to be clear, no response to the tariffs yet with tariffs of their own.   In other words, to increase the amount to match the United States, when we  promised we would put $200 billion on top of that.</p><p>Some read into that a sign that the Chinese are trying to find a middle  ground here, where they can talk tough, but they don't have to respond in  kind and invite a war.  What do you see?  </p><p>SHOVER:  Yes.</p><p>Well, I see that they have already done that, just what we said.  Required  reserve ratio dropped 50 basis points yesterday, adding all that liquidity  into the market.  What did that do?  That dropped RMB by 1.5 percent in  five days, 3.5 percent over the last month.  </p><p>So they're already ready.  That is going to negate any kind of trade tariff  that we are going to impose.  And I think they know, at the end of the day,  that there's so lack of clarity coming out of the White House, that they're  just preparing for it.  </p><p>Also realizing that they have had a real soft patch of data coming in.  So,  perhaps Trump is trying to hit them while they're weak.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  We will see.</p><p>All right, guys, I apologize jumping on you.  We have got a lot of breaking  news here.  </p><p>I do want to bring in my next guest, the former Heinz CEO Bill Johnson, a  global read of things, if ever there were one.  </p><p>And, Bill, I'm looking at this and wondering what the signals could be for  us.  If a company, one after the other, like GM considering making all its  Blazers now in Mexico, and, of course, we have been talking about a number  of other companies that have been doing the same or considering preemptive  move like Harley-Davidson, that has got to have a domestic economic impact.</p><p>BILL JOHNSON, FORMER CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, H.J. HEINZ COMPANY:  It should, Neil.  </p><p>Nothing has happened yet to impact the economy here.  And, frankly, the  Chinese and European economies...</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, they're already leaving.  Those guys are already making some  moves.  </p><p>JOHNSON:  I understand.  But they're more vulnerable than we are.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  True.</p><p>JOHNSON:  Having said that, this is like tic-tac-toe.  Nobody wins.  </p><p>I play tic-tac-toe with any grandkids.  And you never win.  And that's what  this is now.  We have gotten to the point on this situation...</p><p>CAVUTO:  You never won at tic-tac-toe with your grandkids?  </p><p>JOHNSON:  No.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  You're one of the most celebrated CEOs ever.  And... </p><p>JOHNSON:  Yes.  That just shows you nobody wins, Neil.  And that's where we  are right now.  Nobody wins.</p><p>CAVUTO:  So, that's where you see -- that's where we are right now?</p><p>JOHNSON:  I do think that's where we are.</p><p>I think this created a huge environment of uncertainty.  You and I have had  this conversation many times.  Uncertainty leads to volatility.  Volatility  leads to more uncertainty.  And we get in this vicious cycle.  </p><p>And I think that's where we are now.  Having said that, I think,  ultimately, saner and cooler heads will prevail, and this will somehow get  resolved.  </p><p>I hope this is not a negotiation ploy, because it's rather ham-fisted.  And  there has got to be better ways to attack this issue than the one that is  being generated right now.</p><p>CAVUTO:  What do you make -- I think it was ratcheted up a little bit today  to go after in this case the Chinese for investing in technology.</p><p>It was read as, we're not going to allow them to invest in any technology  companies.  And that might have been a prematurely wrong impression.  But  that was the one that was out there for hours in the markets.  They had to  dial that back a little bit.</p><p>But they're still looking at putting a limit to who can invest in  technology.  That's how it interpreted, hence, technology falls off a lot.   So if this is more from just goods and services to, I don't know, even  companies and stocks you invest in, then what?  </p><p>JOHNSON:  Well, then I think we have chaos, Neil. </p><p>I don't think you can stop the investment in a capitalist society.  It's  just the way the system works.  And while I understand why the  administration is going after some of these issues -- and they're sort of  going where people have been afraid to tread before -- the reality is, we  have to have some clarity in the communication of the purpose of what we're  trying to achieve and then take a step-by-step process in which to achieve  it.  </p><p>And I heard about the investment situation this morning.  Then I saw  Secretary Mnuchin's response.  And so I'm completely unclear as to what is  happening.  And there we go again.  That creates more uncertainty, which  creates more volatility, and leaves us all in the dark about what it is  we're trying to achieve.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Now, there used to be an old rule here following this president  the last 18 months that those who doubted him would be proven wrong, and  that everything ends up OK and markets come back from what look like  debacles, and people who second-guessed him have been proven wrong.  </p><p>So there was this now new -- or renewed trust that President Trump must  know what he's doing, there's a method to all of this.  </p><p>Do you subscribe to that, or is there now a reassessment, well, maybe not.   Maybe this is a little impulsive.  Maybe there's not a method to the  madness.  Maybe it's just madness.</p><p>JOHNSON:  Well, I think, historically, over his last 18 months in office,  he's done a pretty good job of bringing us back from the brink and  achieving great success.  </p><p>North Korea seems to be an example of one of those areas.  But I don't  know.  I don't like this whole approach, Neil.  I think it's so ham-fisted  and so unpredictable that sometimes you create a fire out of a smoke bomb,  and the next thing you know, you have got a real conflagration going, and  you don't know how to put it out.  And that -- I'm worried we're headed  that way.</p><p>Having said that, I will give him credit for again treading in these places  that need to be addressed.  I just think there's better ways to do it.  But  I'm not yet ready to say that we're just going to pull this one back from  the brink and everyone is going to be happy.  </p><p>I just don't know.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  We shall see, my friend.  Thank you very, very much.  </p><p>Good luck in your next tic-tac-toe game.  I give the edge to you still.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>JOHNSON:  Thank you.  Thank you.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  William Johnson, the former Heinz CEO, if anyone knows the global  landscape, it is he.  All right. </p><p>All right, when we come back here, this nastiness with Democrats saying  that we're going to get nasty no matter where Republicans gather.  </p><p>Really?  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Yikes, 25 minutes, right, a 5:00 p.m. deadline staring down now,  as House Republicans want documents from the Justice Department on that  Clinton e-mail probe and the Russian investigation.  Then what happens if  they don't get them?  </p><p>After this.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. MAXINE WATERS (D), CALIFORNIA:  And if you see anybody from that  Cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you  get out and you create a crowd.  </p><p>(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>WATERS:  And you push back on them.  And you tell them they're not welcome.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, anyway, American Majority CEO Ned Ryun.  We have got Olympic  Media managing editor Katie Frates and Democratic strategist Christy  Setzer.</p><p>I don't know where to begin.  But, Katie, maybe you can help me with this.  </p><p>This is out of control.  This is just crazy talk.  What do you make of it?  </p><p>KATIE FRATES, OLYMPIC MEDIA:  It absolutely is.  </p><p>This is just going way too far, because she doesn't even know who she is  speaking to, Maxine Waters, when she is saying this.  What if someone sees  somebody at a gas station and takes it way too far?  </p><p>You're essentially encouraging anyone of any mental state, of any level of  discourse, to go up and potentially harm someone else because of their  political beliefs.  That's absolutely not OK.  </p><p>I'm so excited and happy to see at least Nancy Pelosi push back on this.   I'm not sure why more Democratic leaders are not speaking up and condemning  this.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, there were a good number.  To be fair, there were a good  number, Elijah Cummings and all saying...</p><p>FRATES:  Good.  Good.</p><p>CAVUTO:  ... that, even when it came to the Sanders situation, she  shouldn't have been taken out of the restaurant.  </p><p>But, Ned, I'm worried more about the increasing vitriol.  And we're seeing  more and more of it.  And anything could happen in that environment.</p><p>NED RYUN, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN MAJORITY:  No.</p><p>And I think really what we're seeing is, to sum up Charles Krauthammer, we  conservatives, we think the left is philosophically misguided, and many on  the left think we're evil.  </p><p>And I think you're seeing this rhetoric ramp up where borders are now  bigotry and American presidents standing up for the America taxpayer, well,  this is Nazism and the second coming of the Holocaust.  </p><p>And I think what the left is trying to do is say, the debate is over in our  minds because we consider your ideas to be irrational.  We don't consider  your ideas to be legitimate.  </p><p>And if they can dehumanize the other side, that's what they want to do,  because that justifies driving opposing thought from the public square.  </p><p>The thing that troubles me, Neil, about all of this, this kind of  incitement to physical intimidation and bullying is not to be normalized.   It's not normal for a constitutional republic.  It's only normal in banana  republics.  And if the left wants to beat us, try doing it at the ballot  box in 2018 and 2020.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Do you worry about that, Christy?  </p><p>As a Democratic strategist, and a darn good one, and a very calm person, I  might point out, that your party could be ruining it for itself, that it's  actually scaring some people with that kind of talk, whether you agree or  disagree with the politics behind it.  </p><p>CHRISTY SETZER, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  I just think it's impossible to put  Maxine Waters' comments like this in a vacuum like this.</p><p>The defining feature of Donald Trump's campaign was not that he was going  to shake stuff up in Washington or that he was a great businessman.  It was  this incivility.  Right?  </p><p>He started talking about how, I like people that were not captured about  John McCain.  Then you looked as his rallies, where they were filled with  him actively asking them to take violence against protesters.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  If that is what your view is, do you think that the response,  responding in kind, then, if that's your view, is justified?</p><p>SETZER:  I don't think that -- no, I don't think that we have responded in  kind.  </p><p>I think that Democrats are saying, look, we need to make it just a little  bit uncomfortable.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  You have got whole groups that target a homeland security  secretary at a restaurant.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SETZER:  No, no, no, no.  Not with violence, Neil.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SETZER:  That's an extraordinarily important difference.  Not with  violence.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Please listen to me.  </p><p>Sarah Sanders, her incident, Secretary Nielsen outside her home and in a  restaurant, then Maxine Waters justifying it.  I could go on to talk about  Florida's Pam Bondi and what she dealt with at a movie.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  Stephen Miller and be called a fascist while he's out.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SETZER:  Protest is a healthy part of the American tradition, not violence,  not violence.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  You're fine with this.  You're fine with it.  </p><p>But if it were done in reverse, you wouldn't be fine with it.</p><p>SETZER:  I would be absolutely fine with it.  I would be fine with it,  because, again, protest is absolutely fine.</p><p>What is not fine...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  You just said when you didn't like it what Donald Trump and his  people were doing the same.  </p><p>SETZER:  I'm sorry?</p><p>CAVUTO:  You didn't like it when Donald Trump was doing that.</p><p>SETZER:  No.  What Donald Trump was saying was, I want that guy to be taken  out on a stretcher.  What Donald Trump was doing was actually what Ned Ryun  was just talking about right now, which is dehumanizing the other side.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, I don't get it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  OK.</p><p>Mattie, do you believe that this is going too far?  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SETZER:  By talking about how they're animals and infesting America.</p><p>CAVUTO:  I understand.  I heard you.</p><p>SETZER:  That's very different.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Mattie, has this gone too far?  Mattie, you're in awe, aren't you?  </p><p>FRATES:  Yes, yes.  Absolutely, it is.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Katie, I apologize.  I apologize.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  See that?  I lose my place, because I get so wrapped up in it.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Is it your sense that this gets worse, though?  Are you getting a  sense it gets worse?</p><p>FRATES:  So, this is the problem.  </p><p>It's that this is escalating rhetoric.  You're essentially saying mob  someone outside of a gas station.  </p><p>RYUN:  Exactly.  </p><p>FRATES:  And, again, you don't know the intentions of the person who may  then go on to do that.  </p><p>So what if someone is attacked?  What if something violent happens?  And  then you turn around and you say, well, Maxine Waters was telling people to  do that.  It's not a good idea and it's not a healthy dialogue.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SETZER:  Do we remember the Pizzagate conspiracy, how a crazy conspiracy  actually led someone to take a gun to my, my local pizza place, actually,  and try to shoot it up because they had heard this crazy idea on the  Internet and by Alex Jones and others that Hillary Clinton and John Podesta  were up to no good?  </p><p>That led to actual violence.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, I don't want to get in a tit for tat.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  I sometimes feel like I'm separating my teenage sons.  </p><p>But, Ned Ryun, I do know this.  We have all got to bring the octane down a  little bit on all sides here.  </p><p>RYUN:  We do.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  But how do we do that?  </p><p>And should it be incumbent people to just to say, there has got to be a  better way?  Whether the Elijah Cummings approach, this has got to stop,  whether Sarah Sanders' approach, I just politely up and left, and I tried  not to make a big deal of it at the scene, what is it?  What is the answer?</p><p>RYUN:  No.  I think we have got to start policing our own.  We have to  start policing ourselves on the right and the left.  </p><p>And I was encouraged by Nancy Pelosi saying that Maxine Waters' statement  was unacceptable.  I think we have to be honest about it on the right, too,  when we see unacceptable statements.  And I have said this again -- I have  said this before.  I will say it again.  </p><p>When Donald Trump -- I love 85 to 90 percent of his Twitter feed.  When he  is talking about bloody face-lift, you will never me defend that.  I want  him to focus on the positives and policy and all these things.</p><p>When it becomes personal, I think we need to call out our side and say,  this is not how we have more civil discourse in the public arena.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Fully agree.  Fully agree.  </p><p>At our core, guys, we're all human beings.  </p><p>RYUN:  We're all Americans.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  And we can agree to disagree.  But we don't have to be asses in  the process.  </p><p>And none of you are, by the way.  </p><p>But I want to thank you all very, very much.</p><p>And, Katie, I apologize.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRATES:  No, no apology needed.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  I get so apoplectic.  And I don't even know why.  And it's not  even dinnertime.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, by the way, we're close to the witching hour, 5:00 p.m.  Eastern time, that document deadline.  But right now there's indications  the people who have put out that deadline aren't going to get the response  they want in time for that deadline.  </p><p>Then what?  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  Between a deadline coming up in about 15 minutes from  now and, of course, this is the week we're going to see some big testimony  up on Capitol Hill, much of it is behind closed doors.</p><p>Let's get the read from former Justice Department official Tom Dupree.  </p><p>Tom, what is the biggest thing you're waiting for?  </p><p>TOM DUPREE, FORMER JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:  Well, the biggest thing  I'm waiting for in the short-term is whether the Justice Department  complies with the congressional demands.  </p><p>As you point out, the clock is ticking.  They have a document deadline,  production deadline at 5:00 p.m. this afternoon.  We will see if they turn  over what they're expected to turn over.  My guess is that they are not  going to satisfy the demands of the House Republicans.</p><p>And I think we are going to see this dispute continue to escalate in the  days ahead.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, then they would want to take even aggressive action  against Rod Rosenstein.  Right?  What would it be?  </p><p>DUPREE:  Well, let's see.</p><p>They have got a wide variety of means at their disposal.  At one end of the  spectrum is just the continued drumbeat of public criticism.  They can amp  that up several ways.</p><p>One thing they could do is, they could issue subpoenas.  Another thing they  could do is, they could actually instigate contempt proceedings.  And then  at the extreme end of the other spectrum, it would be impeachment  proceedings.</p><p>I'm hopeful that they're not going to go there and that cooler heads will  prevail and they be able to sit down and work all of this out before we get  to that point.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Where is all of this going?  </p><p>I mean, especially with the Peter Strzok testimony later on, are they more  interested in his case, finding out what he knew and what was the backdrop  for his comments he was making about then candidate Trump, or what?  </p><p>DUPREE:  Yes.  I think that's a lot of what was going on.</p><p>I mean, I think right now, from the perspective of Congress, there was so  much that was going on behind the scenes in 2016 that Congress wants to  know, what was your reason for doing this?  What was your reason for  handling the investigations the way you did? What was the reason for  getting these wiretaps and for conducting the surveillance?</p><p>Were you using an informant?  Was it a spy, that sort of thing?  And the  fact is, DOJ is not in the business normally of turning over documents.   And so I think, institutionally, there's a huge amount of reluctance to  give Congress what it wants.</p><p>But Congress is beating the drum.  They're on the warpath.  They're trying  to fulfill their oversight function here.  And so I think we have a real  collision that's not in any -- is not going to be sorted out in the near  term.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  When I have looked at a lot of the comments from those identified,  like Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, and these other unidentified individuals,  and then, of course, now I know how James Comey felt about then candidate  Trump and how Andy McCabe felt, his number two.</p><p>I have not run across one piece of evidence to show a pro-Trump person or  someone who was biased to like -- to like Donald Trump.  Now, I might have  missed it.  But, again, doesn't this feed the narrative that that was a  stacked deck, because that certainly that stacked deck mantle has been  claimed by a lot of Republicans that they were out to get him?</p><p>DUPREE:  Yes, I certainly haven't seen anything along the lines of what  you're talking about, Neil.</p><p>It all does seem to be one way.  I guess what's surprising and frankly  disappointing to me is that some of these folks, Strzok in particular, and  Page, that even though they were nominally professionals, that they just  weren't able to put aside their political biases.</p><p>Look, the fact is, is that pretty much everyone in the country harbors  inner thoughts, their own political leanings.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Right. </p><p>DUPREE:  But I think, for most people, and certainly for the vast majority  of people in the FBI historically, they been able to put these biases aside  when it comes to the sacred function of law enforcement.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  But did you share whatever opinion -- we all have opinions.  You  would be vanilla if you didn't.</p><p>But did you -- these were aggressively shared and aggressive opinions at  that.  When you were there, was that -- did you kind of know what your  colleagues felt, whether they were investigating someone or not?  </p><p>DUPREE:  No, not in this way.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes.  </p><p>DUPREE:  I think what is unusual about this, Neil, is that these were  political comments they were discussing in the context of an ongoing  political investigation.</p><p>It's not as though they were investigating some bank robber and trading  texts about the presidential election.  I mean, not saying that would be  OK, but that would be very different.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Right. </p><p>DUPREE:  What they were doing here is, they were carrying out  investigations involving the very candidates who were running at the same  time they're engaged in this correspondence about how they can advance  their own political views through their official duties.</p><p>That is where it crossed a line.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes.  </p><p>You would just love to get the context for these remarks.  What was going  on?  If it's just hatred, I don't know if that is even better or worse.  </p><p>Tom, good seeing you again, my friend.  Thank you.  </p><p>DUPREE:  Likewise.  Thank you, Neil.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p>How about just eliminating ICE?  </p><p>With all this controversy about separating kids from their parents at the  border, and then now trying to reconnect them with their parents, sometimes  far from the border, maybe just get rid of ICE.  Some people are actually  urging that -- after this.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, groups in protests all around wanting to get rid of  ICE.  </p><p>That's right.  After the separation of these kids from their parents, a lot  of folks saying, you know, the problem isn't these coming into our country.   It's the folks who are trying to keep them out and the way they go about  their business.  So, they're actually saying, get rid of ICE.  Put ICE on  ice, if you will.</p><p>Former ICE agent Claude Arnold on that.</p><p>What do you think of that?  </p><p>CLAUDE ARNOLD, FORMER ICE SPECIAL AGENT:  Well, I -- first of all, people  don't understand the breadth of ICE's mission.  </p><p>Immigration enforcement is half of the mission.  It has an entire  component, homeland security investigations, that investigates all crime  related to the border.  </p><p>It's the investigative arm for all of DHS.  It's the second largest  investigative entity in the U.S. government and it investigates a lot of  things, drug smuggling, human trafficking and smuggling, child pornography,  export of illegal technologies.</p><p>It has a huge national security responsibility.  It's the second largest  representation on the Federal Joint Terrorism Task Force after the FBI.  </p><p>So to say you just need to get rid of ICE, I think people don't understand  all that ICE does.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, a lot of them were saying, right after these apprehensions,  well, does it change and does their mission statement change given on the  administration?  It was this administration that, led by Jeff Sessions,  said, we're going to enforce a policy where we can, yes, separate kids from  their parents, something that wasn't done, at least not the same way  exactly, in the Obama administration.  </p><p>So do you have to pivot depending on the administration?  </p><p>ARNOLD:  Well, I think there was a pivot done on how enforcement was  conducted during the Obama administration.  </p><p>And, really, it's just been a return to the status quo.  But people have  been -- they have developed a sense of entitlement that you can just come  to the country illegally and expecting it's OK. </p><p>CAVUTO:  Oh, no, you're quite right.  People forget how we were  apprehending underage kids and then who were -- drugs deals and all.   You're quite right about that.</p><p>ARNOLD:  Right.  Right.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  But who calls that?  Do you answer then to whatever the  presidential directive is or what?</p><p>ARNOLD:  Yes, of course.  You're part of the executive branch.  </p><p>ICE does what the president tells them to do through the executive chain of  command.  I mean, it's the executive branch.</p><p>CAVUTO:  So, if there were no ICE, to these people's interests, the  protesters, who would handle this border stuff?  </p><p>ARNOLD:  Well, here's the important thing here, Neil.  </p><p>What is going on is, the same people who want ICE abolished, they opposed  there being any wall on the border.  They oppose changing the loopholes  that encourage and allow people to stay in the U.S. illegally.  </p><p>So, the last stand against those who make it in here illegally is ICE.  So  if you get rid of ICE, then you completely have open borders and no  immigration enforcement.  And that's by design.  They want that to happen.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Amazing.  </p><p>All right, Claude Arnold, thank you very much, former ICE agent.  He's put  himself in a lot of harm's way over the years just to deal with that.  </p><p>People should remember that, no matter what your feelings on this  particular issue.  </p><p>We will have more after this.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Thirty seconds away from that deadline.  What is Rod Rosenstein  going to do?  Is he going to give the Republicans what they want?</p><p>Tomorrow, we will get the read on all of this from Republican House  Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte.  He also was one of the fellows  who came up with a plan to settle this immigration mess.  His measure went  nowhere, but that doesn't mean that immigration progress couldn't still  come up somewhere.  </p><p>A one-on-one with probably one of the more powerful players on Capitol Hill  tomorrow, Bob Goodlatte.</p><p>We will see you then.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> QUESTION:  And one more, on trade, and following up on what Blake asked  about Harley-Davidson.  They announced in an SEC filing they're moving a  significant amount of their operations to Europe because of the E.U.  tariffs that were placed on Harley-Davidson motorcycles.  Is this what the  President envisioned for what the impact would be by placing tariffs on the  E.U. and the retaliation the E.U. has put on the U. S.?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Again, the European  Union is trying to punish U.S. workers because they have engaged repeatedly  in unfair trade practices.  And the president is saying enough is enough.   We'd like to work with the E.U. to work on a level playing field. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Sorry, Steve, I did come to you.  Go ahead.  </p><p> QUESTION:  The president today in the Oval Office, sitting next to the king  of Jordan, mentioned some progress in the Middle East peace process, but he  didn't give us any specifics. </p><p> There's been quite a bit of back-channel diplomacy going on the last few  days in the Middle East, with Jared Kushner and Jason Greenblatt.  Do you  have anything concrete to -- to tell us about any sort of positive movement  whatsoever, from all of this? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Again, we -- I think that the meetings that took place  over the last week with Senior Adviser Jared Kushner and Special  Representative Jason Greenblatt, they met with a number of officials and  principals in Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, Israel and Qatar last week. </p><p> They discussed the situation in Gaza as well as the next stages of the  peace effort.  We're going to continue those conversations and we're  committed to the peace effort, and we're going to keep working forward.   But those conversations were productive. </p><p> Julie? </p><p> QUESTION:  Sarah, the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection said  today that they are no longer going to be referring people who cross the  border without authorization for criminal charges if they're traveling with  children, which is essentially a return to the Obama administration  practice and administrations before that.  Does the president support that  approach?  And if so, does he regret trying to push forward on a zero- tolerance approach in the first place? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  No.  The president certainly supports keeping families  together, which he has outlined several times over the last week.  But he's  also called on Congress to actually fix the system. </p><p> They're the only ones that ultimately have the ability to change the law.   The president's executive order has given a temporary solution to the  problem but it's not permanent, and we need Congress to step up.  We need  Democrats to stop playing political games, do their jobs, work with this  president and let's fix the problem at the border. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Jeff? </p><p> QUESTION:  Sarah, can you talk about why you tweeted from your official  account about the episode that you had at the restaurant on Friday night? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Sure.  I was responding to a number of news stories.  I  would been reached out to by over a dozen reporters, and there were  multiple news stories that had already been issued. </p><p> It was considered news of the day, so I responded in the way I would to any  other news of the day story. </p><p> Jeff? </p><p> QUESTION:  Sarah, you said just because you don't see a judge doesn't mean  you don't get due process.  Can you explain what you mean by that  specifically, and how the president envisions that this would work while  still maintaining what the Constitution upholds in having a swift  immigration system? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Again, there are other ways for removal.  There are  thousands of illegal aliens that are removed every month that don't see  judges.  Sometimes that's through voluntary removal, and sometimes that's  through expedited removal. </p><p> Again, the president's ultimate goal would be that we have actually a  secure border, and people aren't coming into the country illegally.  But  that we have a system that works and the people that come into the country  come in through a legal system. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Jill? </p><p> QUESTION:  What is the president doing specifically this week to ensure  that Congress passes a bill?  He's spent all week in Nevada talking about - - or, all weekend.  Excuse me -- on Saturday, talking about how Democrats  want open borders and crime.  But, specifically, has he made phone calls to  Republican members in the House, where the bill is pending?  Has he tried  to bring Democrats together?  What is he doing specifically to try and get  a new law passed, specifically, other than just railing against the current  law? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  The president met with a number of lawmakers last week,  talked with several over the weekend, some that he was with while he was  traveling.  Last week, he made an open invitation to Democrat lawmakers --  that they were welcome to come to the White House to discuss what they'd  like to see, because the president wants solutions. </p><p> We've yet to have any of them to show up, actually willing to have those  conversations, actually willing to fix the problem.  Instead, they'd rather  rant and rave about not allowing members of the Trump administration to  step foot in public. </p><p> The president wants to see solutions.  That's what we're focused on.  It's  Congress's job to do that, and we've laid out very clearly that we want to  be part of that and what we'd like to see in that package. </p><p> Jill? </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> QUESTION:  ... on this? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Clearly, they aren't.  If they haven't passed a law to  fix this system, then they haven't.  Republicans have laid out a number of  proposals that they support.  The president has voiced his support for  those. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> QUESTION:  ... probably fail this week, though.  The Republican bills will  probably...</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  That's because no Democrat will get on board and  actually support a solution. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> QUESTION:  ... Republican -- is your Republicans cannot pass these  Republican bills.  What is the president doing as the leader of the party  to try and get Republican...</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Jeff, these aren't Republican bills.  These are bills  that fix a broken system.  They may have Republican sponsors, but these  should be bipartisan.  This shouldn't be complicated.  Look, the House has  already passed over 500 pieces of legislation, but they can't get through  the Senate because Democrats refuse to actually find solutions. </p><p> We have 50 bills that passed just last week to address the opioid crisis --  that passed through the House.  The Senate still hasn't taken them up.   Hopefully, they will.  And, if they do, that will show that we actually can  come up with bipartisan solutions.  And that's what we'd like to see them  do on immigration, as well. </p><p> Jill? </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> QUESTION:  ... follow-up on Julia's question about the zero-tolerance  policy.  The president said, last week, after signing the executive order,  that he believed that zero tolerance was still important.  You guys made a  point of the fact that the E. O.  did not actually get rid of the policy. </p><p> How does that square with the fact that CBP is now saying that they are no  longer referring for prosecution any adults who come in with children? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Again, this is a temporary solution.  This isn't going  to last.  Congress still has to step up.  They still have to do their job.   This will only last a short amount of time because we're going to run out  of space, we're going to run out of resources in order to keep people  together, and we're asking Congress to provide those resources and do their  job.  And...</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> QUESTION:  ... temporary solution -- does that mean, at some point, you are  going to change that policy back? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  We're not changing the policy.  We're simply out of  resources, and, at some point, Congress has to do what they were elected to  do, and that is secure our border.  That is stop the crime coming into our  country. </p><p> The country has made extremely clear that they don't want open borders, and  Democrats need to understand that, and they need to work with Republicans  and find some solutions. </p><p> QUESTION:  And there...</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Annie.  Sorry, Jill, I'm going to keep going.  Annie, go  ahead. </p><p> QUESTION:  Sarah, you mentioned the state of resources and running out of  them.  Can you be specific about what the resources are right now for  housing parents and children together?  Is there enough housing right now?   Is the Pentagon stepping in?  Like, what's being done about the resources?  </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Again, we're looking at every option available.  We have  asked the Pentagon to help with additional space.  But a lot of that will  depend on our ability to stop people coming into the country illegally.   And we, again, encourage people to go through ports of entry instead of  crossing the border illegally. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  We've requested, through legislation -- we're working  with Congress, hopefully, to provide more resources and the ability to  actually enforce the law. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Ayesha? </p><p> QUESTION:  Thank you.  I just want to see if you can kind of narrow down  exactly what the president actually intends to do when it comes to this  idea of not having judges.  You say that there are instances where people  don't have judges, but my understanding is that, if you do ask for asylum,  you do have certain rights. </p><p> So is there going to be a change in that policy, or what is this  administration planning to do to make it so you don't have to see a judge?   (INAUDIBLE)  </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Again, I have addressed this a couple times.  There are  multiple instances in where you wouldn't:  voluntary removal, certain cases  have expedited removal.  If somebody comes through a port of entry seeking  asylum, those cases and that process will be heard.  But at the same time,  the president's ultimate goal is to secure the border and stop illegal  immigration. </p><p> QUESTION:  I -- I -- I understand that, but so what does that mean  practically?  Like, is the president planning to do anything differently,  or are you just saying, you don't like the way (INAUDIBLE) now? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  The president's laid out what he'd like to see.  We've  put out the things that we want to see in an immigration package months  ago.  We're still waiting on Congress to give us the ability to do that. </p><p> QUESTION:  So -- so unless Congress acts, nothing is actually going to  change?  The administration is not changing anything right now, when it  comes to judges? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  You mean, are we walking around making up laws?  No,  because we're not the Obama administration.  We're actually trying to  enforce the laws that are on the books.  We're actually asking Congress to  do their part in the process, and pass new legislation that will fix our  immigration system. </p><p> QUESTION:  So -- but nothing is actually changing on the ground.  Like,  this -- so this is -- the president's complaining about judges, and saying  that we shouldn't have all these judges, and people who come over should  just be put out, but nothing is actually going to change.  He's just saying  -- he's just complaining about the process as it stands now. </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Things that we have the ability to do administratively,  we are working to do.  But again, Congress is the only one that has the  ability to write law, and we hope they'll do that. </p><p> Steve? </p><p> QUESTION:  I'm honing in on that point.  I'm trying to understand what it  is the president understands about the current policy, because as you've  explained, expedited removal allows the government to remove hundreds of  thousands of illegal immigrants a year without seeing judges.  Did the  president know that when he issued the tweets? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Yeah, but there are still thousands that go through a  very lengthy process.  We'd like to see the process consolidated.  We'd  like to see the backlog stopped.  We'd like to see our border secured. </p><p> Sorry, Steve, I'm going to keep going. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> QUESTION:  Under current law there are a couple of things that the  president could do.  You could expand that policy.  You've said that he  would like to see more expedited removal.  Does the president intend to  expand it to the full two-year limit under the current statute? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Again, we would like to see more expedited removal, but  ultimately, we would like to see the border secured and people stop coming  into the country illegally.  That seems pretty simple to me, and it would  stop a lot of the problems, and would eliminate the need for so many of  these additional laws. </p><p> QUESTION:  Thanks, Sarah.  The gal in the briefing talking about the  importance of civility.  Do you consider it a civil policy to separate more  than two thirds of the children from their parents? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  We consider enforcing the law the role that the  administration has to play.  Certainly, the president has taken an  executive action to the furthest that he has the ability to do to minimize  the separation of families.  We're working hard to make sure families get  to stay together, and we're calling on Congress to help us in that effort,  and we're continuing to focus on the reunification, and making sure that  the families, again, stay together, and that Congress will give us a  permanent solution to fix that. </p><p> QUESTION:  But you say that you're working to make families stay together.   It was your administration that separated them in the first place. </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  It wasn't our administration that created these laws,  but it is our administration's job to enforce it, and we've done that.  If  someone breaks the law, it's our job to enforce it.  If somebody doesn't  like the law, then they need to lobby Congress and ask them to change it.  </p><p> Anita. </p><p> QUESTION:  I have, one, an immigration question, and wanted to clarify one  thing.  So I understand that not every adult with a child is going to be  prosecuted.  If there are families that are being held together, detained  together somewhere and 20 days goes by, what is going to happen then?  I  didn't get an -- an answer with that last week.  I don't understand.  The  law says you can't keep them together, keep the children, even with parents  for longer than 20 days.  So then what happens? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Hopefully, Congress will pass the law and fix the  problem. </p><p> QUESTION:  (INAUDIBLE) 20 days? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Well, why should it be so hard?  They all say that they  don't want to separate families.  Seems like it should be pretty simple to  me. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  John? </p><p> QUESTION:  I said I had a clarification...</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Go ahead. </p><p> QUESTION:  ... so Jeff asked you a question about Congress and the bill.   Were you, in your response, referring to just a stand-alone bill that deals  with family separation, or were you referring to the bigger immigration  bill that the House hopes to take up this week? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Our preference would be a bill that addresses all of the  pillars that we've laid out, that we'd like to see addressed in an  immigration package.  And that's what our focus is right now, is there's a  bill that does that on the table. </p><p> If that doesn't happen, then we'll talk about other pieces of legislation  at that point. </p><p> QUESTION:  (INAUDIBLE) the president still wants that bill to go forward  even though he said...</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Certain...</p><p> QUESTION:  ... they don't want to -- he -- they shouldn't waste their time  on it? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Look, Democrats in the Senate have made clear they're  not going to support this.  </p><p> And because we need at least some Democrats to get on board, they've made  it very clear that they don't want to work with the president, that they  don't want to fix our immigration system.  That they'd rather have open  borders and rampant crime than work with the president to create solutions.   Until they change their mind, we're going to continue looking at the best  ways that we can fix these problems but we need Congress to help us. </p><p> John. </p><p> QUESTION:  Thank you, Sarah.  This president is the first in the television  age who has yet to address the American public on nationwide television  from the Oval Office.  Many Republican consultants have said that he might  have a stronger hand in influencing Congress if he made a nationally  televised address on immigration and what changes he'd like to see, to  explain it. </p><p> Is that something that's on the table within the administration? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Certainly don't want to take anything off the table, or  any tool away from the president.  He does address the American people in a  number of different venues and formats.  And I will certainly pass along  that suggestion to him. </p><p> Nadia. </p><p> QUESTION:  Just a follow-up on the Middle East.  In the recent (INAUDIBLE)  Mr. Kushner said that if President Abbas is not willing to negotiate, he's  going to proceed with the deal.  Can you explain how the White House is  hoping to achieve any progress in the Middle East peace talks if the  principal party is not taking part in it? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  We're going to continue meeting with the other partners  in the region.  And, again, we're going to continue pushing forward in the  peace process.  We had productive meetings over the last week.  We're going  to continue those conversations. </p><p> I will take one last question.  Saagar.  </p><p> QUESTION:  Thanks, Sarah.  </p><p> To follow up on the judges -- on the issue of immigration judges, why is  the President so opposed to an increase in the number of immigration judges  when it would expedite the asylum processing -- the asylum process and  expedite deportation?  </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  We're not opposed to the speeding up the process.  What  the President would like to see, once again, is that we stop the problem at  the very beginning.  He'd like to see us secure the border and people work  through the system, through the ports of entry, so that we're not dealing  with things on the back end.  </p><p> We'd like to stop the problem before it starts, and that's what the  president's focus has been all along, is on securing the border.  And  that's what we're going to continue to do.  </p><p> Thanks so much guys.  Have a great day.  </p><p> NEIL CAVUTO, HOST:  All right, you have been listening to Sarah Sanders  here.</p><p> And it's safe to say the Washington press corps is more concerned with the  immigration issue than a lot of folks losing their shirts today on this  whole trade issue.  </p><p> Welcome, everybody.  I'm Neil Cavuto.  And you're watching \"Your World.\"</p><p> And it could have worse.  As I show you the Dow today down about 328  points, we had been down almost 500 points, and a lot of that over a  building trade war and concerns this could get worse before it gets better,  or that there are no signs of concessions on the part of any of the  principal parties, namely the Chinese and ourselves.  </p><p> All of this on the same day that Harley-Davidson was indicating, because of  these threat of tariffs, they're moving a lot of their operations outside  the U.S.</p><p> On a separate issue, General Motors has indicated that a lot of its Chevy  Blazers will now be made in Mexico, not citing just the trade issue,  but  that it's not welcome noise here.</p><p> So, again, this could have a lot been worse.  There was some confusion  early on in the markets as to whether the administration was also  recommending that they were urging the Chinese and others not to invest in  technology stocks at all.  </p><p> Then Peter Navarro ends up popping up on CNBC to say, no, no, no, no, no,  they're not going to be, nor are there plans in the works for investment  restrictions on China.</p><p> And that brought us down to the levels we're at right now, about 328 points  southward on what was a crazy day on the markets.</p><p> We're going to be at this from all angles right now.</p><p> Let's first go to FOX Business Network's Deirdre Bolton with how it all  sorted out.</p><p> Hey, Deirdre.</p><p> DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, Neil.  </p><p> You said it.  It could have been much worse.  So, the markets did close  clearly lower, but certainly off the low points of the day.  And, of  course, the big headline, the Trump administration moving to block Chinese  companies from investing in U.S. tech firms and moving to block additional  tech exports from the U.S. to China.  </p><p> Our sources are saying the Treasury Department is going to make an official  announcement at the end of this week, bring us more clarity, more details  on the plan.  </p><p> Now, the level of difficulty is, of course, much higher when you start to  talk about blocking investment than when we're just engaging in tariff  spats.  So the stock market heading for the biggest one-day slide in  months.  </p><p> That's how we finished up.  You can see red across the screen.  One area I  really wanted to highlight are the techs, because S&amp;P 500 tech companies  get about 60 percent of their revenue from overseas.  So that's the highest  foreign exposure out of any of the index's 11 sectors.  </p><p> And, of course,critics of our current trade policy say that China has been  stealing anywhere between $30 billion and $50 billion worth of intellectual  property, hard data, every year for the past decade.  But then there was  even a stronger report, a more recent one that came out from the Commission  on the Theft of American Intellectual Property.</p><p> It has a much higher number, stating that up to $600 billion in theft that  has some projections baked in is possible.  But experts say, bottom line,  the motivation to want to level the playing field is completely  understandable.  </p><p> What gets complicated is that so many American businesses are  interconnected.  So, for example, here's seven big tech American companies  that source half of their products and components from China.  </p><p> So, HP, IBM, Dell, Cisco, Unisys, Microsoft, Intel.  Even Apple has sold  more iPhones in China in the last three years than in the U.S.  And Apple  gets about 20 percent of its annual revenue from China.  </p><p> Now, the Chinese president of course says China will punch back and will  not be forced to eat the bitter fruit.  That is a translation, a direct  quote.  </p><p> But as the tension rises between the world's two biggest economies, of  course, investors really showed their anxiety.  So, we had the Nasdaq, you  can see there, closely lower, essentially 2 percent, biggest one-day  percentage decline since March.  Third day down in a row.  So, that's the  longest losing streak for that tech-heavy comp in about two months' time.</p><p> Even Asia overnight, you can see how markets reacted there.  You can see  Hong Kong's Hang Seng down by more than 1 percent.  And, then, of course,  even on our own bond market, right, there was this flight to safety in U.S.  10-year.  Investors typically, of course, buy these bonds when they're  fearful or they feel less certain of the future.  </p><p> And prices really went up, so, therefore, those yields went down, settling  2.875 percent.  And just worth noting, these yields have fallen basically  for the past four out of five weeks.  </p><p> So, Neil, what is clear is, investors really don't know what to make of it.   We have the tariffs and now we have this idea of blocking direct  investment, which is a much more muscular and, quite frankly, threatening  move than tariffs, which really only apply to very specific products, Neil.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Absolutely, especially when they go back and forth either way.</p><p> BOLTON:  Yes.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Thank you very, very much, Deirdre Bolton.</p><p> BOLTON:  Sure.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Doesn't Harley-Davidson know that?  Not so much on the tariffs  we're considering, but the response that company is getting and opting to  do something that the president probably didn't envision.  </p><p>FOX Business Network's Jeff Flock in Countryside, Illinois.  </p><p> What did they do?  </p><p> JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  They're getting a double  whammy at Harley-Davidson, Neil, because the steel and aluminum tariffs hit  their raw materials costs.</p><p> And now the European Union, of course, imposing an addition 25 percent  tariff on motorcycles made here and shipped to Europe.</p><p> And so Harley is in a tough spot.  That tariff went from 6 percent to 31  percent.  And today, in a regulatory filing, Harley said that is going to  add more than $2,000 a bike to the cost of a motorcycle made here in the  U.S. and sold in Europe.  And they can't possibly pass that along to  consumers.</p><p> So, in the short-term, they're going to have to eat it.  In the long term,  they're going to move production away from the U.S.  Europe was an  expanding market for Harley-Davidson.  They love it over there.  And U.S.  sales have been down.</p><p> You look at the first quarter of this year, U.S. sales of Harleys down  double digits, as guys like me get older and maybe give up their  motorcycles.  In Europe, it had been growing by about 7 percent.  </p><p> And so those bikes, made in the U.S. and shipped to Europe, will be no  more.  Harley has four plants here in the U.S., York, Pennsylvania, Kansas  City, Missouri, and two in their home state of Wisconsin, and now  apparently bikes destined for Europe will not be made there anymore.</p><p> Instead, they will be made in places like Brazil and elsewhere, Thailand  and Australia.  This is not, as you pointed out at the outset, what the  president had intended.  His trade policies designed to keep and create  jobs here in the U.S.  In this case, it appears they will be eliminating  them -- Neil.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Amazing.</p><p> All right, Jeff Flock, thank you very, very much.  </p><p> All right, Mattie Duppler is.  We have got Charles Payne here, Larry Shover  here as well of SFG, alternate CME trader as well.  </p><p> Charles Payne, what is going on here?  We knew the trade thing was getting  antsy, but it seemed like the bottom fell out.  </p><p> CHARLES PAYNE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  It did, but because I think this had  a little bit of a different twist.</p><p> This was investment.  This is about -- the whole thing, by the way, is  centered on made in China 2025.  The administration, which I wish they  would articulate what they're trying to do, because I understand, and I  think most -- a lot of people do -- and it's the idea of curbing this  ambition, the stated ambition by China to sort of be the world's tech  leader in a short period of time.</p><p> And one way to get there, perhaps the only way they can get their with  their own timeline, is to continue to steal our intellectual property.</p><p> So the idea is to restrict investments from companies where China has a 25  percent or more ownership.  And, again, this was just speculation.  It was  in a few media outlets, the White House trying to take -- take it back a  little bit.  It's something obviously that they have toyed around with.</p><p> Peter Navarro has talked about this kind of thing for maybe two decades, so  this is not necessarily news, per se.  But it is -- it is a different  twist, to your point.  It's not -- it's not the trade stuff anymore, as  much as it is, hey, we want to take direct aim at your ambitions to usurp  America's perch as the world's tech leader.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, Larry, what worried a lot in the markets is that, all of a  sudden, then we were putting a general wall up on Chinese investment in  general and technology period.  </p><p> That's how it was interpreted.  And then, later on, the treasury secretary,  Mnuchin, came out to say, no, no, no, it wasn't singling out China, as if  to say there's other players here, as if that eased the angst.  </p><p> It actually compounded that.  But what do you make of that?  </p><p> LARRY SHOVER, SOLUTIONS FUNDS GROUP:  Well, what I make of it is that two  things.</p><p> The whole thing lacked clarity.  Like, it didn't matter.  Like, this whole  China tweets and tirades, it didn't matter because it lacked clarity.  It  seemed like the White House is utterly unprepared to create any kind of  proposal that can go into law.</p><p> Immigration policy is a good proof of that.  Also, it lacks credibility,  because we all know -- I mean, this does -- this hurts us more than it  hurts them, the fact that it's going to kill Apple or Nike.  It really,  really hurt them manufacturing their goods there that are sent to us.</p><p> So it doesn't make any sense.  People dismissed it.  And I really think  people are definitely blaming the China trade today.  The bigger problem,  though, it's really tech.  We saw that breaking down last week.</p><p> Leadership has been very thin in the stock market.  Without five or six  super cap techs in the S&amp;P 500...</p><p> CAVUTO:  Yes.  </p><p> SHOVER:  ... we would be down 4 percent, instead of up 1.5 percent.</p><p> But it started to crack.  The Supreme Court came out last week with a  ruling on sales tax, et cetera.  That chasm between growth and value has  been very, very wide.  The market is vulnerable.  The ball will always find  you when you're out of position.</p><p> And that's really what happened today.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  And people were a little anxious on that investment angle here and  maybe finding an excuse for technology, which ran up far and fast, to sell  off some of it.</p><p> But, Mattie, it's sort of this impression that not everyone in the  administration seems to be on the same page.  I'm getting different vibes  from the Treasury secretary, different vibes from their trade  representatives, different vibes from the president.</p><p> MATTIE DUPPLER, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S FORUM:  Right.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  And I think that's the kind of thing that scares markets.  </p><p> DUPPLER:  Oh, absolutely.</p><p> You finally have consensus on this panel, Neil.  And that's, what the heck  is the administration intending to do with these trade efforts?</p><p> Charles and I don't always agree on this issue, but right now we're both  wondering, what is the objective here?  And that's what the administration  needs to clarify.  It needs to make clear what it intends to do with all of  these efforts towards China.</p><p> Now, if the objective here is to exact the most amount of pain and pressure  on China possible, they need to make sure that they're not injecting pain  on American businesses.  And that's a concern, especially when you look at  really artificially diminishing the amount of capital that can come into  this country.</p><p> I worry about the impact on businesses.  And that's not even getting to  what tariffs are doing to American businesses, where we have already seen  some of those announcements this week.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Or even the threat of them.</p><p> But, Charles, the other thing you mentioned -- and this -- you can help me  out here.  It's always been that the Chinese are in bad shape here.   They're at two-year-plus lows in their market.  They have a lot more to  lose than we do.</p><p> But they also have their pride, and they're not giving any ground.  So, how  is this resolved, if it is?</p><p> PAYNE:  And this is where I disagree with Larry.  </p><p> I don't think -- I think a lot of people are raising the white flag so  quickly that China is going to beat us at this.  They're not.  If it has to  go the whole way... </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  The whole way could be years.  </p><p> PAYNE:  Yes, Sure.</p><p> Mattie makes the right point.  It's sort of like when my pops used to take  me out in the back.  He says, it's going to hurt me as much as it hurts  you.  </p><p> No, it won't.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> PAYNE:  With that being said, let's look at what China did today, this  morning.  </p><p> Their central bank freed up banks over there to the tune of $100 billion.   Right?  This is to sort of...</p><p> CAVUTO:  It needs a stimulant.</p><p> PAYNE:  ... to do things thing on debt.  </p><p> Last week, it was $30 billion.  A week before that, it was $30 billion.   Their foreign and reserve currencies have dropped a trillion dollars.  </p><p> Their debt-to-GDP ratio is on its way to 300 percent.  We aren't going to  lose this.  China knows we're not going to lose this.  Nobody wants to  lose.  It's a matter of how, to your point, do you save face and resolve  it?</p><p> CAVUTO:  I think that's where we are.  </p><p> Larry, the Chinese, remember, today indicating, you know, we don't just  turn a cheek on this.  And we come back and we're going to fight back.  </p><p> Now, to be clear, no response to the tariffs yet with tariffs of their own.   In other words, to increase the amount to match the United States, when we  promised we would put $200 billion on top of that.</p><p> Some read into that a sign that the Chinese are trying to find a middle  ground here, where they can talk tough, but they don't have to respond in  kind and invite a war.  What do you see?  </p><p> SHOVER:  Yes.</p><p> Well, I see that they have already done that, just what we said.  Required  reserve ratio dropped 50 basis points yesterday, adding all that liquidity  into the market.  What did that do?  That dropped RMB by 1.5 percent in  five days, 3.5 percent over the last month.  </p><p> So they're already ready.  That is going to negate any kind of trade tariff  that we are going to impose.  And I think they know, at the end of the day,  that there's so lack of clarity coming out of the White House, that they're  just preparing for it.  </p><p> Also realizing that they have had a real soft patch of data coming in.  So,  perhaps Trump is trying to hit them while they're weak.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  We will see.</p><p> All right, guys, I apologize jumping on you.  We have got a lot of breaking  news here.  </p><p> I do want to bring in my next guest, the former Heinz CEO Bill Johnson, a  global read of things, if ever there were one.  </p><p> And, Bill, I'm looking at this and wondering what the signals could be for  us.  If a company, one after the other, like GM considering making all its  Blazers now in Mexico, and, of course, we have been talking about a number  of other companies that have been doing the same or considering preemptive  move like Harley-Davidson, that has got to have a domestic economic impact.</p><p> BILL JOHNSON, FORMER CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, H.J. HEINZ COMPANY:  It should, Neil.  </p><p> Nothing has happened yet to impact the economy here.  And, frankly, the  Chinese and European economies...</p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, they're already leaving.  Those guys are already making some  moves.  </p><p> JOHNSON:  I understand.  But they're more vulnerable than we are.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  True.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Having said that, this is like tic-tac-toe.  Nobody wins.  </p><p> I play tic-tac-toe with any grandkids.  And you never win.  And that's what  this is now.  We have gotten to the point on this situation...</p><p> CAVUTO:  You never won at tic-tac-toe with your grandkids?  </p><p> JOHNSON:  No.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  You're one of the most celebrated CEOs ever.  And... </p><p> JOHNSON:  Yes.  That just shows you nobody wins, Neil.  And that's where we  are right now.  Nobody wins.</p><p> CAVUTO:  So, that's where you see -- that's where we are right now?</p><p> JOHNSON:  I do think that's where we are.</p><p> I think this created a huge environment of uncertainty.  You and I have had  this conversation many times.  Uncertainty leads to volatility.  Volatility  leads to more uncertainty.  And we get in this vicious cycle.  </p><p> And I think that's where we are now.  Having said that, I think,  ultimately, saner and cooler heads will prevail, and this will somehow get  resolved.  </p><p> I hope this is not a negotiation ploy, because it's rather ham-fisted.  And  there has got to be better ways to attack this issue than the one that is  being generated right now.</p><p> CAVUTO:  What do you make -- I think it was ratcheted up a little bit today  to go after in this case the Chinese for investing in technology.</p><p> It was read as, we're not going to allow them to invest in any technology  companies.  And that might have been a prematurely wrong impression.  But  that was the one that was out there for hours in the markets.  They had to  dial that back a little bit.</p><p> But they're still looking at putting a limit to who can invest in  technology.  That's how it interpreted, hence, technology falls off a lot.   So if this is more from just goods and services to, I don't know, even  companies and stocks you invest in, then what?  </p><p> JOHNSON:  Well, then I think we have chaos, Neil. </p><p> I don't think you can stop the investment in a capitalist society.  It's  just the way the system works.  And while I understand why the  administration is going after some of these issues -- and they're sort of  going where people have been afraid to tread before -- the reality is, we  have to have some clarity in the communication of the purpose of what we're  trying to achieve and then take a step-by-step process in which to achieve  it.  </p><p> And I heard about the investment situation this morning.  Then I saw  Secretary Mnuchin's response.  And so I'm completely unclear as to what is  happening.  And there we go again.  That creates more uncertainty, which  creates more volatility, and leaves us all in the dark about what it is  we're trying to achieve.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Now, there used to be an old rule here following this president  the last 18 months that those who doubted him would be proven wrong, and  that everything ends up OK and markets come back from what look like  debacles, and people who second-guessed him have been proven wrong.  </p><p> So there was this now new -- or renewed trust that President Trump must  know what he's doing, there's a method to all of this.  </p><p> Do you subscribe to that, or is there now a reassessment, well, maybe not.   Maybe this is a little impulsive.  Maybe there's not a method to the  madness.  Maybe it's just madness.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Well, I think, historically, over his last 18 months in office,  he's done a pretty good job of bringing us back from the brink and  achieving great success.  </p><p>North Korea seems to be an example of one of those areas.  But I don't  know.  I don't like this whole approach, Neil.  I think it's so ham-fisted  and so unpredictable that sometimes you create a fire out of a smoke bomb,  and the next thing you know, you have got a real conflagration going, and  you don't know how to put it out.  And that -- I'm worried we're headed  that way.</p><p> Having said that, I will give him credit for again treading in these places  that need to be addressed.  I just think there's better ways to do it.  But  I'm not yet ready to say that we're just going to pull this one back from  the brink and everyone is going to be happy.  </p><p> I just don't know.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  We shall see, my friend.  Thank you very, very much.  </p><p> Good luck in your next tic-tac-toe game.  I give the edge to you still.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> JOHNSON:  Thank you.  Thank you.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  William Johnson, the former Heinz CEO, if anyone knows the global  landscape, it is he.  All right. </p><p> All right, when we come back here, this nastiness with Democrats saying  that we're going to get nasty no matter where Republicans gather.  </p><p> Really?  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Yikes, 25 minutes, right, a 5:00 p.m. deadline staring down now,  as House Republicans want documents from the Justice Department on that  Clinton e-mail probe and the Russian investigation.  Then what happens if  they don't get them?  </p><p> After this.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. MAXINE WATERS (D), CALIFORNIA:  And if you see anybody from that  Cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you  get out and you create a crowd.  </p><p> (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)</p><p> WATERS:  And you push back on them.  And you tell them they're not welcome.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, anyway, American Majority CEO Ned Ryun.  We have got Olympic  Media managing editor Katie Frates and Democratic strategist Christy  Setzer.</p><p> I don't know where to begin.  But, Katie, maybe you can help me with this.  </p><p> This is out of control.  This is just crazy talk.  What do you make of it?  </p><p> KATIE FRATES, OLYMPIC MEDIA:  It absolutely is.  </p><p> This is just going way too far, because she doesn't even know who she is  speaking to, Maxine Waters, when she is saying this.  What if someone sees  somebody at a gas station and takes it way too far?  </p><p> You're essentially encouraging anyone of any mental state, of any level of  discourse, to go up and potentially harm someone else because of their  political beliefs.  That's absolutely not OK.  </p><p> I'm so excited and happy to see at least Nancy Pelosi push back on this.   I'm not sure why more Democratic leaders are not speaking up and condemning  this.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, there were a good number.  To be fair, there were a good  number, Elijah Cummings and all saying...</p><p> FRATES:  Good.  Good.</p><p> CAVUTO:  ... that, even when it came to the Sanders situation, she  shouldn't have been taken out of the restaurant.  </p><p> But, Ned, I'm worried more about the increasing vitriol.  And we're seeing  more and more of it.  And anything could happen in that environment.</p><p> NED RYUN, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN MAJORITY:  No.</p><p> And I think really what we're seeing is, to sum up Charles Krauthammer, we  conservatives, we think the left is philosophically misguided, and many on  the left think we're evil.  </p><p> And I think you're seeing this rhetoric ramp up where borders are now  bigotry and American presidents standing up for the America taxpayer, well,  this is Nazism and the second coming of the Holocaust.  </p><p> And I think what the left is trying to do is say, the debate is over in our  minds because we consider your ideas to be irrational.  We don't consider  your ideas to be legitimate.  </p><p> And if they can dehumanize the other side, that's what they want to do,  because that justifies driving opposing thought from the public square.  </p><p> The thing that troubles me, Neil, about all of this, this kind of  incitement to physical intimidation and bullying is not to be normalized.   It's not normal for a constitutional republic.  It's only normal in banana  republics.  And if the left wants to beat us, try doing it at the ballot  box in 2018 and 2020.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Do you worry about that, Christy?  </p><p> As a Democratic strategist, and a darn good one, and a very calm person, I  might point out, that your party could be ruining it for itself, that it's  actually scaring some people with that kind of talk, whether you agree or  disagree with the politics behind it.  </p><p> CHRISTY SETZER, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  I just think it's impossible to put  Maxine Waters' comments like this in a vacuum like this.</p><p> The defining feature of Donald Trump's campaign was not that he was going  to shake stuff up in Washington or that he was a great businessman.  It was  this incivility.  Right?  </p><p> He started talking about how, I like people that were not captured about  John McCain.  Then you looked as his rallies, where they were filled with  him actively asking them to take violence against protesters.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  If that is what your view is, do you think that the response,  responding in kind, then, if that's your view, is justified?</p><p> SETZER:  I don't think that -- no, I don't think that we have responded in  kind.  </p><p> I think that Democrats are saying, look, we need to make it just a little  bit uncomfortable.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  You have got whole groups that target a homeland security  secretary at a restaurant.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> SETZER:  No, no, no, no.  Not with violence, Neil.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> SETZER:  That's an extraordinarily important difference.  Not with  violence.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Please listen to me.  </p><p> Sarah Sanders, her incident, Secretary Nielsen outside her home and in a  restaurant, then Maxine Waters justifying it.  I could go on to talk about  Florida's Pam Bondi and what she dealt with at a movie.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> CAVUTO:  Stephen Miller and be called a fascist while he's out.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> SETZER:  Protest is a healthy part of the American tradition, not violence,  not violence.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  You're fine with this.  You're fine with it.  </p><p> But if it were done in reverse, you wouldn't be fine with it.</p><p> SETZER:  I would be absolutely fine with it.  I would be fine with it,  because, again, protest is absolutely fine.</p><p> What is not fine...</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  You just said when you didn't like it what Donald Trump and his  people were doing the same.  </p><p> SETZER:  I'm sorry?</p><p> CAVUTO:  You didn't like it when Donald Trump was doing that.</p><p> SETZER:  No.  What Donald Trump was saying was, I want that guy to be taken  out on a stretcher.  What Donald Trump was doing was actually what Ned Ryun  was just talking about right now, which is dehumanizing the other side.</p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, I don't get it.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  All right.  OK.</p><p> Mattie, do you believe that this is going too far?  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> SETZER:  By talking about how they're animals and infesting America.</p><p> CAVUTO:  I understand.  I heard you.</p><p> SETZER:  That's very different.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Mattie, has this gone too far?  Mattie, you're in awe, aren't you?  </p><p> FRATES:  Yes, yes.  Absolutely, it is.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Katie, I apologize.  I apologize.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  See that?  I lose my place, because I get so wrapped up in it.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Is it your sense that this gets worse, though?  Are you getting a  sense it gets worse?</p><p> FRATES:  So, this is the problem.  </p><p> It's that this is escalating rhetoric.  You're essentially saying mob  someone outside of a gas station.  </p><p> RYUN:  Exactly.  </p><p> FRATES:  And, again, you don't know the intentions of the person who may  then go on to do that.  </p><p> So what if someone is attacked?  What if something violent happens?  And  then you turn around and you say, well, Maxine Waters was telling people to  do that.  It's not a good idea and it's not a healthy dialogue.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> SETZER:  Do we remember the Pizzagate conspiracy, how a crazy conspiracy  actually led someone to take a gun to my, my local pizza place, actually,  and try to shoot it up because they had heard this crazy idea on the  Internet and by Alex Jones and others that Hillary Clinton and John Podesta  were up to no good?  </p><p> That led to actual violence.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, I don't want to get in a tit for tat.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  I sometimes feel like I'm separating my teenage sons.  </p><p> But, Ned Ryun, I do know this.  We have all got to bring the octane down a  little bit on all sides here.  </p><p> RYUN:  We do.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  But how do we do that?  </p><p> And should it be incumbent people to just to say, there has got to be a  better way?  Whether the Elijah Cummings approach, this has got to stop,  whether Sarah Sanders' approach, I just politely up and left, and I tried  not to make a big deal of it at the scene, what is it?  What is the answer?</p><p> RYUN:  No.  I think we have got to start policing our own.  We have to  start policing ourselves on the right and the left.  </p><p> And I was encouraged by Nancy Pelosi saying that Maxine Waters' statement  was unacceptable.  I think we have to be honest about it on the right, too,  when we see unacceptable statements.  And I have said this again -- I have  said this before.  I will say it again.  </p><p> When Donald Trump -- I love 85 to 90 percent of his Twitter feed.  When he  is talking about bloody face-lift, you will never me defend that.  I want  him to focus on the positives and policy and all these things.</p><p> When it becomes personal, I think we need to call out our side and say,  this is not how we have more civil discourse in the public arena.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Fully agree.  Fully agree.  </p><p> At our core, guys, we're all human beings.  </p><p> RYUN:  We're all Americans.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  And we can agree to disagree.  But we don't have to be asses in  the process.  </p><p> And none of you are, by the way.  </p><p> But I want to thank you all very, very much.</p><p> And, Katie, I apologize.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> FRATES:  No, no apology needed.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  I get so apoplectic.  And I don't even know why.  And it's not  even dinnertime.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, by the way, we're close to the witching hour, 5:00 p.m.  Eastern time, that document deadline.  But right now there's indications  the people who have put out that deadline aren't going to get the response  they want in time for that deadline.  </p><p> Then what?  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right.  Between a deadline coming up in about 15 minutes from  now and, of course, this is the week we're going to see some big testimony  up on Capitol Hill, much of it is behind closed doors.</p><p> Let's get the read from former Justice Department official Tom Dupree.  </p><p> Tom, what is the biggest thing you're waiting for?  </p><p> TOM DUPREE, FORMER JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:  Well, the biggest thing  I'm waiting for in the short-term is whether the Justice Department  complies with the congressional demands.  </p><p> As you point out, the clock is ticking.  They have a document deadline,  production deadline at 5:00 p.m. this afternoon.  We will see if they turn  over what they're expected to turn over.  My guess is that they are not  going to satisfy the demands of the House Republicans.</p><p> And I think we are going to see this dispute continue to escalate in the  days ahead.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, then they would want to take even aggressive action  against Rod Rosenstein.  Right?  What would it be?  </p><p> DUPREE:  Well, let's see.</p><p> They have got a wide variety of means at their disposal.  At one end of the  spectrum is just the continued drumbeat of public criticism.  They can amp  that up several ways.</p><p> One thing they could do is, they could issue subpoenas.  Another thing they  could do is, they could actually instigate contempt proceedings.  And then  at the extreme end of the other spectrum, it would be impeachment  proceedings.</p><p> I'm hopeful that they're not going to go there and that cooler heads will  prevail and they be able to sit down and work all of this out before we get  to that point.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Where is all of this going?  </p><p> I mean, especially with the Peter Strzok testimony later on, are they more  interested in his case, finding out what he knew and what was the backdrop  for his comments he was making about then candidate Trump, or what?  </p><p> DUPREE:  Yes.  I think that's a lot of what was going on.</p><p> I mean, I think right now, from the perspective of Congress, there was so  much that was going on behind the scenes in 2016 that Congress wants to  know, what was your reason for doing this?  What was your reason for  handling the investigations the way you did? What was the reason for  getting these wiretaps and for conducting the surveillance?</p><p> Were you using an informant?  Was it a spy, that sort of thing?  And the  fact is, DOJ is not in the business normally of turning over documents.   And so I think, institutionally, there's a huge amount of reluctance to  give Congress what it wants.</p><p> But Congress is beating the drum.  They're on the warpath.  They're trying  to fulfill their oversight function here.  And so I think we have a real  collision that's not in any -- is not going to be sorted out in the near  term.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  When I have looked at a lot of the comments from those identified,  like Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, and these other unidentified individuals,  and then, of course, now I know how James Comey felt about then candidate  Trump and how Andy McCabe felt, his number two.</p><p> I have not run across one piece of evidence to show a pro-Trump person or  someone who was biased to like -- to like Donald Trump.  Now, I might have  missed it.  But, again, doesn't this feed the narrative that that was a  stacked deck, because that certainly that stacked deck mantle has been  claimed by a lot of Republicans that they were out to get him?</p><p> DUPREE:  Yes, I certainly haven't seen anything along the lines of what  you're talking about, Neil.</p><p> It all does seem to be one way.  I guess what's surprising and frankly  disappointing to me is that some of these folks, Strzok in particular, and  Page, that even though they were nominally professionals, that they just  weren't able to put aside their political biases.</p><p> Look, the fact is, is that pretty much everyone in the country harbors  inner thoughts, their own political leanings.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Right. </p><p> DUPREE:  But I think, for most people, and certainly for the vast majority  of people in the FBI historically, they been able to put these biases aside  when it comes to the sacred function of law enforcement.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  But did you share whatever opinion -- we all have opinions.  You  would be vanilla if you didn't.</p><p> But did you -- these were aggressively shared and aggressive opinions at  that.  When you were there, was that -- did you kind of know what your  colleagues felt, whether they were investigating someone or not?  </p><p> DUPREE:  No, not in this way.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Yes.  </p><p> DUPREE:  I think what is unusual about this, Neil, is that these were  political comments they were discussing in the context of an ongoing  political investigation.</p><p> It's not as though they were investigating some bank robber and trading  texts about the presidential election.  I mean, not saying that would be  OK, but that would be very different.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Right. </p><p> DUPREE:  What they were doing here is, they were carrying out  investigations involving the very candidates who were running at the same  time they're engaged in this correspondence about how they can advance  their own political views through their official duties.</p><p> That is where it crossed a line.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Yes.  </p><p> You would just love to get the context for these remarks.  What was going  on?  If it's just hatred, I don't know if that is even better or worse.  </p><p> Tom, good seeing you again, my friend.  Thank you.  </p><p> DUPREE:  Likewise.  Thank you, Neil.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p> How about just eliminating ICE?  </p><p> With all this controversy about separating kids from their parents at the  border, and then now trying to reconnect them with their parents, sometimes  far from the border, maybe just get rid of ICE.  Some people are actually  urging that -- after this.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, groups in protests all around wanting to get rid of  ICE.  </p><p> That's right.  After the separation of these kids from their parents, a lot  of folks saying, you know, the problem isn't these coming into our country.   It's the folks who are trying to keep them out and the way they go about  their business.  So, they're actually saying, get rid of ICE.  Put ICE on  ice, if you will.</p><p> Former ICE agent Claude Arnold on that.</p><p> What do you think of that?  </p><p> CLAUDE ARNOLD, FORMER ICE SPECIAL AGENT:  Well, I -- first of all, people  don't understand the breadth of ICE's mission.  </p><p> Immigration enforcement is half of the mission.  It has an entire  component, homeland security investigations, that investigates all crime  related to the border.  </p><p> It's the investigative arm for all of DHS.  It's the second largest  investigative entity in the U.S. government and it investigates a lot of  things, drug smuggling, human trafficking and smuggling, child pornography,  export of illegal technologies.</p><p> It has a huge national security responsibility.  It's the second largest  representation on the Federal Joint Terrorism Task Force after the FBI.  </p><p> So to say you just need to get rid of ICE, I think people don't understand  all that ICE does.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, a lot of them were saying, right after these apprehensions,  well, does it change and does their mission statement change given on the  administration?  It was this administration that, led by Jeff Sessions,  said, we're going to enforce a policy where we can, yes, separate kids from  their parents, something that wasn't done, at least not the same way  exactly, in the Obama administration.  </p><p> So do you have to pivot depending on the administration?  </p><p> ARNOLD:  Well, I think there was a pivot done on how enforcement was  conducted during the Obama administration.  </p><p> And, really, it's just been a return to the status quo.  But people have  been -- they have developed a sense of entitlement that you can just come  to the country illegally and expecting it's OK. </p><p> CAVUTO:  Oh, no, you're quite right.  People forget how we were  apprehending underage kids and then who were -- drugs deals and all.   You're quite right about that.</p><p> ARNOLD:  Right.  Right.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  But who calls that?  Do you answer then to whatever the  presidential directive is or what?</p><p> ARNOLD:  Yes, of course.  You're part of the executive branch.  </p><p> ICE does what the president tells them to do through the executive chain of  command.  I mean, it's the executive branch.</p><p> CAVUTO:  So, if there were no ICE, to these people's interests, the  protesters, who would handle this border stuff?  </p><p> ARNOLD:  Well, here's the important thing here, Neil.  </p><p> What is going on is, the same people who want ICE abolished, they opposed  there being any wall on the border.  They oppose changing the loopholes  that encourage and allow people to stay in the U.S. illegally.  </p><p> So, the last stand against those who make it in here illegally is ICE.  So  if you get rid of ICE, then you completely have open borders and no  immigration enforcement.  And that's by design.  They want that to happen.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Amazing.  </p><p> All right, Claude Arnold, thank you very much, former ICE agent.  He's put  himself in a lot of harm's way over the years just to deal with that.  </p><p> People should remember that, no matter what your feelings on this  particular issue.  </p><p> We will have more after this.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Thirty seconds away from that deadline.  What is Rod Rosenstein  going to do?  Is he going to give the Republicans what they want?</p><p> Tomorrow, we will get the read on all of this from Republican House  Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte.  He also was one of the fellows  who came up with a plan to settle this immigration mess.  His measure went  nowhere, but that doesn't mean that immigration progress couldn't still  come up somewhere.  </p><p> A one-on-one with probably one of the more powerful players on Capitol Hill  tomorrow, Bob Goodlatte.</p><p> We will see you then.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> QUESTION:  And one more, on trade, and following up on what Blake asked  about Harley-Davidson.  They announced in an SEC filing they're moving a  significant amount of their operations to Europe because of the E.U.  tariffs that were placed on Harley-Davidson motorcycles.  Is this what the  President envisioned for what the impact would be by placing tariffs on the  E.U. and the retaliation the E.U. has put on the U. S.?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Again, the European  Union is trying to punish U.S. workers because they have engaged repeatedly  in unfair trade practices.  And the president is saying enough is enough.   We'd like to work with the E.U. to work on a level playing field. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Sorry, Steve, I did come to you.  Go ahead.  </p><p> QUESTION:  The president today in the Oval Office, sitting next to the king  of Jordan, mentioned some progress in the Middle East peace process, but he  didn't give us any specifics. </p><p> There's been quite a bit of back-channel diplomacy going on the last few  days in the Middle East, with Jared Kushner and Jason Greenblatt.  Do you  have anything concrete to -- to tell us about any sort of positive movement  whatsoever, from all of this? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Again, we -- I think that the meetings that took place  over the last week with Senior Adviser Jared Kushner and Special  Representative Jason Greenblatt, they met with a number of officials and  principals in Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, Israel and Qatar last week. </p><p> They discussed the situation in Gaza as well as the next stages of the  peace effort.  We're going to continue those conversations and we're  committed to the peace effort, and we're going to keep working forward.   But those conversations were productive. </p><p> Julie? </p><p> QUESTION:  Sarah, the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection said  today that they are no longer going to be referring people who cross the  border without authorization for criminal charges if they're traveling with  children, which is essentially a return to the Obama administration  practice and administrations before that.  Does the president support that  approach?  And if so, does he regret trying to push forward on a zero- tolerance approach in the first place? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  No.  The president certainly supports keeping families  together, which he has outlined several times over the last week.  But he's  also called on Congress to actually fix the system. </p><p> They're the only ones that ultimately have the ability to change the law.   The president's executive order has given a temporary solution to the  problem but it's not permanent, and we need Congress to step up.  We need  Democrats to stop playing political games, do their jobs, work with this  president and let's fix the problem at the border. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Jeff? </p><p> QUESTION:  Sarah, can you talk about why you tweeted from your official  account about the episode that you had at the restaurant on Friday night? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Sure.  I was responding to a number of news stories.  I  would been reached out to by over a dozen reporters, and there were  multiple news stories that had already been issued. </p><p> It was considered news of the day, so I responded in the way I would to any  other news of the day story. </p><p> Jeff? </p><p> QUESTION:  Sarah, you said just because you don't see a judge doesn't mean  you don't get due process.  Can you explain what you mean by that  specifically, and how the president envisions that this would work while  still maintaining what the Constitution upholds in having a swift  immigration system? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Again, there are other ways for removal.  There are  thousands of illegal aliens that are removed every month that don't see  judges.  Sometimes that's through voluntary removal, and sometimes that's  through expedited removal. </p><p> Again, the president's ultimate goal would be that we have actually a  secure border, and people aren't coming into the country illegally.  But  that we have a system that works and the people that come into the country  come in through a legal system. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Jill? </p><p> QUESTION:  What is the president doing specifically this week to ensure  that Congress passes a bill?  He's spent all week in Nevada talking about - - or, all weekend.  Excuse me -- on Saturday, talking about how Democrats  want open borders and crime.  But, specifically, has he made phone calls to  Republican members in the House, where the bill is pending?  Has he tried  to bring Democrats together?  What is he doing specifically to try and get  a new law passed, specifically, other than just railing against the current  law? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  The president met with a number of lawmakers last week,  talked with several over the weekend, some that he was with while he was  traveling.  Last week, he made an open invitation to Democrat lawmakers --  that they were welcome to come to the White House to discuss what they'd  like to see, because the president wants solutions. </p><p> We've yet to have any of them to show up, actually willing to have those  conversations, actually willing to fix the problem.  Instead, they'd rather  rant and rave about not allowing members of the Trump administration to  step foot in public. </p><p> The president wants to see solutions.  That's what we're focused on.  It's  Congress's job to do that, and we've laid out very clearly that we want to  be part of that and what we'd like to see in that package. </p><p> Jill? </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> QUESTION:  ... on this? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Clearly, they aren't.  If they haven't passed a law to  fix this system, then they haven't.  Republicans have laid out a number of  proposals that they support.  The president has voiced his support for  those. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> QUESTION:  ... probably fail this week, though.  The Republican bills will  probably...</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  That's because no Democrat will get on board and  actually support a solution. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> QUESTION:  ... Republican -- is your Republicans cannot pass these  Republican bills.  What is the president doing as the leader of the party  to try and get Republican...</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Jeff, these aren't Republican bills.  These are bills  that fix a broken system.  They may have Republican sponsors, but these  should be bipartisan.  This shouldn't be complicated.  Look, the House has  already passed over 500 pieces of legislation, but they can't get through  the Senate because Democrats refuse to actually find solutions. </p><p> We have 50 bills that passed just last week to address the opioid crisis --  that passed through the House.  The Senate still hasn't taken them up.   Hopefully, they will.  And, if they do, that will show that we actually can  come up with bipartisan solutions.  And that's what we'd like to see them  do on immigration, as well. </p><p> Jill? </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> QUESTION:  ... follow-up on Julia's question about the zero-tolerance  policy.  The president said, last week, after signing the executive order,  that he believed that zero tolerance was still important.  You guys made a  point of the fact that the E. O.  did not actually get rid of the policy. </p><p> How does that square with the fact that CBP is now saying that they are no  longer referring for prosecution any adults who come in with children? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Again, this is a temporary solution.  This isn't going  to last.  Congress still has to step up.  They still have to do their job.   This will only last a short amount of time because we're going to run out  of space, we're going to run out of resources in order to keep people  together, and we're asking Congress to provide those resources and do their  job.  And...</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> QUESTION:  ... temporary solution -- does that mean, at some point, you are  going to change that policy back? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  We're not changing the policy.  We're simply out of  resources, and, at some point, Congress has to do what they were elected to  do, and that is secure our border.  That is stop the crime coming into our  country. </p><p> The country has made extremely clear that they don't want open borders, and  Democrats need to understand that, and they need to work with Republicans  and find some solutions. </p><p> QUESTION:  And there...</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Annie.  Sorry, Jill, I'm going to keep going.  Annie, go  ahead. </p><p> QUESTION:  Sarah, you mentioned the state of resources and running out of  them.  Can you be specific about what the resources are right now for  housing parents and children together?  Is there enough housing right now?   Is the Pentagon stepping in?  Like, what's being done about the resources?  </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Again, we're looking at every option available.  We have  asked the Pentagon to help with additional space.  But a lot of that will  depend on our ability to stop people coming into the country illegally.   And we, again, encourage people to go through ports of entry instead of  crossing the border illegally. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  We've requested, through legislation -- we're working  with Congress, hopefully, to provide more resources and the ability to  actually enforce the law. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Ayesha? </p><p> QUESTION:  Thank you.  I just want to see if you can kind of narrow down  exactly what the president actually intends to do when it comes to this  idea of not having judges.  You say that there are instances where people  don't have judges, but my understanding is that, if you do ask for asylum,  you do have certain rights. </p><p> So is there going to be a change in that policy, or what is this  administration planning to do to make it so you don't have to see a judge?   (INAUDIBLE)  </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Again, I have addressed this a couple times.  There are  multiple instances in where you wouldn't:  voluntary removal, certain cases  have expedited removal.  If somebody comes through a port of entry seeking  asylum, those cases and that process will be heard.  But at the same time,  the president's ultimate goal is to secure the border and stop illegal  immigration. </p><p> QUESTION:  I -- I -- I understand that, but so what does that mean  practically?  Like, is the president planning to do anything differently,  or are you just saying, you don't like the way (INAUDIBLE) now? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  The president's laid out what he'd like to see.  We've  put out the things that we want to see in an immigration package months  ago.  We're still waiting on Congress to give us the ability to do that. </p><p> QUESTION:  So -- so unless Congress acts, nothing is actually going to  change?  The administration is not changing anything right now, when it  comes to judges? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  You mean, are we walking around making up laws?  No,  because we're not the Obama administration.  We're actually trying to  enforce the laws that are on the books.  We're actually asking Congress to  do their part in the process, and pass new legislation that will fix our  immigration system. </p><p> QUESTION:  So -- but nothing is actually changing on the ground.  Like,  this -- so this is -- the president's complaining about judges, and saying  that we shouldn't have all these judges, and people who come over should  just be put out, but nothing is actually going to change.  He's just saying  -- he's just complaining about the process as it stands now. </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Things that we have the ability to do administratively,  we are working to do.  But again, Congress is the only one that has the  ability to write law, and we hope they'll do that. </p><p> Steve? </p><p> QUESTION:  I'm honing in on that point.  I'm trying to understand what it  is the president understands about the current policy, because as you've  explained, expedited removal allows the government to remove hundreds of  thousands of illegal immigrants a year without seeing judges.  Did the  president know that when he issued the tweets? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Yeah, but there are still thousands that go through a  very lengthy process.  We'd like to see the process consolidated.  We'd  like to see the backlog stopped.  We'd like to see our border secured. </p><p> Sorry, Steve, I'm going to keep going. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> QUESTION:  Under current law there are a couple of things that the  president could do.  You could expand that policy.  You've said that he  would like to see more expedited removal.  Does the president intend to  expand it to the full two-year limit under the current statute? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Again, we would like to see more expedited removal, but  ultimately, we would like to see the border secured and people stop coming  into the country illegally.  That seems pretty simple to me, and it would  stop a lot of the problems, and would eliminate the need for so many of  these additional laws. </p><p> QUESTION:  Thanks, Sarah.  The gal in the briefing talking about the  importance of civility.  Do you consider it a civil policy to separate more  than two thirds of the children from their parents? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  We consider enforcing the law the role that the  administration has to play.  Certainly, the president has taken an  executive action to the furthest that he has the ability to do to minimize  the separation of families.  We're working hard to make sure families get  to stay together, and we're calling on Congress to help us in that effort,  and we're continuing to focus on the reunification, and making sure that  the families, again, stay together, and that Congress will give us a  permanent solution to fix that. </p><p> QUESTION:  But you say that you're working to make families stay together.   It was your administration that separated them in the first place. </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  It wasn't our administration that created these laws,  but it is our administration's job to enforce it, and we've done that.  If  someone breaks the law, it's our job to enforce it.  If somebody doesn't  like the law, then they need to lobby Congress and ask them to change it.  </p><p> Anita. </p><p> QUESTION:  I have, one, an immigration question, and wanted to clarify one  thing.  So I understand that not every adult with a child is going to be  prosecuted.  If there are families that are being held together, detained  together somewhere and 20 days goes by, what is going to happen then?  I  didn't get an -- an answer with that last week.  I don't understand.  The  law says you can't keep them together, keep the children, even with parents  for longer than 20 days.  So then what happens? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Hopefully, Congress will pass the law and fix the  problem. </p><p> QUESTION:  (INAUDIBLE) 20 days? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Well, why should it be so hard?  They all say that they  don't want to separate families.  Seems like it should be pretty simple to  me. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  John? </p><p> QUESTION:  I said I had a clarification...</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Go ahead. </p><p> QUESTION:  ... so Jeff asked you a question about Congress and the bill.   Were you, in your response, referring to just a stand-alone bill that deals  with family separation, or were you referring to the bigger immigration  bill that the House hopes to take up this week? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Our preference would be a bill that addresses all of the  pillars that we've laid out, that we'd like to see addressed in an  immigration package.  And that's what our focus is right now, is there's a  bill that does that on the table. </p><p> If that doesn't happen, then we'll talk about other pieces of legislation  at that point. </p><p> QUESTION:  (INAUDIBLE) the president still wants that bill to go forward  even though he said...</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Certain...</p><p> QUESTION:  ... they don't want to -- he -- they shouldn't waste their time  on it? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Look, Democrats in the Senate have made clear they're  not going to support this.  </p><p> And because we need at least some Democrats to get on board, they've made  it very clear that they don't want to work with the president, that they  don't want to fix our immigration system.  That they'd rather have open  borders and rampant crime than work with the president to create solutions.   Until they change their mind, we're going to continue looking at the best  ways that we can fix these problems but we need Congress to help us. </p><p> John. </p><p> QUESTION:  Thank you, Sarah.  This president is the first in the television  age who has yet to address the American public on nationwide television  from the Oval Office.  Many Republican consultants have said that he might  have a stronger hand in influencing Congress if he made a nationally  televised address on immigration and what changes he'd like to see, to  explain it. </p><p> Is that something that's on the table within the administration? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Certainly don't want to take anything off the table, or  any tool away from the president.  He does address the American people in a  number of different venues and formats.  And I will certainly pass along  that suggestion to him. </p><p> Nadia. </p><p> QUESTION:  Just a follow-up on the Middle East.  In the recent (INAUDIBLE)  Mr. Kushner said that if President Abbas is not willing to negotiate, he's  going to proceed with the deal.  Can you explain how the White House is  hoping to achieve any progress in the Middle East peace talks if the  principal party is not taking part in it? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  We're going to continue meeting with the other partners  in the region.  And, again, we're going to continue pushing forward in the  peace process.  We had productive meetings over the last week.  We're going  to continue those conversations. </p><p> I will take one last question.  Saagar.  </p><p> QUESTION:  Thanks, Sarah.  </p><p> To follow up on the judges -- on the issue of immigration judges, why is  the President so opposed to an increase in the number of immigration judges  when it would expedite the asylum processing -- the asylum process and  expedite deportation?  </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  We're not opposed to the speeding up the process.  What  the President would like to see, once again, is that we stop the problem at  the very beginning.  He'd like to see us secure the border and people work  through the system, through the ports of entry, so that we're not dealing  with things on the back end.  </p><p> We'd like to stop the problem before it starts, and that's what the  president's focus has been all along, is on securing the border.  And  that's what we're going to continue to do.  </p><p> Thanks so much guys.  Have a great day.  </p><p> NEIL CAVUTO, HOST:  All right, you have been listening to Sarah Sanders  here.</p><p> And it's safe to say the Washington press corps is more concerned with the  immigration issue than a lot of folks losing their shirts today on this  whole trade issue.  </p><p> Welcome, everybody.  I'm Neil Cavuto.  And you're watching \"Your World.\"</p><p> And it could have worse.  As I show you the Dow today down about 328  points, we had been down almost 500 points, and a lot of that over a  building trade war and concerns this could get worse before it gets better,  or that there are no signs of concessions on the part of any of the  principal parties, namely the Chinese and ourselves.  </p><p> All of this on the same day that Harley-Davidson was indicating, because of  these threat of tariffs, they're moving a lot of their operations outside  the U.S.</p><p> On a separate issue, General Motors has indicated that a lot of its Chevy  Blazers will now be made in Mexico, not citing just the trade issue,  but  that it's not welcome noise here.</p><p> So, again, this could have a lot been worse.  There was some confusion  early on in the markets as to whether the administration was also  recommending that they were urging the Chinese and others not to invest in  technology stocks at all.  </p><p> Then Peter Navarro ends up popping up on CNBC to say, no, no, no, no, no,  they're not going to be, nor are there plans in the works for investment  restrictions on China.</p><p> And that brought us down to the levels we're at right now, about 328 points  southward on what was a crazy day on the markets.</p><p> We're going to be at this from all angles right now.</p><p> Let's first go to FOX Business Network's Deirdre Bolton with how it all  sorted out.</p><p> Hey, Deirdre.</p><p> DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, Neil.  </p><p> You said it.  It could have been much worse.  So, the markets did close  clearly lower, but certainly off the low points of the day.  And, of  course, the big headline, the Trump administration moving to block Chinese  companies from investing in U.S. tech firms and moving to block additional  tech exports from the U.S. to China.  </p><p> Our sources are saying the Treasury Department is going to make an official  announcement at the end of this week, bring us more clarity, more details  on the plan.  </p><p> Now, the level of difficulty is, of course, much higher when you start to  talk about blocking investment than when we're just engaging in tariff  spats.  So the stock market heading for the biggest one-day slide in  months.  </p><p> That's how we finished up.  You can see red across the screen.  One area I  really wanted to highlight are the techs, because S&amp;P 500 tech companies  get about 60 percent of their revenue from overseas.  So that's the highest  foreign exposure out of any of the index's 11 sectors.  </p><p> And, of course,critics of our current trade policy say that China has been  stealing anywhere between $30 billion and $50 billion worth of intellectual  property, hard data, every year for the past decade.  But then there was  even a stronger report, a more recent one that came out from the Commission  on the Theft of American Intellectual Property.</p><p> It has a much higher number, stating that up to $600 billion in theft that  has some projections baked in is possible.  But experts say, bottom line,  the motivation to want to level the playing field is completely  understandable.  </p><p> What gets complicated is that so many American businesses are  interconnected.  So, for example, here's seven big tech American companies  that source half of their products and components from China.  </p><p> So, HP, IBM, Dell, Cisco, Unisys, Microsoft, Intel.  Even Apple has sold  more iPhones in China in the last three years than in the U.S.  And Apple  gets about 20 percent of its annual revenue from China.  </p><p> Now, the Chinese president of course says China will punch back and will  not be forced to eat the bitter fruit.  That is a translation, a direct  quote.  </p><p> But as the tension rises between the world's two biggest economies, of  course, investors really showed their anxiety.  So, we had the Nasdaq, you  can see there, closely lower, essentially 2 percent, biggest one-day  percentage decline since March.  Third day down in a row.  So, that's the  longest losing streak for that tech-heavy comp in about two months' time.</p><p> Even Asia overnight, you can see how markets reacted there.  You can see  Hong Kong's Hang Seng down by more than 1 percent.  And, then, of course,  even on our own bond market, right, there was this flight to safety in U.S.  10-year.  Investors typically, of course, buy these bonds when they're  fearful or they feel less certain of the future.  </p><p> And prices really went up, so, therefore, those yields went down, settling  2.875 percent.  And just worth noting, these yields have fallen basically  for the past four out of five weeks.  </p><p> So, Neil, what is clear is, investors really don't know what to make of it.   We have the tariffs and now we have this idea of blocking direct  investment, which is a much more muscular and, quite frankly, threatening  move than tariffs, which really only apply to very specific products, Neil.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Absolutely, especially when they go back and forth either way.</p><p> BOLTON:  Yes.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Thank you very, very much, Deirdre Bolton.</p><p> BOLTON:  Sure.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Doesn't Harley-Davidson know that?  Not so much on the tariffs  we're considering, but the response that company is getting and opting to  do something that the president probably didn't envision.  </p><p>FOX Business Network's Jeff Flock in Countryside, Illinois.  </p><p> What did they do?  </p><p> JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  They're getting a double  whammy at Harley-Davidson, Neil, because the steel and aluminum tariffs hit  their raw materials costs.</p><p> And now the European Union, of course, imposing an addition 25 percent  tariff on motorcycles made here and shipped to Europe.</p><p> And so Harley is in a tough spot.  That tariff went from 6 percent to 31  percent.  And today, in a regulatory filing, Harley said that is going to  add more than $2,000 a bike to the cost of a motorcycle made here in the  U.S. and sold in Europe.  And they can't possibly pass that along to  consumers.</p><p> So, in the short-term, they're going to have to eat it.  In the long term,  they're going to move production away from the U.S.  Europe was an  expanding market for Harley-Davidson.  They love it over there.  And U.S.  sales have been down.</p><p> You look at the first quarter of this year, U.S. sales of Harleys down  double digits, as guys like me get older and maybe give up their  motorcycles.  In Europe, it had been growing by about 7 percent.  </p><p> And so those bikes, made in the U.S. and shipped to Europe, will be no  more.  Harley has four plants here in the U.S., York, Pennsylvania, Kansas  City, Missouri, and two in their home state of Wisconsin, and now  apparently bikes destined for Europe will not be made there anymore.</p><p> Instead, they will be made in places like Brazil and elsewhere, Thailand  and Australia.  This is not, as you pointed out at the outset, what the  president had intended.  His trade policies designed to keep and create  jobs here in the U.S.  In this case, it appears they will be eliminating  them -- Neil.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Amazing.</p><p> All right, Jeff Flock, thank you very, very much.  </p><p> All right, Mattie Duppler is.  We have got Charles Payne here, Larry Shover  here as well of SFG, alternate CME trader as well.  </p><p> Charles Payne, what is going on here?  We knew the trade thing was getting  antsy, but it seemed like the bottom fell out.  </p><p> CHARLES PAYNE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  It did, but because I think this had  a little bit of a different twist.</p><p> This was investment.  This is about -- the whole thing, by the way, is  centered on made in China 2025.  The administration, which I wish they  would articulate what they're trying to do, because I understand, and I  think most -- a lot of people do -- and it's the idea of curbing this  ambition, the stated ambition by China to sort of be the world's tech  leader in a short period of time.</p><p> And one way to get there, perhaps the only way they can get their with  their own timeline, is to continue to steal our intellectual property.</p><p> So the idea is to restrict investments from companies where China has a 25  percent or more ownership.  And, again, this was just speculation.  It was  in a few media outlets, the White House trying to take -- take it back a  little bit.  It's something obviously that they have toyed around with.</p><p> Peter Navarro has talked about this kind of thing for maybe two decades, so  this is not necessarily news, per se.  But it is -- it is a different  twist, to your point.  It's not -- it's not the trade stuff anymore, as  much as it is, hey, we want to take direct aim at your ambitions to usurp  America's perch as the world's tech leader.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, Larry, what worried a lot in the markets is that, all of a  sudden, then we were putting a general wall up on Chinese investment in  general and technology period.  </p><p> That's how it was interpreted.  And then, later on, the treasury secretary,  Mnuchin, came out to say, no, no, no, it wasn't singling out China, as if  to say there's other players here, as if that eased the angst.  </p><p> It actually compounded that.  But what do you make of that?  </p><p> LARRY SHOVER, SOLUTIONS FUNDS GROUP:  Well, what I make of it is that two  things.</p><p> The whole thing lacked clarity.  Like, it didn't matter.  Like, this whole  China tweets and tirades, it didn't matter because it lacked clarity.  It  seemed like the White House is utterly unprepared to create any kind of  proposal that can go into law.</p><p> Immigration policy is a good proof of that.  Also, it lacks credibility,  because we all know -- I mean, this does -- this hurts us more than it  hurts them, the fact that it's going to kill Apple or Nike.  It really,  really hurt them manufacturing their goods there that are sent to us.</p><p> So it doesn't make any sense.  People dismissed it.  And I really think  people are definitely blaming the China trade today.  The bigger problem,  though, it's really tech.  We saw that breaking down last week.</p><p> Leadership has been very thin in the stock market.  Without five or six  super cap techs in the S&amp;P 500...</p><p> CAVUTO:  Yes.  </p><p> SHOVER:  ... we would be down 4 percent, instead of up 1.5 percent.</p><p> But it started to crack.  The Supreme Court came out last week with a  ruling on sales tax, et cetera.  That chasm between growth and value has  been very, very wide.  The market is vulnerable.  The ball will always find  you when you're out of position.</p><p> And that's really what happened today.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  And people were a little anxious on that investment angle here and  maybe finding an excuse for technology, which ran up far and fast, to sell  off some of it.</p><p> But, Mattie, it's sort of this impression that not everyone in the  administration seems to be on the same page.  I'm getting different vibes  from the Treasury secretary, different vibes from their trade  representatives, different vibes from the president.</p><p> MATTIE DUPPLER, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S FORUM:  Right.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  And I think that's the kind of thing that scares markets.  </p><p> DUPPLER:  Oh, absolutely.</p><p> You finally have consensus on this panel, Neil.  And that's, what the heck  is the administration intending to do with these trade efforts?</p><p> Charles and I don't always agree on this issue, but right now we're both  wondering, what is the objective here?  And that's what the administration  needs to clarify.  It needs to make clear what it intends to do with all of  these efforts towards China.</p><p> Now, if the objective here is to exact the most amount of pain and pressure  on China possible, they need to make sure that they're not injecting pain  on American businesses.  And that's a concern, especially when you look at  really artificially diminishing the amount of capital that can come into  this country.</p><p> I worry about the impact on businesses.  And that's not even getting to  what tariffs are doing to American businesses, where we have already seen  some of those announcements this week.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Or even the threat of them.</p><p> But, Charles, the other thing you mentioned -- and this -- you can help me  out here.  It's always been that the Chinese are in bad shape here.   They're at two-year-plus lows in their market.  They have a lot more to  lose than we do.</p><p> But they also have their pride, and they're not giving any ground.  So, how  is this resolved, if it is?</p><p> PAYNE:  And this is where I disagree with Larry.  </p><p> I don't think -- I think a lot of people are raising the white flag so  quickly that China is going to beat us at this.  They're not.  If it has to  go the whole way... </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  The whole way could be years.  </p><p> PAYNE:  Yes, Sure.</p><p> Mattie makes the right point.  It's sort of like when my pops used to take  me out in the back.  He says, it's going to hurt me as much as it hurts  you.  </p><p> No, it won't.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> PAYNE:  With that being said, let's look at what China did today, this  morning.  </p><p> Their central bank freed up banks over there to the tune of $100 billion.   Right?  This is to sort of...</p><p> CAVUTO:  It needs a stimulant.</p><p> PAYNE:  ... to do things thing on debt.  </p><p> Last week, it was $30 billion.  A week before that, it was $30 billion.   Their foreign and reserve currencies have dropped a trillion dollars.  </p><p> Their debt-to-GDP ratio is on its way to 300 percent.  We aren't going to  lose this.  China knows we're not going to lose this.  Nobody wants to  lose.  It's a matter of how, to your point, do you save face and resolve  it?</p><p> CAVUTO:  I think that's where we are.  </p><p> Larry, the Chinese, remember, today indicating, you know, we don't just  turn a cheek on this.  And we come back and we're going to fight back.  </p><p> Now, to be clear, no response to the tariffs yet with tariffs of their own.   In other words, to increase the amount to match the United States, when we  promised we would put $200 billion on top of that.</p><p> Some read into that a sign that the Chinese are trying to find a middle  ground here, where they can talk tough, but they don't have to respond in  kind and invite a war.  What do you see?  </p><p> SHOVER:  Yes.</p><p> Well, I see that they have already done that, just what we said.  Required  reserve ratio dropped 50 basis points yesterday, adding all that liquidity  into the market.  What did that do?  That dropped RMB by 1.5 percent in  five days, 3.5 percent over the last month.  </p><p> So they're already ready.  That is going to negate any kind of trade tariff  that we are going to impose.  And I think they know, at the end of the day,  that there's so lack of clarity coming out of the White House, that they're  just preparing for it.  </p><p> Also realizing that they have had a real soft patch of data coming in.  So,  perhaps Trump is trying to hit them while they're weak.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  We will see.</p><p> All right, guys, I apologize jumping on you.  We have got a lot of breaking  news here.  </p><p> I do want to bring in my next guest, the former Heinz CEO Bill Johnson, a  global read of things, if ever there were one.  </p><p> And, Bill, I'm looking at this and wondering what the signals could be for  us.  If a company, one after the other, like GM considering making all its  Blazers now in Mexico, and, of course, we have been talking about a number  of other companies that have been doing the same or considering preemptive  move like Harley-Davidson, that has got to have a domestic economic impact.</p><p> BILL JOHNSON, FORMER CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, H.J. HEINZ COMPANY:  It should, Neil.  </p><p> Nothing has happened yet to impact the economy here.  And, frankly, the  Chinese and European economies...</p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, they're already leaving.  Those guys are already making some  moves.  </p><p> JOHNSON:  I understand.  But they're more vulnerable than we are.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  True.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Having said that, this is like tic-tac-toe.  Nobody wins.  </p><p> I play tic-tac-toe with any grandkids.  And you never win.  And that's what  this is now.  We have gotten to the point on this situation...</p><p> CAVUTO:  You never won at tic-tac-toe with your grandkids?  </p><p> JOHNSON:  No.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  You're one of the most celebrated CEOs ever.  And... </p><p> JOHNSON:  Yes.  That just shows you nobody wins, Neil.  And that's where we  are right now.  Nobody wins.</p><p> CAVUTO:  So, that's where you see -- that's where we are right now?</p><p> JOHNSON:  I do think that's where we are.</p><p> I think this created a huge environment of uncertainty.  You and I have had  this conversation many times.  Uncertainty leads to volatility.  Volatility  leads to more uncertainty.  And we get in this vicious cycle.  </p><p> And I think that's where we are now.  Having said that, I think,  ultimately, saner and cooler heads will prevail, and this will somehow get  resolved.  </p><p> I hope this is not a negotiation ploy, because it's rather ham-fisted.  And  there has got to be better ways to attack this issue than the one that is  being generated right now.</p><p> CAVUTO:  What do you make -- I think it was ratcheted up a little bit today  to go after in this case the Chinese for investing in technology.</p><p> It was read as, we're not going to allow them to invest in any technology  companies.  And that might have been a prematurely wrong impression.  But  that was the one that was out there for hours in the markets.  They had to  dial that back a little bit.</p><p> But they're still looking at putting a limit to who can invest in  technology.  That's how it interpreted, hence, technology falls off a lot.   So if this is more from just goods and services to, I don't know, even  companies and stocks you invest in, then what?  </p><p> JOHNSON:  Well, then I think we have chaos, Neil. </p><p> I don't think you can stop the investment in a capitalist society.  It's  just the way the system works.  And while I understand why the  administration is going after some of these issues -- and they're sort of  going where people have been afraid to tread before -- the reality is, we  have to have some clarity in the communication of the purpose of what we're  trying to achieve and then take a step-by-step process in which to achieve  it.  </p><p> And I heard about the investment situation this morning.  Then I saw  Secretary Mnuchin's response.  And so I'm completely unclear as to what is  happening.  And there we go again.  That creates more uncertainty, which  creates more volatility, and leaves us all in the dark about what it is  we're trying to achieve.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Now, there used to be an old rule here following this president  the last 18 months that those who doubted him would be proven wrong, and  that everything ends up OK and markets come back from what look like  debacles, and people who second-guessed him have been proven wrong.  </p><p> So there was this now new -- or renewed trust that President Trump must  know what he's doing, there's a method to all of this.  </p><p> Do you subscribe to that, or is there now a reassessment, well, maybe not.   Maybe this is a little impulsive.  Maybe there's not a method to the  madness.  Maybe it's just madness.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Well, I think, historically, over his last 18 months in office,  he's done a pretty good job of bringing us back from the brink and  achieving great success.  </p><p>North Korea seems to be an example of one of those areas.  But I don't  know.  I don't like this whole approach, Neil.  I think it's so ham-fisted  and so unpredictable that sometimes you create a fire out of a smoke bomb,  and the next thing you know, you have got a real conflagration going, and  you don't know how to put it out.  And that -- I'm worried we're headed  that way.</p><p> Having said that, I will give him credit for again treading in these places  that need to be addressed.  I just think there's better ways to do it.  But  I'm not yet ready to say that we're just going to pull this one back from  the brink and everyone is going to be happy.  </p><p> I just don't know.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  We shall see, my friend.  Thank you very, very much.  </p><p> Good luck in your next tic-tac-toe game.  I give the edge to you still.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> JOHNSON:  Thank you.  Thank you.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  William Johnson, the former Heinz CEO, if anyone knows the global  landscape, it is he.  All right. </p><p> All right, when we come back here, this nastiness with Democrats saying  that we're going to get nasty no matter where Republicans gather.  </p><p> Really?  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Yikes, 25 minutes, right, a 5:00 p.m. deadline staring down now,  as House Republicans want documents from the Justice Department on that  Clinton e-mail probe and the Russian investigation.  Then what happens if  they don't get them?  </p><p> After this.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. MAXINE WATERS (D), CALIFORNIA:  And if you see anybody from that  Cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you  get out and you create a crowd.  </p><p> (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)</p><p> WATERS:  And you push back on them.  And you tell them they're not welcome.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, anyway, American Majority CEO Ned Ryun.  We have got Olympic  Media managing editor Katie Frates and Democratic strategist Christy  Setzer.</p><p> I don't know where to begin.  But, Katie, maybe you can help me with this.  </p><p> This is out of control.  This is just crazy talk.  What do you make of it?  </p><p> KATIE FRATES, OLYMPIC MEDIA:  It absolutely is.  </p><p> This is just going way too far, because she doesn't even know who she is  speaking to, Maxine Waters, when she is saying this.  What if someone sees  somebody at a gas station and takes it way too far?  </p><p> You're essentially encouraging anyone of any mental state, of any level of  discourse, to go up and potentially harm someone else because of their  political beliefs.  That's absolutely not OK.  </p><p> I'm so excited and happy to see at least Nancy Pelosi push back on this.   I'm not sure why more Democratic leaders are not speaking up and condemning  this.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, there were a good number.  To be fair, there were a good  number, Elijah Cummings and all saying...</p><p> FRATES:  Good.  Good.</p><p> CAVUTO:  ... that, even when it came to the Sanders situation, she  shouldn't have been taken out of the restaurant.  </p><p> But, Ned, I'm worried more about the increasing vitriol.  And we're seeing  more and more of it.  And anything could happen in that environment.</p><p> NED RYUN, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN MAJORITY:  No.</p><p> And I think really what we're seeing is, to sum up Charles Krauthammer, we  conservatives, we think the left is philosophically misguided, and many on  the left think we're evil.  </p><p> And I think you're seeing this rhetoric ramp up where borders are now  bigotry and American presidents standing up for the America taxpayer, well,  this is Nazism and the second coming of the Holocaust.  </p><p> And I think what the left is trying to do is say, the debate is over in our  minds because we consider your ideas to be irrational.  We don't consider  your ideas to be legitimate.  </p><p> And if they can dehumanize the other side, that's what they want to do,  because that justifies driving opposing thought from the public square.  </p><p> The thing that troubles me, Neil, about all of this, this kind of  incitement to physical intimidation and bullying is not to be normalized.   It's not normal for a constitutional republic.  It's only normal in banana  republics.  And if the left wants to beat us, try doing it at the ballot  box in 2018 and 2020.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Do you worry about that, Christy?  </p><p> As a Democratic strategist, and a darn good one, and a very calm person, I  might point out, that your party could be ruining it for itself, that it's  actually scaring some people with that kind of talk, whether you agree or  disagree with the politics behind it.  </p><p> CHRISTY SETZER, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  I just think it's impossible to put  Maxine Waters' comments like this in a vacuum like this.</p><p> The defining feature of Donald Trump's campaign was not that he was going  to shake stuff up in Washington or that he was a great businessman.  It was  this incivility.  Right?  </p><p> He started talking about how, I like people that were not captured about  John McCain.  Then you looked as his rallies, where they were filled with  him actively asking them to take violence against protesters.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  If that is what your view is, do you think that the response,  responding in kind, then, if that's your view, is justified?</p><p> SETZER:  I don't think that -- no, I don't think that we have responded in  kind.  </p><p> I think that Democrats are saying, look, we need to make it just a little  bit uncomfortable.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  You have got whole groups that target a homeland security  secretary at a restaurant.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> SETZER:  No, no, no, no.  Not with violence, Neil.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> SETZER:  That's an extraordinarily important difference.  Not with  violence.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Please listen to me.  </p><p> Sarah Sanders, her incident, Secretary Nielsen outside her home and in a  restaurant, then Maxine Waters justifying it.  I could go on to talk about  Florida's Pam Bondi and what she dealt with at a movie.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> CAVUTO:  Stephen Miller and be called a fascist while he's out.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> SETZER:  Protest is a healthy part of the American tradition, not violence,  not violence.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  You're fine with this.  You're fine with it.  </p><p> But if it were done in reverse, you wouldn't be fine with it.</p><p> SETZER:  I would be absolutely fine with it.  I would be fine with it,  because, again, protest is absolutely fine.</p><p> What is not fine...</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  You just said when you didn't like it what Donald Trump and his  people were doing the same.  </p><p> SETZER:  I'm sorry?</p><p> CAVUTO:  You didn't like it when Donald Trump was doing that.</p><p> SETZER:  No.  What Donald Trump was saying was, I want that guy to be taken  out on a stretcher.  What Donald Trump was doing was actually what Ned Ryun  was just talking about right now, which is dehumanizing the other side.</p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, I don't get it.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  All right.  OK.</p><p> Mattie, do you believe that this is going too far?  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> SETZER:  By talking about how they're animals and infesting America.</p><p> CAVUTO:  I understand.  I heard you.</p><p> SETZER:  That's very different.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Mattie, has this gone too far?  Mattie, you're in awe, aren't you?  </p><p> FRATES:  Yes, yes.  Absolutely, it is.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Katie, I apologize.  I apologize.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  See that?  I lose my place, because I get so wrapped up in it.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Is it your sense that this gets worse, though?  Are you getting a  sense it gets worse?</p><p> FRATES:  So, this is the problem.  </p><p> It's that this is escalating rhetoric.  You're essentially saying mob  someone outside of a gas station.  </p><p> RYUN:  Exactly.  </p><p> FRATES:  And, again, you don't know the intentions of the person who may  then go on to do that.  </p><p> So what if someone is attacked?  What if something violent happens?  And  then you turn around and you say, well, Maxine Waters was telling people to  do that.  It's not a good idea and it's not a healthy dialogue.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> SETZER:  Do we remember the Pizzagate conspiracy, how a crazy conspiracy  actually led someone to take a gun to my, my local pizza place, actually,  and try to shoot it up because they had heard this crazy idea on the  Internet and by Alex Jones and others that Hillary Clinton and John Podesta  were up to no good?  </p><p> That led to actual violence.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, I don't want to get in a tit for tat.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  I sometimes feel like I'm separating my teenage sons.  </p><p> But, Ned Ryun, I do know this.  We have all got to bring the octane down a  little bit on all sides here.  </p><p> RYUN:  We do.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  But how do we do that?  </p><p> And should it be incumbent people to just to say, there has got to be a  better way?  Whether the Elijah Cummings approach, this has got to stop,  whether Sarah Sanders' approach, I just politely up and left, and I tried  not to make a big deal of it at the scene, what is it?  What is the answer?</p><p> RYUN:  No.  I think we have got to start policing our own.  We have to  start policing ourselves on the right and the left.  </p><p> And I was encouraged by Nancy Pelosi saying that Maxine Waters' statement  was unacceptable.  I think we have to be honest about it on the right, too,  when we see unacceptable statements.  And I have said this again -- I have  said this before.  I will say it again.  </p><p> When Donald Trump -- I love 85 to 90 percent of his Twitter feed.  When he  is talking about bloody face-lift, you will never me defend that.  I want  him to focus on the positives and policy and all these things.</p><p> When it becomes personal, I think we need to call out our side and say,  this is not how we have more civil discourse in the public arena.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Fully agree.  Fully agree.  </p><p> At our core, guys, we're all human beings.  </p><p> RYUN:  We're all Americans.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  And we can agree to disagree.  But we don't have to be asses in  the process.  </p><p> And none of you are, by the way.  </p><p> But I want to thank you all very, very much.</p><p> And, Katie, I apologize.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> FRATES:  No, no apology needed.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  I get so apoplectic.  And I don't even know why.  And it's not  even dinnertime.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, by the way, we're close to the witching hour, 5:00 p.m.  Eastern time, that document deadline.  But right now there's indications  the people who have put out that deadline aren't going to get the response  they want in time for that deadline.  </p><p> Then what?  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right.  Between a deadline coming up in about 15 minutes from  now and, of course, this is the week we're going to see some big testimony  up on Capitol Hill, much of it is behind closed doors.</p><p> Let's get the read from former Justice Department official Tom Dupree.  </p><p> Tom, what is the biggest thing you're waiting for?  </p><p> TOM DUPREE, FORMER JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:  Well, the biggest thing  I'm waiting for in the short-term is whether the Justice Department  complies with the congressional demands.  </p><p> As you point out, the clock is ticking.  They have a document deadline,  production deadline at 5:00 p.m. this afternoon.  We will see if they turn  over what they're expected to turn over.  My guess is that they are not  going to satisfy the demands of the House Republicans.</p><p> And I think we are going to see this dispute continue to escalate in the  days ahead.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, then they would want to take even aggressive action  against Rod Rosenstein.  Right?  What would it be?  </p><p> DUPREE:  Well, let's see.</p><p> They have got a wide variety of means at their disposal.  At one end of the  spectrum is just the continued drumbeat of public criticism.  They can amp  that up several ways.</p><p> One thing they could do is, they could issue subpoenas.  Another thing they  could do is, they could actually instigate contempt proceedings.  And then  at the extreme end of the other spectrum, it would be impeachment  proceedings.</p><p> I'm hopeful that they're not going to go there and that cooler heads will  prevail and they be able to sit down and work all of this out before we get  to that point.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Where is all of this going?  </p><p> I mean, especially with the Peter Strzok testimony later on, are they more  interested in his case, finding out what he knew and what was the backdrop  for his comments he was making about then candidate Trump, or what?  </p><p> DUPREE:  Yes.  I think that's a lot of what was going on.</p><p> I mean, I think right now, from the perspective of Congress, there was so  much that was going on behind the scenes in 2016 that Congress wants to  know, what was your reason for doing this?  What was your reason for  handling the investigations the way you did? What was the reason for  getting these wiretaps and for conducting the surveillance?</p><p> Were you using an informant?  Was it a spy, that sort of thing?  And the  fact is, DOJ is not in the business normally of turning over documents.   And so I think, institutionally, there's a huge amount of reluctance to  give Congress what it wants.</p><p> But Congress is beating the drum.  They're on the warpath.  They're trying  to fulfill their oversight function here.  And so I think we have a real  collision that's not in any -- is not going to be sorted out in the near  term.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  When I have looked at a lot of the comments from those identified,  like Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, and these other unidentified individuals,  and then, of course, now I know how James Comey felt about then candidate  Trump and how Andy McCabe felt, his number two.</p><p> I have not run across one piece of evidence to show a pro-Trump person or  someone who was biased to like -- to like Donald Trump.  Now, I might have  missed it.  But, again, doesn't this feed the narrative that that was a  stacked deck, because that certainly that stacked deck mantle has been  claimed by a lot of Republicans that they were out to get him?</p><p> DUPREE:  Yes, I certainly haven't seen anything along the lines of what  you're talking about, Neil.</p><p> It all does seem to be one way.  I guess what's surprising and frankly  disappointing to me is that some of these folks, Strzok in particular, and  Page, that even though they were nominally professionals, that they just  weren't able to put aside their political biases.</p><p> Look, the fact is, is that pretty much everyone in the country harbors  inner thoughts, their own political leanings.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Right. </p><p> DUPREE:  But I think, for most people, and certainly for the vast majority  of people in the FBI historically, they been able to put these biases aside  when it comes to the sacred function of law enforcement.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  But did you share whatever opinion -- we all have opinions.  You  would be vanilla if you didn't.</p><p> But did you -- these were aggressively shared and aggressive opinions at  that.  When you were there, was that -- did you kind of know what your  colleagues felt, whether they were investigating someone or not?  </p><p> DUPREE:  No, not in this way.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Yes.  </p><p> DUPREE:  I think what is unusual about this, Neil, is that these were  political comments they were discussing in the context of an ongoing  political investigation.</p><p> It's not as though they were investigating some bank robber and trading  texts about the presidential election.  I mean, not saying that would be  OK, but that would be very different.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Right. </p><p> DUPREE:  What they were doing here is, they were carrying out  investigations involving the very candidates who were running at the same  time they're engaged in this correspondence about how they can advance  their own political views through their official duties.</p><p> That is where it crossed a line.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Yes.  </p><p> You would just love to get the context for these remarks.  What was going  on?  If it's just hatred, I don't know if that is even better or worse.  </p><p> Tom, good seeing you again, my friend.  Thank you.  </p><p> DUPREE:  Likewise.  Thank you, Neil.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p> How about just eliminating ICE?  </p><p> With all this controversy about separating kids from their parents at the  border, and then now trying to reconnect them with their parents, sometimes  far from the border, maybe just get rid of ICE.  Some people are actually  urging that -- after this.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, groups in protests all around wanting to get rid of  ICE.  </p><p> That's right.  After the separation of these kids from their parents, a lot  of folks saying, you know, the problem isn't these coming into our country.   It's the folks who are trying to keep them out and the way they go about  their business.  So, they're actually saying, get rid of ICE.  Put ICE on  ice, if you will.</p><p> Former ICE agent Claude Arnold on that.</p><p> What do you think of that?  </p><p> CLAUDE ARNOLD, FORMER ICE SPECIAL AGENT:  Well, I -- first of all, people  don't understand the breadth of ICE's mission.  </p><p> Immigration enforcement is half of the mission.  It has an entire  component, homeland security investigations, that investigates all crime  related to the border.  </p><p> It's the investigative arm for all of DHS.  It's the second largest  investigative entity in the U.S. government and it investigates a lot of  things, drug smuggling, human trafficking and smuggling, child pornography,  export of illegal technologies.</p><p> It has a huge national security responsibility.  It's the second largest  representation on the Federal Joint Terrorism Task Force after the FBI.  </p><p> So to say you just need to get rid of ICE, I think people don't understand  all that ICE does.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, a lot of them were saying, right after these apprehensions,  well, does it change and does their mission statement change given on the  administration?  It was this administration that, led by Jeff Sessions,  said, we're going to enforce a policy where we can, yes, separate kids from  their parents, something that wasn't done, at least not the same way  exactly, in the Obama administration.  </p><p> So do you have to pivot depending on the administration?  </p><p> ARNOLD:  Well, I think there was a pivot done on how enforcement was  conducted during the Obama administration.  </p><p> And, really, it's just been a return to the status quo.  But people have  been -- they have developed a sense of entitlement that you can just come  to the country illegally and expecting it's OK. </p><p> CAVUTO:  Oh, no, you're quite right.  People forget how we were  apprehending underage kids and then who were -- drugs deals and all.   You're quite right about that.</p><p> ARNOLD:  Right.  Right.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  But who calls that?  Do you answer then to whatever the  presidential directive is or what?</p><p> ARNOLD:  Yes, of course.  You're part of the executive branch.  </p><p> ICE does what the president tells them to do through the executive chain of  command.  I mean, it's the executive branch.</p><p> CAVUTO:  So, if there were no ICE, to these people's interests, the  protesters, who would handle this border stuff?  </p><p> ARNOLD:  Well, here's the important thing here, Neil.  </p><p> What is going on is, the same people who want ICE abolished, they opposed  there being any wall on the border.  They oppose changing the loopholes  that encourage and allow people to stay in the U.S. illegally.  </p><p> So, the last stand against those who make it in here illegally is ICE.  So  if you get rid of ICE, then you completely have open borders and no  immigration enforcement.  And that's by design.  They want that to happen.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Amazing.  </p><p> All right, Claude Arnold, thank you very much, former ICE agent.  He's put  himself in a lot of harm's way over the years just to deal with that.  </p><p> People should remember that, no matter what your feelings on this  particular issue.  </p><p> We will have more after this.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Thirty seconds away from that deadline.  What is Rod Rosenstein  going to do?  Is he going to give the Republicans what they want?</p><p> Tomorrow, we will get the read on all of this from Republican House  Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte.  He also was one of the fellows  who came up with a plan to settle this immigration mess.  His measure went  nowhere, but that doesn't mean that immigration progress couldn't still  come up somewhere.  </p><p> A one-on-one with probably one of the more powerful players on Capitol Hill  tomorrow, Bob Goodlatte.</p><p> We will see you then.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> QUESTION:  And one more, on trade, and following up on what Blake asked  about Harley-Davidson.  They announced in an SEC filing they're moving a  significant amount of their operations to Europe because of the E.U.  tariffs that were placed on Harley-Davidson motorcycles.  Is this what the  President envisioned for what the impact would be by placing tariffs on the  E.U. and the retaliation the E.U. has put on the U. S.?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Again, the European  Union is trying to punish U.S. workers because they have engaged repeatedly  in unfair trade practices.  And the president is saying enough is enough.   We'd like to work with the E.U. to work on a level playing field. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Sorry, Steve, I did come to you.  Go ahead.  </p><p> QUESTION:  The president today in the Oval Office, sitting next to the king  of Jordan, mentioned some progress in the Middle East peace process, but he  didn't give us any specifics. </p><p> There's been quite a bit of back-channel diplomacy going on the last few  days in the Middle East, with Jared Kushner and Jason Greenblatt.  Do you  have anything concrete to -- to tell us about any sort of positive movement  whatsoever, from all of this? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Again, we -- I think that the meetings that took place  over the last week with Senior Adviser Jared Kushner and Special  Representative Jason Greenblatt, they met with a number of officials and  principals in Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, Israel and Qatar last week. </p><p> They discussed the situation in Gaza as well as the next stages of the  peace effort.  We're going to continue those conversations and we're  committed to the peace effort, and we're going to keep working forward.   But those conversations were productive. </p><p> Julie? </p><p> QUESTION:  Sarah, the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection said  today that they are no longer going to be referring people who cross the  border without authorization for criminal charges if they're traveling with  children, which is essentially a return to the Obama administration  practice and administrations before that.  Does the president support that  approach?  And if so, does he regret trying to push forward on a zero- tolerance approach in the first place? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  No.  The president certainly supports keeping families  together, which he has outlined several times over the last week.  But he's  also called on Congress to actually fix the system. </p><p> They're the only ones that ultimately have the ability to change the law.   The president's executive order has given a temporary solution to the  problem but it's not permanent, and we need Congress to step up.  We need  Democrats to stop playing political games, do their jobs, work with this  president and let's fix the problem at the border. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Jeff? </p><p> QUESTION:  Sarah, can you talk about why you tweeted from your official  account about the episode that you had at the restaurant on Friday night? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Sure.  I was responding to a number of news stories.  I  would been reached out to by over a dozen reporters, and there were  multiple news stories that had already been issued. </p><p> It was considered news of the day, so I responded in the way I would to any  other news of the day story. </p><p> Jeff? </p><p> QUESTION:  Sarah, you said just because you don't see a judge doesn't mean  you don't get due process.  Can you explain what you mean by that  specifically, and how the president envisions that this would work while  still maintaining what the Constitution upholds in having a swift  immigration system? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Again, there are other ways for removal.  There are  thousands of illegal aliens that are removed every month that don't see  judges.  Sometimes that's through voluntary removal, and sometimes that's  through expedited removal. </p><p> Again, the president's ultimate goal would be that we have actually a  secure border, and people aren't coming into the country illegally.  But  that we have a system that works and the people that come into the country  come in through a legal system. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Jill? </p><p> QUESTION:  What is the president doing specifically this week to ensure  that Congress passes a bill?  He's spent all week in Nevada talking about - - or, all weekend.  Excuse me -- on Saturday, talking about how Democrats  want open borders and crime.  But, specifically, has he made phone calls to  Republican members in the House, where the bill is pending?  Has he tried  to bring Democrats together?  What is he doing specifically to try and get  a new law passed, specifically, other than just railing against the current  law? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  The president met with a number of lawmakers last week,  talked with several over the weekend, some that he was with while he was  traveling.  Last week, he made an open invitation to Democrat lawmakers --  that they were welcome to come to the White House to discuss what they'd  like to see, because the president wants solutions. </p><p> We've yet to have any of them to show up, actually willing to have those  conversations, actually willing to fix the problem.  Instead, they'd rather  rant and rave about not allowing members of the Trump administration to  step foot in public. </p><p> The president wants to see solutions.  That's what we're focused on.  It's  Congress's job to do that, and we've laid out very clearly that we want to  be part of that and what we'd like to see in that package. </p><p> Jill? </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> QUESTION:  ... on this? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Clearly, they aren't.  If they haven't passed a law to  fix this system, then they haven't.  Republicans have laid out a number of  proposals that they support.  The president has voiced his support for  those. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> QUESTION:  ... probably fail this week, though.  The Republican bills will  probably...</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  That's because no Democrat will get on board and  actually support a solution. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> QUESTION:  ... Republican -- is your Republicans cannot pass these  Republican bills.  What is the president doing as the leader of the party  to try and get Republican...</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Jeff, these aren't Republican bills.  These are bills  that fix a broken system.  They may have Republican sponsors, but these  should be bipartisan.  This shouldn't be complicated.  Look, the House has  already passed over 500 pieces of legislation, but they can't get through  the Senate because Democrats refuse to actually find solutions. </p><p> We have 50 bills that passed just last week to address the opioid crisis --  that passed through the House.  The Senate still hasn't taken them up.   Hopefully, they will.  And, if they do, that will show that we actually can  come up with bipartisan solutions.  And that's what we'd like to see them  do on immigration, as well. </p><p> Jill? </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> QUESTION:  ... follow-up on Julia's question about the zero-tolerance  policy.  The president said, last week, after signing the executive order,  that he believed that zero tolerance was still important.  You guys made a  point of the fact that the E. O.  did not actually get rid of the policy. </p><p> How does that square with the fact that CBP is now saying that they are no  longer referring for prosecution any adults who come in with children? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Again, this is a temporary solution.  This isn't going  to last.  Congress still has to step up.  They still have to do their job.   This will only last a short amount of time because we're going to run out  of space, we're going to run out of resources in order to keep people  together, and we're asking Congress to provide those resources and do their  job.  And...</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> QUESTION:  ... temporary solution -- does that mean, at some point, you are  going to change that policy back? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  We're not changing the policy.  We're simply out of  resources, and, at some point, Congress has to do what they were elected to  do, and that is secure our border.  That is stop the crime coming into our  country. </p><p> The country has made extremely clear that they don't want open borders, and  Democrats need to understand that, and they need to work with Republicans  and find some solutions. </p><p> QUESTION:  And there...</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Annie.  Sorry, Jill, I'm going to keep going.  Annie, go  ahead. </p><p> QUESTION:  Sarah, you mentioned the state of resources and running out of  them.  Can you be specific about what the resources are right now for  housing parents and children together?  Is there enough housing right now?   Is the Pentagon stepping in?  Like, what's being done about the resources?  </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Again, we're looking at every option available.  We have  asked the Pentagon to help with additional space.  But a lot of that will  depend on our ability to stop people coming into the country illegally.   And we, again, encourage people to go through ports of entry instead of  crossing the border illegally. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  We've requested, through legislation -- we're working  with Congress, hopefully, to provide more resources and the ability to  actually enforce the law. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Ayesha? </p><p> QUESTION:  Thank you.  I just want to see if you can kind of narrow down  exactly what the president actually intends to do when it comes to this  idea of not having judges.  You say that there are instances where people  don't have judges, but my understanding is that, if you do ask for asylum,  you do have certain rights. </p><p> So is there going to be a change in that policy, or what is this  administration planning to do to make it so you don't have to see a judge?   (INAUDIBLE)  </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Again, I have addressed this a couple times.  There are  multiple instances in where you wouldn't:  voluntary removal, certain cases  have expedited removal.  If somebody comes through a port of entry seeking  asylum, those cases and that process will be heard.  But at the same time,  the president's ultimate goal is to secure the border and stop illegal  immigration. </p><p> QUESTION:  I -- I -- I understand that, but so what does that mean  practically?  Like, is the president planning to do anything differently,  or are you just saying, you don't like the way (INAUDIBLE) now? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  The president's laid out what he'd like to see.  We've  put out the things that we want to see in an immigration package months  ago.  We're still waiting on Congress to give us the ability to do that. </p><p> QUESTION:  So -- so unless Congress acts, nothing is actually going to  change?  The administration is not changing anything right now, when it  comes to judges? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  You mean, are we walking around making up laws?  No,  because we're not the Obama administration.  We're actually trying to  enforce the laws that are on the books.  We're actually asking Congress to  do their part in the process, and pass new legislation that will fix our  immigration system. </p><p> QUESTION:  So -- but nothing is actually changing on the ground.  Like,  this -- so this is -- the president's complaining about judges, and saying  that we shouldn't have all these judges, and people who come over should  just be put out, but nothing is actually going to change.  He's just saying  -- he's just complaining about the process as it stands now. </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Things that we have the ability to do administratively,  we are working to do.  But again, Congress is the only one that has the  ability to write law, and we hope they'll do that. </p><p> Steve? </p><p> QUESTION:  I'm honing in on that point.  I'm trying to understand what it  is the president understands about the current policy, because as you've  explained, expedited removal allows the government to remove hundreds of  thousands of illegal immigrants a year without seeing judges.  Did the  president know that when he issued the tweets? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Yeah, but there are still thousands that go through a  very lengthy process.  We'd like to see the process consolidated.  We'd  like to see the backlog stopped.  We'd like to see our border secured. </p><p> Sorry, Steve, I'm going to keep going. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> QUESTION:  Under current law there are a couple of things that the  president could do.  You could expand that policy.  You've said that he  would like to see more expedited removal.  Does the president intend to  expand it to the full two-year limit under the current statute? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Again, we would like to see more expedited removal, but  ultimately, we would like to see the border secured and people stop coming  into the country illegally.  That seems pretty simple to me, and it would  stop a lot of the problems, and would eliminate the need for so many of  these additional laws. </p><p> QUESTION:  Thanks, Sarah.  The gal in the briefing talking about the  importance of civility.  Do you consider it a civil policy to separate more  than two thirds of the children from their parents? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  We consider enforcing the law the role that the  administration has to play.  Certainly, the president has taken an  executive action to the furthest that he has the ability to do to minimize  the separation of families.  We're working hard to make sure families get  to stay together, and we're calling on Congress to help us in that effort,  and we're continuing to focus on the reunification, and making sure that  the families, again, stay together, and that Congress will give us a  permanent solution to fix that. </p><p> QUESTION:  But you say that you're working to make families stay together.   It was your administration that separated them in the first place. </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  It wasn't our administration that created these laws,  but it is our administration's job to enforce it, and we've done that.  If  someone breaks the law, it's our job to enforce it.  If somebody doesn't  like the law, then they need to lobby Congress and ask them to change it.  </p><p> Anita. </p><p> QUESTION:  I have, one, an immigration question, and wanted to clarify one  thing.  So I understand that not every adult with a child is going to be  prosecuted.  If there are families that are being held together, detained  together somewhere and 20 days goes by, what is going to happen then?  I  didn't get an -- an answer with that last week.  I don't understand.  The  law says you can't keep them together, keep the children, even with parents  for longer than 20 days.  So then what happens? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Hopefully, Congress will pass the law and fix the  problem. </p><p> QUESTION:  (INAUDIBLE) 20 days? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Well, why should it be so hard?  They all say that they  don't want to separate families.  Seems like it should be pretty simple to  me. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  John? </p><p> QUESTION:  I said I had a clarification...</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Go ahead. </p><p> QUESTION:  ... so Jeff asked you a question about Congress and the bill.   Were you, in your response, referring to just a stand-alone bill that deals  with family separation, or were you referring to the bigger immigration  bill that the House hopes to take up this week? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Our preference would be a bill that addresses all of the  pillars that we've laid out, that we'd like to see addressed in an  immigration package.  And that's what our focus is right now, is there's a  bill that does that on the table. </p><p> If that doesn't happen, then we'll talk about other pieces of legislation  at that point. </p><p> QUESTION:  (INAUDIBLE) the president still wants that bill to go forward  even though he said...</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Certain...</p><p> QUESTION:  ... they don't want to -- he -- they shouldn't waste their time  on it? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Look, Democrats in the Senate have made clear they're  not going to support this.  </p><p> And because we need at least some Democrats to get on board, they've made  it very clear that they don't want to work with the president, that they  don't want to fix our immigration system.  That they'd rather have open  borders and rampant crime than work with the president to create solutions.   Until they change their mind, we're going to continue looking at the best  ways that we can fix these problems but we need Congress to help us. </p><p> John. </p><p> QUESTION:  Thank you, Sarah.  This president is the first in the television  age who has yet to address the American public on nationwide television  from the Oval Office.  Many Republican consultants have said that he might  have a stronger hand in influencing Congress if he made a nationally  televised address on immigration and what changes he'd like to see, to  explain it. </p><p> Is that something that's on the table within the administration? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  Certainly don't want to take anything off the table, or  any tool away from the president.  He does address the American people in a  number of different venues and formats.  And I will certainly pass along  that suggestion to him. </p><p> Nadia. </p><p> QUESTION:  Just a follow-up on the Middle East.  In the recent (INAUDIBLE)  Mr. Kushner said that if President Abbas is not willing to negotiate, he's  going to proceed with the deal.  Can you explain how the White House is  hoping to achieve any progress in the Middle East peace talks if the  principal party is not taking part in it? </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  We're going to continue meeting with the other partners  in the region.  And, again, we're going to continue pushing forward in the  peace process.  We had productive meetings over the last week.  We're going  to continue those conversations. </p><p> I will take one last question.  Saagar.  </p><p> QUESTION:  Thanks, Sarah.  </p><p> To follow up on the judges -- on the issue of immigration judges, why is  the President so opposed to an increase in the number of immigration judges  when it would expedite the asylum processing -- the asylum process and  expedite deportation?  </p><p> HUCKABEE SANDERS:  We're not opposed to the speeding up the process.  What  the President would like to see, once again, is that we stop the problem at  the very beginning.  He'd like to see us secure the border and people work  through the system, through the ports of entry, so that we're not dealing  with things on the back end.  </p><p> We'd like to stop the problem before it starts, and that's what the  president's focus has been all along, is on securing the border.  And  that's what we're going to continue to do.  </p><p> Thanks so much guys.  Have a great day.  </p><p> NEIL CAVUTO, HOST:  All right, you have been listening to Sarah Sanders  here.</p><p> And it's safe to say the Washington press corps is more concerned with the  immigration issue than a lot of folks losing their shirts today on this  whole trade issue.  </p><p> Welcome, everybody.  I'm Neil Cavuto.  And you're watching \"Your World.\"</p><p> And it could have worse.  As I show you the Dow today down about 328  points, we had been down almost 500 points, and a lot of that over a  building trade war and concerns this could get worse before it gets better,  or that there are no signs of concessions on the part of any of the  principal parties, namely the Chinese and ourselves.  </p><p> All of this on the same day that Harley-Davidson was indicating, because of  these threat of tariffs, they're moving a lot of their operations outside  the U.S.</p><p> On a separate issue, General Motors has indicated that a lot of its Chevy  Blazers will now be made in Mexico, not citing just the trade issue,  but  that it's not welcome noise here.</p><p> So, again, this could have a lot been worse.  There was some confusion  early on in the markets as to whether the administration was also  recommending that they were urging the Chinese and others not to invest in  technology stocks at all.  </p><p> Then Peter Navarro ends up popping up on CNBC to say, no, no, no, no, no,  they're not going to be, nor are there plans in the works for investment  restrictions on China.</p><p> And that brought us down to the levels we're at right now, about 328 points  southward on what was a crazy day on the markets.</p><p> We're going to be at this from all angles right now.</p><p> Let's first go to FOX Business Network's Deirdre Bolton with how it all  sorted out.</p><p> Hey, Deirdre.</p><p> DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, Neil.  </p><p> You said it.  It could have been much worse.  So, the markets did close  clearly lower, but certainly off the low points of the day.  And, of  course, the big headline, the Trump administration moving to block Chinese  companies from investing in U.S. tech firms and moving to block additional  tech exports from the U.S. to China.  </p><p> Our sources are saying the Treasury Department is going to make an official  announcement at the end of this week, bring us more clarity, more details  on the plan.  </p><p> Now, the level of difficulty is, of course, much higher when you start to  talk about blocking investment than when we're just engaging in tariff  spats.  So the stock market heading for the biggest one-day slide in  months.  </p><p> That's how we finished up.  You can see red across the screen.  One area I  really wanted to highlight are the techs, because S&amp;P 500 tech companies  get about 60 percent of their revenue from overseas.  So that's the highest  foreign exposure out of any of the index's 11 sectors.  </p><p> And, of course,critics of our current trade policy say that China has been  stealing anywhere between $30 billion and $50 billion worth of intellectual  property, hard data, every year for the past decade.  But then there was  even a stronger report, a more recent one that came out from the Commission  on the Theft of American Intellectual Property.</p><p> It has a much higher number, stating that up to $600 billion in theft that  has some projections baked in is possible.  But experts say, bottom line,  the motivation to want to level the playing field is completely  understandable.  </p><p> What gets complicated is that so many American businesses are  interconnected.  So, for example, here's seven big tech American companies  that source half of their products and components from China.  </p><p> So, HP, IBM, Dell, Cisco, Unisys, Microsoft, Intel.  Even Apple has sold  more iPhones in China in the last three years than in the U.S.  And Apple  gets about 20 percent of its annual revenue from China.  </p><p> Now, the Chinese president of course says China will punch back and will  not be forced to eat the bitter fruit.  That is a translation, a direct  quote.  </p><p> But as the tension rises between the world's two biggest economies, of  course, investors really showed their anxiety.  So, we had the Nasdaq, you  can see there, closely lower, essentially 2 percent, biggest one-day  percentage decline since March.  Third day down in a row.  So, that's the  longest losing streak for that tech-heavy comp in about two months' time.</p><p> Even Asia overnight, you can see how markets reacted there.  You can see  Hong Kong's Hang Seng down by more than 1 percent.  And, then, of course,  even on our own bond market, right, there was this flight to safety in U.S.  10-year.  Investors typically, of course, buy these bonds when they're  fearful or they feel less certain of the future.  </p><p> And prices really went up, so, therefore, those yields went down, settling  2.875 percent.  And just worth noting, these yields have fallen basically  for the past four out of five weeks.  </p><p> So, Neil, what is clear is, investors really don't know what to make of it.   We have the tariffs and now we have this idea of blocking direct  investment, which is a much more muscular and, quite frankly, threatening  move than tariffs, which really only apply to very specific products, Neil.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Absolutely, especially when they go back and forth either way.</p><p> BOLTON:  Yes.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Thank you very, very much, Deirdre Bolton.</p><p> BOLTON:  Sure.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Doesn't Harley-Davidson know that?  Not so much on the tariffs  we're considering, but the response that company is getting and opting to  do something that the president probably didn't envision.  </p><p>FOX Business Network's Jeff Flock in Countryside, Illinois.  </p><p> What did they do?  </p><p> JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  They're getting a double  whammy at Harley-Davidson, Neil, because the steel and aluminum tariffs hit  their raw materials costs.</p><p> And now the European Union, of course, imposing an addition 25 percent  tariff on motorcycles made here and shipped to Europe.</p><p> And so Harley is in a tough spot.  That tariff went from 6 percent to 31  percent.  And today, in a regulatory filing, Harley said that is going to  add more than $2,000 a bike to the cost of a motorcycle made here in the  U.S. and sold in Europe.  And they can't possibly pass that along to  consumers.</p><p> So, in the short-term, they're going to have to eat it.  In the long term,  they're going to move production away from the U.S.  Europe was an  expanding market for Harley-Davidson.  They love it over there.  And U.S.  sales have been down.</p><p> You look at the first quarter of this year, U.S. sales of Harleys down  double digits, as guys like me get older and maybe give up their  motorcycles.  In Europe, it had been growing by about 7 percent.  </p><p> And so those bikes, made in the U.S. and shipped to Europe, will be no  more.  Harley has four plants here in the U.S., York, Pennsylvania, Kansas  City, Missouri, and two in their home state of Wisconsin, and now  apparently bikes destined for Europe will not be made there anymore.</p><p> Instead, they will be made in places like Brazil and elsewhere, Thailand  and Australia.  This is not, as you pointed out at the outset, what the  president had intended.  His trade policies designed to keep and create  jobs here in the U.S.  In this case, it appears they will be eliminating  them -- Neil.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Amazing.</p><p> All right, Jeff Flock, thank you very, very much.  </p><p> All right, Mattie Duppler is.  We have got Charles Payne here, Larry Shover  here as well of SFG, alternate CME trader as well.  </p><p> Charles Payne, what is going on here?  We knew the trade thing was getting  antsy, but it seemed like the bottom fell out.  </p><p> CHARLES PAYNE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  It did, but because I think this had  a little bit of a different twist.</p><p> This was investment.  This is about -- the whole thing, by the way, is  centered on made in China 2025.  The administration, which I wish they  would articulate what they're trying to do, because I understand, and I  think most -- a lot of people do -- and it's the idea of curbing this  ambition, the stated ambition by China to sort of be the world's tech  leader in a short period of time.</p><p> And one way to get there, perhaps the only way they can get their with  their own timeline, is to continue to steal our intellectual property.</p><p> So the idea is to restrict investments from companies where China has a 25  percent or more ownership.  And, again, this was just speculation.  It was  in a few media outlets, the White House trying to take -- take it back a  little bit.  It's something obviously that they have toyed around with.</p><p> Peter Navarro has talked about this kind of thing for maybe two decades, so  this is not necessarily news, per se.  But it is -- it is a different  twist, to your point.  It's not -- it's not the trade stuff anymore, as  much as it is, hey, we want to take direct aim at your ambitions to usurp  America's perch as the world's tech leader.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, Larry, what worried a lot in the markets is that, all of a  sudden, then we were putting a general wall up on Chinese investment in  general and technology period.  </p><p> That's how it was interpreted.  And then, later on, the treasury secretary,  Mnuchin, came out to say, no, no, no, it wasn't singling out China, as if  to say there's other players here, as if that eased the angst.  </p><p> It actually compounded that.  But what do you make of that?  </p><p> LARRY SHOVER, SOLUTIONS FUNDS GROUP:  Well, what I make of it is that two  things.</p><p> The whole thing lacked clarity.  Like, it didn't matter.  Like, this whole  China tweets and tirades, it didn't matter because it lacked clarity.  It  seemed like the White House is utterly unprepared to create any kind of  proposal that can go into law.</p><p> Immigration policy is a good proof of that.  Also, it lacks credibility,  because we all know -- I mean, this does -- this hurts us more than it  hurts them, the fact that it's going to kill Apple or Nike.  It really,  really hurt them manufacturing their goods there that are sent to us.</p><p> So it doesn't make any sense.  People dismissed it.  And I really think  people are definitely blaming the China trade today.  The bigger problem,  though, it's really tech.  We saw that breaking down last week.</p><p> Leadership has been very thin in the stock market.  Without five or six  super cap techs in the S&amp;P 500...</p><p> CAVUTO:  Yes.  </p><p> SHOVER:  ... we would be down 4 percent, instead of up 1.5 percent.</p><p> But it started to crack.  The Supreme Court came out last week with a  ruling on sales tax, et cetera.  That chasm between growth and value has  been very, very wide.  The market is vulnerable.  The ball will always find  you when you're out of position.</p><p> And that's really what happened today.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  And people were a little anxious on that investment angle here and  maybe finding an excuse for technology, which ran up far and fast, to sell  off some of it.</p><p> But, Mattie, it's sort of this impression that not everyone in the  administration seems to be on the same page.  I'm getting different vibes  from the Treasury secretary, different vibes from their trade  representatives, different vibes from the president.</p><p> MATTIE DUPPLER, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S FORUM:  Right.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  And I think that's the kind of thing that scares markets.  </p><p> DUPPLER:  Oh, absolutely.</p><p> You finally have consensus on this panel, Neil.  And that's, what the heck  is the administration intending to do with these trade efforts?</p><p> Charles and I don't always agree on this issue, but right now we're both  wondering, what is the objective here?  And that's what the administration  needs to clarify.  It needs to make clear what it intends to do with all of  these efforts towards China.</p><p> Now, if the objective here is to exact the most amount of pain and pressure  on China possible, they need to make sure that they're not injecting pain  on American businesses.  And that's a concern, especially when you look at  really artificially diminishing the amount of capital that can come into  this country.</p><p> I worry about the impact on businesses.  And that's not even getting to  what tariffs are doing to American businesses, where we have already seen  some of those announcements this week.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Or even the threat of them.</p><p> But, Charles, the other thing you mentioned -- and this -- you can help me  out here.  It's always been that the Chinese are in bad shape here.   They're at two-year-plus lows in their market.  They have a lot more to  lose than we do.</p><p> But they also have their pride, and they're not giving any ground.  So, how  is this resolved, if it is?</p><p> PAYNE:  And this is where I disagree with Larry.  </p><p> I don't think -- I think a lot of people are raising the white flag so  quickly that China is going to beat us at this.  They're not.  If it has to  go the whole way... </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  The whole way could be years.  </p><p> PAYNE:  Yes, Sure.</p><p> Mattie makes the right point.  It's sort of like when my pops used to take  me out in the back.  He says, it's going to hurt me as much as it hurts  you.  </p><p> No, it won't.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> PAYNE:  With that being said, let's look at what China did today, this  morning.  </p><p> Their central bank freed up banks over there to the tune of $100 billion.   Right?  This is to sort of...</p><p> CAVUTO:  It needs a stimulant.</p><p> PAYNE:  ... to do things thing on debt.  </p><p> Last week, it was $30 billion.  A week before that, it was $30 billion.   Their foreign and reserve currencies have dropped a trillion dollars.  </p><p> Their debt-to-GDP ratio is on its way to 300 percent.  We aren't going to  lose this.  China knows we're not going to lose this.  Nobody wants to  lose.  It's a matter of how, to your point, do you save face and resolve  it?</p><p> CAVUTO:  I think that's where we are.  </p><p> Larry, the Chinese, remember, today indicating, you know, we don't just  turn a cheek on this.  And we come back and we're going to fight back.  </p><p> Now, to be clear, no response to the tariffs yet with tariffs of their own.   In other words, to increase the amount to match the United States, when we  promised we would put $200 billion on top of that.</p><p> Some read into that a sign that the Chinese are trying to find a middle  ground here, where they can talk tough, but they don't have to respond in  kind and invite a war.  What do you see?  </p><p> SHOVER:  Yes.</p><p> Well, I see that they have already done that, just what we said.  Required  reserve ratio dropped 50 basis points yesterday, adding all that liquidity  into the market.  What did that do?  That dropped RMB by 1.5 percent in  five days, 3.5 percent over the last month.  </p><p> So they're already ready.  That is going to negate any kind of trade tariff  that we are going to impose.  And I think they know, at the end of the day,  that there's so lack of clarity coming out of the White House, that they're  just preparing for it.  </p><p> Also realizing that they have had a real soft patch of data coming in.  So,  perhaps Trump is trying to hit them while they're weak.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  We will see.</p><p> All right, guys, I apologize jumping on you.  We have got a lot of breaking  news here.  </p><p> I do want to bring in my next guest, the former Heinz CEO Bill Johnson, a  global read of things, if ever there were one.  </p><p> And, Bill, I'm looking at this and wondering what the signals could be for  us.  If a company, one after the other, like GM considering making all its  Blazers now in Mexico, and, of course, we have been talking about a number  of other companies that have been doing the same or considering preemptive  move like Harley-Davidson, that has got to have a domestic economic impact.</p><p> BILL JOHNSON, FORMER CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, H.J. HEINZ COMPANY:  It should, Neil.  </p><p> Nothing has happened yet to impact the economy here.  And, frankly, the  Chinese and European economies...</p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, they're already leaving.  Those guys are already making some  moves.  </p><p> JOHNSON:  I understand.  But they're more vulnerable than we are.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  True.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Having said that, this is like tic-tac-toe.  Nobody wins.  </p><p> I play tic-tac-toe with any grandkids.  And you never win.  And that's what  this is now.  We have gotten to the point on this situation...</p><p> CAVUTO:  You never won at tic-tac-toe with your grandkids?  </p><p> JOHNSON:  No.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  You're one of the most celebrated CEOs ever.  And... </p><p> JOHNSON:  Yes.  That just shows you nobody wins, Neil.  And that's where we  are right now.  Nobody wins.</p><p> CAVUTO:  So, that's where you see -- that's where we are right now?</p><p> JOHNSON:  I do think that's where we are.</p><p> I think this created a huge environment of uncertainty.  You and I have had  this conversation many times.  Uncertainty leads to volatility.  Volatility  leads to more uncertainty.  And we get in this vicious cycle.  </p><p> And I think that's where we are now.  Having said that, I think,  ultimately, saner and cooler heads will prevail, and this will somehow get  resolved.  </p><p> I hope this is not a negotiation ploy, because it's rather ham-fisted.  And  there has got to be better ways to attack this issue than the one that is  being generated right now.</p><p> CAVUTO:  What do you make -- I think it was ratcheted up a little bit today  to go after in this case the Chinese for investing in technology.</p><p> It was read as, we're not going to allow them to invest in any technology  companies.  And that might have been a prematurely wrong impression.  But  that was the one that was out there for hours in the markets.  They had to  dial that back a little bit.</p><p> But they're still looking at putting a limit to who can invest in  technology.  That's how it interpreted, hence, technology falls off a lot.   So if this is more from just goods and services to, I don't know, even  companies and stocks you invest in, then what?  </p><p> JOHNSON:  Well, then I think we have chaos, Neil. </p><p> I don't think you can stop the investment in a capitalist society.  It's  just the way the system works.  And while I understand why the  administration is going after some of these issues -- and they're sort of  going where people have been afraid to tread before -- the reality is, we  have to have some clarity in the communication of the purpose of what we're  trying to achieve and then take a step-by-step process in which to achieve  it.  </p><p> And I heard about the investment situation this morning.  Then I saw  Secretary Mnuchin's response.  And so I'm completely unclear as to what is  happening.  And there we go again.  That creates more uncertainty, which  creates more volatility, and leaves us all in the dark about what it is  we're trying to achieve.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Now, there used to be an old rule here following this president  the last 18 months that those who doubted him would be proven wrong, and  that everything ends up OK and markets come back from what look like  debacles, and people who second-guessed him have been proven wrong.  </p><p> So there was this now new -- or renewed trust that President Trump must  know what he's doing, there's a method to all of this.  </p><p> Do you subscribe to that, or is there now a reassessment, well, maybe not.   Maybe this is a little impulsive.  Maybe there's not a method to the  madness.  Maybe it's just madness.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Well, I think, historically, over his last 18 months in office,  he's done a pretty good job of bringing us back from the brink and  achieving great success.  </p><p>North Korea seems to be an example of one of those areas.  But I don't  know.  I don't like this whole approach, Neil.  I think it's so ham-fisted  and so unpredictable that sometimes you create a fire out of a smoke bomb,  and the next thing you know, you have got a real conflagration going, and  you don't know how to put it out.  And that -- I'm worried we're headed  that way.</p><p> Having said that, I will give him credit for again treading in these places  that need to be addressed.  I just think there's better ways to do it.  But  I'm not yet ready to say that we're just going to pull this one back from  the brink and everyone is going to be happy.  </p><p> I just don't know.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  We shall see, my friend.  Thank you very, very much.  </p><p> Good luck in your next tic-tac-toe game.  I give the edge to you still.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> JOHNSON:  Thank you.  Thank you.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  William Johnson, the former Heinz CEO, if anyone knows the global  landscape, it is he.  All right. </p><p> All right, when we come back here, this nastiness with Democrats saying  that we're going to get nasty no matter where Republicans gather.  </p><p> Really?  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Yikes, 25 minutes, right, a 5:00 p.m. deadline staring down now,  as House Republicans want documents from the Justice Department on that  Clinton e-mail probe and the Russian investigation.  Then what happens if  they don't get them?  </p><p> After this.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. MAXINE WATERS (D), CALIFORNIA:  And if you see anybody from that  Cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you  get out and you create a crowd.  </p><p> (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)</p><p> WATERS:  And you push back on them.  And you tell them they're not welcome.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, anyway, American Majority CEO Ned Ryun.  We have got Olympic  Media managing editor Katie Frates and Democratic strategist Christy  Setzer.</p><p> I don't know where to begin.  But, Katie, maybe you can help me with this.  </p><p> This is out of control.  This is just crazy talk.  What do you make of it?  </p><p> KATIE FRATES, OLYMPIC MEDIA:  It absolutely is.  </p><p> This is just going way too far, because she doesn't even know who she is  speaking to, Maxine Waters, when she is saying this.  What if someone sees  somebody at a gas station and takes it way too far?  </p><p> You're essentially encouraging anyone of any mental state, of any level of  discourse, to go up and potentially harm someone else because of their  political beliefs.  That's absolutely not OK.  </p><p> I'm so excited and happy to see at least Nancy Pelosi push back on this.   I'm not sure why more Democratic leaders are not speaking up and condemning  this.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, there were a good number.  To be fair, there were a good  number, Elijah Cummings and all saying...</p><p> FRATES:  Good.  Good.</p><p> CAVUTO:  ... that, even when it came to the Sanders situation, she  shouldn't have been taken out of the restaurant.  </p><p> But, Ned, I'm worried more about the increasing vitriol.  And we're seeing  more and more of it.  And anything could happen in that environment.</p><p> NED RYUN, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN MAJORITY:  No.</p><p> And I think really what we're seeing is, to sum up Charles Krauthammer, we  conservatives, we think the left is philosophically misguided, and many on  the left think we're evil.  </p><p> And I think you're seeing this rhetoric ramp up where borders are now  bigotry and American presidents standing up for the America taxpayer, well,  this is Nazism and the second coming of the Holocaust.  </p><p> And I think what the left is trying to do is say, the debate is over in our  minds because we consider your ideas to be irrational.  We don't consider  your ideas to be legitimate.  </p><p> And if they can dehumanize the other side, that's what they want to do,  because that justifies driving opposing thought from the public square.  </p><p> The thing that troubles me, Neil, about all of this, this kind of  incitement to physical intimidation and bullying is not to be normalized.   It's not normal for a constitutional republic.  It's only normal in banana  republics.  And if the left wants to beat us, try doing it at the ballot  box in 2018 and 2020.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Do you worry about that, Christy?  </p><p> As a Democratic strategist, and a darn good one, and a very calm person, I  might point out, that your party could be ruining it for itself, that it's  actually scaring some people with that kind of talk, whether you agree or  disagree with the politics behind it.  </p><p> CHRISTY SETZER, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  I just think it's impossible to put  Maxine Waters' comments like this in a vacuum like this.</p><p> The defining feature of Donald Trump's campaign was not that he was going  to shake stuff up in Washington or that he was a great businessman.  It was  this incivility.  Right?  </p><p> He started talking about how, I like people that were not captured about  John McCain.  Then you looked as his rallies, where they were filled with  him actively asking them to take violence against protesters.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  If that is what your view is, do you think that the response,  responding in kind, then, if that's your view, is justified?</p><p> SETZER:  I don't think that -- no, I don't think that we have responded in  kind.  </p><p> I think that Democrats are saying, look, we need to make it just a little  bit uncomfortable.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  You have got whole groups that target a homeland security  secretary at a restaurant.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> SETZER:  No, no, no, no.  Not with violence, Neil.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> SETZER:  That's an extraordinarily important difference.  Not with  violence.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Please listen to me.  </p><p> Sarah Sanders, her incident, Secretary Nielsen outside her home and in a  restaurant, then Maxine Waters justifying it.  I could go on to talk about  Florida's Pam Bondi and what she dealt with at a movie.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> CAVUTO:  Stephen Miller and be called a fascist while he's out.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> SETZER:  Protest is a healthy part of the American tradition, not violence,  not violence.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  You're fine with this.  You're fine with it.  </p><p> But if it were done in reverse, you wouldn't be fine with it.</p><p> SETZER:  I would be absolutely fine with it.  I would be fine with it,  because, again, protest is absolutely fine.</p><p> What is not fine...</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  You just said when you didn't like it what Donald Trump and his  people were doing the same.  </p><p> SETZER:  I'm sorry?</p><p> CAVUTO:  You didn't like it when Donald Trump was doing that.</p><p> SETZER:  No.  What Donald Trump was saying was, I want that guy to be taken  out on a stretcher.  What Donald Trump was doing was actually what Ned Ryun  was just talking about right now, which is dehumanizing the other side.</p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, I don't get it.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  All right.  OK.</p><p> Mattie, do you believe that this is going too far?  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> SETZER:  By talking about how they're animals and infesting America.</p><p> CAVUTO:  I understand.  I heard you.</p><p> SETZER:  That's very different.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Mattie, has this gone too far?  Mattie, you're in awe, aren't you?  </p><p> FRATES:  Yes, yes.  Absolutely, it is.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Katie, I apologize.  I apologize.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  See that?  I lose my place, because I get so wrapped up in it.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Is it your sense that this gets worse, though?  Are you getting a  sense it gets worse?</p><p> FRATES:  So, this is the problem.  </p><p> It's that this is escalating rhetoric.  You're essentially saying mob  someone outside of a gas station.  </p><p> RYUN:  Exactly.  </p><p> FRATES:  And, again, you don't know the intentions of the person who may  then go on to do that.  </p><p> So what if someone is attacked?  What if something violent happens?  And  then you turn around and you say, well, Maxine Waters was telling people to  do that.  It's not a good idea and it's not a healthy dialogue.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> SETZER:  Do we remember the Pizzagate conspiracy, how a crazy conspiracy  actually led someone to take a gun to my, my local pizza place, actually,  and try to shoot it up because they had heard this crazy idea on the  Internet and by Alex Jones and others that Hillary Clinton and John Podesta  were up to no good?  </p><p> That led to actual violence.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, I don't want to get in a tit for tat.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  I sometimes feel like I'm separating my teenage sons.  </p><p> But, Ned Ryun, I do know this.  We have all got to bring the octane down a  little bit on all sides here.  </p><p> RYUN:  We do.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  But how do we do that?  </p><p> And should it be incumbent people to just to say, there has got to be a  better way?  Whether the Elijah Cummings approach, this has got to stop,  whether Sarah Sanders' approach, I just politely up and left, and I tried  not to make a big deal of it at the scene, what is it?  What is the answer?</p><p> RYUN:  No.  I think we have got to start policing our own.  We have to  start policing ourselves on the right and the left.  </p><p> And I was encouraged by Nancy Pelosi saying that Maxine Waters' statement  was unacceptable.  I think we have to be honest about it on the right, too,  when we see unacceptable statements.  And I have said this again -- I have  said this before.  I will say it again.  </p><p> When Donald Trump -- I love 85 to 90 percent of his Twitter feed.  When he  is talking about bloody face-lift, you will never me defend that.  I want  him to focus on the positives and policy and all these things.</p><p> When it becomes personal, I think we need to call out our side and say,  this is not how we have more civil discourse in the public arena.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Fully agree.  Fully agree.  </p><p> At our core, guys, we're all human beings.  </p><p> RYUN:  We're all Americans.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  And we can agree to disagree.  But we don't have to be asses in  the process.  </p><p> And none of you are, by the way.  </p><p> But I want to thank you all very, very much.</p><p> And, Katie, I apologize.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> FRATES:  No, no apology needed.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  I get so apoplectic.  And I don't even know why.  And it's not  even dinnertime.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, by the way, we're close to the witching hour, 5:00 p.m.  Eastern time, that document deadline.  But right now there's indications  the people who have put out that deadline aren't going to get the response  they want in time for that deadline.  </p><p> Then what?  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right.  Between a deadline coming up in about 15 minutes from  now and, of course, this is the week we're going to see some big testimony  up on Capitol Hill, much of it is behind closed doors.</p><p> Let's get the read from former Justice Department official Tom Dupree.  </p><p> Tom, what is the biggest thing you're waiting for?  </p><p> TOM DUPREE, FORMER JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:  Well, the biggest thing  I'm waiting for in the short-term is whether the Justice Department  complies with the congressional demands.  </p><p> As you point out, the clock is ticking.  They have a document deadline,  production deadline at 5:00 p.m. this afternoon.  We will see if they turn  over what they're expected to turn over.  My guess is that they are not  going to satisfy the demands of the House Republicans.</p><p> And I think we are going to see this dispute continue to escalate in the  days ahead.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, then they would want to take even aggressive action  against Rod Rosenstein.  Right?  What would it be?  </p><p> DUPREE:  Well, let's see.</p><p> They have got a wide variety of means at their disposal.  At one end of the  spectrum is just the continued drumbeat of public criticism.  They can amp  that up several ways.</p><p> One thing they could do is, they could issue subpoenas.  Another thing they  could do is, they could actually instigate contempt proceedings.  And then  at the extreme end of the other spectrum, it would be impeachment  proceedings.</p><p> I'm hopeful that they're not going to go there and that cooler heads will  prevail and they be able to sit down and work all of this out before we get  to that point.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Where is all of this going?  </p><p> I mean, especially with the Peter Strzok testimony later on, are they more  interested in his case, finding out what he knew and what was the backdrop  for his comments he was making about then candidate Trump, or what?  </p><p> DUPREE:  Yes.  I think that's a lot of what was going on.</p><p> I mean, I think right now, from the perspective of Congress, there was so  much that was going on behind the scenes in 2016 that Congress wants to  know, what was your reason for doing this?  What was your reason for  handling the investigations the way you did? What was the reason for  getting these wiretaps and for conducting the surveillance?</p><p> Were you using an informant?  Was it a spy, that sort of thing?  And the  fact is, DOJ is not in the business normally of turning over documents.   And so I think, institutionally, there's a huge amount of reluctance to  give Congress what it wants.</p><p> But Congress is beating the drum.  They're on the warpath.  They're trying  to fulfill their oversight function here.  And so I think we have a real  collision that's not in any -- is not going to be sorted out in the near  term.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  When I have looked at a lot of the comments from those identified,  like Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, and these other unidentified individuals,  and then, of course, now I know how James Comey felt about then candidate  Trump and how Andy McCabe felt, his number two.</p><p> I have not run across one piece of evidence to show a pro-Trump person or  someone who was biased to like -- to like Donald Trump.  Now, I might have  missed it.  But, again, doesn't this feed the narrative that that was a  stacked deck, because that certainly that stacked deck mantle has been  claimed by a lot of Republicans that they were out to get him?</p><p> DUPREE:  Yes, I certainly haven't seen anything along the lines of what  you're talking about, Neil.</p><p> It all does seem to be one way.  I guess what's surprising and frankly  disappointing to me is that some of these folks, Strzok in particular, and  Page, that even though they were nominally professionals, that they just  weren't able to put aside their political biases.</p><p> Look, the fact is, is that pretty much everyone in the country harbors  inner thoughts, their own political leanings.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Right. </p><p> DUPREE:  But I think, for most people, and certainly for the vast majority  of people in the FBI historically, they been able to put these biases aside  when it comes to the sacred function of law enforcement.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  But did you share whatever opinion -- we all have opinions.  You  would be vanilla if you didn't.</p><p> But did you -- these were aggressively shared and aggressive opinions at  that.  When you were there, was that -- did you kind of know what your  colleagues felt, whether they were investigating someone or not?  </p><p> DUPREE:  No, not in this way.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Yes.  </p><p> DUPREE:  I think what is unusual about this, Neil, is that these were  political comments they were discussing in the context of an ongoing  political investigation.</p><p> It's not as though they were investigating some bank robber and trading  texts about the presidential election.  I mean, not saying that would be  OK, but that would be very different.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Right. </p><p> DUPREE:  What they were doing here is, they were carrying out  investigations involving the very candidates who were running at the same  time they're engaged in this correspondence about how they can advance  their own political views through their official duties.</p><p> That is where it crossed a line.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Yes.  </p><p> You would just love to get the context for these remarks.  What was going  on?  If it's just hatred, I don't know if that is even better or worse.  </p><p> Tom, good seeing you again, my friend.  Thank you.  </p><p> DUPREE:  Likewise.  Thank you, Neil.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p> How about just eliminating ICE?  </p><p> With all this controversy about separating kids from their parents at the  border, and then now trying to reconnect them with their parents, sometimes  far from the border, maybe just get rid of ICE.  Some people are actually  urging that -- after this.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, groups in protests all around wanting to get rid of  ICE.  </p><p> That's right.  After the separation of these kids from their parents, a lot  of folks saying, you know, the problem isn't these coming into our country.   It's the folks who are trying to keep them out and the way they go about  their business.  So, they're actually saying, get rid of ICE.  Put ICE on  ice, if you will.</p><p> Former ICE agent Claude Arnold on that.</p><p> What do you think of that?  </p><p> CLAUDE ARNOLD, FORMER ICE SPECIAL AGENT:  Well, I -- first of all, people  don't understand the breadth of ICE's mission.  </p><p> Immigration enforcement is half of the mission.  It has an entire  component, homeland security investigations, that investigates all crime  related to the border.  </p><p> It's the investigative arm for all of DHS.  It's the second largest  investigative entity in the U.S. government and it investigates a lot of  things, drug smuggling, human trafficking and smuggling, child pornography,  export of illegal technologies.</p><p> It has a huge national security responsibility.  It's the second largest  representation on the Federal Joint Terrorism Task Force after the FBI.  </p><p> So to say you just need to get rid of ICE, I think people don't understand  all that ICE does.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, a lot of them were saying, right after these apprehensions,  well, does it change and does their mission statement change given on the  administration?  It was this administration that, led by Jeff Sessions,  said, we're going to enforce a policy where we can, yes, separate kids from  their parents, something that wasn't done, at least not the same way  exactly, in the Obama administration.  </p><p> So do you have to pivot depending on the administration?  </p><p> ARNOLD:  Well, I think there was a pivot done on how enforcement was  conducted during the Obama administration.  </p><p> And, really, it's just been a return to the status quo.  But people have  been -- they have developed a sense of entitlement that you can just come  to the country illegally and expecting it's OK. </p><p> CAVUTO:  Oh, no, you're quite right.  People forget how we were  apprehending underage kids and then who were -- drugs deals and all.   You're quite right about that.</p><p> ARNOLD:  Right.  Right.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  But who calls that?  Do you answer then to whatever the  presidential directive is or what?</p><p> ARNOLD:  Yes, of course.  You're part of the executive branch.  </p><p> ICE does what the president tells them to do through the executive chain of  command.  I mean, it's the executive branch.</p><p> CAVUTO:  So, if there were no ICE, to these people's interests, the  protesters, who would handle this border stuff?  </p><p> ARNOLD:  Well, here's the important thing here, Neil.  </p><p> What is going on is, the same people who want ICE abolished, they opposed  there being any wall on the border.  They oppose changing the loopholes  that encourage and allow people to stay in the U.S. illegally.  </p><p> So, the last stand against those who make it in here illegally is ICE.  So  if you get rid of ICE, then you completely have open borders and no  immigration enforcement.  And that's by design.  They want that to happen.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Amazing.  </p><p> All right, Claude Arnold, thank you very much, former ICE agent.  He's put  himself in a lot of harm's way over the years just to deal with that.  </p><p> People should remember that, no matter what your feelings on this  particular issue.  </p><p> We will have more after this.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Thirty seconds away from that deadline.  What is Rod Rosenstein  going to do?  Is he going to give the Republicans what they want?</p><p> Tomorrow, we will get the read on all of this from Republican House  Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte.  He also was one of the fellows  who came up with a plan to settle this immigration mess.  His measure went  nowhere, but that doesn't mean that immigration progress couldn't still  come up somewhere.  </p><p> A one-on-one with probably one of the more powerful players on Capitol Hill  tomorrow, Bob Goodlatte.</p><p> We will see you then.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Illegal immigration is not only condoned but encouraged by the radical left and the rino right. The global elites of this country's establishment don't want you to know how many illegal immigrants enter the country.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">They don't want you to know how many illegal immigrants are in the country. And those elites don't want you to know the cost that illegal immigrants bring to the nation and the economy and the number of crimes illegal immigrants commit.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A shocking new report from three customs and border protection whistle- blowers on the agency's failure to comply with the federal law mandating DNA collection by criminal illegal immigrants, within hours of our reporting on that story last night.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Department of Homeland Security announced it will be following the law and actively begin collecting DNA and provide that information to the FBI and a cross-check against violent crimes on record.</p><p>Chief Intelligence Correspondent, Catherine Herridge has the report.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CATHERINE HERRIDGE, CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT: Lou, after your show last night, Fox News received this statement from a homeland security official confirming that they would now comply with the law and provide samples from illegal immigrants to the FBI's violent crimes database.</p><p>Quote, \"Under the direction of the Acting Secretary, McAleenan, DHS is working closely with the Department of Justice on a path forward for DNA collection, for the combined DNA index system known as CODIS.\"</p><p>This is a major development after Fox News first profiled the three border agency whistleblowers, who brought the case against homeland security.</p><p>And a government watchdog sided with the whistle-blowers telling the president that customs and border protection violated the law for nearly a decade and compromised public safety.</p><p>That letter to the president reads in part, quote, \"The agency's noncompliance with the law has allowed subjects subsequently accused of violent crimes including homicide and sexual assaults to elude detection even when detained multiple times by CBP, or immigration and customs enforcement.</p><p>This is an unacceptable dereliction of the agency's law enforcement mandate.\" The program was put on hold under the Obama administration citing resource issues.</p><p>The goal was to identify and then remove or prosecute illegal migrants whose DNA matched open cases, from sexual assault to even murder.</p><p>But special counsel investigators found the waiver was never meant to be permanent speaking to Fox before today's announcement, the whistleblowers wearing that past effort to implement the DNA program were set up to fail</p><p>MARK JONES, WHISTLEBLOWER ON DNA PROGRAM FAILURE: The folks in that conference call said, we'll pick places we can make it fail or we'll find a 79-year-old woman and we'll have the press taking her DNA so we can garner public outrage.</p><p>That was what spurred us to reach out to the office of special counsel.</p><p>HERRIDGE: Fox News will continue to report on this story to check whether homeland security makes meaningful changes, Lou.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: Catherine, thank you. We appreciate it. As always Catherine Herridge. A new report from the Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Statistics highlights the rise of crimes by non-US citizens in this country.</p><p>The report shows in 2018, 64 percent of all federal arrests were of non-US citizens. More than 40 percent of all suspects prosecuted in the federal courts were non-US citizens.</p><p>Even though those non-US citizens make up only 7 percent of our population. Over the past two decades, federal arrests of non-US citizens has more than tripled, up 234 percent.</p><p>And over that same two decade period, federal arrests of U.S. citizens rose only 10 percent. And just last year, there were more than 78,000 federal arrests of Mexican citizens in that number, exceeding the number of federal arrests of U.S. citizens by 10 percent.</p><p>North Carolina's Governor and Radical Dem, Roy Cooper vetoed a bill requiring state sheriffs to cooperate with federal immigrations and customs enforcement.</p><p>Cooper said this, in vetoing the bill, \"This legislation is simply about scoring partisan political points and using fear to divide North Carolina.</p><p>This bill in addition to being unconstitutional weakens law enforcement in North Carolina by mandating sheriffs to do the job of federal agents.</p><p>Well joining us tonight to take up all of these issues and more, Acting Customs and Border Protection CBP Commissioner, Mark Morgan. Mark, good to have you with us.</p><p>And let's -- let's start with the DNA match with violent crimes, records of the FBI. Those whistleblowers are basically indicting President Obama and his administration for purposely violating U.S. law.</p><p>MARK MORGAN, ACTING CBP COMMISSIONER: So Lou, what I can say, obviously I wasn't there at the time, but there was a waiver that was granted. But I agree, the waiver was never meant to be permanent, and now is the time.</p><p>We need to take a look at this, and we need to make meaningful changes to address the issues that you just talked about. And I can tell you, just a couple of hours ago, I had a team of leaders within CBP, and we are talking about what are the next steps we need to do to take a look at this and actually make meaningful changes to start doing DNA testing where it makes sense, and I guarantee you, we will.</p><p>DOBBS: You said where it makes sense and that you will do it. There hasn't been a decision to do it?</p><p>MORGAN: So the decision has been made, Lou, that yes, we are going to move forward --</p><p>DOBBS: Who made that decision?</p><p>MORGAN: So collectively, the White House, make no mistake, when the White House became aware of this, they got all the agencies together that needed to be here and said hey, look, we got to take a look at this, we need to do better at this.</p><p>Let's get a team together, let's get a plan together to make meaningful changes to address this and start doing this where it makes sense.</p><p>DOBBS: It's troubling to me that a department -- Department of Homeland Security has been in violation of law for nearly a decade. And that there is some conference that has to be held about whether or not to comport with federal law?</p><p>MORGAN: No, Lou, that's not what I'm saying. And listen --</p><p>DOBBS: Well, I'm trying to understand.</p><p>MORGAN: Yeah, so absolutely. So we need to make clear that you could disagree maybe with the waiver, but according to the law, the secretary actually had authority to waive compliance, and that was done under the Obama administration.</p><p>I think what is correct to say is that was really never meant to be permanent, and it should have been reviewed sooner. What I'm saying now is we are getting together, not to make the decision whether we should do it we're getting together now to come up with a strategy to implement meaningful changes and start applying DNA testing where it makes sense.</p><p>DOBBS: Is there someplace that it doesn't make sense? That's what -- I'm really desperately trying to understand this. It's a law. It makes sense on its face, that you do not want serious criminals who could be discovered through a DNA test escaping apprehension.</p><p>MORGAN: And I think that's exactly where it makes sense Lou, and that's exactly we're going to take a look at. And from my position, I'm telling you Lou, I'm telling American people, we need to do just that in those situations you just described.</p><p>DOBBS: Okay. Let's move on. These numbers we just look at from the Bureau of Justice Statistics showing the number of arrests of non-US citizens, and that means that our federal government is again obfuscating even as it reveals these shocking numbers.</p><p>But they've conflated illegal immigrants and legal immigrants in those statistics. We can infer, we can speculate, we can guess, but the reality is we have a serious, serious problem here, and it's been hidden from the eyes of the American people for two decades, in large measure.</p><p>MORGAN: Lou, that's exactly right. And I'm so glad that you're bringing this topic up and you route off all those statistics. Because this addresses one of the false narratives that's been out there for a long time.</p><p>This president, this administration, myself, and a whole lot of other experts at this have been saying for a very long time, this is a crisis, both a humanitarian crisis and a national security crisis.</p><p>And those statistics that came out from the Bureau of Justice that you've just articulated tonight shows that, proves that. This is not just a humanitarian crisis. We have a national security crisis, and those statistics prove that.</p><p>DOBBS: You know, it's stunning to me.</p><p>MORGAN: It is.</p><p>DOBBS: The president of the United States declares a national emergency, and here we are in August. We did so in February, as I recall, I believe the 15th of February.</p><p>And here we are at the end of August, and still there's a sense that I get from our federal government, I'm talking about the permanent bureaucracy. I'm talking about the full expanse of Washington bureaucracy.</p><p>I don't know whether it's -- and I really don't. I don't know whether it's resistance on the part of deep state actors. I don't know if it's just simply an inability to manage a behemoth the size of these federal departments of this government. What are your thoughts?</p><p>MORGAN: So I can tell you, Lou, you and I've talked about this before. There are still areas that we can improve upon, absolutely. And we're trying to do that every single day, but we are making progress.</p><p>I'd tell you, and this is being driven by this president and this administration through multiple initiatives and in my opinion, it's being carried out by the men and women of CBP expertly.</p><p>I mean, right now the government of Mexico, we talked about this before, unprecedented, this president through his negotiations has gotten Mexico to the table to recognize this is a regional crisis and step up, as true partners like they have never before.</p><p>The migrant protection protocol, 36,000 individuals are now waiting in Mexico instead of being in our holding facilities, or being released in the United States. And we could go on with the new Flores regulation.</p><p>So we're making tremendous progress, some game changers, but we still have a lot of work to do, Lou, I agree with you.</p><p>DOBBS: All right. Mark, there's another thing that is in public view, and I realize that you're not responsible for it, but as part of DHS, why are we not seeing the arrests of the employers of illegal immigrants? What is the rationale for that in DHS?</p><p>So what I can tell you, was there for a short time and I know the director, Matt Albence. I'm telling you, Lou, he's absolutely committed to men and women.</p><p>They suffering a little bit, this is part of it. They're suffering a little bit like we all are. Like right now, I've got about 50 percent of the border patrol agents that pulled off the front line doing the law enforcement work to do daycare providing stuff that I referred to, you know, ordering baby formula, changing diapers, and etc.</p><p>That's the reality of this crisis. I have resources pulled away to handle humanitarian crisis. To some degree, ICE is suffering from the same issue because Congress has failed to do their job, and I know, Lou, I'm not expecting Congress to do their job, but that's the fact, and because of this crisis, you know, ICE is suffering the same thing.</p><p>A lot of their resources are pulled off handling the humanitarian issue that's affecting their interior enforcement.</p><p>DOBBS: There's not much more you can say on this matter when you say that because Congress isn't doing their job, with the tremendous resources of the federal government, with the innovative and original thinking of this president and his leadership, he has succeeded and the government has succeeded in ways they were totally unexpected.</p><p>It's a shame that we have an entire party that doesn't seem to be concerned about securing a border that is the domain of the deadliest cartels in all of the world.</p><p>And who are holding sway over illegal immigration, holding sway over the smuggling of tens of billions of dollars in deadly drugs as well as sex trafficking across that border.</p><p>That is a terrible, terrible shame. Mark Morgan, we thank you for all you're doing. We appreciate it and good talking with you.</p><p>MORGAN: Yes, Lou. Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS: Mark Morgan, the head of CBP. Illinois's Radical Dem Governor J.B. Pritzker signed a new law that will protect illegal immigrant tenants in the state.</p><p>The immigrant tenant protection act prevents landlords from evicting or reporting illegal immigrant tenants to authorities. If a landlord were to violate that new law, they would have to pay a civil penalty of up to $2,000.</p><p>Up next, the left wing national media's latest conspiracy theory, they call it a fact, but it's quite something really about this president.</p><p>It has nothing to do with policy and all to do with -- tonight we're going to be talking about the president's age and one, well CNN personality who has a difficult time handling the issue.</p><p>We'll take that up. Also more lunacy from the city of San Francisco, what would you expect? Wait until you hear what they want to call convicted criminals. Stay with us. We're coming right back.</p><p>DOBBS: The New York Times reporting a lack of excitement about Joe Biden from his supporters in Iowa. The article entitled \"Joe Biden's Poll Numbers Mask an Enthusiasm Gap.\" They had to find a gap and I guess that's where it is.</p><p>Featuring several Biden supporters that a pollster talked to, the pollster was Patrick Murray from the Monmouth University polling institute who said this quote, \"I did not meet one Biden voter who was in any way, shape, or form excited about voting for Biden.\"</p><p>Biden by the way is about -- what is it, about 10 points ahead in the worst poll. He's leading the pack by a considerable margin. At this point, he might say who needs excitement? I've got the numbers.</p><p>CNN's Chris Cuomo has outdone in the south. I think he may have outdone CNN himself. He has a new conspiracy theory about President Trump.</p><p>Cuomo claims that the president is not aging like other presidents. Oh my gosh, how could that be? Please listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS CUOMO, CNN ANCHOR: Look at presidents when they come in and when they leave. I mean, come on, look at Clinton's hair went white. George W. Bush looks like he got a beat down. Obama looks like his own grandfather.</p><p>I mean look at it, I mean this is a very hard job because of the stress that they carry with them. Now let's look at this president, it's been almost three years since Trump won the presidency, looks exactly the same.</p><p>His hair is like, you know, I don't know what's going on with that. But he may do things that presidents in the past haven't done to augment their physical reality, but it could also be that he doesn't care the way others have.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: He got to it, didn't he? Oh man, augment his physical reality. What's wrong with those people over there?</p><p>Joining me no, former Reagan White House political director, Fox Business political analyst, the savant, Ed Rollins. And Pulitzer Prize winning New York Post columnist, Fox Business contributor, Great American, Michael Goodwin. Gentlemen, good to have you with us.</p><p>ED ROLLINS, GREAT AMERICAN PAC CHAIRMAN: Thank you.</p><p>MICHAEL GOODWIN, NY POST COLUMNIST: Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS: Cuomo's got a point there.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DOBBS: He's managed to make a man's aging well a liability for him politically.</p><p>ROLLINS: Well, the premise that he's not doing what's right for the country is absurd. The president is a very confident man. The president has lived in an environment that's as tough as any environment in politics, in the business world, the gambling world.</p><p>He's used to making tough decisions and he makes tough decisions. He doesn't need much sleep. Every one of those people they put up on that map, didn't like making tough decisions.</p><p>DOBBS: They never really worked before I think is the problem for each of them.</p><p>ROLLINS: And then you get Biden who has had all the plastic surgery and the hair transplants and all the stuff that basically</p><p>DOBBS: Hey, hey, hey that's hot.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ROLLINS: -- redo his looks but the reality is Trump does the job every day, gets up and just goes and does it.</p><p>DOBBS: And you didn't get the Cuomo memo, what was it augmentation of physical -- you know, I mean, come on. This is amazing stuff even by Cuomo's standards, CNN's standards.</p><p>I just love the idea that they would find some sort evil, some negative in the fact that he doesn't age like, say Obama, which is interesting because he didn't have the reputation for working very hard.</p><p>He may have worried, but he may have been worrying about not working very hard.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>And Clinton, I mean, come on.</p><p>GOODWIN: Well, the idea that he doesn't care.</p><p>DOBBS: Beautiful.</p><p>GOODWIN: Yeah. I mean, that may be why he's not aging. I mean it's a non-secular to start with but it's just a ridiculous kind of argument to be making. And let's just say that Donald Trump --</p><p>DOBBS: But is that more ridiculous actually than the Russia collusion nonsense? The recession nonsense? I mean, the list goes and they have no problem, calling him a racist --</p><p>GOODWIN: Well, this is another one of these in the long line of trying to explode the Trump presidency. Now he doesn't care because he's not aging. Look at his hair, I mean we're back to the hair again.</p><p>DOBBS: Yeah.</p><p>ROLLINS: So this would be the slogan of the Democrats, vote against Trump because he hasn't aged or he doesn't look good.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ROLLINS: He doesn't care about the job.</p><p>DOBBS: I think the problem is that Cuomo thinks he looks very good, too good.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>And you do look at that list, it's amazing to me to think of the nonsense. AFL-CIO had Richard Trumka warning the Democrats that they shouldn't take the AFL-CIO's endorsement and support for granted. Do you think they should be worried?</p><p>ROLLINS: Well, the reality is I don't know but been around politics for 50 years I've never known them to endorse any Republican and my expectation is the members, wherever they go, it doesn't matter because the members are going to be overwhelmingly I think for Trump. He's done well among union workers because he's created jobs.</p><p>GOODWIN: Yeah, my suspicion is Trumka is basically, you know, saying to the members I hear you and trying to get the Democrats to focus on this issue of job creation, particularly among unionized manufacturing.</p><p>DOBBS: They are all socialists. Why do they have to worry about a job?</p><p>GOODWIN: And I've argued for a while now, you know, Biden's whole thing about he's middle class Joe and working class Joe is a bunch of hooey particularly when you look at the record of the Obama-Biden administration on manufacturing jobs, lost 200,000 of them.</p><p>Trump creates 500,000 manufacturing jobs. How do you go to Pennsylvania and say I'm on your side or any of those states when you're registration is not.</p><p>DOBBS: That's why the Democrats, you know hairs on fire, they've got nothing to run on. What are they going to run against? They have thrown everything in the world. They have invented every piece of nonsense, and much of it they've had reinforced the national, really all of it from the national left wing media and the voters say go away, this is silly and stupid and irrelevant.</p><p>ROLLINS: Don't forget the AFL-CIO has lost 700,000 members from 2002 to 2018. That's a pretty severe depletion of their leadership.</p><p>DOBBS: What do you make of the times, the enthusiasm gap that they've discovered about Joe Biden? It's like they had to try to find something to take down the leader of the 2020 hopefuls?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ROLLINS: In this case, I think they're accurate. There is no enthusiasm.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>And the reality is as I've said on this show many --</p><p>DOBBS: Mark this moment.</p><p>ROLLINS: I have never found Biden voter outside of his home state in Delaware. So I'm not surprised he's not creating enthusiasm. But I'll tell you this, if he doesn't have enthusiasm, he's not going to win the nomination.</p><p>DOBBS: Right.</p><p>GOODWIN: Well, I mean the electability issue is what he's selling as what his wife is selling. I mean to me, it's the sense of being inevitable. And we know how that worked out with Hilary Clinton.</p><p>Nobody is inevitable when it comes to this primary system. Democrats have said change the rules on delegates. It's going to be very difficult.</p><p>DOBBS: Very quickly, very quickly, you got Hickenlooper pulling out, You've got others pulling out. It's starting to look like this was just a charade. They got into it so they could run for the senate, so they could run for governor, these marginal candidates. What do you think?</p><p>ROLLINS: Well, Hickenlooper is going to be a strong candidate running for the senate. He's been the governor there and he was popular. And Inslee is the other one who is the governor who is going to run for third term. So obviously, they didn't get hurt by this, some of the others may fast forward.</p><p>GOODWIN: I'm just really proud Mayor De Blasio inherent --</p><p>DOBBS: He's in there.</p><p>GOODWIN: He's still --</p><p>DOBBS: He's in it to win it.</p><p>GOODWIN: I'm so proud.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DOBBS: That steadfast socialist.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ROLLINS: Trying to break one percent, break one percent.</p><p>DOBBS: Ed, thank you very much. Michael, thank you. Appreciate it, gentlemen.</p><p>Up next, why you can no longer say the word felon in the city of San Francisco. I think the left has gone very near the abyss. Stay with us. We're coming right back.</p><p>DOBBS: Tripping the light fantastic more absurdity out of left wing San Francisco, city officials proposing convicted felons should be referred to by another name rather than a simple word like felon. Try out formerly incarcerated person or just a returning resident juvenile delinquent. Well, they shouldn't be called that. They should be called a young person impacted by the juvenile justice system.</p><p>Folks, this is absolutely serious. Addicts would become, quote, a person, quote, with a history of substance abuse. Now, that's just astonishing stuff. I mean, it really is.</p><p>Joining us tonight to take up this and more is Patrice Onwuka who is senior policy analyst at the Independent Women's Forum. What do you think? It looks to me like San Francisco is taking us places we never dreamed we'd be with the language.</p><p>PATRICE ONWUKA, SENIOR POLICY ANALYST, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S FORUM: Oh, yes, Lou. I agree with you. I mean, it's interesting what's unique here is that San Francisco is continuing the Obama administration legacy, where under -- where the under Obama, the Justice Department tried to scrub some of these, quote, disparaging labels like ex-convict, like former felon.</p><p>DOBBS: Right.</p><p>ONWUKA: And what -- there's a new twist here, San Francisco is saying that this is in part to fight the systemic racism and white supremacy. Apparently that's inherent in the justice system there.</p><p>So, you know, I think it's laughable. I am a wholehearted supporter of criminal justice reform and giving people who have served their time and their punishment a second chance.</p><p>DOBBS: Absolutely.</p><p>ONWUKA: But this is going beyond that. This is trying to obfuscate the difference between people who are actually served their time and people who are repeated fem -- criminals and lumping them all together the same way they do with legal and illegal immigrants.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, Patrice, it's the left, they know very well and they've had such success with -- well, homogenizing, sterilizing words and language ringing the life from Anglo-Saxon words and selecting Latin derivatives. And in going P.C., they control language, they control the mind and they know that.</p><p>ONWUKA: Yes.</p><p>DOBBS: And this is just and it seems to me obviously an extension of that.</p><p>Facebook pulling a Trump presidential campaign ad. Facebook pulling a woman for Trump saying it violated the platform's gender policies. What are your thoughts?</p><p>ONWUKA: Facebook is at it again. I would like to believe that they are not targeting the Trump campaign particularly on a day when the campaign is really trying to reach out to women by doing this women blitz of having their effective surrogates hitting lots of different cities to mobilize female support. I think it's just potentially somebody at Facebook who's trying to, you know, target the campaign. It would be nice if they actually explained.</p><p>DOBBS: We've got a history of it for crying out loud.</p><p>ONWUKA: Oh, yes.</p><p>DOBBS: It's -- the bias is clear within Facebook and next we're going to have a police force with a language police within Facebook. Are we headed do you think for a real collision here breaking up Google, breaking up Facebook, Silicon Valley on notice, attorneys general carrying out an investigation antitrust, the Department of Justice doing the same?</p><p>ONWUKA: I think we're headed in that direction but I don't think we're going to get there honestly. And I -- and I worry, I hesitate when I hear about antitrust being thrown around and breaking up big tech because -- just because a company is big, doesn't mean it's sinister. Now, are they living up to there -- are they harming consumers? That's another situation, that's another standard to hold up to.</p><p>DOBBS: They're doing what they want with user -- with user data.</p><p>ONWUKA: With user data, certainly.</p><p>DOBBS: Almost without exception. I'm sorry, go ahead.</p><p>ONWUKA: Well, that the challenge is, this is their playground and we as users, we have agreed to abide by their rules however they decide to meet out their version of justice. So you know, I think we've kind of struck a Faustian bargain by saying, you know what, I want to be able to share my family pictures and find a community of conservative people across the world using social media, but at the same time --</p><p>DOBBS: Yes, there's a -- it's a one way bargain and that means it's an impact on consumers.</p><p>And by the way, being big is not in and of itself a defense against abuse of user data and violation of privacy.</p><p>ONWUKA: Sure.</p><p>DOBBS: Patrice, we're out of time. Great to see you, come back soon.</p><p>ONWUKA: OK, good to see you too. Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS: Patrice Onwuka.</p><p>We'd like to hear your thoughts on all of this. Share your comments, follow me on Twitter @LouDobbs, like me on Facebook, follow me on Instagram @LouDobbsTonight.</p><p>Up next, the major connection between Google and the radical Dems 2020 presidential candidates. There is one? Say this and so. We'll take that up and more right after this quick break, stay with us.</p><p>DOBBS: A data firm supported by a former Alphabet chairman Eric Schmidt is now working for some of the top 2020 Dem candidates. New FEC record showed Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Kamala Harris and Bernie Sanders their campaigns paying thousands and thousands of dollars for research from Schmidt's data firm Civis Analytics. Schmidt who helped run and fund Hillary's 2016 campaign still serves as technical adviser to Google's board. As far as I know, he's not on the payroll but there it is.</p><p>Joining us tonight, Peter Schweizer. New York Times bestselling author, president of the Government Accountability is -- Accountability Institute and host of a new investigative series entitled The Drill Down. Peter, great to have you with us. Let's start --</p><p>PETER SCHWEIZER, PRESIDENT, GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY INSTITUTE: It's good to be with you as always, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Eric Schmidt, I can't imagine that he would support advise council, a Democratic candidate. It's just -- this is to me fascinating that there is not more of an inquiry into Google itself. And what they've done is just extraordinary in terms of all the visits or executives paid to President Obama during his time in the White House. I believe they were the most representative of any firm or maybe entity -- private entity in the country.</p><p>SCHWEIZER: No, you're exactly right. I mean, we are all familiar with the term revolving door and people think of it, you know, defense contractors going in and out of the Pentagon. Well, in the Obama administration, Google was the number one company that had executives visiting the White House. And you had something like a couple hundred I believe Google executives who left Google, went to work in the Obama administration and then went back to Google.</p><p>Look, people have the right to do these things. The problem is a company like Google has the power and has the inclination to dramatically influence an election in a way that nobody can know about it. They can manipulate the algorithm, you've got whistleblowers that say that they've done that, you've got internal documents that have been leaked that have done that.</p><p>DOBBS: Against conservatives.</p><p>SCHWEIZER: Yes, exactly against conservatives but also against conservative candidates --</p><p>DOBBS: Right.</p><p>SCHWEIZER: -- in favor of Liberal Democratic candidates. That's a campaign violation and it needs to be investigated.</p><p>DOBBS: And do you think this administration will certainly would seem a Republican administration should? I'm sure that the Democrats would have returned the favor had it worked out the other way.</p><p>SCHWEIZER: Yes, I mean, imagine if you had a big high-tech firm that was run by conservatives and that there have been allegations that they were helping certain political campaigns in certain ways, you can believe. And I think honestly, they'd be rightfully -- you know, capable of doing this is to send some Department of Justice prosecutors over there to start poking and looking around.</p><p>I mean, you know, if we're concerned about campaign violations of you know, people giving to a candidate by donating to their sister and having their sister give in straw donations like that a prosecutor. My goodness, we ought to be looking and investigating the lar -- one of the largest corporations in America which has been charged by some of its own former employees of tipping the scales in favor of certain political candidates.</p><p>DOBBS: Right.</p><p>SCHWEIZER: It's a slam dunk and I hope the Trump administration does that.</p><p>DOBBS: In Facebook, a new police on language and intent I suppose, I'm not quite sure how they plan to carry that out. But we're looking at -- it seems to me a requirement for a new definition of public responsibility on the part of corporate America and adherence to old ideas about anti- competitive monopoly. Whether it be the -- you know, at least de facto monopoly when it comes to search, Google is it. When it comes to social media, Facebook is it, your thoughts.</p><p>SCHWEIZER: Yes, they're completely dominant. And look, Ted Cruz has been sounding this alarm bell for a while on Capitol Hill. These tech companies are protected by the Communications Decency Act in a section that basically says, because and as long as they are neutral platforms, they don't have to worry about certain things related to monopoly or liability that media firms like Fox News does.</p><p>DOBBS: Right.</p><p>SCHWEIZER: Well, Cruz's point is they're not neutral platforms anymore. So let's stop fooling ourselves. If they're not going to be neutral platforms, why do they get the benefits of being a neutral platform?</p><p>I think Cruz is right, they ought to choose, they ought to be neutral platforms in the true sense of the word. And they can keep their current status of some of these legal protections they have or if they want to continue in the path they're going, they're going to be treated as media companies, which means, you know, if a broadcasting company wants to buy a television station somewhere, that has to be approved. If you do something and somebody thinks you've libelled them and as a media company, you can be sued. That should apply to these tech companies if they're going to act like media companies.</p><p>DOBBS: And where we are right now, it looks to me like some of these companies spending tens and tens of millions of dollars on lobbying and influencing policy, it looks to me like a lot of law makers are outright intimidated by these companies. They're afraid to pursue a public policy responsibility that at least in my opinion that they should.</p><p>And I'm just curious about you know, how far this is going to go because Cruz is amongst the very few who's had the guts to actually say something and I don't know of a single committee that is prepared to do much of anything about what is an awesome economic consolidation of economic policy and political power.</p><p>SCHWEIZER: Well, I think is, Lou, you probably know even better than I do profiles and courage are not very prevalent on Capitol Hill. What they want to do is get reelected. And as long as they think their constituencies don't care or it's not that important to them, they're not going to address it.</p><p>I think people need to let their elected officials know they're concerned about this, they're concerned about these companies that are impacting our elections in a hidden secretive way at a profound level, and that they're also silencing certain voices. And I think if these politicians realize that the voters who put them into office are concerned about these issues, perhaps they'll start showing more courage and start you know, carrying the torch the way Ted Cruz and some other people are.</p><p>DOBBS: Peter Schweizer, always good to see you. Thank you, Peter.</p><p>SCHWEIZER: Thanks, Lou. Thanks.</p><p>DOBBS: We're in the fourth day of this week and the fourth different view from the administration on tax cuts. Monday, the Trump White House denied reports they were looking at cutting Payroll Taxes. Tuesday, the president said he was looking at the idea. Wednesday, the president told reporters he couldn't see any reason for new tax cuts. Today, National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow announced the new position.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL: We're looking at what I sometimes call tax cuts 2.0. You might see that during the campaign, to be perfectly honest. There's nothing in the near term. That's what the president was getting at.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: And that leaves us another day in this week, another opportunity for discussion of tax cuts. Up next, President Trump just wrapped up a meeting on preventing mass shootings. What was discussed at the meeting? John Lott, one of the country's leading experts on guns and gun laws joins us right after the break. Stay with us.</p><p>DOBBS: Breaking news now President Trump holding a bipartisan meeting on gun legislation today. The President just tweeted this just moments ago. \"Just concluded a very good meeting on preventing mass shootings. Talks are ongoing with both Republicans and Democrats. We are likewise engaging with lawful gun owners, survivors, grieving family members, law enforcement, the NRA, mental health professionals, and school officials. I'm hopeful Congress will engage with my team to pass meaningful legislation that will make a real difference and most importantly, save lives.\"</p><p>Well to sort all of this out, joining us tonight, John Lott. He's President of the Crime Prevention Research Center, Economist for FoxNews.com. John, good to see you. First, background checks.</p><p>JOHN LOTT, ECONOMIST, FOXNEWS.COM: Right.</p><p>DOBBS: There are background checks on nearly all of the guns sold in this country. Why aren't they -- why are they adequate?</p><p>LOTT: Well, what they want to try to do is have what they call universal background checks, background checks on all private transfers. They bring this up after each mass public shooting. President Obama, this was the one law that he kept on pushing. But it wouldn't have stopped one of these mass public shootings this century. All the people chained the guns either through a background check themselves or they stole them.</p><p>DOBBS: And with that understanding, that reality -- and by the way, what John said is exactly correct, what are we doing here? What is the purpose of the push for \"universal background checks\" when everyone acknowledges that in nearly every instance, what we're dealing with is a deeply disturbed, mentally disturbed individual?</p><p>LOTT: Well, I think the reason why they push this is that they want to make it costly for people to be able to go and get guns.</p><p>DOBBS: They want to keep guns out of everyone's hands.</p><p>LOTT: So we're in New York City right now. It costs $125, at least, to do a background check on privately transferring a gun. You know, you add the head to the licensing and registration fees, they may not stop you and I from being able to go and buy a gun, but my research shows that poor people, poor minorities, blacks who live in high crime, urban areas, that people are most likely to be victims of violent crime, that this can keep from being able to be able to defend themselves and their families.</p><p>DOBBS: So what is the solution here? What is the intelligent thing to do?</p><p>LOTT: Right.</p><p>DOBBS: I personally believe the Second Amendment. I mean, I am an absolute sure supporter of the Second Amendment. But is there any --</p><p>LOTT: Yes, there is.</p><p>DOBBS: -- part of this a reasonable solution?</p><p>LOTT: Well, I mean, what's been frustrating is that the solutions that The democrats put forward have nothing to do with these attacks. But there is something we can do.</p><p>DOBBS: Let's go.</p><p>LOTT: Virtually about all these attacks, about 95 percent of them keep on occurring in places where guns are banned. These killers aren't stupid. They want to get kill as many people as possible because they know the more people they kill, the more publicity they can get.</p><p>And so they go to places where victims can't defend themselves. If you have one guard there who's in uniform, they have an almost impossible job. These killers have huge strategic advantages. They could -- if they're going to attack, that will be the one person they kill first, because they know if they kill that person --</p><p>DOBBS: But what is the solution, John?</p><p>LOTT: Is to get rid of the gun-free zones. To allow --</p><p>DOBBS: So you get rid of the security guard too?</p><p>LOTT: You can have the security guard. Having people with concealed carry actually makes the job for the security guard safer. Because if a terrorist is going to go and attack them, he reveals his position. Now he has to worry about somebody behind him or the side who may be able to stop him.</p><p>DOBBS: In so many of these instances, a disturbed individual, the school doesn't do anything, doesn't talk to authorities, the families do nothing or do too little. We've got to have a different approach here in a mindset of the community, the neighborhood, and families.</p><p>Look can be great if we could go and identify these individuals beforehand. But you have to realize how difficult it is.</p><p>DOBBS: I'm not arguing how difficult it is. I'm not going. Why in the world can't we have a campaign for people to pay attention and take responsibility for the mental health of all of us?</p><p>LOTT: Right. Look, it's easy to see these things Monday morning quarterbacking.</p><p>DOBB: I'm not -- John, I'm sorry, we've hit the absolute out here. John Lott, it's great to see you. Thanks so much. We'll be right back. Stay with us.</p><p>DOBBS: On Wall Street today, stocks is mixed. The Dow up 50, the S&amp;P down two, the NASDAQ down 29. Volume of the big board slipping a bit to 2.9 billion shares. A reminder to listen to my report three times a day coast to coast on the Salem Radio Network.</p><p>President Trump presenting 91-year-old Boston Celtics basketball legend Bob Cousy with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. During the ceremony, the President joked about what he and Cousy have in common.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: And Bob, never forgot the lesson his first mentor taught him, don't ever be predictable. Hey, I've heard that lesson too, not for basketball, for other things.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: That's it for us tonight. Thanks for being with us. The Border Patrol Union's Hector Garza, social media stars Diamond and Silk among our guests tomorrow. Please join us. Thanks for being with us tonight and good night from New York.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LOUDOB-2019082201cb229</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LOUDOB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WWB-NR01-DXH2-6314-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">383182</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6618\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Lou Dobbs Tonight</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 22, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Elizabeth Warren[3], the Massachusetts Democrat who is running for president in 2020, celebrated Facebook cofounder Chris Hughes' call to break up Facebook two months after Warren rolled out her own plan[4] to break up the largest US tech companies, including Amazon, Google, and Facebook. \"Chris Hughes is right. Today's big tech companies have too much power\u2014over our economy, our society, ...r democracy,\" Warren tweeted[5] on Thursday morning. \"They've bulldozed competition, used our private info for profit, hurt small businesses ...ifled innovation. It's time to #BreakUpBigTech.\" Hughes, who started Facebook with Mark Zuckerberg in their Harvard dorm in 2004, on Thursday warned of the \"dangers of Facebook's monopoly\" and argued that Zuckerberg has amassed \"unprecedented and un-American\" personal power. \"Every time Facebook messes up, we repeat an exhausting pattern: first outrage, then disappointment and, finally, resignation,\" Hughes wrote in a New York Times op-ed,[6] adding that the company's domination in the market restricts competition and hurts its two billion users. Hughes also argued that Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram should be broken into three different companies. Read more: A Facebook cofounder has written a blistering New York Times op-ed arguing that Mark Zuckerberg's social network should be torn apart[7] Warren's plan[8] includes a call for \"platform neutrality\" \u2014 barring tech giants from both providing a marketplace and selling their product on the same marketplace \u2014 and the appointment of new regulators that would undo mergers between massive tech companies. She argues that such mergers smother competition and undermine democracy. \"That means we break Facebook away from Instagram and WhatsApp, Amazon away from Whole Foods, Google away from Nest, and more,\" Warren wrote in a campaign email.

Facebook subsequently reversed course and unblocked it, but the incident highlights the company's extraordinary power to regulate online speech. The leftwing Democratic politician then blasted Facebook in a tweet, calling it a \"censor.\" Facebook banned an ad by US presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren that called for it and other big tech companies to be broken up, saying that the ad violated its rules, before changing course and allowing it to remain up. </p><p>Politico reported on Monday that the Silicon Valley social networking giant had blocked ads[3] by the leftwing Democratic politician that touted her plan to take regulatory action to split up Facebook, Amazon, and Google[4] if she becomes the next US president, citing their \"vast power over our economy and our democracy.\" A Facebook spokesperson told the news outlet that Facebook \"removed the ads because they violated our policies against use of our corporate logo\" \u2014 but that it would restore them \"in the interest of allowing robust debate.\" Facebook did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment. Elizabeth Warren's ad criticized the three tech firms, saying\"it's time to break up these big companies so they don't have so much power over everyone else.\" It included a one-and-a-half minute video highlighting news stories about allegedly anti-competitive behavior from Facebook, Google, and Amazon, and briefly includes a stylized version of Facebook's logo to represent the company. (The ad is viewable in full in Facebook's political Ad Archive[5].) Facebook's ad policies[6] place restrictions on how advertisers may use Facebook's logos and brand names, in an attempt to avoid misleading ads or ones that might appear to suggest Facebook is endorsing the advertiser. It's this rule that Facebook says Elizabeth Warren's campaign violated. The incident was swiftly rectified, but it served to illustrate the extraordinary level of power Facebook has to regulate online discourse today \u2014 and how criticism of the company, if not framed carefully, can inadvertently run afoul of its rules. Elizabeth Warren subsequently responded on Twitter, tweeting: \"Curious why I think FB has too much power? Let's start with their ability to shut down a debate over whether FB has too much power. Thanks for restoring my posts. But I want a social media marketplace that isn't dominated by a single censor. #BreakUpBigTech\"Tweet Embed: //twitter.com/mims/statuses/1105256905058979841?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw Curious why I think FB has too much power?

Those companies would not be allowed to own participants on their platforms.</p><p>She would also appoint regulators committed to reversing mergers completed long ago, such as Facebooks purchase of WhatsApp and Instagram, Googles acquisition of Waze, Nest and DoubleClick, and Amazons purchase of Whole Foods and Zappos.</p><p>Tech industry trade groups were quick to criticize the senators plan.</p><p>These companies have provided lower cost and better access to goods and services, said Carl Guardino, president and CEO of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, whose members include Google and Facebook. If the reward for building a successful company is to destroy that company through the political process, the message to entrepreneurs across America is that America is closed for business.</p><p>To address some of Warrens concerns, the answer is not to break up tech companies but to pass a national privacy framework, campaign finance reform legislation, and laws regarding political ads, said Rob Atkinson, president of the Information Technology &amp; Innovation Foundation.</p><p>But the groups that last year urged the FTC to break up Facebook applauded Warrens plan.</p><p>Shes been talking about this for a few years and has put in a lot of time and effort, said Robert Cruickshank, campaign director for Demand Progress. I think most people know the internet was never supposed to be dominated by a few companies.</p><p>No serious presidential candidate can present a proposal to address economic inequality and strengthen democracy without being willing to name names and break up monopoly power,\" said Open Markets Institute Deputy Director Sarah Miller.</p><p>How might Warrens proposal affect her chances in the crowded Democratic field in the presidential primary, and in California  home to Facebook and Google?</p><p>Given that California is now pretty much an early voting state, I could see it playing a much bigger role during the primary, said Rebecca Eissler, assistant professor in the political science department at San Francisco State University.</p><p>Warren, whose efforts helped lead to the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, has long been outspoken against the rich and powerful. She is proposing an ultra-millionaire tax on American households with a net worth of $50 million or more. And as she kicked off her presidential campaign this year, she said she would not take money from political action committees.</p><p>She speaks from a position of real authority of the dangers to consumers of these large companies, Eissler said. That might make her popular with some consumers, but maybe not the people who work for the companies who stand to profit when those companies do well.</p><p>Larry Gerston, professor emeritus for San Jose State Universitys political science department, said Warrens proposal will not endear her to many voters in Silicon Valley, especially considering the large numbers of employees, vendors and suppliers who support and benefit from the companies the senator is targeting.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2019/03/16/zuckerbergs-bad-week-gets-worse-with-live-streamed-shooting/\">        Zuckerbergs bad week gets worse with live-streamed shooting     </url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2019/03/15/a-potential-game-changer-analysts-praise-model-y-and-teslas-plan-to-bring-sexy-back/\">        'A potential game changer': Analysts praise Model Y and Tesla's plan to 'bring sexy back'     </url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2019/03/15/jury-rules-apple-infringed-on-three-qualcomm-patents/\">        Jury rules Apple infringed on three Qualcomm patents     </url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2019/03/15/facebook-twitter-youtube-scramble-to-remove-new-zealand-mosque-attack-videos/\">Facebook, Twitter, YouTube scramble to remove New Zealand mosque attack videos     </url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2019/03/15/h-1b-apple-and-outsourcer-infosys-get-whistleblower-visa-scam-lawsuit-tossed-out/\">        H-1B: Apple and outsourcer Infosys get whistleblower lawsuit claiming visa scam tossed out     </url></p><p>Facebook and Amazon said they would have no comment on Warrens proposal.

But will it help her campaign?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Using the 2001 US v. Microsoft case as the basis for her argument, Warren outlines why she believes Big Tech's behavior is anticompetitive, anti-innovation, monopolistic and thus hurts small businesses and consumers.</p><p>\"[Microsoft's] story demonstrates why promoting competition is so important: it allows new, groundbreaking companies to grow and thrive -- which pushes everyone in the marketplace to offer better products and services,\" she wrote. \"Aren't we all glad that now we have the option of using Google instead of being stuck with Bing?\"</p><p>By buying up smaller edge providers like DoubleClick, Instagram, Waze and WhatsApp, Facebook and Google undermine competition, she argues.</p><p>\"Amazon crushes small companies by copying the goods they sell on the Amazon Marketplace and then selling its own branded version,\" she wrote. \"Google allegedly snuffed out a competing small search engine by demoting its content on its search algorithm, and it has favored its own restaurant ratings over those of Yelp.\"</p><p>To restore competition to the tech industry, she argues, regulators must break up the dominating companies as they did with Standard Oil back in 1911. Warren also calls for edge providers like Facebook and Google to be treated as \"utilities,\" like electric and water companies.</p><p>\"These companies would be prohibited from owning both the platform utility and any participants on that platform,\" she wrote. \"Platform utilities would be required to meet a standard of fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory dealing with users. Platform utilities would not be allowed to transfer or share data with third parties.\"</p><p>Rob Atkinson of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation says Warren's approach is anti-consumer.  \"Breaking up large Internet companies just because they are large won't help consumers. It will hurt them by reducing convenience, reducing quality of service and innovation, and in some cases leading to the introduction of priced services,\" Atkinson said in a statement.</p><p>And the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a right-leaning think tank, dismissed Warren's plan as a \"doomed regulatory experiment.\"</p><p>\"The free market is working to lower prices, create new products, and leave consumers better off; politicians need to stay out of its way,\" CEI's Center for Technology and Innovation Associate Director Jessica Melugin said.</p><p>And Rob Atkinson of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, said in a statement, \"Breaking up large Internet companies just because they are large won't help consumers. It will hurt them by reducing convenience, reducing quality of service and innovation, and in some cases leading to the introduction of priced services.\"</p><p>But Warren -- and most economists-- say the tech industry does not operate as a truly free market due to the dominance of a few platforms.</p><p>Aram Sinnreich, chair of communication studies at American University, believes government's role is to ensure markets are truly free. When a few companies dominate an industry, responsible government should step in.</p><p>\"Trust-busting is an American tradition (under every administration),\" he told InsideSources. \"It's democratic and free market pragmatism. It's not radical, it's not socialism.\"</p><p>But Sinnreich isn't sure antitrust law will adequately handle the problem.</p><p>\"Antitrust is a difficult tool to use,\" he said. \"First of all you need a regulatory apparatus capable of handling that and you also need courts to support them. Even 20 years ago in US v. Microsoft, it was very difficult to explain to judges about what the problem was. There's a bunch of political and logistical hurdles to accomplishing this, but I commend her, I think her analysis of the problem is spot on, and antitrust is probably, out of the many unpalatable options, the least unpalatable.\"</p><p>Furthermore, he added, \"the threat of antitrust has the capacity to lead to effective self-regulation to a certain degree.\"</p><p>Warren's stance on Big Tech could hurt her campaign. The tech giants she calls out in the blog post are also lobbying giants, and she declared war on them. It could make her unpopular not only in Silicon Valley but also in D.C., as Amazon prepares to launch its second headquarters just over the river in Crystal City, Virginia.</p><p>\"Whatever beneficial PR she might get from putting this out, it's dwarfed by the threat of poking a bunch of tigers in the eye,\" Sinnreich said. \"It remains to be seen what the political consequences of that might be [but] it's unlikely to benefit her traditionally.\"</p><p>Still, Warren's comments align with the testimonies and research of many (not all) economists who study antitrust. She wants to review and break up tech mergers like Facebook and Instagram, something both Republican and Democrat senators discussed at a recent antitrust hearing.</p><p>\"It's not that [Big Tech is] evil, it's that they're corporations and their job is to make profits for their shareholders,\" Sinnreich said. \"They have a fiduciary to behave anticompetitively, which is why the government needs to step in to create the conditions for necessary competition to occur.\"</p><p>Follow Kate on Twitter</p><p>___ (c)2019 InsideSources.com, Washington, D.C.

Google, Amazon, Facebook and now Apple have fallen into the politician's crosshairs as she seeks greater diversity and innovation in the tech sector. \"Twenty-five years ago, Facebook, Google, and Amazon didn't exist. Now they are among the most valuable and well-known companies in the world,\" she said in a Medium[1] post. </p><p>\"It's a great story - but also one that highlights why the government must break up monopolies and promote competitive markets.\" Warren reasoned that when markets are competitive, innovative companies are allowed to shine which motivates everyone in that competition to produce better products and services.\"Today's big tech companies have too much power - too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy. They've bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else. And in the process, they have hurt small businesses and stifled innovation,\" she said. Her proposals have a whiff of those brought against Microsoft in the late nineties regarding its antitrust suit with USA's Department of Justice (DOJ). In an attempt to combat Microsoft's monopoly of the personal computer market, lawmakers tried to prevent the company from bundling Internet Explorer in with its Windows PCs. \"Today's big tech companies have too much power -- too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy. They've bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else. And in the process, they have hurt small businesses and stifled innovation.\" The same sort of logic applies here with her plan to dismantle tech companies from their subsidiary arms. Facebook would have to be a completely separate entity from Instagram and WhatsApp. Amazon could remain as an e-commerce platform but cut ties with Amazon Basics and Amazon Marketplace. This is so manufacturers won't be overshadowed by Amazon's own renditions of a product that's naturally promoted to the top of its own platform which happens to also be a globally popular go-to for practically any shopping requirement. Warren plans to achieve this by targeting any platform with an online marketplace[2] or exchange with a global revenue of 25bn or more and then redesigning them as 'platform utilities'. This would entail new laws having to be created, prohibiting these companies from owning both the platform utility and any participants of that platform, while having to \"meet a standard of fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory dealing with users\". \"For smaller companies (those with annual global revenue of between $90 million and $25 billion), their platform utilities would be required to meet the same standard of fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory dealing with users, but would not be required to structurally separate from any participant on the platform,\" she said. She also wants to put a stop to big companies simply swallowing their competition in the form of massive mergers. To do this, she proposes the advent of a regulatory body to oversee the nature of these allegedly illegal and anti-competitive mergers. \"Unwinding these mergers will promote healthy competition in the market - which will put pressure on big tech companies to be more responsive to user concerns, including about privacy[3],\" she said. Although she would have just won the hearts of SMBs, startups and privacy advocates across the States with these proposals, she cautions that the internet isn't likely to change too drastically. \"You'll still be able to go on Google and search like you do today. You'll still be able to go on Amazon and find 30 different coffee machines that you can get delivered to your house in two days. You'll still be able to go on Facebook and see how your old friend from school is doing.\" What will change is the landscape of the products made available. Those 30 coffee machines will be comprised of other brands not yet heard of as they would have been allowed to flourish in an open, competitive market. She also thinks privacy will be impacted in a positive way. Citing Facebook's interoperability with Instagram and WhatsApp[4], she said that the disconnection of the services will encourage Facebook to dedicate more effort to improve the user experience and privacy of the services. \"We must give people more control over how their personal information is collected, shared, and sold - and do it in a way that doesn't lock in massive competitive advantages for the companies that already have a ton of our data,\" Warren said. \"We must help America's content creators -- from local newspapers and national magazines to comedians and musicians - keep more of the value their content generates, rather than seeing it scooped up by companies like Google and Facebook. \"And we must ensure that Russia - or any other foreign power - can't use Facebook or any other form of social media to influence our elections[5].\"Apple hasn't escapedIn a follow-up interview with The Verge, Warren added another name to her hit list. She said Apple can't both host an app store and then sell apps on it too. \"Apple, you've got to break it apart from their App Store. It's got to be one or the other,\" Warren said. \"Either they run the platform or they play in the store. They don't get to do both at the same time.\" Much in the same way she singles out Amazon and its Basics range for a market monopoly on the platform, under her proposed laws, Apple wouldn't be able to push apps like iMovie, Pages and Apple News. This would allow competitors such as Adobe Clip, Microsoft Word and the BBC to gain more widespread exposure on a platform dominated by its creator.
