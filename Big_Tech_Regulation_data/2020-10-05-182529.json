We both hope to see you there!</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Hi everyone \u2014\u00a0here is your bumper \u201cUS-China decoupling\u201d issue. Chinese venture capital firms \u2014 once so enamoured of the US start-up scene \u2014 are pulling in their horns. The US has also considered restrictions on Chinese listings in New York. But amid all this, PayPal has secured entry into the huge Chinese digital payments market. Switching to India, New Delhi has unveiled its surveillance ambitions and IT specialists are finding plenty of jobs in the US. Oh, and Hyundai is moving into \u201curban air mobility\u201d (flying cars).\u00a0</emphasis></p><p>The Big Story \u2014 exclusive</p><p>US-China decoupling is hitting venture capital hard. Chinese VC firms used to make big investments into US start-ups but that is changing fast, according to an\u00a0 exclusive in the Financial Times. Spooked by US national security reviews, Chinese VC investments into the US this year have fallen to $4bn, down from almost $7bn in the same period last year.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Key implications</emphasis></p><p>Cfius, the US review panel on foreign investment, is the main obstacle.\u00a0The panel is heightening scrutiny over Chinese investments and acquisitions, particularly in \u201ccritical technology\u201d areas such as military equipment, semiconductors and a broad category of \u201cdual use\u201d tech that could have both civilian and military applications.\u00a0Such action \u2014 and the fear of it \u2014 has clobbered the confidence of Chinese investors eyeing the US. Much of their interest is instead now focused on India and\u00a0 south-east Asia.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Upshot</emphasis></p><p>The pullback in venture capital matches a broader drying-up of Chinese foreign direct investment into the US. Chinese FDI, a category that does not include venture capital, fell to $5.4bn in 2018 from $29b in 2017, according to data from Rhodium Group.</p><p>Mercedes\u2019 top 10</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">A round-up of the week\u2019s best tech stories from the FT\u2019s Asia tech reporter Mercedes Ruehl.</emphasis></p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>A report that the Trump administration was considering\u00a0 a ban \u00a0on\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chinese</emphasis>\u00a0listings on US stock markets spooked companies.

This week Blackstone announced the purchase of another $5.9bn worth of US warehouses from Colony Capital.</p><p>And logistics these days are high tech. The warehouses in China of ESR Cayman, an Asia-focused ecommerce and logistics start-up, are a prime example. At one logistics centre in Shanghai, robots moved cartons to trucks and delivery vans in a carefully choreographed dance. The company is hoping all this will parlay into a Hong Kong listing this year to raise between $1bn and $1.5bn, perhaps one of the biggest splashes of the year.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Read the story from Henny Sender, the FT\u2019s chief correspondent of international finance,\u00a0 here.</emphasis></p><p>In the spotlight</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PayPal became the first foreign company to enter China\u2019s huge but fiercely competitive digital payments market</emphasis>, signing this week to acquire a local player called Guofubao or, in English, GoPay. The move allows PayPal to steal a march on Visa and Mastercard, which are among those foreign companies that have been kept waiting by Chinese authorities for licences in spite of changes in 2017 that removed formal obstacles to market access.</p><p>Dan Schulman, PayPal\u2019s chief executive, pictured above, thinks China\u2019s market is big enough to support several participants. Indeed, it is enormous: there are\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/frost\u2013sullivan-mobile-payments-market-in-china-is-expected-to-witness-three-fold-growth-with-doubling-of-active-mobile-payment-users-by-2023-300772861.html\"> forecast</url>\u00a0to be 956m active mobile payment users by 2023, with total payments valued at $96.7tn. The downside, though, is that Alibaba\u2019s Alipay and Tencent\u2019s WeChat Pay already have the market pretty much sewn up.</p><p>Smart data</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Move over Beijing and London.\u00a0</emphasis>New Delhi is planning to become one of the world\u2019s top surveillance cities. The city government will install 300,000 smart cameras to upgrade its crime-fighting potential.\u00a0</p><p>There\u2019s still some catching up to do. According to a survey by consumer site Comparitech, the city has only about 10 CCTV cameras per 1,000 people, compared with 40 in Beijing and 68 in London. But privacy campaigners in India are worried \u2014 especially as the country is yet to introduce any personal data privacy laws.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a high chance that the government will be tempted to use the facial recognition data for highly dubious purposes,\u201d says one think-tanker.

Initiatives include a push from Indonesia to join forces with Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines \u2014 together 80 per cent of the region\u2019s population \u2014 in demanding action from Google, Facebook and others on content regulation and tax policy.

While the technologies have great potential, the commissioner warned that they should be deployed carefully.<br/>\"We'll only see the full benefits - low prices, wide choice, innovative products and services - if the markets for these devices stay open and competitive. And the trouble is that competition in digital markets can be fragile,\" said Vestager.<br/>In Europe, the total number of smart home devices was around 108 million at the end of 2019 and is forecast to reach 184 million devices by 2023. The value of the smart home market is expected to almost double in the next four years to more than (EURO)27 billion ($30.8 billion).<br/>With Internet of Things (IoT) products carrying out tasks ranging from fitness tracking to front door unlocking, connected devices are set to become a huge part of users' everyday lives. Vestager stressed the need to \"act in good time\" to avoid monopoly from bigger players, which would lead to consumers being denied a fair choice when buying the devices.<br/>\"We have seen this type of conduct before,\" said Vestager. \"This is not new. So we know there's a risk that some of these players could become gatekeepers of the Internet of Things, with the power to make or break other companies.\"<br/>According to Vestager, it is also key to make sure that consumers don't find themselves locked into a closed ecosystem because of the lack of interoperability between providers of smart products.\u00a0<br/>\"For us to get the most out of the Internet of Things, our smart devices need to communicate,\" said Vestager. \"So if the devices from different companies don't work together, then consumers may be locked in to just one provider.\u00a0 And be limited to what that provider has to offer.\"<br/>Last year, Amazon launched the Voice Interoperability initiative along with 30 other companies, including Bose, Microsoft, Sonos, to name but a few. The companies participating in the project pledged to work with one another to make sure customers have the freedom to interact with multiple voice services on a single device.<br/>The EU watchdog will survey 400 companies of various sizes over the next year in Europe, Asia and America, to find out which initiatives will work best to regulate the IoT market, as well as the problems that are likely to arise in the future.\u00a0<br/>It is not the first time that the organization has launched probes to maintain healthy competition in the EU's markets. In 2018, a similar inquiry into e-commerce practices resulted in the adoption of a ban on geo-blocking, to make sure that customers could not be stopped from buying products and services from a website based in another member state.<br/>This time, the competition watchdog seems to have specific players in mind. \"It sends an important message to powerful operators in these markets that we are watching them - and that they need to do business in line with the competition rules,\" said Vestager.<br/>In a separate part of her speech, the commissioner mentioned a recent ruling by the EU's general court on Ireland's tax treatment of Apple. \"There's more work ahead,\" said Vestager, \"including to make sure that all businesses, including digital ones, pay their fair share of tax where it is rightfully due.\"<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-M1228529</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60D6-HY31-JBYT-H0YJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"627\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 20, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The EU competition watchdog is taking another look at whether big tech is helping itself to too large a slice of the digital market, this time in the space of connected devices.    The organization's commissioner Margrethe Vestager announced the launch of a sector probe to make sure that the companies behind smart products and digital assistants aren't building monopolies that could threaten consumer rights in the EU.   SEE:  5G: What it means for IoT (free PDF) (TechRepublic download)   Vestager named Apple's Siri, Google's Assistant and Amazon's Alexa, but also Deutshe Telekom's Magenta as the voice assistants \"at the centre of it all\".

He has done so in a letter to the European Union, calling for Apple to face the consequences of its privacy failure  BackgroundThe controversy dates back to last July[2], when aGuardian report revealed that Apple was using contractors to review interactions with Siri - and that some of the recordings were clearly triggered accidentally. This means that contractors were effectively eavesdropping on private conversations. </p><p>The report mentions that Apple doesn't clearly let consumers know that a small percentage of recordings are sent to contractors to improve Siri [] There have been countless instances of recordings featuring private discussions between doctors and patients, business deals, seemingly criminal dealings, sexual encounters and so on. These recordings are accompanied by user data showing location, contact details, and app data. At the time, the whistleblower remained anonymous. Apple initially defended the program before later apologizing and suspending it[3]. We realise we have not been fully living up to our high ideals. The company later said it was reinstating Siri grading[4], but only for those customers who explicitly opt in.Siri grading whistleblower demands actionThe former contractor has now gone public, revealing his identity as Thomas le Bonniec. He says he has done so to protest at the fact that Apple faced no consequences for the privacy breach. The Guardian[5] reports that Le Bonniec has written to European privacy watchdogs questioning the lack of action against Apple. In a letter announcing his decision, sent to all European data protection regulators, Thomas le Bonniec said: 'It is worrying that Apple (and undoubtedly not just Apple) keeps ignoring and violating fundamental rights and continues their massive collection of data. 'I am extremely concerned that big tech companies are basically wiretapping entire populations despite European citizens being told the EU has one of the strongest data protection laws in the world. Passing a law is not good enough: it needs to be enforced upon privacy offenders.' He said that it wasn't just Apple customers whose privacy was infringed. The recordings were not limited to the users of Apple devices, but also involved relatives, children, friends, colleagues, and whoever could be recorded by the device. The system recorded everything: names, addresses, messages, searches, arguments, background noises, films, and conversations. I heard people talking about their cancer, referring to dead relatives, religion, sexuality, pornography, politics, school, relationships, or drugs with no intention to activate Siri whatsoever. Le Bonniec said he was concerned that Apple has not faced any penalties, nor even been investigated by data protection authorities. FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

In a letter to European data protection regulation agencies, Thomas le Bonniec has revealed himself as the whistleblower who declaredin July 2019 that Apple was mishandling consumer Siri queries. According to a new report from The Guardian[1], le Bonniecsent a letter to all European data protection regulators stating the Cupertino company is violating rights and continues massive data collection: It is worrying that Apple (and undoubtedly not just Apple) keeps ignoring and violating fundamental rights and continues its massive collection of data. </p><p>I am extremely concerned that big tech companies are basically wiretapping entire populations despite European citizens being told the EU has one of the strongest data protection laws in the world. Passing a law is not good enough: it needs to be enforced upon privacy offenders. Le Bonniec, who was hired by one of Apple's subcontractors in Ireland called Globe Technical Services, reportedly had to listen to recordings from users and correct transcription errors. Listening to hundreds of recordings from Apple's iPhones, iPads, and Apple Watches, many of them were taken 'outside of any activation of Siri' \u2014 meaning that users were not aware of the action. 'I listened to hundreds of recordings every day, from various Apple devices (eg. iPhones, Apple Watches, or iPads),' says le Bonniec. 'These recordings were often taken outside of any activation of Siri, eg in the context of an actual intention from the user to activate it for a request. These processings were made without users being aware of it, and were gathered into datasets to correct the transcription of the recording made by the device,' he said. 'The recordings were not limited to the users of Apple devices, but also involved relatives, children, friends, colleagues, and whoever could be recorded by the device. The system recorded everything: names, addresses, messages, searches, arguments, background noises, films, and conversations. I heard people talking about their cancer, referring to dead relatives, religion, sexuality, pornography, politics, school, relationships, or drugs with no intention to activate Siri whatsoever.' 'These practices are clearly at odds with the company's 'privacy-driven' policies and should be urgently investigated by data protection authorities and Privacy watchdogs. With the current statement, I want to bring this issue to your attention, and also offer my cooperation to provide any element substantiating these facts. Although this case has already gone public, Apple has not been subject to any kind of investigation to the best of my knowledge.' As well as recording their owners, Apple's devices also picked up speech involving relatives or children of the owners who divulged names, addresses, messages, searches, arguments, and conversations without their knowledge that it was being recorded. InAugust 2019, as a response, the Cupertino company fired 300 workers with only one week's notice and said it was reviewing its audio program. Le Bonniec said that 'nothing has been done to verify if Apple actually stopped the program,' with sources reportedly telling him that Apple has not taken action. 'I believe that Apple's statements merely aim to reassure their users and public authorities, and they do not care for their user's consent, unless being forced to obtain it by law,' le Bonniec wrote.

Among other reasons, because we are very aware of the privacy of users and do not share or cross-sell data\", explains Uribe-Etxebarria.<br/>Gruber says that at Apple they considered privacy \"a human right\" and argues that governments have to protect it, so it appreciates it as \"a great idea\" that European regulations are more rigid than the US.<br/>\"It's harder, it takes longer and more money, it's harder, but it's worth protecting privacy,\" warns Gruber, who denies that virtual assistants listen to users if they don't utter the activation word, except for few mistakes.<br/>About the fear of being heard in privacy if you have virtual assistants, Gruber states that it is \"millions of times greater\" the amount of data we reveal on any internet access on a screen, even just to read, as well as greater privacy risks by showing us in front of the thousands of surveillance cameras in any city.<br/>On whether espionage could increase with 5G and his opinion on the US veto on Huawei, Gruber asks for \"being cautious\" and warns that cybersecurity has to be a jobgovernments and companies, through \"architectural barriers\" that prevent \"security holes.\"<br/>\"We are one of the few companies certified with ISO 27001 information security,\" adds the founder of Sherpa, which has more than 40 computer developers, mostly doctors, and associated departments at the universities of the Basque Country and Grenade.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-8972402</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X87-CJ21-JBJN-M425-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"628\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 12, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

There was a technology theme to the selections, while several on our panel of small business champions picked companies they claimed were tackling some of the world's biggest problems by treating Alzheimer's disease and broadening access to education.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                   Sir Richard Branson, founder of Virgin Group, picks                   Sustainably                   </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Many of the best ideas are ones that solve a problem and make things easier for people. Loral and Eishel Quinn, the mother and daughter behind Sustainably, have done just that with an app that allows people to donate spare change to charity automatically - by rounding it up to the nearest pound each time they shop.</p><p>They realised that charitable giving needed an upgrade; setting up direct debits or rooting around in your bag for spare change were not the easiest ways for people to donate to good causes.</p><p>The company, based in Edinburgh and London, is supporting charities large and small - from the British Heart Foundation to animal shelters and charities helping refugees. It is attracting a new generation of philanthropists who want to do good on their own terms. Sustainably doesn't share your personal details, so you can give with privacy, transparency and control.</p><p>The business is part-funded by Virgin StartUp, our not-for-profit organisation, and I'm proud we have committed to funding an equal number of women and men. Gender shouldn't matter when it comes to starting a business. What is important is the strength of your idea and your determination to make it happen.</p><p>                   Sherry Coutu, entrepreneur and non-executive director, picks                   Workfinder                   </p><p>Workfinder was run as a project in my Founders4Schools charity for three years, but was spun out in the summer. It is now a for-profit business that connects university students with scale-up companies looking to put together teams for particular projects.</p><p>It would be obvious to students that they should apply to, say, Unilever or Google, but there are tens of thousands of applicants for every spot. Workfinder, which has an HQ in Shoreditch, east London, is telling students that scale-ups produce 95% of jobs in the country, and helping them identify the best places to apply. It uses information from LinkedIn, DueDil [a financial database] and Companies House to act as a matchmaker between students and those fast-growing companies. It works for both parties.</p><p>My other favourites this year have been Raspberry Pi, which makes affordable mini-computers, and Perkbox, an online platform for boosting employee engagement.</p><p>                   Robin Klein, co-founder of LocalGlobe                   , picks                   Cuvva                   </p><p>The insurance industry is broken. Decades of middle-men, jargon, lengthy contracts and confusing quotes have made protecting yourself a chore, and in an era of pay-as-you-go services and subscriptions, there just isn't a place for such outdated practices anymore.</p><p>Founder Freddy Macnamara set up Cuvva in Islington, north London, to take the hassle out of insurance by letting people sign up for only what they need - whether that's an hour's cover, a rolling contract or a longer policy. If you're borrowing a friend's van to move home at the weekend, or need to use a family car for a holiday, for instance, you can get a quote in seconds via the Cuvva app and it doesn't require you to add names to existing policies, nor does it involve complex forms.</p><p>I love the idea that one of the oldest financial markets in the world is being transformed through products, and an approach to customer service, that really reflect the way people live today.</p><p>                   Vin Murria, entrepreneur and angel investor, picks                   XCD HR and Taina Technology                   </p><p>My favourite companies are those that form critical requirements in the course of business. Taina has developed technology that helps financial institutions automate their regulatory compliance. It was founded by Maria Scott, a London-based entrepreneur who worked as a tax lawyer for the bank JP Morgan for 12 years. Maria is incredibly driven and motivated and is a great female role model. XCD, based in Cheltenham in Gloucestershire, is a human resources payroll software suite on the Salesforce platform. It is going to be successful, but has taken five years to get where it is. You don't go from zero to hero in a few weeks.</p><p>                   Stephen Welton, founder and chief executive of BGF, picks                    Fluidic Analytics and Spoke                   </p><p>The businesses that stand out are those with a great vision and an acute understanding of the market and their differentiators within it.</p><p>One is Fluidic Analytics, a Cambridge-based life sciences business. It was set up by a group of scientists who have developed the technology to analyse proteins faster and more accurately than any other technology available. This year, the team celebrated a breakthrough in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease with its Fluidity One-W system. The impact of the company's innovation on diagnostics, cancer therapies and organ transplants is potentially huge.</p><p>Another stand-out business is the men's trousers brand Spoke, which is based in Richmond, southwest London. The growth of direct-to-customer channels has made overseas customers more accessible to UK retailers. While the best brands make this look effortless, behind-the-scenes execution takes a huge amount of digital marketing prowess, which Spoke has achieved.</p><p>Identifying the gap for a direct-to-customer men's clothing business, the team are using machine learning to offer customers 10 times more sizes than the average trouser brand.</p><p>                   Alex Chesterman, co-founder of Lovefilm and Zoopla, picks                   Perlego and Thirdfort                   </p><p>The typical student needs between \u00a3500 and \u00a31,000 for educational materials and equipment each year. That leaves disadvantaged students potentially unable to access the materials required to excel in higher education.</p><p>Perlego, a digital learning library in London, was created to combat this problem. For only \u00a312 a month - less than the price of a single textbook - Perlego users gain access to more than 250,000 academic and professional books, while the platform allows publishers to recoup revenues lost to piracy and the second-hand market.</p><p>Another example of a business solving a real problem is Thirdfort. The process of buying or selling a home hasn't changed for decades and carries increasing risks for lawyers around compliance and for consumers around fraud. Thirdfort tackles this with a mobile app, empowering lawyers to carry out checks with no need for physical documents. With a photo of the required documents and a selfie, Thirdfort carries out identity and anti-money-laundering checks.</p><p>                   Kerry Baldwin, managing partner of IQ Capital, pick                   s Concirrus and Neurovalens                   </p><p>London-based Concirrus is tackling marine insurance, a 300-year-old industry, using big data, artificial intelligence and machine learning. The premise is that behaviour is a better indicator of risk than the traditional approach, which looks at size, weight and type.</p><p>The company has ingested billions of records of data to create predictive models that clearly outperform the market. Concirrus has done for marine insurance what Google Maps did for driving directions and has won customers such as Marsh and Willis Re.</p><p>Northern Ireland's Neurovalens is changing the future treatment of global health epidemics with a non-invasive headset. It combines neuroscience with technology to stimulate the brain's hypothalamus [which has a vital role in functions such as releasing hormones and controlling appetite] and tackles obesity, insomnia and type 2 diabetes. There has been enormous traction this year, with three products moving into phase three clinical trials. There have been large sales of the consumer headset, Modius, which targets weight loss.</p><p>                   Alex Davies, founder of Wealth Club, picks                   Aparito and Acamar Films</p><p>Two companies we backed this year stand out. Aparito was founded in Wrexham by Elin Haf Davies, a former senior research nurse at Great Ormond Street Hospital, with the aim of solving a poignant problem: many clinical trials - especially involving children - fail because of poor data.</p><p>Aparito is Europe's first company to combine smartphone and wearable technology to record patient data 24/7 and feed it directly into clinical trials. Larger and better data sets could make the difference between success and failure.</p><p>Acamar Films is the independent production company behind Bing, the top-rated BBC children's show. If you have pre-school children, Bing is probably a constant presence in your home. Acamar's founder, Mikael Shields, acquired the rights to the book character in 2005. He then invested nearly 10 years and considerable sums researching and developing Bing's world. The first episode aired in 2014 and it is broadcast in about 120 territories. Next stop is America.</p><p>                   James Wise, partner at Balderton Capital, picks                   Jolt and Zoe                   </p><p>As the skills we need at work change, Jolt provides a highly flexible and much more affordable business school in London and Tel Aviv, letting people learn at their own pace and around their work schedule. It runs classes where experts from companies such as Tesla and Apple stream live talks, teaching everything from Instagram marketing techniques to negotiation skills. It provides the quality of a \u00a325,000-a year MBA at a fraction of the cost.</p><p>Founded by a former tech entrepreneur and a leading biologist, Zoe is running the biggest-ever clinical study on twins to truly understand what goes on in our microbiome, the bacteria in our gut and what we can do to change our health.</p><p>While big tech companies such as Facebook and Amazon have shown they still have plenty of flaws, we hope companies such as Jolt and Zoe show how technology really can make us all better off.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-59004937</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XVK-B7S1-F021-6370-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1704\"/><timeReceived>12:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 29, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>CC0001O0F</classCode><className>VIRGIN GROUP LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002HQ4</classCode><className>UNILEVER PLC/NV</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Writing for the Web Foundation on the 29th birthday of the web, he said regulation may be required to prevent tech giants from interfering with the \"open, creative space.\" Reduced innovation Berners-Lee has previously spoken out[1] about issues facing the modern web but this is the first time he's directly called for regulation. </p><p>In his post, he said a \"legal or regulatory framework\" may be needed to improve accountability, manage social objectives and ease the tensions associated with the modern web.Targeting firms including Facebook and Google, Berners-Lee criticised how \"a handful of platforms\" manipulate and control what people see online. The centralisation of power onto global social networks has enabled misinformation and abuse to spread across the web. According to the creator of the web, this goes against the[2] spirit of his invention by threatening to put an end to the open platform originally envisioned.READ NEXT: Nordstrom purchases two startups in push into retail tech[3]Whereas 20 years ago individuals frequently ran their own personal sites, today people are more likely to post on a social network. Instead of hosting their own platform, web users have clustered around a few centralised systems. As the tech giants have grown, they've come to acquire rivals, hire the top industry talent and obtain vast amounts of user data. Berners-Lee said this will result in \"far less\" innovation over the next 20 years than that seen during the web's infancy.\"These dominant platforms are able to lock in their position by creating barriers for competitors. They acquire startup challengers, buy up new innovations and hire the industry's top talent,\" said Berners-Lee[4]. \"Add to this the competitive advantage that their user data gives them and we can expect the next 20 years to be far less innovative than the last.\"\"Greater ambition\" for the webBerners-Lee is joining tech leaders including Microsoft founder Bill Gates and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff[5] in calling for regulation for tech giants. His comments come as public concern about the[6] role of social media and the internet in democracy, communication and society is growing.People are coming to realise the power[7] that platforms such as Facebook and Google hold. The highly-public debates around fake news and ad manipulation have prompted increased awareness of the scale at which tech firms operate. Berners-Lee said people should challenge themselves to promote \"greater ambitions\" for the web, which may include emphasis on decentralisation[8] and regulation for the largest firms. He called for people from across society to collaborate and define the future of the web, noting it's not too late to resolve the current problems.\"Let's assemble the brightest minds from business, technology, government, civil society, the arts and academia to tackle the threats to the web's future,\" said Berners-Lee[9]. \"At the Web Foundation, we are ready to play our part in this mission and build the web we all want. Let's work together to make it possible.\" [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.digitaljournal.com/tech-and-science/technology/tim-berners-lee-thinks-the-web-s-facing-a-nasty-storm-of-issues/article/507851\">http://www.digitaljournal.com/tech-and-science/technology/tim-berners-lee-thinks-the-web-s-facing-a-nasty-storm-of-issues/article/507851</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/the-download/610501/the-webs-creator-says-lets-regulate-big-tech/\">https://www.technologyreview.com/the-download/610501/the-webs-creator-says-lets-regulate-big-tech/</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.digitaljournal.com/tech-and-science/technology/nordstrom-purchases-two-startups-in-push-into-retail-tech/article/517099\">http://www.digitaljournal.com/tech-and-science/technology/nordstrom-purchases-two-startups-in-push-into-retail-tech/article/517099</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://webfoundation.org/2018/03/web-birthday-29/\">https://webfoundation.org/2018/03/web-birthday-29/</url> [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.digitaljournal.com/tech-and-science/technology/salesforce-ceo-says-facebook-should-be-regulated-like-cigarettes/article/513215\">http://www.digitaljournal.com/tech-and-science/technology/salesforce-ceo-says-facebook-should-be-regulated-like-cigarettes/article/513215</url> [ 6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.digitaljournal.com/tech-and-science/technology/uk-minister-hits-out-at-distorting-social-media-posts/article/508409\">http://www.digitaljournal.com/tech-and-science/technology/uk-minister-hits-out-at-distorting-social-media-posts/article/508409</url> [ 7]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.digitaljournal.com/tech-and-science/technology/tim-cook-attacks-social-media-for-helping-to-divide-people/article/506696\">http://www.digitaljournal.com/tech-and-science/technology/tim-cook-attacks-social-media-for-helping-to-divide-people/article/506696</url> [ 8]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.digitaljournal.com/tech-and-science/technology/what-the-decentralised-web-movement-means-for-you/article/490453\">http://www.digitaljournal.com/tech-and-science/technology/what-the-decentralised-web-movement-means-for-you/article/490453</url> [ 9]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://webfoundation.org/2018/03/web-birthday-29/\">https://webfoundation.org/2018/03/web-birthday-29/</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DIJO1009031520869010741251767300230</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DIJO-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RVK-R331-F03R-N46B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"723\"/><timeReceived>3:36 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Digital Journal</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 12, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It will be focused on censorship-free discourse.</p><p>Considering how important third-party payment processors are becoming in the free-speech battle, Thinkspot should be looking to replicate the ease of PayPal donations, YouTube\u2019s monetized Superchats, the anonymity of cryptocurrency payment options or micropayment integration.</p><p>Soon on Netflix</p><p>soononnetflix.com</p><p>Netflix has become a content monster, turning out an increasingly difficult-to-follow release schedule, with new shows seemingly showing up with little or no promotion.

A Kremlin spokesman blasted[1] the Trump administration's new National Security Strategy as 'imperialist' on Tuesday, adding that it shows 'an unwillingness to give up the idea of a unipolar world, moreover, an insistent unwillingness, disregard for a multipolar world.' President Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin have shared[2] a series of friendly phone calls in recent days, in which Trump shared U.S. intelligence to help thwart a terrorist attack in Russia, and Putin praised him for the stock market's performance. Adding to the back and forth, the tough words the strategy paper had for Russia were not matched[3] by Trump's speech on Monday rolling out the plan. </p><p>McMaster warns North Korea again. National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster told[4] CBS News on Tuesday that Trump asked Putin to do more to decrease trade with North Korea during those calls. On Monday, McMaster affirmed that[5] 'the president asked us to continue to refine a military option, should we have to use it,' in North Korea. The Norks did it. American officials announced Monday that North Korea was responsible for the WannaCry computer virus that struck hundreds of thousands of computers around the globe, demanding ransom in return for the encrypted contents of the machines. Tom Bossert, the top White House aide for homeland security and counterterrorism, made the announcement[6] in a Wall Street Journal op ed. News of North Korea's likely role in the outbreak first emerged[7] in March, when security firms spotted[8] similarities in the WannaCry and earlier North Korean cyberweapons. But key questions remain unanswered. Chief among them is the relationship between the hackers and Pyongyang. Another Houthi missile over Saudi. Saudi Arabian officials claim they knocked down[9] another ballistic missile heading for its capital of Riyadh on Tuesday, accusing the Houthi movement in neighbouring Yemen of firing the missile. Several witnesses in the Saudi capital[10] posted videos on social media showing a cloud of smoke in the air. The Houthis earlier said they had fired a Burkan-2 missile at the Yamama Palace. The Saudis and the United States have long accused Iran of supplying the Houthis, and United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley recently delivered[11] a dramatic speech showing off what the U.S. government claims was a missile that contained Iranian parts. MeanwhileAir strikes by the Saudi-led military coalition in Yemen have killed at least[12] 136 civilians since December 6, U.N. human rights spokesman Rupert Colville said on Tuesday. U.S. pushes for aid delivery to Yemen. Saudi Arabia has blocked the delivery of humanitarian aid to Yemen, worsening the humanitarian disaster that has unfolded in the war-torn country. State Department officials on Monday again pressed[13] for the delivery of World Food Program shipments to Yemen and the installation of new cranes at a key port amid a conflict in the nation that has killed or wounded more than 60,000 people. Japan goes big. Japanese officials announced Tuesday[14] they would vastly expand the country's ballistic missile defense system, licking off the process of buying and installing two U.S.-made ground-based Aegis radar stations and missile interceptors. The sites will likely cost at least $2 billion, and should be ready by around 2023. 'North Korea's nuclear missile development poses a new level of threat to Japan and as we have done in the past we will ensure that we are able to defend ourselves with a drastic improvement in ballistic missile defense,' Japanese Minister of Defence Itsunori Onodera told reporters after the Cabinet meeting. U.S. negotiating to stay in Iraq. American officials in Baghdad are working with their Iraqi counterparts to figure out how many U.S. troops will remain behind[15] once the fighting stops in the battle against the Islamic State. The Pentagon has about 5,200 troops on the ground now training and advising Iraqi forces, but the final number is expected to be less than that. American military officials have said they want to play a role in helping to train Baghdad's troops for years to come. Welcome to SitRep.

Officials from China's Cyberspace Administration of China have told the big tech companies that they better get comfortable[17] with Chinese surveillance and censorship if they want to have access to Chinese customers. Qi Xiaoxia, director of the agency's Bureau of International Cooperation said companies like Google, which left China in 2010 over censorship concerns, and Facebook, which hasn't yet made a jump into the Chinese market, are 'welcome' but 'The condition is that they have to abide by Chinese law and regulations. That is the bottom line.' Kaspersky fights back. Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Labs is suing the Trump administration[18] after it banned the federal government from purchasing Kaspersky security products based on security fears. Kaspersky lawyers say the government did not provide sufficient evidence for their decision and denied the company due process. Told you so. The FBI warned the Trump campaign[19] that it would be a target for foreign and specifically Russian espionage shortly after Trump became the Republican nominee, sources tell NBC News. Counterintelligence officials from the bureau offered a similar briefing to the Clinton campaign and began sharing the warnings shortly before the candidates began to receive customary intelligence briefings. Security jitters at U.S. air base. U.S. military personnel fired shots[20] at a man who drove through a security checkpoint at the American air base at RAF Mildenhall, in Suffolk, England. Authorities now say the incident wasn't related to terrorism but they're still trying to figure out how and why the man, who was slightly wounded in the incident, drove through security and ended a chase by a V-22 Osprey parked at the base. Murder of a British diplomat. Police in Lebanon have arrested a suspect in the murder of a British diplomat[21] found strangled in Beirut, obtaining a confession from an Uber driver after the woman, Rebecca Dykes, apparently used the ride hailing service. Foreign fighters. Defense officials tell CNN that the U.S.-led anti-Islamic State coalition has captured around 50 foreign fighters[22] from the Middle East, Europe, Africa and Southeast Asia in both Syria and Iraq since the beginning of November. Grounded. If you get a hobby drone for the holidays this year, you'll have to skip the over-the-cooling-tower fly-by shot because the Federal Aviation Administration is banning drone flights[23] over nuclear facilities.

What more do we know, Barbara? </p><p/><p> BARBARA STARR, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: Well, the incident now under investigation. U.S. military authorities are saying the six perished, there was one survivor, when the helicopter went down in southern Afghanistan.</p><p/><p> There are no initial indications of enemy fire in the area at the time. There are reports of engine failure.</p><p/><p> But, look, they're going to have to investigate all of this very thoroughly to figure out what exactly did happen.</p><p/><p> Terribly sad news, of course, for six U.S. military families going into the holiday season.</p><p/><p> For those who thing the war is winding down in Afghanistan, always worth remembering that our troops are still out there. Forty-two- thousand-plus still serving in Afghanistan.</p><p/><p> The number of casualties may be down this year, the number of troops down this year, but still, military families paying a very significant price for that service.</p><p/><p> Ashleigh? </p><p/><p> BANFIELD: And I know this is still early, Barbara, but they're saying engine failure.</p><p/><p> But what do we know about the potential for enemy activity in this area? </p><p/><p> STARR: There is enemy activity in the area. They do say, at this point, they had no reports of enemy fire at the time the aircraft went down.</p><p/><p> So what does that tell us? It tells us they had no radio call from the crew saying that they were under fire, because that would have happened if the crew was under fire and they had time to make a radio call.</p><p/><p> These are very standard procedures, very well understood, and no reports from any other aircraft flying in the area, by all accounts, that they were seeing enemy fire.</p><p/><p> Those are all the indicators you would very routinely get if there was enemy fire in the area.</p><p/><p> No reports of that at this time, but let's be clear, very early and they're going to investigate all of it, Ashleigh. </p><p/><p> BANFIELD: All right. Barbara Starr reporting for us live at the Pentagon. Thank you for that. </p><p/><p> I want to get you back here to the United States. No one's tweeting, no one's texting but we are pretty sure that President Obama is getting an earful this hour from some of the biggest names in technology.</p><p/><p> Top executives from Apple, from Yahoo, from Facebook, Google, Twitter, Comcast, Microsoft, and that, by the way, is just a few of the names, they're all behind a closed-door meeting at the White House, a meeting urging the president, among other things, to rein in the NSA.</p><p/><p> Their visit comes just hours after a U.S. district judge wrote that secretly collecting virtually every American's phone record is, quote, \"almost Orwellian,\" end quote, and certainly -- almost certainly, unconstitutional.</p><p/><p> Here is our chief national security correspondent Jim Sciutto.</p><p/><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p> JIM SCIUTTO, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Six months after Edward Snowden revealed it to the world, a federal judge ruled the NSA program that sweeps up Americans' phone call records is likely unconstitutional.</p><p/><p> The judge wrote, quote, \"I cannot imagine a more indiscriminate and arbitrary invasion than this systematic and high-tech collection and retention of personal data on virtually every citizen.\" Snowden described it as a vindication of his hacking, saying, \"I acted on my belief that the NSA's mass surveillance system would not withstand a constitutional challenge.</p><p/><p> \"Today a secret program authorized by a secret court was, when exposed to the light of day, found to violate American's rights.\"</p><p/><p> Snowden remains holed up in Russia, avoiding charges in the U.S. of espionage. But a senior NSA official floated an unlikely solution on CBS' \"60 Minutes\" to get Snowden back here. Give him amnesty, an idea that the White House quickly dismissed. </p><p/><p> JAY CARNEY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: He should be returned to the United States as soon as possible where he will be afforded all due process and protection in our system.</p><p/><p> So, that's our position and it has not changed. </p><p/><p> SCIUTTO: Still, the court's decision is a body blow for the administration. </p><p/><p> JEFFREY TOOBIN, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST: Well, it's just an absolutely scathing rejection of the NSA program that the government has defended so strongly.</p><p/><p> And it is worth noting that the judge was a George W. Bush appointee, someone who had worked for Republicans in Congress, hardly a screaming liberal.</p><p/><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p> BANFIELD: And Jim Sciutto joins me live now from Washington, D.C.</p><p/><p> Jim, if I could go back to Edward Snowden, who you mentioned in your report briefly.</p><p/><p> The concern regarding the amnesty was potentially to stop any further disclosures of sensitive information, and yet Edward Snowden is still busy today and he is active.</p><p/><p> What's he doing? </p><p/><p> SCIUTTO: That's right. He's written an open letter to the people of Brazil, published in a Brazilian paper, in effect offering help with Brazil as it fights back against this surveillance by the NSA, in return, though, in exchange for asylum.</p><p/><p> Here's what he wrote in this letter. He said, \"Many Brazilian senators agree and I have asked -- and have asked for my assistance with their investigations of suspected crimes against Brazilian citizens.</p><p/><p> \"I've expressed my willingness wherever appropriate and lawful, but unfortunately, the United States government has worked very hard to limit my ability to do so.\"</p><p/><p> Ashleigh, not a bad place for him to reach out. There are questions about how long he's welcome in Russia or how long he'll be happy in Russia, and Brazil is place where there's been severe opposition to NSA surveillance.</p><p/><p> You may remember during the U.N. general assembly, the Brazilian president called President Obama out on, calling it a violation of international law. It was known then that the NSA listening in even on her phone calls, the Brazilian president's phone calls.</p><p/><p> So, this is a fertile ground for Edward Snowden to seek support. That said, a lot of difficulties getting from Moscow to Brazil with the possibility of stopping plane travel.</p><p/><p> I mean, we had this case before when he was trying to get from Hong Kong to some other possible refuge, so questions there about whether they will accept this offer, or whether he can even get there if they did accept it. </p><p/><p> BANFIELD: All right, Jim Sciutto reporting for us live, thank you for that, from Washington, D.C.</p><p/><p> And still in Washington, D.C., a budget compromise just cleared a key vote in the Senate today with 12 Republicans joining the Democrats, all to get over the procedural hurdle and move on towards a full-on vote. That certainly shows some promise for that said final vote.</p><p/><p> Wolf Blitzer joins me live now to talk a little bit more about what's in store in the coming hours.</p><p/><p> I have often said that a good marriage requires someone to say, \"Yes, dear,\" even when perhaps they'd prefer not to say, \"Yes, dear,\" and that seems to be playing out in Washington, D.C.</p><p/><p> Some Republicans say this has just got to happen, others saying it's not that easy, that their jobs are on the line.</p><p/><p> What's going to happen later today? </p><p/><p> WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR, \"THE SITUATION ROOM\": Well, eventually, tomorrow, I think, the final vote will take place on the floor of the Senate. It needs 51 votes, a majority now that that procedural hurdle has been cleared, the so-called filibuster.</p><p/><p> So, now they just need 50 -- obviously, they have Joe Biden to break any tie in the U.S. Senate, so 51 votes. They'll have that. It will go to the president's desk. The president will sign it right away.</p><p/><p> The government will remain open. There won't be a shutdown this January. There won't be a shutdown in October just before the midterm elections when the next fiscal year starts.</p><p/><p> So, the government's going to remain open now for two years, but there's still a lot of issues out there on the table. This keeps the government going, but the feuding here in Washington, as you well know, Ashleigh, will continue. </p><p/><p> BANFIELD: And, as we continue to wait to see if those numbers crunch the way the Democrats hope they crunch, I also want to go to some other numbers that are crunching not the way President Obama would prefer.</p><p/><p> \"The Washington Post\" has a new poll out, asking the question -- Who do you trust to do a better job on the economy?</p><p/><p> And here is a look at some of the answers. Forty-one percent say Obama. Forty-five percent say the Republicans, instead. And you can see how those numbers have shifted from one year ago.</p><p/><p> This is not lost on the White House, although many would say they're just polls and polls can fluctuate. </p><p/><p> BLITZER: You know, it's really -- it's surprising to a certain degree, because if you take a look at the economy today as opposed to a year ago, it's probably stronger.</p><p/><p> You take a look at all sorts of indicators, including unemployment. It's down at its lowest level in five years since the Great Recession of 2008. The Dow Jones, the stock market, it was 7,000, the Dow Jones when the president took office. It's around 16,000 right now.</p><p/><p> Economic growth in the third quarter was, what, 3.5 percent, something along those lines.</p><p/><p> So, all the indicators show the economy is definitely improving today as opposed to a year ago, but the president's approval numbers as far as the economy's concerned, when compared to the Republicans, they've collapsed pretty much, and you see the contrast between last December and this December.</p><p/><p> And I think it's probably in large part because of the disappointment over the rollout of ObamaCare, the Affordable Care Act. A lot of people have lost confidence in the president, in his handling of the economy, simply because of the disastrous rollout of the health care.</p><p/><p> They've got to fix that. They've got to fix it quickly. The president will be able to come back if they do so. But I think that's been the major reason why people have lost confidence in the president's ability to deal with the economy. </p><p/><p> BANFIELD: Yeah, a 13-point drop. That's a pretty significant drop.</p><p/><p> Wolf Blitzer, thank you. And a reminder to all of our viewers and yours, Wolf, we'll see you at 1:00 Eastern this afternoon. Thank you. </p><p/><p> BLITZER: Thank you. </p><p/><p> BANFIELD: A lot of people are talking about getting lucky because it's lotto season.</p><p/><p> Do you know there's about a hall billion dollars up for stakes tonight in the drawing for the Mega Millions?</p><p/><p> And how about this? Did you know there's $800 million worth of lottery prizes every year that go uncollected because people either forget or they don't check their tickets.</p><p/><p> We're going to show you where this is most prevalent in just a moment.</p><p/><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p> BANFIELD: Checking some other top stories that we're following, a reminder today that the Syrian civil war continues to rage on, this photograph, a harrowing picture, shows the horror of that civil war in a very personal way, a Syrian man carrying the body of a child in what activists say was a government air strike in Aleppo on Sunday.</p><p/><p> The Associated Press says it has verified this photo which was handed out by a Syrian opposition media group. Human rights groups say that the attack killed more than 70 people. </p><p/><p> Some incredible pictures.  A video of a little boy sitting on the luggage counter at an airport in Poland. You can see the dad beside the child. He sort of takes off his jacket, getting ready to go through security. His son leans closer and closer to the edge and nearly falls off, but the dive, you can see it on the left-hand side of the screen.  The security guard leans in and catches him. Dives in to do that. And by the way, for his heroic efforts that security guard got a bonus.  Take a look one more time.  Leaning over.  Until -- in comes the security guard for the catch.  Love to hear that.  </p><p/><p> You want a shot at more money than you'd ever know what to do with? Make sure you get a Mega Millions ticket today, because the jackpot for tonight's drawing is at $586 million.  I had to look down because I needed to double-check it each time I see those numbers.  Here's the problem.  The odds are super long like really long like supercalifragilistically long.</p><p/><p> But somebody has to win it, you would think anyway. Alison Kosik joins me live now in New York.  I'm assuming the lines are long but the odds are longer, and they got longer even since we last played this game, you and I, on the TV when the Mega Millions jackpot was huge.  What's up?  </p><p/><p> ALISON KOSIK, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: You're looking at the line form right now, Ashleigh.  This is the time where people are getting to work, making multiple trips here, buying multiple tickets.  This gentleman here, this is his fourth time.  He's kind of the designating office runner for the lotto ticket. </p><p/><p> You look at this jackpot -- $586 million.  Guess what?  That's what the estimated jackpot was yesterday afternoon.  Seeing this line you can only imagine how much that jackpot is growing.  If this Lotto rolls over again, if nobody wins it tonight, it's going to roll over again and the next drawing is Friday and the jackpot could be as much as $800 million.  If it rolls over again, by Christmas, Christmas eve it could be $1 billion.  </p><p/><p> You know why this keeps rolling over?  Because this game actually changed the rules in October.  It made it a little more difficult to win.  When you go in and pick these numbers out, you used to be able to pick between fewer numbers, between 1 and 56. Now you have to choose between 1 and 75.  To get the gold ball, you chosen between 1 and 46. Now you choose between 1 and 15.  So, that sort of combination means there are more combinations of numbers, less chance of winning. That's why the odds are 1 in 259 million that you'll actually hit the jackpot, Ashleigh.  </p><p/><p> BANFIELD: Yes, but still people come streaming in there thinking they have a little hope at glory and a little, you know, easy life ahead.  </p><p/><p> KOSIK: Yes.  </p><p/><p> BANFIELD: Let me ask you this.  </p><p/><p> KOSIK: I'm all about -- I just have to say I'm all about hope and glory.  I've got a dollar here.  </p><p/><p> BANFIELD: Adorable.  </p><p/><p> KOSIK: I've got my numbers picked out.  I'm going to join the line. Although I have to split the ticket with a friend if I win. I'm so willing to do it.</p><p/><p> BANFIELD: So, which one of you is actually going to check to see if the ticket wins? There's this incredible story out, Alison.  I could not believe that there's $800 million in unclaimed prizes. We're talking about not even a $600 million jackpot that's got everybody going bananas, and there's $800 million out there that people have either forgotten about or, you know, lost a ticket, or maybe didn't think that they played that week.  What is that about?  </p><p/><p> KOSIK: The thing is if you don't win the jackpot and you bought a bunch of tickets you want to look over your tickets carefully because what the stats show is a lot of people walk away from a lot of money and you said it,  $800 million in Lotto prizes that, poof, aren't picked up every single year. You look at New York, $65 million in prize money just walked away from.  Some of the prizes are big.  You know, if you don't hit the jackpot, all the numbers, you can still have enough numbers where you can win up to a million dollars in some cases.  </p><p/><p> BANFIELD:  $65 million in New York.  I can't believe that's just sitting on the table, people.  You know what?  I'm in a Lotto pool every week.  We're going to have to recheck those tickets.  Alison, thank you and good luck to you.  Although she'd better come back to work because we really like her here.  </p><p/><p> Do you remember the thousands of passengers drifting for days on the Carnival Triumph?  No power, no lights, and infamously no flushing toilets which led to pictures of sewage in orange bags all around the deck. Don't book your winter cruise until you see the CNN investigation about Triumph, and what they may have known before that ship set sail. Our Drew Griffin is keeping them honest.  Next.  </p><p/><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p/><p> BANFIELD: It's no secret we've been doing a lot of weather stories lately.  It's cold and the weather is pretty lousy for a lot of you at this time of year.  So this might be the season where you're dreaming of a winter getaway at sea.  Or maybe not because who can forget last February when more than 3,000 passengers were stuck aboard the Carnival Triumph. S.O.S. read the bed sheet.  It became what is known as the \"poop cruise.\"  No light, not much food or water, and unfortunately no flushing toilets.  </p><p/><p> Now CNN has learned in an exclusive investigation that the ship set sail with only four of six generators operational, knowing that the company had an ongoing generator fire hazard, and not just on the Triumph, but on the ships across the fleet.  CNN INVESTIGATON's  Drew Griffin is keeping them honest.  </p><p/><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p> BETTINA RODRIGUEZ PASSENGER: This was supposed to be the fun ship, and we were basically having to fend for ourselves.</p><p/><p> GRIFFIN (voice-over): Bettina Rodriguez and her daughter, Isabelle, have planned this cruise for half a year. They would sail on the Carnival Triumph and celebrate Isabelle's birthday. It was the trip of a lifetime until they awoke to a fire alarm, smoke in the hallway, and then days and days of misery. Human waste was piling up just outside their door.</p><p/><p> RODRIGUEZ: Just on our deck alone, there were the biohazard bags lined up across the floor. We're talking about raw sewage at just the end of our deck alone. It was --</p><p/><p> GRIFFIN (on camera): Really?</p><p/><p> RODRIGUEZ: It was repulsive.</p><p/><p> GRIFFIN (voice-over): It was, according to Rodriguez, a nightmare -- now made even worse because of these. The cruise line's own reports, inspections and maintenance records detailed the problem that had been developing on board the Carnival Triumph more than a year before Rodriguez and her daughter were on board.</p><p/><p> Houston attorney Frank Spagnoletti obtained the documents in his lawsuit against Carnival.</p><p/><p> FRANK SPAGNOLETTI, PLAINTIFF'S ATTORNEY: That ship should have never set sail in February. It was un-seaworthy at the convention of the voyage. These documents tell you that the company -- and I'm saying to you the corporation back in Miami -- had knowledge of the fact that this vessel had a propensity for fires, that there were things that could have been, should have been, and weren't done in order to make sure that fires didn't take place.</p><p/><p> DREW GRIFFIN, CNN INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT: The first trouble with triumph, diesel generator number six, the one that ended up catching fire. Starting more than a year before the infamous cruise, diesel generator number six was overdue for maintenance, out of compliance with the safety laws of the sea, known as SOLAS, according to the ship's own engineer. Over and over again, Carnival's own maintenance reports say the same thing. Diesel generator number six, overdue for maintenance. And during that same time period, Carnival learned about another, even more alarming safety problem in the engine room. Fuel lines. A dangerous pattern of leaks that emerged on other Carnival cruise ships. In fact, Carnival Costas (ph) Allegra caught fire because fuel leaked onto a hot spot and ignited.</p><p/><p> It would be the ultimate foreshadowing. Consider this: Carnival's own investigation shows the fire on board the Costa Allegra, is believed to be caused by a fuel leak on one of the diesel generators, eerily similar to what would start the fire onboard the Triumph one year later.</p><p/><p> Carnival says it proactively began investigating and found a big problem in a different type of fuel line. There had been nine -- that's right, nine incidents resulting in fuel leaks associated with flexible fuel lines in just two years. On January 2nd, Carnival issues a compliance order, giving ships two months to address the problem, to ensure a suitable spray shield is installed for all diesel engines, using the flexible fuel lines. Mark Jackson is Carnival's chief engineer.</p><p/><p> MARK JACKSON, V.P. TECHNICAL OPERATIONS, CARNIVAL CRUISE LINES: After that internal study, the company came out with a new policy to, again, shield all of the flanges and the hoses that were below the deck plates.</p><p/><p> GRIFFIN: But you didn't shield the one hose that wound up causing this tragedy. </p><p/><p> JACKSON: That hose was beneath the deck plates and it was believed that the deck plates would act as that shield. In this case, it found that gap in the hose - that gap in the bilge plates and caused that fire.</p><p/><p> GRIFFIN: On February 7th with the diesel generator still in need of overhaul and fuel line shields on some but not all of its flexible hoses, Triumph set sail from Galveston, Texas.</p><p/><p> JACKSON: We were in total compliance with the rules and regulations. We had our regulating bodies onboard the vessel less than two weeks before, that had certified the ship safe to sail.</p><p/><p> Obviously, you learn things on a situation - on an incident such as the Triumph.</p><p/><p> GRIFFIN: Three days later, off the coast of Mexico, fire breaks out in diesel generator number six when fuel sprays from a flexible fuel line, a line that was less than six months old.</p><p/><p> Drew Griffin, CNN, Houston, Texas.  </p><p/><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p> BANFIELD: Carnival says this was an accident, not negligence, but the company did dedicate $300 million in a safety upgrade fleet-wide. Carnival does point out that the passengers have no right to sue, and this is unusual, because its attorneys say when you buy your ticket, and I'm going to quote, \"the ticket contract makes absolutely no guarantee for safe passage, a seaworthy vessel, adequate and wholesome food, and sanitary and safe living conditions.\" </p><p/><p> Let that sit in for a while.  Carnival is trying to get this suit tossed.  Passengers are obviously going to challenge it in court and they'll have their chance to do so in February when the case is set to go to trial.  </p><p/><p> Coming up next, I want you to watch a piece of video where a high school senior goes to give a hug to a teacher.  Do you see anything untoward there?  What you're watching gave that young man a year-long suspension from school and maybe a whole lot more than that.  Sit worth it?  Is there something more up?  we'll going to explain this in just a moment.  </p><p/><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p> [Byline: Ashleigh Banfield, Barbara Starr, Jim Sciutto, Jeffrey Toobin, Wolf Blitzer, Drew Griffin, Alison Kosik ] [High: The single-biggest loss of life in months for NATO troops in Afghanistan, six Americans were killed today in a helicopter crash in a southern province.

The diving catch saves the day. The best landing perhaps this airport has ever seen. We'll take you inside that video in just a moment.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hello, everyone. I'm Ashleigh Banfield. It is Tuesday, December 17th. Welcome to LEGAL VIEW. It's nice to have you with us today.</p><p/><p>Let's begin here. This hour, the single-biggest loss of life in months for NATO troops in Afghanistan, six Americans were killed today in a helicopter crash in a southern province there.</p><p/><p>I want to get you live right away to our Pentagon correspondent Barbara Starr, who joins me with more of the details.</p><p/><p>You've been following this. What more do we know, Barbara?</p><p/><p>BARBARA STARR, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: Well, the incident now under investigation. U.S. military authorities are saying the six perished, there was one survivor, when the helicopter went down in southern Afghanistan.</p><p/><p>There are no initial indications of enemy fire in the area at the time. There are reports of engine failure.</p><p/><p>But, look, they're going to have to investigate all of this very thoroughly to figure out what exactly did happen.</p><p/><p>Terribly sad news, of course, for six U.S. military families going into the holiday season.</p><p/><p>For those who thing the war is winding down in Afghanistan, always worth remembering that our troops are still out there. Forty-two- thousand-plus still serving in Afghanistan.</p><p/><p>The number of casualties may be down this year, the number of troops down this year, but still, military families paying a very significant price for that service.</p><p/><p>Ashleigh?</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: And I know this is still early, Barbara, but they're saying engine failure.</p><p/><p>But what do we know about the potential for enemy activity in this area?</p><p/><p>STARR: There is enemy activity in the area. They do say, at this point, they had no reports of enemy fire at the time the aircraft went down.</p><p/><p>So what does that tell us? It tells us they had no radio call from the crew saying that they were under fire, because that would have happened if the crew was under fire and they had time to make a radio call.</p><p/><p>These are very standard procedures, very well understood, and no reports from any other aircraft flying in the area, by all accounts, that they were seeing enemy fire.</p><p/><p>Those are all the indicators you would very routinely get if there was enemy fire in the area.</p><p/><p>No reports of that at this time, but let's be clear, very early and they're going to investigate all of it, Ashleigh.</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: All right. Barbara Starr reporting for us live at the Pentagon. Thank you for that.</p><p/><p>I want to get you back here to the United States. No one's tweeting, no one's texting but we are pretty sure that President Obama is getting an earful this hour from some of the biggest names in technology.</p><p/><p>Top executives from Apple, from Yahoo, from Facebook, Google, Twitter, Comcast, Microsoft, and that, by the way, is just a few of the names, they're all behind a closed-door meeting at the White House, a meeting urging the president, among other things, to rein in the NSA.</p><p/><p>Their visit comes just hours after a U.S. district judge wrote that secretly collecting virtually every American's phone record is, quote, \"almost Orwellian,\" end quote, and certainly -- almost certainly, unconstitutional.</p><p/><p>Here is our chief national security correspondent Jim Sciutto.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>JIM SCIUTTO, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Six months after Edward Snowden revealed it to the world, a federal judge ruled the NSA program that sweeps up Americans' phone call records is likely unconstitutional.</p><p/><p>The judge wrote, quote, \"I cannot imagine a more indiscriminate and arbitrary invasion than this systematic and high-tech collection and retention of personal data on virtually every citizen.\" Snowden described it as a vindication of his hacking, saying, \"I acted on my belief that the NSA's mass surveillance system would not withstand a constitutional challenge.</p><p/><p>\"Today a secret program authorized by a secret court was, when exposed to the light of day, found to violate American's rights.\"</p><p/><p>Snowden remains holed up in Russia, avoiding charges in the U.S. of espionage. But a senior NSA official floated an unlikely solution on CBS' \"60 Minutes\" to get Snowden back here. Give him amnesty, an idea that the White House quickly dismissed.</p><p/><p>JAY CARNEY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: He should be returned to the United States as soon as possible where he will be afforded all due process and protection in our system.</p><p/><p>So, that's our position and it has not changed.</p><p/><p>SCIUTTO: Still, the court's decision is a body blow for the administration.</p><p/><p>JEFFREY TOOBIN, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST: Well, it's just an absolutely scathing rejection of the NSA program that the government has defended so strongly.</p><p/><p>And it is worth noting that the judge was a George W. Bush appointee, someone who had worked for Republicans in Congress, hardly a screaming liberal.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: And Jim Sciutto joins me live now from Washington, D.C.</p><p/><p>Jim, if I could go back to Edward Snowden, who you mentioned in your report briefly.</p><p/><p>The concern regarding the amnesty was potentially to stop any further disclosures of sensitive information, and yet Edward Snowden is still busy today and he is active.</p><p/><p>What's he doing?</p><p/><p>SCIUTTO: That's right. He's written an open letter to the people of Brazil, published in a Brazilian paper, in effect offering help with Brazil as it fights back against this surveillance by the NSA, in return, though, in exchange for asylum.</p><p/><p>Here's what he wrote in this letter. He said, \"Many Brazilian senators agree and I have asked -- and have asked for my assistance with their investigations of suspected crimes against Brazilian citizens.</p><p/><p>\"I've expressed my willingness wherever appropriate and lawful, but unfortunately, the United States government has worked very hard to limit my ability to do so.\"</p><p/><p>Ashleigh, not a bad place for him to reach out. There are questions about how long he's welcome in Russia or how long he'll be happy in Russia, and Brazil is place where there's been severe opposition to NSA surveillance.</p><p/><p>You may remember during the U.N. general assembly, the Brazilian president called President Obama out on, calling it a violation of international law. It was known then that the NSA listening in even on her phone calls, the Brazilian president's phone calls.</p><p/><p>So, this is a fertile ground for Edward Snowden to seek support. That said, a lot of difficulties getting from Moscow to Brazil with the possibility of stopping plane travel.</p><p/><p>I mean, we had this case before when he was trying to get from Hong Kong to some other possible refuge, so questions there about whether they will accept this offer, or whether he can even get there if they did accept it.</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: All right, Jim Sciutto reporting for us live, thank you for that, from Washington, D.C.</p><p/><p>And still in Washington, D.C., a budget compromise just cleared a key vote in the Senate today with 12 Republicans joining the Democrats, all to get over the procedural hurdle and move on towards a full-on vote. That certainly shows some promise for that said final vote.</p><p/><p>Wolf Blitzer joins me live now to talk a little bit more about what's in store in the coming hours.</p><p/><p>I have often said that a good marriage requires someone to say, \"Yes, dear,\" even when perhaps they'd prefer not to say, \"Yes, dear,\" and that seems to be playing out in Washington, D.C.</p><p/><p>Some Republicans say this has just got to happen, others saying it's not that easy, that their jobs are on the line.</p><p/><p>What's going to happen later today?</p><p/><p>WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR, \"THE SITUATION ROOM\": Well, eventually, tomorrow, I think, the final vote will take place on the floor of the Senate. It needs 51 votes, a majority now that that procedural hurdle has been cleared, the so-called filibuster.</p><p/><p>So, now they just need 50 -- obviously, they have Joe Biden to break any tie in the U.S. Senate, so 51 votes. They'll have that. It will go to the president's desk. The president will sign it right away.</p><p/><p>The government will remain open. There won't be a shutdown this January. There won't be a shutdown in October just before the midterm elections when the next fiscal year starts.</p><p/><p>So, the government's going to remain open now for two years, but there's still a lot of issues out there on the table. This keeps the government going, but the feuding here in Washington, as you well know, Ashleigh, will continue.</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: And, as we continue to wait to see if those numbers crunch the way the Democrats hope they crunch, I also want to go to some other numbers that are crunching not the way President Obama would prefer.</p><p/><p>\"The Washington Post\" has a new poll out, asking the question -- Who do you trust to do a better job on the economy?</p><p/><p>And here is a look at some of the answers. Forty-one percent say Obama. Forty-five percent say the Republicans, instead. And you can see how those numbers have shifted from one year ago.</p><p/><p>This is not lost on the White House, although many would say they're just polls and polls can fluctuate.</p><p/><p>BLITZER: You know, it's really -- it's surprising to a certain degree, because if you take a look at the economy today as opposed to a year ago, it's probably stronger.</p><p/><p>You take a look at all sorts of indicators, including unemployment. It's down at its lowest level in five years since the Great Recession of 2008. The Dow Jones, the stock market, it was 7,000, the Dow Jones when the president took office. It's around 16,000 right now.</p><p/><p>Economic growth in the third quarter was, what, 3.5 percent, something along those lines.</p><p/><p>So, all the indicators show the economy is definitely improving today as opposed to a year ago, but the president's approval numbers as far as the economy's concerned, when compared to the Republicans, they've collapsed pretty much, and you see the contrast between last December and this December.</p><p/><p>And I think it's probably in large part because of the disappointment over the rollout of ObamaCare, the Affordable Care Act. A lot of people have lost confidence in the president, in his handling of the economy, simply because of the disastrous rollout of the health care.</p><p/><p>They've got to fix that. They've got to fix it quickly. The president will be able to come back if they do so. But I think that's been the major reason why people have lost confidence in the president's ability to deal with the economy.</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: Yeah, a 13-point drop. That's a pretty significant drop.</p><p/><p>Wolf Blitzer, thank you. And a reminder to all of our viewers and yours, Wolf, we'll see you at 1:00 Eastern this afternoon. Thank you.</p><p/><p>BLITZER: Thank you.</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: A lot of people are talking about getting lucky because it's lotto season.</p><p/><p>Do you know there's about a hall billion dollars up for stakes tonight in the drawing for the Mega Millions?</p><p/><p>And how about this? Did you know there's $800 million worth of lottery prizes every year that go uncollected because people either forget or they don't check their tickets.</p><p/><p>We're going to show you where this is most prevalent in just a moment.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: Checking some other top stories that we're following, a reminder today that the Syrian civil war continues to rage on, this photograph, a harrowing picture, shows the horror of that civil war in a very personal way, a Syrian man carrying the body of a child in what activists say was a government air strike in Aleppo on Sunday.</p><p/><p>The Associated Press says it has verified this photo which was handed out by a Syrian opposition media group. Human rights groups say that the attack killed more than 70 people.</p><p/><p>Some incredible pictures. A video of a little boy sitting on the luggage counter at an airport in Poland. You can see the dad beside the child. He sort of takes off his jacket, getting ready to go through security. His son leans closer and closer to the edge and nearly falls off, but the dive, you can see it on the left-hand side of the screen. The security guard leans in and catches him. Dives in to do that. And by the way, for his heroic efforts that security guard got a bonus. Take a look one more time. Leaning over. Until -- in comes the security guard for the catch. Love to hear that.</p><p/><p>You want a shot at more money than you'd ever know what to do with? Make sure you get a Mega Millions ticket today, because the jackpot for tonight's drawing is at $586 million. I had to look down because I needed to double-check it each time I see those numbers. Here's the problem. The odds are super long like really long like supercalifragilistically long.</p><p/><p>But somebody has to win it, you would think anyway. Alison Kosik joins me live now in New York. I'm assuming the lines are long but the odds are longer, and they got longer even since we last played this game, you and I, on the TV when the Mega Millions jackpot was huge. What's up?</p><p/><p>ALISON KOSIK, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: You're looking at the line form right now, Ashleigh. This is the time where people are getting to work, making multiple trips here, buying multiple tickets. This gentleman here, this is his fourth time. He's kind of the designating office runner for the lotto ticket.</p><p/><p>You look at this jackpot -- $586 million. Guess what? That's what the estimated jackpot was yesterday afternoon. Seeing this line you can only imagine how much that jackpot is growing. If this Lotto rolls over again, if nobody wins it tonight, it's going to roll over again and the next drawing is Friday and the jackpot could be as much as $800 million. If it rolls over again, by Christmas, Christmas eve it could be $1 billion.</p><p/><p>You know why this keeps rolling over? Because this game actually changed the rules in October. It made it a little more difficult to win. When you go in and pick these numbers out, you used to be able to pick between fewer numbers, between 1 and 56. Now you have to choose between 1 and 75. To get the gold ball, you chosen between 1 and 46. Now you choose between 1 and 15. So, that sort of combination means there are more combinations of numbers, less chance of winning. That's why the odds are 1 in 259 million that you'll actually hit the jackpot, Ashleigh.</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: Yes, but still people come streaming in there thinking they have a little hope at glory and a little, you know, easy life ahead.</p><p/><p>KOSIK: Yes.</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: Let me ask you this.</p><p/><p>KOSIK: I'm all about -- I just have to say I'm all about hope and glory. I've got a dollar here.</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: Adorable.</p><p/><p>KOSIK: I've got my numbers picked out. I'm going to join the line. Although I have to split the ticket with a friend if I win. I'm so willing to do it.</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: So, which one of you is actually going to check to see if the ticket wins? There's this incredible story out, Alison. I could not believe that there's $800 million in unclaimed prizes. We're talking about not even a $600 million jackpot that's got everybody going bananas, and there's $800 million out there that people have either forgotten about or, you know, lost a ticket, or maybe didn't think that they played that week. What is that about?</p><p/><p>KOSIK: The thing is if you don't win the jackpot and you bought a bunch of tickets you want to look over your tickets carefully because what the stats show is a lot of people walk away from a lot of money and you said it, $800 million in Lotto prizes that, poof, aren't picked up every single year. You look at New York, $65 million in prize money just walked away from. Some of the prizes are big. You know, if you don't hit the jackpot, all the numbers, you can still have enough numbers where you can win up to a million dollars in some cases.</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: $65 million in New York. I can't believe that's just sitting on the table, people. You know what? I'm in a Lotto pool every week. We're going to have to recheck those tickets. Alison, thank you and good luck to you. Although she'd better come back to work because we really like her here.</p><p/><p>Do you remember the thousands of passengers drifting for days on the Carnival Triumph? No power, no lights, and infamously no flushing toilets which led to pictures of sewage in orange bags all around the deck. Don't book your winter cruise until you see the CNN investigation about Triumph, and what they may have known before that ship set sail. Our Drew Griffin is keeping them honest. Next.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: It's no secret we've been doing a lot of weather stories lately. It's cold and the weather is pretty lousy for a lot of you at this time of year. So this might be the season where you're dreaming of a winter getaway at sea. Or maybe not because who can forget last February when more than 3,000 passengers were stuck aboard the Carnival Triumph. S.O.S. read the bed sheet. It became what is known as the \"poop cruise.\" No light, not much food or water, and unfortunately no flushing toilets.</p><p/><p>Now CNN has learned in an exclusive investigation that the ship set sail with only four of six generators operational, knowing that the company had an ongoing generator fire hazard, and not just on the Triumph, but on the ships across the fleet. CNN INVESTIGATON's Drew Griffin is keeping them honest.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>BETTINA RODRIGUEZ PASSENGER: This was supposed to be the fun ship, and we were basically having to fend for ourselves.</p><p/><p>GRIFFIN (voice-over): Bettina Rodriguez and her daughter, Isabelle, have planned this cruise for half a year. They would sail on the Carnival Triumph and celebrate Isabelle's birthday. It was the trip of a lifetime until they awoke to a fire alarm, smoke in the hallway, and then days and days of misery. Human waste was piling up just outside their door.</p><p/><p>RODRIGUEZ: Just on our deck alone, there were the biohazard bags lined up across the floor. We're talking about raw sewage at just the end of our deck alone. It was --</p><p/><p>GRIFFIN (on camera): Really?</p><p/><p>RODRIGUEZ: It was repulsive.</p><p/><p>GRIFFIN (voice-over): It was, according to Rodriguez, a nightmare -- now made even worse because of these. The cruise line's own reports, inspections and maintenance records detailed the problem that had been developing on board the Carnival Triumph more than a year before Rodriguez and her daughter were on board.</p><p/><p>Houston attorney Frank Spagnoletti obtained the documents in his lawsuit against Carnival.</p><p/><p>FRANK SPAGNOLETTI, PLAINTIFF'S ATTORNEY: That ship should have never set sail in February. It was un-seaworthy at the convention of the voyage. These documents tell you that the company -- and I'm saying to you the corporation back in Miami -- had knowledge of the fact that this vessel had a propensity for fires, that there were things that could have been, should have been, and weren't done in order to make sure that fires didn't take place.</p><p/><p>DREW GRIFFIN, CNN INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT: The first trouble with triumph, diesel generator number six, the one that ended up catching fire. Starting more than a year before the infamous cruise, diesel generator number six was overdue for maintenance, out of compliance with the safety laws of the sea, known as SOLAS, according to the ship's own engineer. Over and over again, Carnival's own maintenance reports say the same thing. Diesel generator number six, overdue for maintenance. And during that same time period, Carnival learned about another, even more alarming safety problem in the engine room. Fuel lines. A dangerous pattern of leaks that emerged on other Carnival cruise ships. In fact, Carnival Costas (ph) Allegra caught fire because fuel leaked onto a hot spot and ignited.</p><p/><p>It would be the ultimate foreshadowing. Consider this: Carnival's own investigation shows the fire on board the Costa Allegra, is believed to be caused by a fuel leak on one of the diesel generators, eerily similar to what would start the fire onboard the Triumph one year later.</p><p/><p>Carnival says it proactively began investigating and found a big problem in a different type of fuel line. There had been nine -- that's right, nine incidents resulting in fuel leaks associated with flexible fuel lines in just two years. On January 2nd, Carnival issues a compliance order, giving ships two months to address the problem, to ensure a suitable spray shield is installed for all diesel engines, using the flexible fuel lines. Mark Jackson is Carnival's chief engineer.</p><p/><p>MARK JACKSON, V.P. TECHNICAL OPERATIONS, CARNIVAL CRUISE LINES: After that internal study, the company came out with a new policy to, again, shield all of the flanges and the hoses that were below the deck plates.</p><p/><p>GRIFFIN: But you didn't shield the one hose that wound up causing this tragedy.</p><p/><p>JACKSON: That hose was beneath the deck plates and it was believed that the deck plates would act as that shield. In this case, it found that gap in the hose - that gap in the bilge plates and caused that fire.</p><p/><p>GRIFFIN: On February 7th with the diesel generator still in need of overhaul and fuel line shields on some but not all of its flexible hoses, Triumph set sail from Galveston, Texas.</p><p/><p>JACKSON: We were in total compliance with the rules and regulations. We had our regulating bodies onboard the vessel less than two weeks before, that had certified the ship safe to sail.</p><p/><p>Obviously, you learn things on a situation - on an incident such as the Triumph.</p><p/><p>GRIFFIN: Three days later, off the coast of Mexico, fire breaks out in diesel generator number six when fuel sprays from a flexible fuel line, a line that was less than six months old.</p><p/><p>Drew Griffin, CNN, Houston, Texas.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: Carnival says this was an accident, not negligence, but the company did dedicate $300 million in a safety upgrade fleet-wide. Carnival does point out that the passengers have no right to sue, and this is unusual, because its attorneys say when you buy your ticket, and I'm going to quote, \"the ticket contract makes absolutely no guarantee for safe passage, a seaworthy vessel, adequate and wholesome food, and sanitary and safe living conditions.\"</p><p/><p>Let that sit in for a while. Carnival is trying to get this suit tossed. Passengers are obviously going to challenge it in court and they'll have their chance to do so in February when the case is set to go to trial.</p><p/><p>Coming up next, I want you to watch a piece of video where a high school senior goes to give a hug to a teacher. Do you see anything untoward there? What you're watching gave that young man a year-long suspension from school and maybe a whole lot more than that. Sit worth it? Is there something more up? we'll going to explain this in just a moment.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>[Byline: Ashleigh Banfield, Barbara Starr, Jim Sciutto, Jeffrey Toobin, Wolf Blitzer, Drew Griffin, Alison Kosik ] [High: The single-biggest loss of life in months for NATO troops in Afghanistan, six Americans were killed today in a helicopter crash in a southern province.

The diving catch saves the day. The best landing perhaps this airport has ever seen. We'll take you inside that video in just a moment.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hello, everyone. I'm Ashleigh Banfield. It is Tuesday, December 17th. Welcome to LEGAL VIEW. It's nice to have you with us today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Let's begin here. This hour, the single-biggest loss of life in months for NATO troops in Afghanistan, six Americans were killed today in a helicopter crash in a southern province there.</p><p>I want to get you live right away to our Pentagon correspondent Barbara Starr, who joins me with more of the details.</p><p>You've been following this. What more do we know, Barbara?</p><p>BARBARA STARR, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: Well, the incident now under investigation. U.S. military authorities are saying the six perished, there was one survivor, when the helicopter went down in southern Afghanistan.</p><p>There are no initial indications of enemy fire in the area at the time. There are reports of engine failure.</p><p>But, look, they're going to have to investigate all of this very thoroughly to figure out what exactly did happen.</p><p>Terribly sad news, of course, for six U.S. military families going into the holiday season.</p><p>For those who thing the war is winding down in Afghanistan, always worth remembering that our troops are still out there. Forty-two- thousand-plus still serving in Afghanistan.</p><p>The number of casualties may be down this year, the number of troops down this year, but still, military families paying a very significant price for that service.</p><p>Ashleigh?</p><p>BANFIELD: And I know this is still early, Barbara, but they're saying engine failure.</p><p>But what do we know about the potential for enemy activity in this area?</p><p>STARR: There is enemy activity in the area. They do say, at this point, they had no reports of enemy fire at the time the aircraft went down.</p><p>So what does that tell us? It tells us they had no radio call from the crew saying that they were under fire, because that would have happened if the crew was under fire and they had time to make a radio call.</p><p>These are very standard procedures, very well understood, and no reports from any other aircraft flying in the area, by all accounts, that they were seeing enemy fire.</p><p>Those are all the indicators you would very routinely get if there was enemy fire in the area.</p><p>No reports of that at this time, but let's be clear, very early and they're going to investigate all of it, Ashleigh.</p><p>BANFIELD: All right. Barbara Starr reporting for us live at the Pentagon. Thank you for that.</p><p>I want to get you back here to the United States. No one's tweeting, no one's texting but we are pretty sure that <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>is getting an earful this hour from some of the biggest names in technology.</p><p>Top executives from Apple, from Yahoo, from Facebook, Google, Twitter, Comcast, Microsoft, and that, by the way, is just a few of the names, they're all behind a closed-door meeting at the White House, a meeting urging the president, among other things, to rein in the NSA.</p><p>Their visit comes just hours after a U.S. district judge wrote that secretly collecting virtually every American's phone record is, quote, \"almost Orwellian,\" end quote, and certainly -- almost certainly, unconstitutional.</p><p>Here is our chief national security correspondent Jim Sciutto.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JIM SCIUTTO, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Six months after Edward Snowden revealed it to the world, a federal judge ruled the NSA program that sweeps up Americans' phone call records is likely unconstitutional.</p><p>The judge wrote, quote, \"I cannot imagine a more indiscriminate and arbitrary invasion than this systematic and high-tech collection and retention of personal data on virtually every citizen.\" Snowden described it as a vindication of his hacking, saying, \"I acted on my belief that the NSA's mass surveillance system would not withstand a constitutional challenge.</p><p>\"Today a secret program authorized by a secret court was, when exposed to the light of day, found to violate American's rights.\"</p><p>Snowden remains holed up in Russia, avoiding charges in the U.S. of espionage. But a senior NSA official floated an unlikely solution on CBS' \"60 Minutes\" to get Snowden back here. Give him amnesty, an idea that the White House quickly dismissed.</p><p>JAY CARNEY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: He should be returned to the United States as soon as possible where he will be afforded all due process and protection in our system.</p><p>So, that's our position and it has not changed.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Still, the court's decision is a body blow for the administration.</p><p>JEFFREY TOOBIN, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST: Well, it's just an absolutely scathing rejection of the NSA program that the government has defended so strongly.</p><p>And it is worth noting that the judge was a George W. Bush appointee, someone who had worked for Republicans in Congress, hardly a screaming liberal.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BANFIELD: And Jim Sciutto joins me live now from Washington, D.C.</p><p>Jim, if I could go back to Edward Snowden, who you mentioned in your report briefly.</p><p>The concern regarding the amnesty was potentially to stop any further disclosures of sensitive information, and yet Edward Snowden is still busy today and he is active.</p><p>What's he doing?</p><p>SCIUTTO: That's right. He's written an open letter to the people of Brazil, published in a Brazilian paper, in effect offering help with Brazil as it fights back against this surveillance by the NSA, in return, though, in exchange for asylum.</p><p>Here's what he wrote in this letter. He said, \"Many Brazilian senators agree and I have asked -- and have asked for my assistance with their investigations of suspected crimes against Brazilian citizens.</p><p>\"I've expressed my willingness wherever appropriate and lawful, but unfortunately, the United States government has worked very hard to limit my ability to do so.\"</p><p>Ashleigh, not a bad place for him to reach out. There are questions about how long he's welcome in Russia or how long he'll be happy in Russia, and Brazil is place where there's been severe opposition to NSA surveillance.</p><p>You may remember during the U.N. general assembly, the Brazilian president called <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>out on, calling it a violation of international law. It was known then that the NSA listening in even on her phone calls, the Brazilian president's phone calls.</p><p>So, this is a fertile ground for Edward Snowden to seek support. That said, a lot of difficulties getting from Moscow to Brazil with the possibility of stopping plane travel.</p><p>I mean, we had this case before when he was trying to get from Hong Kong to some other possible refuge, so questions there about whether they will accept this offer, or whether he can even get there if they did accept it.</p><p>BANFIELD: All right, Jim Sciutto reporting for us live, thank you for that, from Washington, D.C.</p><p>And still in Washington, D.C., a budget compromise just cleared a key vote in the Senate today with 12 Republicans joining the Democrats, all to get over the procedural hurdle and move on towards a full-on vote. That certainly shows some promise for that said final vote.</p><p>Wolf Blitzer joins me live now to talk a little bit more about what's in store in the coming hours.</p><p>I have often said that a good marriage requires someone to say, \"Yes, dear,\" even when perhaps they'd prefer not to say, \"Yes, dear,\" and that seems to be playing out in Washington, D.C.</p><p>Some Republicans say this has just got to happen, others saying it's not that easy, that their jobs are on the line.</p><p>What's going to happen later today?</p><p>WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR, \"THE SITUATION ROOM\": Well, eventually, tomorrow, I think, the final vote will take place on the floor of the Senate. It needs 51 votes, a majority now that that procedural hurdle has been cleared, the so-called filibuster.</p><p>So, now they just need 50 -- obviously, they have Joe Biden to break any tie in the U.S. Senate, so 51 votes. They'll have that. It will go to the president's desk. The president will sign it right away.</p><p>The government will remain open. There won't be a shutdown this January. There won't be a shutdown in October just before the midterm elections when the next fiscal year starts.</p><p>So, the government's going to remain open now for two years, but there's still a lot of issues out there on the table. This keeps the government going, but the feuding here in Washington, as you well know, Ashleigh, will continue.</p><p>BANFIELD: And, as we continue to wait to see if those numbers crunch the way the Democrats hope they crunch, I also want to go to some other numbers that are crunching not the way <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>would prefer.</p><p>\"The Washington Post\" has a new poll out, asking the question -- Who do you trust to do a better job on the economy?</p><p>And here is a look at some of the answers. Forty-one percent say Obama. Forty-five percent say the Republicans, instead. And you can see how those numbers have shifted from one year ago.</p><p>This is not lost on the White House, although many would say they're just polls and polls can fluctuate.</p><p>BLITZER: You know, it's really -- it's surprising to a certain degree, because if you take a look at the economy today as opposed to a year ago, it's probably stronger.</p><p>You take a look at all sorts of indicators, including unemployment. It's down at its lowest level in five years since the Great Recession of 2008. The Dow Jones, the stock market, it was 7,000, the Dow Jones when the president took office. It's around 16,000 right now.</p><p>Economic growth in the third quarter was, what, 3.5 percent, something along those lines.</p><p>So, all the indicators show the economy is definitely improving today as opposed to a year ago, but the president's approval numbers as far as the economy's concerned, when compared to the Republicans, they've collapsed pretty much, and you see the contrast between last December and this December.</p><p>And I think it's probably in large part because of the disappointment over the rollout of ObamaCare, the Affordable Care Act. A lot of people have lost confidence in the president, in his handling of the economy, simply because of the disastrous rollout of the health care.</p><p>They've got to fix that. They've got to fix it quickly. The president will be able to come back if they do so. But I think that's been the major reason why people have lost confidence in the president's ability to deal with the economy.</p><p>BANFIELD: Yeah, a 13-point drop. That's a pretty significant drop.</p><p>Wolf Blitzer, thank you. And a reminder to all of our viewers and yours, Wolf, we'll see you at 1:00 Eastern this afternoon. Thank you.</p><p>BLITZER: Thank you.</p><p>BANFIELD: A lot of people are talking about getting lucky because it's lotto season.</p><p>Do you know there's about a hall billion dollars up for stakes tonight in the drawing for the Mega Millions?</p><p>And how about this? Did you know there's $800 million worth of lottery prizes every year that go uncollected because people either forget or they don't check their tickets.</p><p>We're going to show you where this is most prevalent in just a moment.</p><p>BANFIELD: Checking some other top stories that we're following, a reminder today that the Syrian civil war continues to rage on, this photograph, a harrowing picture, shows the horror of that civil war in a very personal way, a Syrian man carrying the body of a child in what activists say was a government air strike in Aleppo on Sunday.</p><p>The Associated Press says it has verified this photo which was handed out by a Syrian opposition media group. Human rights groups say that the attack killed more than 70 people.</p><p>Some incredible pictures. A video of a little boy sitting on the luggage counter at an airport in Poland. You can see the dad beside the child. He sort of takes off his jacket, getting ready to go through security. His son leans closer and closer to the edge and nearly falls off, but the dive, you can see it on the left-hand side of the screen. The security guard leans in and catches him. Dives in to do that. And by the way, for his heroic efforts that security guard got a bonus. Take a look one more time. Leaning over. Until -- in comes the security guard for the catch. Love to hear that.</p><p>You want a shot at more money than you'd ever know what to do with? Make sure you get a Mega Millions ticket today, because the jackpot for tonight's drawing is at $586 million. I had to look down because I needed to double-check it each time I see those numbers. Here's the problem. The odds are super long like really long like supercalifragilistically long.</p><p>But somebody has to win it, you would think anyway. Alison Kosik joins me live now in New York. I'm assuming the lines are long but the odds are longer, and they got longer even since we last played this game, you and I, on the TV when the Mega Millions jackpot was huge. What's up?</p><p>ALISON KOSIK, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: You're looking at the line form right now, Ashleigh. This is the time where people are getting to work, making multiple trips here, buying multiple tickets. This gentleman here, this is his fourth time. He's kind of the designating office runner for the lotto ticket.</p><p>You look at this jackpot -- $586 million. Guess what? That's what the estimated jackpot was yesterday afternoon. Seeing this line you can only imagine how much that jackpot is growing. If this Lotto rolls over again, if nobody wins it tonight, it's going to roll over again and the next drawing is Friday and the jackpot could be as much as $800 million. If it rolls over again, by Christmas, Christmas eve it could be $1 billion.</p><p>You know why this keeps rolling over? Because this game actually changed the rules in October. It made it a little more difficult to win. When you go in and pick these numbers out, you used to be able to pick between fewer numbers, between 1 and 56. Now you have to choose between 1 and 75. To get the gold ball, you chosen between 1 and 46. Now you choose between 1 and 15. So, that sort of combination means there are more combinations of numbers, less chance of winning. That's why the odds are 1 in 259 million that you'll actually hit the jackpot, Ashleigh.</p><p>BANFIELD: Yes, but still people come streaming in there thinking they have a little hope at glory and a little, you know, easy life ahead.</p><p>KOSIK: Yes.</p><p>BANFIELD: Let me ask you this.</p><p>KOSIK: I'm all about -- I just have to say I'm all about hope and glory. I've got a dollar here.</p><p>BANFIELD: Adorable.</p><p>KOSIK: I've got my numbers picked out. I'm going to join the line. Although I have to split the ticket with a friend if I win. I'm so willing to do it.</p><p>BANFIELD: So, which one of you is actually going to check to see if the ticket wins? There's this incredible story out, Alison. I could not believe that there's $800 million in unclaimed prizes. We're talking about not even a $600 million jackpot that's got everybody going bananas, and there's $800 million out there that people have either forgotten about or, you know, lost a ticket, or maybe didn't think that they played that week. What is that about?</p><p>KOSIK: The thing is if you don't win the jackpot and you bought a bunch of tickets you want to look over your tickets carefully because what the stats show is a lot of people walk away from a lot of money and you said it, $800 million in Lotto prizes that, poof, aren't picked up every single year. You look at New York, $65 million in prize money just walked away from. Some of the prizes are big. You know, if you don't hit the jackpot, all the numbers, you can still have enough numbers where you can win up to a million dollars in some cases.</p><p>BANFIELD: $65 million in New York. I can't believe that's just sitting on the table, people. You know what? I'm in a Lotto pool every week. We're going to have to recheck those tickets. Alison, thank you and good luck to you. Although she'd better come back to work because we really like her here.</p><p>Do you remember the thousands of passengers drifting for days on the Carnival Triumph? No power, no lights, and infamously no flushing toilets which led to pictures of sewage in orange bags all around the deck. Don't book your winter cruise until you see the CNN investigation about Triumph, and what they may have known before that ship set sail. Our Drew Griffin is keeping them honest. Next.</p><p>BANFIELD: It's no secret we've been doing a lot of weather stories lately. It's cold and the weather is pretty lousy for a lot of you at this time of year. So this might be the season where you're dreaming of a winter getaway at sea. Or maybe not because who can forget last February when more than 3,000 passengers were stuck aboard the Carnival Triumph. S.O.S. read the bed sheet. It became what is known as the \"poop cruise.\" No light, not much food or water, and unfortunately no flushing toilets.</p><p>Now CNN has learned in an exclusive investigation that the ship set sail with only four of six generators operational, knowing that the company had an ongoing generator fire hazard, and not just on the Triumph, but on the ships across the fleet. CNN INVESTIGATON's Drew Griffin is keeping them honest.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BETTINA RODRIGUEZ PASSENGER: This was supposed to be the fun ship, and we were basically having to fend for ourselves.</p><p>GRIFFIN (voice-over): Bettina Rodriguez and her daughter, Isabelle, have planned this cruise for half a year. They would sail on the Carnival Triumph and celebrate Isabelle's birthday. It was the trip of a lifetime until they awoke to a fire alarm, smoke in the hallway, and then days and days of misery. Human waste was piling up just outside their door.</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: Just on our deck alone, there were the biohazard bags lined up across the floor. We're talking about raw sewage at just the end of our deck alone. It was --</p><p>GRIFFIN (on camera): Really?</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: It was repulsive.</p><p>GRIFFIN (voice-over): It was, according to Rodriguez, a nightmare -- now made even worse because of these. The cruise line's own reports, inspections and maintenance records detailed the problem that had been developing on board the Carnival Triumph more than a year before Rodriguez and her daughter were on board.</p><p>Houston attorney Frank Spagnoletti obtained the documents in his lawsuit against Carnival.</p><p>FRANK SPAGNOLETTI, PLAINTIFF'S ATTORNEY: That ship should have never set sail in February. It was un-seaworthy at the convention of the voyage. These documents tell you that the company -- and I'm saying to you the corporation back in Miami -- had knowledge of the fact that this vessel had a propensity for fires, that there were things that could have been, should have been, and weren't done in order to make sure that fires didn't take place.</p><p>DREW GRIFFIN, CNN INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT: The first trouble with triumph, diesel generator number six, the one that ended up catching fire. Starting more than a year before the infamous cruise, diesel generator number six was overdue for maintenance, out of compliance with the safety laws of the sea, known as SOLAS, according to the ship's own engineer. Over and over again, Carnival's own maintenance reports say the same thing. Diesel generator number six, overdue for maintenance. And during that same time period, Carnival learned about another, even more alarming safety problem in the engine room. Fuel lines. A dangerous pattern of leaks that emerged on other Carnival cruise ships. In fact, Carnival Costas (ph) Allegra caught fire because fuel leaked onto a hot spot and ignited.</p><p>It would be the ultimate foreshadowing. Consider this: Carnival's own investigation shows the fire on board the Costa Allegra, is believed to be caused by a fuel leak on one of the diesel generators, eerily similar to what would start the fire onboard the Triumph one year later.</p><p>Carnival says it proactively began investigating and found a big problem in a different type of fuel line. There had been nine -- that's right, nine incidents resulting in fuel leaks associated with flexible fuel lines in just two years. On January 2nd, Carnival issues a compliance order, giving ships two months to address the problem, to ensure a suitable spray shield is installed for all diesel engines, using the flexible fuel lines. Mark Jackson is Carnival's chief engineer.</p><p>MARK JACKSON, V.P. TECHNICAL OPERATIONS, CARNIVAL CRUISE LINES: After that internal study, the company came out with a new policy to, again, shield all of the flanges and the hoses that were below the deck plates.</p><p>GRIFFIN: But you didn't shield the one hose that wound up causing this tragedy.</p><p>JACKSON: That hose was beneath the deck plates and it was believed that the deck plates would act as that shield. In this case, it found that gap in the hose - that gap in the bilge plates and caused that fire.</p><p>GRIFFIN: On February 7th with the diesel generator still in need of overhaul and fuel line shields on some but not all of its flexible hoses, Triumph set sail from Galveston, Texas.</p><p>JACKSON: We were in total compliance with the rules and regulations. We had our regulating bodies onboard the vessel less than two weeks before, that had certified the ship safe to sail.</p><p>Obviously, you learn things on a situation - on an incident such as the Triumph.</p><p>GRIFFIN: Three days later, off the coast of Mexico, fire breaks out in diesel generator number six when fuel sprays from a flexible fuel line, a line that was less than six months old.</p><p>Drew Griffin, CNN, Houston, Texas.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BANFIELD: Carnival says this was an accident, not negligence, but the company did dedicate $300 million in a safety upgrade fleet-wide. Carnival does point out that the passengers have no right to sue, and this is unusual, because its attorneys say when you buy your ticket, and I'm going to quote, \"the ticket contract makes absolutely no guarantee for safe passage, a seaworthy vessel, adequate and wholesome food, and sanitary and safe living conditions.\"</p><p>Let that sit in for a while. Carnival is trying to get this suit tossed. Passengers are obviously going to challenge it in court and they'll have their chance to do so in February when the case is set to go to trial.</p><p>Coming up next, I want you to watch a piece of video where a high school senior goes to give a hug to a teacher. Do you see anything untoward there? What you're watching gave that young man a year-long suspension from school and maybe a whole lot more than that. Sit worth it? Is there something more up? we'll going to explain this in just a moment.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2013121701CNV52</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2013</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5B32-5B51-JB20-G1F0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3745\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2013 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"12\" year=\"2013\"><dateText>December 17, 2013 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0002678</classCode><className>CARNIVAL CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>OR00091XD</classCode><className>NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANIZATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS483112 DEEP SEA PASSENGER TRANSPORTATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>SIC4481 DEEP SEA TRANSPORTATION OF PASSENGERS, EXCEPT BY FERRY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>CCL (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Afghanistan</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Budget</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Congress</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Death</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Economy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Internet</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Lawsuits</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Military</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Policies</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Polls</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Technology</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Criminal Law &amp;

The latest comes this weekend in arguably the most important election in Europe for 2018, when Italians will be heading for the polls.  The Italian general election result remains too close to call, with as much as a third of the electorate still undecided on their voting intentions.  Investors are keeping a nervous eye on the result, not least because two of the main parties (the Five Star Movement and the Northern League) are sceptical about the euro and have the potential to put its future back in the spotlight. </p><p> A great deal of the media coverage of the election build-up has focused on Italy\u2019s immigration debate, but tax is a major issue too, especially among business leaders. As the chart below shows, the World Economic Forum\u2019s Economic Opinion Survey of 2017 has the country\u2019s tax rates as the second most problematic factor for doing business in Italy (narrowly behind the country\u2019s inefficient government bureaucracy).  Most of the main parties are vowing to cut taxes and/or increase spending, potentially ringing alarm bells among investors already wary of the country\u2019s large public debt pile and budget deficit.  Philip Haddon  Improving conditions supporting European peripheral bond yields  Remaining in Europe, peripheral eurozone government bonds (including Italy), for a long time the pariah of financial markets, are seeing an upturn in fortunes. Peripheral yields have taken support in recent months from a spate of ratings upgrades and improved economic conditions.  In January, each of the so-called \u201cPIGS\u201d \u2013 Portugal, Italy, Greece and Spain \u2013 issued new sovereign debt attracting strong demand. Spain in particular issued a \u20ac10 billion 10-year maturity bond, which drew demand of over \u20ac40 billion. Spain was upgraded to A- by Fitch Ratings, while S&amp;P has Spain on BBB+ with a positive outlook. Fitch cited Spain\u2019s broad-based economic recovery and limited impact on the economy from Catalonia\u2019s independence bid. Italy issued 10 and 50-year bonds which were oversubscribed. Both have followed this with further issues in February.  S&amp;P lifted Greek long-term, foreign currency ratings for the first time in two years on improvements in the finances and fiscal outlook. Portugal regained an investment grade rating from S&amp;P last September, prompting 10-year yields to drop over 40 basis points (bps), and from Fitch in December.  James Molony  Path of the peripheral yields  Past performance is not a guide to future performance and may not be repeated. Short volatility ETFs collapse as Vix spikes  The growth of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has been significant over recent years with the products proving popular with individual investors.  Providers have looked to capitalise on this ETF boom with the development of increasingly specialised strategies. One such example is the short (or inverse) volatility ETF. It is constructed using derivatives to profit from declining volatility, as measured by the Vix. The Vix \u2013 the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index \u2013 comprises S&amp;P 500 options to track expected equity market volatility levels.  Volatility in 2017 was persistently low (ie stock prices did not fluctuate particularly wildly), so these \u201cshort vol\u201d funds performed extremely well, but the events of recent weeks have demonstrated just how swiftly things can unravel.  Markets were turbulent at the beginning of February. This volatility caused the short vol funds to suffer calamitous declines. At the most extreme point, in the first week of February, over a dozen products were suspended from trading.  One such fund was the VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short Term ETN (XIV) shown in the chart below. It reached over $2 billion in assets in late January before falling nearly 95% in early-February and has since been liquidated.  James Molony  Short vol funds versus the VIX  Source: Bloomberg.

Past performance is not a guide to future performance and may not be repeated. Has London\u2019s junior stockmarket grown up?  This graph illustrates how the number of companies on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) has fallen since the 2007/08 financial crisis and average market capitalisations have risen.  In part the chart speaks of the junior market\u2019s growing maturity relative to its earlier days. There are materially fewer very small companies quoted on AIM today than there were a decade ago. The number of companies with market valuations of less than 163;25 million has more than halved over this period.  Since the financial crisis there has not been a wave of speculative IPOs on AIM to rival those of the 1999/00 dotcom bubble or 2005/06 resources boom. Meanwhile, the secondary market for further fundraisings has held up relatively well. High quality AIM companies have, it appears, been able to raise the equity capital they require to grow.  Simon Keane  Are start-ups being stifled?  In her recent article \u201cThe \u201cBig Tech\u201d backlash: How sustainable are Google, Facebook and Amazon?\u201d, Katherine Davidson looked at why the internet giants are coming under increased scrutiny from society and regulators.  One criticism levelled at the likes of Google is that by snapping up promising start-ups and monopolising the best talent they have been stifling innovation.  Indeed, as the chart below from the Kauffman Index of Startup Activity shows, the number of start-ups declined precipitously from 2006 to 2013, when it reached its lowest point in 20 years. But now the tide seems to have turned.  \u201cStart-up activity, growth, and entrepreneurship have ticked up encouragingly since 2014, suggesting the dip was more a function of the economic environment than structural change,\u201d Katherine said.  Andrew Lacey  Startup activity  Global PMI reaches three year high  Leading economic indicator readings, released in February, have continued to reflect strength and synchronisation in global economic growth. The Global Composite Purchasing Manager\u2019s Index (PMI), a combined activity index of manufacturing and services activity, climbed to 54.6 in January, up from 54.3 in December. This is the highest level that the index has reached in over three years. Significantly, the measure saw both the advanced and emerging markets economies components increase. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RVMPCU-RLPMN641588920180305</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RVMPCU2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RT3-B2N1-DXCW-D0T8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">424987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1101\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Plus Company Updates(PCU)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"45923\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 5, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Facebook can defeat a government break-up attemptThe Facebook CEO said he expected the company would face, and defeat, legal challenges if Democratic US Senator Elizabeth Warren were elected president. Warren has vowed to break up giant tech companies like Facebook, Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google.<br/>He also said breaking up big tech companies would make election interference \"more likely because now the companies can't coordinate and work together\" and drew laughter by saying Facebook's investment on safety was bigger than Twitter's entire revenue.<br/>\u00a0<br/>2. Without absolute control, 'I would have been fired'Asked how he balanced his financial responsibility to shareholders with his moral responsibility to society, Zuckerberg reminded employees of moments when he believes his concentrated control helped Facebook ride out difficulties such as Yahoo's 2006 bid for the company.<br/>\"One of the things that I've been lucky about in building this company is, you know, I kind of have voting control of the company, and that's something I focused on early on,\" he said.<br/>\"And it was important because, without that, there were several points where I would've been fired. For sure, for sure...\"<br/>You can also listen to the two hours of leaked audio (shared by The Verge), where Mark Zuckerberg addresses the government's attempt to break-up the company, it's competition with TikTok, it's Libra cryptocurrency and more.<br/>3. Facebook has a 'plan of attack' against TikTokZuckerberg was also questioned about Facebook's 'plan of attack' against TikTok, the rapidly growing video app owned by Chinese tech giant ByteDance, which has gained huge popularity among teenagers.<br/>He said that Facebook was focusing its new standalone video-sharing app Lasso, but would test it first in markets where TikTok is less prominent, such as Mexico.<br/>\"We're trying to first see if we can get it to work in countries where TikTok is not already big before we go and compete with TikTok in countries where they are big,\" he said.<br/>\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/>4. Why Facebook announced digital currency plans earlyZuckerberg touched on the company's ambitious plans to establish a cryptocurrency called Libra. Announced in June, the project quickly ran into trouble with sceptical regulators around the world.<br/>Zuckerberg said these responses had been part of Facebook trying \"a more consultative approach\" on big projects.<br/>\"So not just show up and say, 'Alright, here we're launching this. Here's a product, your app got updated, now you can start buying Libras and sending them around,'\" he said.<br/>\u00a0<br/>5. Facebook does not want to get into brain surgeryFacebook announced last month that it had bought New York-based CTRL-labs, a start-up that is exploring ways for people to communicate with computers using brain signals.<br/>In the transcripts from the earlier July meetings, Zuckerberg said he thought that as part of Facebook's work on artificial reality and virtual reality, there would be a small amount of \"direct brain\" interface and that progress in this area was exciting.<br/>But he stressed that Facebook was focused on non-invasive approaches that do not require surgery or implants.<br/>\"You think Libra is hard to launch,\" Zuckerberg joked, imagining the headline \"'Facebook wants to perform brain surgery.' I don't want to see the congressional hearings on that one.\"<br/>\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/>6. Content moderator reports: \"A little overdramatic\"Outside contractors who monitor Facebook for objectionable content have complained that their work was underpaid, stressful and sometimes traumatic. An employee asked Zuckerberg about Facebook's plan to protect these types of contractors.<br/>Zuckerberg said it was an \"important issue that we're focused on\" but he also said some of the reports were \"a little overdramatic.\"<br/>\"Within a population of 30,000 people, there's going to be a distribution of experiences that people have,\" he said.<br/>Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer also stepped in to say that the company was working on technology to minimize harms for human moderators, for example, by automatically catching duplicate content.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-M-271190</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XFT-5FH1-DYDW-71S8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"775\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 8, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Willett launched[1] the first ever ICO[2], Mastercoin (now Omni), and tomorrow will mark 6 years since this monumental occasion. Looking at the last 6 years, it's evident that the industry has matured and the very nature of fundraising within the blockchain[3] space has changed. We've witnessed a slight shift away from ICOs: as evidenced in this STO report[4] from the NEM Foundation, and the recent launch of STOs in public markets. In 2019, we've witnessed a further progression towards IEOs.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/bitcoin_1561199111.jpgMichaelWuensch\">https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/bitcoin_1561199111.jpgMichaelWuensch</url>[5] / Pixabay  Get The Full Ray Dalio Series in PDF Get the entire 10-part series on Ray Dalio in PDF. Save it to your desktop, read it on your tablet, or email to your colleagues Q2 hedge fund letters, conference, scoops etc[6] In light of this milestone and the ever-changing fundraising landscape, we have included commentary below from leaders in the blockchain and crypto[7] space. They have included their personal thoughts on the current status of the ICO/STO/IEO market, as well as predictions on the future of fundraising. Dave Hodgson, Director and Co-founder at NEM Ventures[8], the venture capital and investments arm of the NEM blockchain ecosystem, commented: \"Although ICOs worked well within a strong bull market, it became increasingly hard to raise capital as the market turned to a bear. Additionally, some high profile scam ICOs damaged sentiment and the overall attractiveness of this investment vehicle further. National regulators have also prosecuted several ICO projects for breach of securities regulations. As we have come through the bear market and the industry has matured, many companies are seeking to raise capital in a more compliant manner where regulation[9] exists, or in a way that they think will be compliant within future regulation. Several successful issuances have now happened across various jurisdictions and the proposals are far more mature in their approach to presenting a viable investment opportunity. The future of fundraising in the short-medium term is likely to focus on traditional startup avenues, including crowdfunding, angels, VC and private equity, coupled with the newer IEO and STO approaches. As we move into the era of Decentralised Finance (DeFi), I believe that a number of very interesting finance raising approaches will emerge and present themselves apart from the more traditional approaches. We've only really seen the tip of the creative iceberg at this point in time in relation to new fundraising models.\" Pradeep Goel, CEO of Solve.Care[10], which aims to redefine care coordination, improve access to care, reduce benefit administration costs, and eliminate fraud and waste from healthcare and benefit administration around the world, commented: 'ICOs played a fundamental role in allowing blockchain projects to raise funds by making it easier for potential investors to invest. However, by the end of 2018, interest in ICOs started to wane due to exit scams and fraudulent[11] token sales becoming more and more prevalent, and a lack of regulatory oversight. Investors then began to pay more attention to STOs instead, because they appeared to be more transparent and secure. They also needed to comply with FINMA and SEC rules and guidelines. These requirements also mean that investments are restricted to institutional investors only, with KYC and investor accreditation now compulsory. The past six months have sparked a renewed interest in blockchain projects. Inextricably linked to a specific exchange, IEOs bring an extra layer of security by eliminating the potential for illicit investments. With exchanges expected to carry out due diligence before the issuing of a token, and the expectation that participants will have to pass KYC and AML checks, there's greater incentive for blockchain projects to engage in this kind of fundraising. The next five years will undoubtedly see the introduction of new investment models as the future of the tokenized economy evolves. As the industry looks to facilitate fundraising and address regulatory constraints, the model that ultimately offers the most transparency, security, and accessibility will prevail.' Kevin Sekniqi, Co-Founder ...ief Protocol Architect at AVA Labs[12], whose mission is to build a payments rail and computation engine based on the breakthrough Avalanche family of consensus protocols, commented: 'The frenzy around ICOs in 2017/2018, and the more recent interest in their more regulatory compliant cousins known as STOs/IEOs indicates that the global public has a broader need for the wholesale democratization of responsible and safe fundraising. The next few years will witness a rise in more efficient fundraising[13] processes that provide strong assurance and are increasingly more legally compliant.' Lars Seier Christensen, Chairman of Concordium[14], the next-generation, decentralized world computer and the first with ID-verification built-in at the protocol level, commented: \"There is still too much focus on form over content in this market, and because so many ICOs were successful with fundraising but unsuccessful in executing their business plans, retail interest petered out. While the shift to STOs marked a shift to higher quality projects, investors are much more selective now. This new form of fundraising is not a panacea for the underlying lack of project quality, and there are many lessons that still have to be learned in this relatively immature industry. I am sure new models will continue to spring up, but the long-term success of these projects will also determine the long-term appetite for investing in the space. Clearly, with bitcoin's volatile recovery, some risk appetite is returning, but there is still a distinct lack of real institutional interest in investing. Investors are awaiting better regulatory clarity and evidence that projects are successful with their business models, not just with fundraising. If there is no real viability or way to profitability for most projects, fundraising will remain patchy.\" Sky Geo, Founder ...O of Cypherium[15], the enterprise-focused blockchain platform that prioritizes scalability and decentralization, commented: 'Like the DLT space on the whole, dynamism of crypto[16] fundraising has good and bad aspects. Partly, the space has shifted so quickly because it innovates at such a fast clip, like the tech itself, always changing and looking to improve. Unfortunately, there is another reason for the constantly shifting standard fundraising apparatuses: new projects looking to make a quick buck while evading the improving regulations. And because of that, the community has no choice but to convene around a single, cogent standard of early investment. This certainly does necessitate conforming to the laws of traditional startup equity, which open themselves only to the uber-rich. Instead, crypto projects will have to develop a stable, internal fundraising logic, one that can be understood international and withstand the test of time.' Christophe de Courson, CEO of Olymp Capital, Europe's first asset management fund dedicated to blockchain and crypto, said:  'The beginning of ICOs in the crypto space marked an important milestone, as blockchain became a new tool for businesses to raise funds in a more accessible way than ever before. ICOs unlocked the ability to raise capital, which was previously reserved for companies with the resources to hold Initial Public Offerings. Accessible fundraising is central to the financial inclusivity that underpins the entire decentralized[17] financial sphere. That being said, it is also important to note that the crypto industry has matured a great deal since the earliest ICOs. This phase of maturation was largely caused by the bear market, which helped to filter out weaker projects and scams. The crypto ecosystem has grown into a more credible and legitimate space, where real business is taking priority. The bear market was also followed by a decline[18] in the numbers of ICOs. Meanwhile we have witnessed emergence of Initial Exchange Offering (IEO), giving more security for investors as the exchange platforms are selective; time will tell if IEOs are just an opportunistic trend or a long term model. In addition, we have seen the first Security Token Offerings (STOs). STOs are seen as the next big event for blockchain and finance, but still need adequate infrastructure, promotion, and regulation in order to deliver on its promises. In the years to come, I anticipate that the industry will continue to mature, driven by enterprise adoption and institutional investment which has already taken flight.' Charles Lu, CEO of Findora[19], a cryptographically transparent public blockchain for building financial applications, commented: 'Six years ago, the ICO emerged as an innovative and subversive way to raise funding for the new phenomenon of decentralized networks. ICOs offered a way to jumpstart development of a public shared resource and initialize a diverse global pool of stakeholders. ICOs were also dramatically different from traditional funding methods, which are often associated with high costs, siloed investor pools, illiquidity, and financial exclusion. Though fruitful systems like Ethereum were bootstrapped by ICOs, as the ICO craze took off, some of their shortcomings were clear. ICOs were often structured in ways where the incentives of teams and investors were misaligned. The lack of accountability and high degree of speculation led to a large number of 2017 and 2018 ICO projects failing and disappearing. Additionally, many ICOs were found to be likely in violation of local securities laws. Recently, we have seen the decentralized funding model evolve further. Regulation around blockchain is steadily gaining clarity around the world, and innovations[20] like security token offerings (STOs) are emerging. Because many traditional financial services are inefficient, expensive, and inaccessible, we predict that finance will continue to improve through democratization, interoperability, and automated compliance. Though the rampant speculation of 2017 led to many failings, ICOs have a very important place in the history of financial democracy, and financial services will continue to evolve in the direction of transparency, accessibility, and compliance.' Charles Phan, Founding Engineer of Interdax[21], the all-in-one cryptocurrency exchange providing a safe, secure, and more efficient platform to the masses through innovative derivatives contracts, commented: \"It's only natural for projects to move away from ICOs towards IEOs, as the early landscape saw a failure in terms of due diligence, causing many vaporware projects to be funded. With an IEO platform, investors are assured of two critical aspects: there is an immediate and liquid market for the new token, and there is an experienced team who will ensure that only legitimate projects are listed. As the market matures, it will become clear that exchanges are the natural place for offerings to congregate, in particular, with exchanges that are able to offer a full range of products for new tokens.\" Jose Llisterri, Co-Founder of Interdax[22] added: 'After the wild west that the on-chain ICOs were, it is normal that token sales have gravitated towards more controlled and centralised offerings like IEOs or STOs. These new formulas are in high demand because traders and crypto enthusiasts love that exchanges are saving them hours of research and due diligence[23]. This trend will continue during the coming years as regulators catch up and proper frameworks are applied to both sales of security and non-security tokens.' Florian Glatz, Co-Founder of Fundament Group[24], commented: 'Since the first ICO in 2013, the blockchain industry has undergone a significant transformation. The initial wave of ICO-based crowdfunding served to fuel the protocol wars, that is, the competition for the best base-layer protocols. However, ICOs soon lost their attraction since they focused primarily on the application layer, for which the funding model proved to be the wrong instrument. Today, we're witnessing the onset of a new type of competition - the wallet wars - where companies such as Facebook compete for end-user relationships. At the same time, smart entrepreneurs have adopted the lessons learned from the ICO-craziness of previous years and applied them to regulated financial instruments such as bonds. By combining the concepts of shared digital ledgers and tokens with traditional investments, financial inclusion can finally reach a new, global scale. In the next five years, we will see tokenization become the new standard for securitizing debt and, ultimately, equity. In terms of distribution, the latest fad of IEOs is just a signifier of consolidation in the market around aggregators of end-user relationships. In that sense, the wallet wars and STOs go hand in hand.' Aries Wang, CEO and Co-Founder of Bibox[25], the AI enhanced crypto digital asset exchange, commented: 'The shift away from ICOs is a response to the 'Wild West' nature of the ICO craze \u2014 unregulated, decentralized and statistically speaking, risky. Fundraising has gone unchecked from regulators, and resulted in huge portions of investors losing money. A fundamental issue with ICOs is the fact that most of them raised money pre-product, without regulated exchanges to support their endeavour. Customers were left burned by scam projects[26] which had poor business models and raised funds through illegitimate websites. Similarly, genuine businesses suffered as a result of the tarnished reputation left by the bad actors. The ICO boom was important in developing a novel form of crowdfunding, but made investment extremely speculative and risky. Enter the IEO. The IEO fundraising method is making waves in a big way \u2014 May 2019 saw[27] 45% of all fundraising by blockchain and crypto projects conducted via the IEO model, whereas ICOs only accounted for 4% of all funding. Blockchain entrepreneurs are realizing that to succeed long-term, they need the legitimacy of trusted networks \u2014 cleared pools of investors, sponsors, marketing experts and guidance from teams of financial experts who have raised funds in the past. In order for blockchain to mature as a genuine mainstream space for investors, these networks will need to be utilized, adding legitimacy to the space.'

Eighty percent will cease to exist, become commoditized or achieve zombie status.\"</p><p>Zombie status means existing, but not competing effectively.</p><p>\"Like zombies, they're still moving, but they're not really alive,\" said Peter Redshaw, practice vice president at Gartner.</p><p>\"Heritage firms that do adapt can survive,\" he said. \"It's the ones that fail to make any serious moves\" will die out.</p><p>The report explains that in a recent Gartner survey, 71% of financial services CEOs said they believe their organizations can compete in a digital world without changing their business model. These CEOs apparently think they are safe because few of the digital-only banks have scaled up or become highly profitable.</p><p>\"This attitude is dangerous because it underestimates the degree of change that digital technology will bring to the industry,\" the Gartner analysts said in their report.</p><p>Gartner's forecast caused a stir on Twitter.</p><p>\"If I were CEO of JPMC, I'd buy Gartner, shut it down, call that analyst into my office and say: \"~Who's out of business and irrelevant now, sucker!?' \" Cornerstone analyst Ron Shevlin posted.</p><p>Another person Tweeted \"Rubbish\" in reaction to Gartner's prediction. Others used stronger language.</p><p>In an interview, Asheet Mehta, senior partner at McKinsey, also took issue with Gartner's prediction. McKinsey,which is releasing its own report on the disintermediation of banks on Wednesday, is not looking out as far as 2030.</p><p>\"If you were to go out the next five years, we don't see that happening,\" he said.</p><p>He pointed out that the big banks have scale, which becomes more important as technology, data and transparency play a bigger role in financial services.</p><p>\"It's easy to enter the financial services market because of technology and data availability, at the same time in certain segments, scale is becoming so much more important that you're seeing the large get larger,\" Mehta said.</p><p>In trading, for example, large banks have value as partners.</p><p>\"You can do a small trade with any bank, but when you want a large trade, you need a large bank on the other side of counterparty to provide liquidity and other things,\" he said. \"That's difficult for a smaller player to do. Because you know you need that, you have to use the big banks for other business. You can't just go to them for the large trades.\"</p><p>Warren Kornfeld, senior vice president at Moody's Investors Service, was more sympathetic to Gartner's projections.</p><p>\"There will be massive consolidation,\" he said. \"We all know there are far too many banks, far too much capacity, and the number of banks will continue to shrink at a faster pace. Technology is going to do this. Whether it's 80% or 60%, I don't disagree there will be sizable decrease.\"</p><p>He also thinks some of this will simply be consolidation caused by bank mergers, as midsize banks strive to get bigger.</p><p>Lost market share</p><p>Accenture estimates that fintechs and challengers have already taken between 3% and 4% of market share away from traditional banks in certain segments.</p><p>\"That follows a very typical attacker strategy,\" said Peter Sidebottom, lead in North America banking and capital markets strategy for Accenture. \"Which is not to cut across all the waterfront but to pick particular niches and go from there. I'm sure when Amazon started, there wasn't anybody who thought they were a threat to them, including Walmart, and now look at the newer categories they're in.\"</p><p>In commercial lending, money is flowing to alternative providers, Sidebottom observed. Private-equity firms are funding companies' equipment leasing and new buildings, for example.</p><p>On the consumer banking side, banks may not have lost vast amounts of assets yet. But growth in new consumer accounts is going to digitally enabled leaders, he said.</p><p>\"There are a number of institutions in the U.S. that are largely at a standstill,\" Sidebottom said. \"They're not growing consumer accounts. And there are institutions that are investing heavily in digital that are growing accounts and households.\"</p><p>Personal lending, student lending andsmall-business lendingare all areas where disruptors like Prosper, LendingClub, SoFi, Kabbage and OnDeck Capital have gained traction.</p><p>\"It's the niches where banks have stepped back and decided these markets are not super profitable and where emerging fintechs have been able to feed a demand and have a much stronger user interface and understand the needs of the borrower and try to address them,\" Kornfeld said.</p><p>Banks such asHSBC,PNC Financial Services GroupandBBVA Compasshave launched all-digital consumer banking products in recent months in response to the competitive threat.</p><p>The personal loan market is estimated at about $120 billion.</p><p>\"A not insignificant portion of those are nontraditional lenders,\" Kornfeld said.</p><p>Though credit card debt is at a healthy $800 billion, according to McKinsey, it has not been growing at the rate it used to. It once was the second-largest asset class in the U.S. after mortgages, which are at around $10 trillion. It's now the fourth-largest asset class, one spot behind auto lending, which is more than $1 trillion outstanding.</p><p>One reason for this is some consumers have refinanced their credit card debt with online lenders.</p><p>Mortgage origination is another area where fintechs and challengers have done well, especially Quicken with its Rocket Mortgage. Earlier this year, Quicken became the market share leader in U.S. mortgage originations.</p><p>Kornfeld said banks have deliberately stepped back from mortgages because they are only \"modestly profitable\" and they can make more money other ways.</p><p>Smaller margins</p><p>Mehta does not see banks losing market share to fintechs and other challengers entering financial services, but he does see those challengers putting pressure on banks' margins - especially in products where it is easy to compare prices.</p><p>One example is in asset management. About 45% of asset management today is passive money going into exchange-traded funds. This is up from 12% in 1998, according to McKinsey. The ETFs charge less than 20 basis points; some charge 6 points or less. Active equity funds typically charge 100-150 basis points.</p><p>In savings accounts and CDs, about $30 billion has moved from low-rate bank accounts to higher-rate accounts at disruptors, Mehta said.</p><p>\"It's not a big number per se, but it is a number,\" he said. \"And younger clients who are more digital-only are turning out to be less loyal. If they see a better rate or a better offer, they will move. As deposits leave banks, they will have to price up deposits to keep them at some point.\"</p><p>Big-tech threat</p><p>Kornfeld sees the biggest threat coming from tech giants like Amazon.</p><p>\"The bigger fear of real displacement comes from big tech where they already have the consumers, the merchants, the brand - they have more currency than the incumbents have, they have market cap, and they're larger than the incumbents,\" Kornfeld said. \"That's why those entities are the ones that are going to have the potential to be so disruptive.\"</p><p>Mehta does not think tech companies will want to become banks and comply with bank regulations.</p><p>\"The cost of becoming a regulated bank holding company is quite problematic,\" he said.</p><p>He does see tech companies becoming an important distribution channel for products like mortgages and mutual funds. And he sees more tech companies accepting payments on the front end of the customer journey, the way Amazon has Amazon payments and Apple and Google have mobile wallets.</p><p>\"You could also see some financing or lending being integrated with that - that is already happening,\" Mehta said. \"But it's hard to see a significant move outside that, other than as a distributor of financial services products.\"</p><p>Accenture suggests that for the next dozen years, the biggest challenge for traditional banks will be changing their approach by going truly digital and investing in growth efforts that can help them escape the squeeze of new competition and deteriorating returns.</p><p>\"Most banks struggle to find the right mix of digital investment,\" Sidebottom said. \"To remain relevant, traditional banks will need to continue to address changing customer needs, exploit new technologies to reduce costs and increase speed to market for new products, and choose a business model that is best suited to their strengths.\"</p><p>Editor at Large Penny Crosman welcomes feedback <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:atpenny.crosman@sourcemedia.com\">atpenny.crosman@sourcemedia.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AMBNKR-00000166-eaf7-dab1-a37f-fff7bbed0000-1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AMBNKR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TNW-S581-JCRW-52HN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303174</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1488\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 SourceMedia LLC d/b/a Arizent.

Whether it's 80% or 60%, I don't disagree there will be sizable decrease.\"</p><p>He also thinks some of this will simply be consolidation caused by mergers, as midsize banks and CUs strive to get bigger. Lost market share</p><p>Accenture estimates that fintechs and challengers have already taken between 3% and 4% of market share away from traditional FIs in certain segments.</p><p>\"That follows a very typical attacker strategy,\" said Peter Sidebottom, lead in North America banking and capital markets strategy for Accenture. \"Which is not to cut across all the waterfront but to pick particular niches and go from there. I'm sure when Amazon started, there wasn't anybody who thought they were a threat to them, including Walmart, and now look at the newer categories they're in.\"</p><p>In commercial lending, money is flowing to alternative providers, Sidebottom observed. Private-equity firms are funding companies' equipment leasing and new buildings, for example.</p><p>On the consumer banking side, banks and credit unions may not have lost vast amounts of assets yet. But growth in new consumer accounts is going to digitally enabled leaders, he said.</p><p>\"There are a number of institutions in the U.S. that are largely at a standstill,\" Sidebottom said. \"They're not growing consumer accounts. And there are institutions that are investing heavily in digital that are growing accounts and households.\"</p><p>Personal lending, student lending andsmall-business lendingare all areas where disruptors like Prosper, LendingClub, SoFi, Kabbage and OnDeck Capital have gained traction.</p><p>\"It's the niches where banks have stepped back and decided these markets are not super profitable and where emerging fintechs have been able to feed a demand and have a much stronger user interface and understand the needs of the borrower and try to address them,\" Kornfeld said.</p><p>Banks such asHSBC,PNC Financial Services GroupandBBVA Compasshave launched all-digital consumer banking products in recent months in response to the competitive threat.</p><p>The personal loan market is estimated at about $120 billion.</p><p>\"A not insignificant portion of those are nontraditional lenders,\" Kornfeld said.</p><p>Though credit card debt is at a healthy $800 billion, according to McKinsey, it has not been growing at the rate it used to. It once was the second-largest asset class in the U.S. after mortgages, which are at around $10 trillion. It's now the fourth-largest asset class, one spot behind auto lending, which is more than $1 trillion outstanding.</p><p>One reason for this is some consumers have refinanced their credit card debt with online lenders.</p><p>Mortgage origination is another area where fintechs and challengers have done well, especially Quicken with its Rocket Mortgage. Earlier this year, Quicken became the market share leader in U.S. mortgage originations.</p><p>Kornfeld said banks have deliberately stepped back from mortgages because they are only \"modestly profitable\" and they can make more money other ways. Smaller margins</p><p>Mehta does not see traditional FIs losing market share to fintechs and other challengers entering financial services, but he does see those challengers putting pressure on banks' margins - especially in products where it is easy to compare prices.</p><p>One example is in asset management. About 45% of asset management today is passive money going into exchange-traded funds. This is up from 12% in 1998, according to McKinsey. The ETFs charge less than 20 basis points; some charge 6 points or less. Active equity funds typically charge 100-150 basis points.</p><p>In savings accounts and CDs, about $30 billion has moved from low-rate bank accounts to higher-rate accounts at disruptors, Mehta said.</p><p>\"It's not a big number per se, but it is a number,\" he said. \"And younger clients who are more digital-only are turning out to be less loyal. If they see a better rate or a better offer, they will move. As deposits leave banks, they will have to price up deposits to keep them at some point.\" Big-tech threat</p><p>Kornfeld sees the biggest threat coming from tech giants like Amazon.</p><p>\"The bigger fear of real displacement comes from big tech where they already have the consumers, the merchants, the brand - they have more currency than the incumbents have, they have market cap, and they're larger than the incumbents,\" Kornfeld said. \"That's why those entities are the ones that are going to have the potential to be so disruptive.\"</p><p>Mehta does not think tech companies will want to become banks and comply with bank regulations.</p><p>\"The cost of becoming a regulated bank holding company is quite problematic,\" he said.</p><p>He does see tech companies becoming an important distribution channel for products like mortgages and mutual funds. And he sees more tech companies accepting payments on the front end of the customer journey, the way Amazon has Amazon payments and Apple and Google have mobile wallets.</p><p>\"You could also see some financing or lending being integrated with that - that is already happening,\" Mehta said. \"But it's hard to see a significant move outside that, other than as a distributor of financial services products.\"</p><p>Accenture suggests that for the next dozen years, the biggest challenge for traditional financial institutions will be changing their approach by going truly digital and investing in growth efforts that can help them escape the squeeze of new competition and deteriorating returns.</p><p>\"Most banks struggle to find the right mix of digital investment,\" Sidebottom said. \"To remain relevant, traditional banks will need to continue to address changing customer needs, exploit new technologies to reduce costs and increase speed to market for new products, and choose a business model that is best suited to their strengths.\"</p><p>Editor at Large Penny Crosman welcomes feedback <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:atpenny.crosman@sourcemedia.com\">atpenny.crosman@sourcemedia.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRUJNL-00000166f48ed617abe7fcaed0a100001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRUJNL2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TP0-PWP1-JCRW-53W0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">305422</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1499\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 SourceMedia LLC d/b/a Arizent All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>creditunionjournal.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"29981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><volume>Vol. 1</volume><issueNumber>No. 1</issueNumber><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/creditunions/news/sizing-up-the-real-fintech-threat-to-banks-and-credit-unions\">https://www.americanbanker.com/creditunions/news/sizing-up-the-real-fintech-threat-to-banks-and-credit-unions</url><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 8, 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Banking Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OUM2ODY2RDZGMjZENDM0MkI5RDA2MjA3NkFDMDdEMTE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QTExQjk4M0RBNjUyNDBDNTgwNjI4MUIzRUU0RDBEMzI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOQM</classCode><className>DIGITAL ONLY BANKS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST00632417</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000231</classCode><className>BUSINESS FORECASTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001928</classCode><className>COMPANY ACTIVITIES &amp;

But many Germans still have reservations about this technology. Now, German industry is urging greater progress, as Sabine Kinkartz reports from Berlin.Smart devices equipped with voice-controlled virtual assistants are ubiquitous today \u2014 and probably featured under many Christmas trees this holiday season. These systems can be prompted to play music, switch the lights and television on, do online shopping, answer manifold questions and much more. </p><p>In short, they are already making everyday life much easier for us. But in return, they feed back large quantities of user data to the major tech companies behind these devices. And many of them are even fitted with cameras and facial recognition technology.Amazon, Alibaba, Google, Facebook, Apple and many other big tech companies are busily gathering and processing our data with the help of special software. They analyze consumer preferences to develop user profiles for targeted advertising. Artificial intelligence (AI) is not only used for such marketing purposes, of course, though this is where many consumers are already experiencing what this technology can already do today.So far, AI still does not rival human intelligence. But self-learning computers are already capable of processing and analyzing vast quantities of data in short periods of time.Read more: When smart devices pass secrets to the policeEveryone is after dataUS tech companies capitalize on our data by selling it or using it to send us targeted advertising. In China, meanwhile, such data is processed with the help of AI and software capable of recognizing facial features and gaits. This is done to control Chinese citizens and force them into conformity.Dieter Janecek, a lawmaker in the German parliament and member of the Greens, warns that such technology could \"lead us straight into a total surveillance state.\" Janecek, who cares deeply about Europeans' civil rights, says \"we don't want this to happen here.\" That is why he says Europe must become a real alternative to the US and China and develop AI technology that honors European values.Together with numerous other MPs, Janecek contributes to a parliamentary committee on AI that aims to investigate \"the chances and challenges represented by new technologies.\" The committee, which will be disbanded by fall 2020, has already submitted its first interim report on how AI will impact the healthcare sector, the economy and the German state. After this it will look into its effect on the labor market, German media and transport.Read more: Minister, what's a European artificial intelligence?German lawmakers divided over AIThe commission is deeply divided over whether AI should be welcomed or treated with utmost caution. Members of Germany's environmentalist Greens, socialist Left Party and some center-left Social Democrats are predominately skeptical of this new technology. But Ronja Kemmer of the center-right Christian Democrats worries that such an attitude could hurt Germany, saying that \"if we allow every potential risk or mistake of an AI system to become an obstacle, there will be no innovation.\" Kemmer thinks this could leave Germany playing catch-up. One of the biggest bones of contention is the issue of data privacy. Joana Cotar of Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party says that Germans \"have a tendency to demonize the gathering and processing of data on principle.\" But, she says, if hospitals were to collect and analyze data to reduce the number of deaths and devise new treatment methods, this would surely be a good thing. That is why she wants Germany's General Data Protection Regulation to be amended. Cotar thinks that Germans should no longer fear giving up personal data provided it is anonymized and pseudonymized.Read more: Protecting children from voice assistants' data collection zeal World won't wait for GermanySocial Democratic lawmaker Rene R\u00f6spel, too, highlights the danger of data surveillance and insists that \"AI should serve humanity\" and contribute to sensible societal progress. But what, exactly, does \"sensible\" progress mean? And for how much longer does Germany intend to debate this issue while other nations already move ahead?Ronja Kemmer is certain that \"the world will not wait\" for Germany to open up to AI technology. She says other nations are already investing billions in this sector, and that \"we need to get moving fast.\" She believes that AI \"Made in Europe\" could be a success \u2014 though she stresses that this depends on scientific and technological progress as well as sustainable business models being developed.US and China lead the wayThe US and China are already way ahead of Europe with regard to AI technology. Back in 2016, under President Barack Obama, the US devised its first AI strategy. Each year, the US state invests $1.5 billion (\u20ac1.3 billion) in AI research and development.A study by Germany's Konrad Adenauer Foundation found that the reasons why the US is the global leader in AI stem from the fact that it \"generates the most influential research papers on AI, has some 3,000 doctoral scholars working in this field each year and boasts about 1,400 AI startups and seven of the world's leading tech companies.\" On top of this, the study says that over the past 40 years, US universities, state agencies and companies have developed a close-knit cooperative network.China looking to set standardsBut that dominance is waning. In the summer of 2017, the Chinese State Council presented its national AI strategy, which is set out in three stages: catching up with the US by 2020, overtaking it by 2025 and leading the way globally from 2030. China is investing a lot to achieve these goals. Beijing has announced it will provide \u20ac16.4 billion to promote the chip industry. The city of Tianjin alone has put aside a fund of \u20ac12.8 billion for advancing AI.Compared with this, Germany is lagging far behind. In November 2018, the government approved its AI strategy. Some \u20ac3 billion are to be made available to implement it, but in the financial planning up to 2023, only \u20ac1 billion in subsidies is budgeted for. Debate is continuing over where the rest of the money should come from. Only two of the 100 AI professorships that have been announced have been filled so far.Read more: China launches compulsory face scans for new phone users Focus on industry?This AI strategy is facing criticism from many quarters, including the Federation of German Industries (BDI), which is calling for more budget funds. In a policy paper on artificial intelligence, the BDI also provides recommendations for other steps to take. A central demand made in the paper is for Germany to concentrate on AI applications that are of use to industry and for it to develop its own focus and competence in this area. It says that German industry is already a global leader in the field of intelligent automation, intelligent sensor technology and robotics and that this should be built upon. The paper cites hybrid AI as an example. This field includes models in which human expert knowledge and machine-based learning methods are combined.The BDI paper says that US companies dominated in the area of data-driven applications and platforms in the private consumer sector, while China was strong on national security and online trading. \"Germany and Europe will not be able to hold their own against international competition if they focus on the same areas,\" it says.DW sends out a daily selection of the day's news and features.

But few people realize just how huge.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Put it this way: Three of the most iconic names in technology - Facebook Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Google's parent, Alphabet Inc. - are together worth more than Canada's S&amp;P/TSX Composite.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Add in Apple Inc. and Netflix Inc. and the market capitalization of the group swells to more than the entire German stock market.</p><p>The massive size of the FAANGs (for Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google) will ensure attention when three of them - Facebook, Amazon and Alphabet - report first-quarter results this week. But what's particularly intriguing this earnings season is the hint of skepticism that's beginning to emerge about what lies ahead for these gigantic success stories.</p><p>To be sure, it's just a glimmer of doubt. Most analysts are still wildly bullish about the FAANGs.</p><p>But other indicators suggest caution is in order. Last week, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, a key supplier to Apple, warned it is seeing \"weak demand from the mobile sector.\" Apple's share price promptly tumbled on worries that smartphone sales may be softening.</p><p>Some key investors have already begun to ease back on the big names in tech. Hedge funds reduced their positions in Facebook, Apple and Netflix over the past three months of 2017, according to Institutional Investor, an industry publication. The selling is noteworthy, because big hedge funds such as Appaloosa, Adage Capital, Tiger Global, SRS and TCI have been some of the most eager buyers of the FAANG stocks in recent years.</p><p>The hedge funds may simply be taking profits off the table. Or perhaps they're finding the lush valuations on some of the FAANGs too expensive for comfort. A more robust explanation, though, is that the sellers are growing concerned about the increasing calls for more regulation of the sector.</p><p>Recent U.S. congressional inquiries into the Cambridge Analytica scandal highlighted the vast amounts of personal data collected by Facebook and the other online giants. In Europe, measures such as the soon-to-be-introduced General Data Protection Regulation are attempting to crack down on how such information can be used.</p><p>On top of that, there are growing questions about whether the FAANG penchant for disruption is a good thing for the economy as a whole. By now, for instance, no one doubts Amazon's ability to put traditional retailers out of business. It's gobbling up the sector, just as Alphabet eviscerated the newspaper business and its YouTube subsidiary played havoc with the music business.</p><p>Is this disruption a net benefit to society? Maybe not. One sore point is that ordinary people aren't necessarily sharing in the payoff from the FAANG good times.</p><p>Consider Amazon. The online retailer is expected to report a 40per-cent jump in first-quarter sales, to US$49.9-billion, when it reports results on Thursday. By any standards, that's an astonishing rate of expansion for such a huge company.</p><p>Amazon workers, though, aren't seeing much of the joy trickle down to them. The company said in a securities filing this past week that its median employee made all of US$28,446 in 2017.</p><p>At other tech companies, too, the biggest winners are a relatively small group of people. In the case of Facebook, for instance, the problem is not how much employees are being paid, but how few employees are being paid, period. Despite its ubiquitous presence, Facebook employed only 25,000 people this past year, according to Bloomberg data. By comparison, Merck &amp; Co., a company with similar revenues, employed 68,000.</p><p>The numbers suggest FAANG companies may be qualitatively different than earlier generations of big corporate winners. For all their own issues, auto makers and oil companies created lots of middle-class jobs. The tech giants are not faring so well at that task.</p><p>In part, that's because they've become effective monopolies, protected by patents and economies of scale that prevent real competition, according to Mordecai Kurz, an emeritus professor of economics at Stanford University in California. The result, he argued in a recent editorial, is increased income inequality and large numbers of displaced workers.</p><p>\"The current situation is not just deeply unfair,\" he said. \"If unchecked, it threatens to precipitate political strife and economic turmoil, with disastrous consequences.\" He recommends higher taxation of the new monopolies, with proceeds going to compensate workers in disrupted sectors.</p><p>You can, of course, take issue with Prof. Kurz. But when a professor at Stanford - not exactly a hotbed of socialist ideology - begins to propose such measures, it's a sign that the intellectual climate is shifting and the regulatory environment may follow. Investors should pay attention.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOBML-GAM20180423rbgimcguganfangs</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOBML2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S5G-J6C1-JCRP-C1V1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303830</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"792\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Globe and Mail, a division of CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.

With the fed making a financial mess, how to prepare with  what is coming next.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Plus, surviving the apocalypse in style.  A California developer is opening  the world's largest doomsday shelter and resort.  Where do I make my  reservation?  The man behind it joins us.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> And who lost \"Money\" today?  One of America's top CEO, it is so much money,  it would make John B. Rockefeller cry.  Stay tuned to find out who it is. </p><p/><p> Because even when they say t is not, it is always about \"Money.\" </p><p/><p> It is the end of a very tumultuous week on Wall Street and it is time for  some serious crisis management for the fed.  So, you are entering the spin  zone.  Ben Bernanke is getting slam for statements this week about the  possibility of easing off the bond buying program which came just two days  of the fed chairman was basically fired on the Charlie Rose show.  I don't  know if you saw this, a lot of moving pieces but we want you to know what  you have to do right now to protect yourself in the midst of all of it.  </p><p/><p> Joining me now is Barron's senior editor, Jack Hough and Pat Howell, CEO of  Howell financial group.  Welcome back to the show.  </p><p/><p> Jack, let me start with you.  Have the wheels come off the fed here?  I  mean, it has been quite a week for those guys.  </p><p/><p> JACK HOUGH, SENIOR EDITOR, BARRON:  I'm not sure what the dissent is about.   I mean, are we supposed to keep interest rates near zero forever?  I mean,  at this point, you are trading off this much improvement in the economy  versus this much distortion of every kind of asset class investors have a  choice of.  It is time, isn't it?  </p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  It is time.  But that is not really what we're talking about.  I  mean, what we are talking about is sort of the chaos that ensued this week.   For example, I mean, let me play you the sound bite.  President Obama  basically fired Ben Bernanke in Charlie Rose.  And we will get both your  reactions on the other side.  Listen to this.  </p><p/><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p> BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I think Ben Bernanke has  done an outstanding job.  Ben Bernanke is a little bit like Bob Mueller,  the head of the FBI where he has already stayed a lot longer than he wanted  or he was supposed to.  But, I think --  </p><p/><p> CHARLIE ROSE, TV HOST:  But if he wanted to be reappointed, you would  reappoint him?  </p><p/><p> OBAMA:  He has been outstanding partner along with the White House.  </p><p/><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  What?  I mean, that is not really a ringing endorsement.  Pat,  that is like somebody saying, you know, how is your husband?  You are like,  well, he has been outstanding partner until now.  </p><p/><p> PATRICIA POWELL, CEO, POWELL FINANCIAL GROUP:  Anybody can be a loose  cannon, it is just odd it is the president of the United States.  </p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  Is he a loose cannon or was that on purpose?  I mean, don't know.   There is a lot of negativity there.  </p><p/><p> POWELL:  He is making some telegraphing things too.  He is not going to  Jackson hole, you know, that was a little odd.  I mean, he has been  telegraphing things.  And a lot of people say that he is tired, this has  been exhausting thing, and it was not really -- this is now what he had in  mind when he became chairman of the fed.  </p><p/><p> HOUGH:  He was looking at his shoes when he said that, right?  </p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  Right.  </p><p/><p> HOUGH:  I'm not a body language expert, but that says stayed.  </p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  He stayed a lot longer than he was supposed to or he wanted to.   I mean, that is pretty harsh.  So then, it is not surprising that Ben  Bernanke comes out, rocks the boat a bit.  I mean, they are all over the  place.  You have James Bullard, Ben coming out today saying, well maybe,  you know, we are going t have more combination down the road if we need it.   Basically, going against everything that Ben Bernanke said, which is sort  of all over the map.  Where does that leave investors?  </p><p/><p> HOUGH:  It is unusual to see a special press release like that with a sort  of dissenting view.  And I think it is already a tumultuous time for the  market.  I don't think there's any kind of financial Armageddon.  I mean,  where people are getting crazy about losing a few percent in the stock  market.  Keep in mind the market is double in nearly, you know, in about  four years, and treasury rates are up (INAUDIBLE), were 2.5 percent for the  average over the past 50 years, it is over six percent.  So we don't have  skyrocketing interest rates something like that.  </p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  It says that the whole point is we need these guys.  I mean, they  are doing -- they have done policy that we have never seen before in our  lives.  So, we need them to dismount in the cleanest way possible her and  get out of it.  So far just this week it has been utter chaos.  </p><p/><p> My favorite comment because the twitter universe and online to block its  fear was alive, with all of these different machination during the week.  I  love Lawrence McDonald tweeted, somebody that a lot of us follow, he is on  TV all the time.  He said job opening, portfolio manager need for $3.5  trillion, 70-tons leverage Hedge Fund unlimited borrow, no marked market,  see Federal Reserve.  </p><p/><p> Does not inspire confidence?  I mean, everybody is joking about what is  going on.  It does tell you don't have a lot of confidence of what is going  on.  </p><p/><p> POWELL:  Well, nobody here has confidence because we don't know how this is  going to be around.  But, it is so much better that they are telling us  this stuff.  We don't want to invest blindly.  We don't want to have  another secret.  </p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  They telling us, what though?  They are telling us all different  things.  I mean, Bullard says we could ease more.  Ben Bernanke says we are  getting out, President Obama says he is fired, telling us what?  </p><p/><p> POWELL:  Well, Bernanke started, I think, on the 22nd of May by giving us  the first inkling that there thinking about chasing, and I think in this  particular -- the comments this week really dealt with the fact that we are  creating a plan to taper.  This is a very good thing.  It is so much better  to have a plan than to be shooting from the hips which was not good.  </p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  So, how do we all set ourselves up for this because this is the  take away that we want for our audience here?  It means that interest rates  are going up, maybe, my thought is give anything interest-rate sensitive  whether it is an adjustable mortgage or it is credit card rates you want to  keep an eye on that, maybe it is a great time in real estate to transact  whether you are a buyer or a seller.  I mean, if you are a buyer, this is  probably as good as the rates are going to be.  If you are seller, you may  want to transact because it is the most money that a buyer is going to  have.  What do you think? </p><p/><p> POWELL:  Buyers may start rushing in because they have been sitting back  waiting to see what is going to happen, now they saw a real choice.  If  interest rates go up, every point that goes up they lose purchasing power  or borrowing power.  So, it can push the real estate market, actually, up  in the short run.  </p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  In the short run.  In the long run, I mean, Jack, would you agree  with that?  In the long run, it is bad for the real estate market because  higher interest rates make it tougher.  </p><p/><p> HOUGH:  I'm on sure there is anyone here is on the fence right now, that  waiting for a little less of the mortgage rate before they buy, I mean,  that ship has sailed.  But I think in terms of investors right now, you  hold onto some extra cash because there's a possibility both stocks and  bonds are going to be weak at the same time.  We don't a lynch how an  interesting piece of research what they said.  Right now, inflations is  actually coming down and interest rates are going up, which is a rarity.   It happened in 1994, at that time tech stocks outperformed, utilities got  hurt, they were recommending the same thing right now.  </p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  Interesting point of view.  </p><p/><p> All right, thanks to both of you.  Good stuff.  </p><p/><p> HOUGH:  Thank you.  </p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  Time now for today's fuel gauge report.  China and Russia signing  $270 billion oil deal.  It is one of the biggest in history.  Rosneft,  Russian's state owned oil company will double supplies to China.  It could  reach up to 900,000 barrels per day.  That is according to Vladimir Putin.   The 25 year deal makes chin China the biggest customer for Russian oil.  </p><p/><p>U.S. gasoline demand for May fell to a 13 year low.  That is according to  the American Petroleum Institute.  Demand slipped by 3.3 percent to about  8.7 million barrels per day.  </p><p/><p> And Oil futures is getting smacked for a second session, a stronger U.S.  dollar largely fueling oil decline.  It posted its biggest two-day drop in  a year losing about 4.5 percent.  Crude settled at $93.69 a barrel.  Big  move on the week.  </p><p/><p> All right, up next, Michael Dell versus Carl Icahn, it is the face-off only  the power of money could create.  We are going to tell you how it is  turning personal now.  </p><p/><p> Plus, the reason the government has gotten so good at spying on you is  because it is coaching top talent from Silicon Valley.  Maybe you didn't  know that.  We got details on the stunning revelation in the NSA scandal.  </p><p/><p> More \"Money\" coming up.  </p><p/><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  The battle between two Wall Street titans is getting bigger and  personal, by the way.  Michael Dell now launching a personal pitch to buy  out his ubiquitous company, and pushed Icahn's offer out of the way, but  will it deliver or well Icahn when out?  It is all about the power of  \"Money.\"  </p><p/><p> Here to weigh in is \"Wall Street Journal\" business editor, Dennis Berman  and Jonas Max Ferris at MaxFunds.com. </p><p/><p> Great to have you both on the show.  </p><p/><p> Dennis, let me start with you.  This is battle of the titans.  I mean,  these are two enormous egos out there, so how do you size of the whole  think?  </p><p/><p> DENNIS BERMAN, BUSINESS EDITOR, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  I see Dell winning,  Icahn losing.  </p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  Really?  How come?  </p><p/><p> BERMAN:  Simple reason.  The best chance for Dell to beaten was a potential  rival bid from another private equity firm.  Carl Icahn, at this point, he  could do a lot of great noise and smoke and a lot of activity, but when it  comes down to it the shareholder will have to say that he wants to take  this offer or do we not?  And right now, given the market where they are,  they are probably going to take the offer of $14 per share.  </p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  So Jonas, what do you think?  I mean, his basically saying Silver  Lake wins the day because, of course, that too smacky (ph) Michael Dell?  </p><p/><p> JONAS MAX FERRIS, MARKET WATCHER, MAXFUNDS.COM:  Because I think people  would rather side with the guy who started the company in his dorm room  then some Wall Street raider.  I just don't think that that is -- that guy  is going to fix it.  </p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  The guy has started the company in his dorm room, but has kind of  driven it into the ground, right?  </p><p/><p> FERRIS:  Well, by that logic every tech CEO who isn't Apple or Samsung  should be fired because they all missed the smart phone revolution.  Go  down the line, everybody screwed up.  And the whole PC, this has come on  land.  That was original cornerstone of the business was assembling PC box.   That is a dying business and it is easy to say, he missed the smart phone  and pad revolution, yes, it is good.  But everybody didn't because it is  really hard to compete.  </p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  I don't know.  I mean, Dennis, right here you have his whole  plan, Michael Dell's whole plan right here, for how he will turn the  company around.  And we were talking about this is the commercial break is  that if he has this brilliance, why hasn't he done it already, why doesn't  he do it while the company is public?  I mean, just do it, you know.  Why  do you have to take (INAUDIBLE).  </p><p/><p> BERMAN:  I think you make a really good point.  I agree with you.  And, if  you read this and it doesn't take long because he doesn't write very much  here you will be relatively uninspired by what with Michael dell has to  say.  You will be relatively uninspired by what Michael Dell has to say.   It is what I would call problem.  It is generic.  It does not say anything.  </p><p/><p> But, whether he says anything here or not or whether Carl Icahn is the  right person to be a part of dell, really, it doesn't matter is there's  only one thing that matters, to shareholders want to accept the price for  dell right now?  There are no offers being the price of the stock is  trading below the $14 offer.  It the market that telling us that will  probably be accepted.  Although, it may not be easy at the moment.  </p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  Jonas, if you are a shareholder -- but, are you, by the way?  </p><p/><p> FERRIS:  We all own it through mutual funds indirectly.  Directly, don't  bow and very few people only this directly.  It is not growth stock getting  more and the public only owns like Apple directly users all along by --.  </p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  So, would say, give me the $14 let me the hell out of the stock?   So, I can just forget about Dell and go off.  </p><p/><p> FERRIS:  Because I think Icahn is playing an a head start for proxy movie,  who with all the movie with the executives try to pretend the company was  worthless so they can buy the stock at a cheap price and then by putting  the bad CEO in.  That was the movie.  I think that is what the spin is  here, the Dell rule is down talking the stock so he could take it private.  </p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  So you think it has more value than Roe (ph).  </p><p/><p> FERRIS:  I do think so.  </p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  Really?  Why, what is so valuable?  </p><p/><p> FERRIS:  Well, it is a long shot, but without the PC business, I think  there is still an angle to be some sort of IBM asks more, you know, selling  silver type in software company.  It is not a huge growth opportunity, but  I think there is something there that is more valuable than the current  share price.  That is a better price for a lot of non-Apple, Samsung  companies today.  </p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  What do you think, Dennis?  Is that possible?  </p><p/><p> BERMAN:  It is certainly possible.  And this is that the fundamental  complex.  The real tension inside this management by IPOs, what does the  guy at the top of the ladder know that I don't know that he shares with us?   And should I trust him, or should I not?  </p><p/><p> Here is another great example.  J. Crew, great company.  We all know that  company.  It went private after the CEO basically forced and offer down his  owned shareholder's growth.  So, Jonas makes a fair point about the  conflicts inherent in that those dynamics.  But again, as it stands now,  roughly 15 percent or so of shares are a lied against BBO (ph).  </p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  But wait, but other than him knowing something we all don't, what  would be his other reason for wanting to take it private?  </p><p/><p> FERRIS:  I would say vanity.  It is his business.  He has got his name on  it.  It is hard to walk away.  You don't want it to die.  It is called  Dell.  It is not Microsoft, you know.  It holds on Bill Gates' software.   So, it is like there's a certain element where you want it to succeed.  </p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  So, it is either vanity or he knows something we don't?  Real  quick before we go, what is your bet, vanity or he knows something we  don't?  </p><p/><p> FERRIS:  I think it is still worth more than it is.  I do think all these  tycoons, these are old, are going to go private at some point because --.  </p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  So, he knows something we don't.  That's how I'm going to  interpret that.  </p><p/><p> Dennis, what do you think, vanity or he know something we don't?  </p><p/><p> BERMAN:  I say the answer is both.  But, in the end --  </p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  How can it be both?  Pick one.  </p><p/><p> BERMAN:  Well, he is both vain and he knows something that we don't.  Those  can both motivations.  In the end, the shareholders are going to bite  because --.  </p><p/><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  OK.  Guys, you are fantastic, thank you.  </p><p/><p> BERMAN:  Thank you.  </p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  Coming up on \"Money,\" if you knew facebook former chief security  officer but feel like he has dropped off the radar, here is why.  He is now  working for the NSA and he is not alone.  We will tell you how Silicon  Valley is getting help to the government's prying eyes.  </p><p/><p> Plus, former Enron CEO, Jeff Skilling, hits 10 years, why he stop his  prison sentence?  And it could be a dream come true for white-collar  criminals.  </p><p/><p> Stay right where you are and find out why.  </p><p/><p> Do you ever have too much \"Money\"?  </p><p/><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  Weather it is on Wall Street or Main Street, here is to make  \"Money\" today.  </p><p/><p> Actually, I can start with who made money.  Larry Ellison, the CEO of  Oracle, lost so much money I have to do that one first.  Oracle's latest  earnings were a big disappointment on Wall Street.  And as a result, the  shares plunged more than nine percent today.  So Larry Ellison owns 1.1  billion shares of Oracle.  That means he lost $3.4 billion today, $3.4  billion.  I had to put that in perspective.  Ellison bought the whole  island of Lanai last year for $300 million.  So, he lost the equivalent of  11 Hawaiian Islands today.  </p><p/><p> Meanwhile, trying to make \"Money\" today, Starbucks, it is raising drink  cause for first time in almost two years.  The average price hike will be  about one percent.  Starbucks blames rising rent and labor cost for the  increase.  </p><p/><p> And the Miami heat championship win proving a ratings gold mine for ABC.   Nearly 18 percent of you at home watched game seven last night.  That is  according to Nielsen.  It is the second highest rating for an NBA game in  11 years, a sign of the times and congratulations.  </p><p/><p> So, if you have been following the NSA spy scandal you may wonder how tight  the government really is with big tech companies like facebook, for  example.  Well, a shocking report reveal that actually left to go work for  the NSA back in 2010 and evidently, he is not the only big tech exec that's  made the move from Silicon Valley to government spy agency.  </p><p/><p> That brings up a lot of questions and concerns, namely what kinds of info  are these ex-tech employees bringing to their new job.  With me on this  frightening development is managing director of TechnoBuffalo, Roy Choi.  </p><p/><p> Welcome back to the show, Roy.  </p><p/><p> ROY CHOI, MANAGING DIRECTOR, TECHNOBUFFALO:  Thank you.  </p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  I mean, should we be afraid of this?  I mean, this is a guy who  was in charge of protecting our own private personal information on  facebook and he eventually took the knowledge and the keys of the kingdom  and went to go work for an agency that is now spying on us.  </p><p/><p> CHOI:  I think we have to assume that, you know, employees as tech  companies like facebook, Google, Skype, they have this information and  they're going to go somewhere and may be to the NSA and feed that.  </p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  So, you are basically saying, we have to assume that everything  we put online could eventually be handed over to people who are spying on  us?  And you just have to be satisfied with that?  </p><p/><p> CHOI:  Yes.  They have policies in place, but when you turn into reality  you will see that information isn't always word is supposed to be.  We will  claim it is 100 percent locks down, but how many times have we seen leaks  weathered his credit card information or online information leaks either  accidentally or a hole in the security software or malicious hackers going  in and getting this information.  </p><p/><p> So, I can't say that people are always going to be secure.  And you know, I  think people are under the assumption when I post something online, it is  going to be there for public consumption.  But you know, it is beyond that,  it is the metadata, it is the stuff you don't necessarily see.  </p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  What will be his motivation for leaving a place like facebook?   You have to imagine that at the level he was, he was making a lot of money  and owned a lot of stock and did really well.  Why would you leave and go  and work for the government?  </p><p/><p> CHOI:  Who knows?  Maybe it is a greater challenge.  Maybe, you know,  facebook has been a huge supporter of helping fight crime a couple of years  ago.  And I am not saying this particular security official, but the most  recent security official actually implemented a program where they could  actually search through content, so there was anything that is a sexual  predator was out there and putting in language that would be a little worry  some for law enforcement, they would openly give that information out.  And  you know, they have actually stated their policy is as long as there is a  court order or any type of subpoena they would hand that information freely  in order to protect users.  And at that point, they were under a lot of  pressure to help especially with lots of sexual predators lurking on  facebook.  </p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  That's one thing.  But you know, when I have asked that question  in the past of hackers and the like, why would you go from the private  sector where you are making a lot of money to work for the NSA or any  government agency for a lot less.  They say that they are allowed to do  things when you're working for the NSA that you're not allowed to do in  regular life, and you are allowed to spy in a way that you can't do for a  private company.  So you combine sort of that ability and ambition with  someone who knows the intimate ins and outs of a facebook or a Google and  you get a very powerful government who could spy on us even more than we  ever imagined.  Your thoughts on that?  </p><p/><p> CHOI:  Definitely.  And I think, when we look at, in terms of national  security, in terms of our own security, privately, you are going to see the  internet as like the next forum, whether that is in a proactive manner or a  reactive manner.  So, for someone to leave from Silicon Valley, the  constraints of, you know, regulations and whatever else, you know, maybe  you go to the NSA, maybe you go to another government agency, but you do  get that level of freedom to go out and use your talents to make your mark.  </p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  Yes.  </p><p/><p> Roy, thank you so much for coming on the show.  Appreciate your time.  </p><p/><p> CHOI:  Thank you.  Appreciate it.  </p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  Up next on \"Money,\" we are going to Jeffrey Skilling.  He  committed one of the worst acts of corporate fraud in U.S. history.  Well,  the former Enron CEO is now getting out of prison 10 years ahead of  schedule.  We are going to explain why this is music to the ears of white- collar criminals everywhere.  </p><p/><p> Plus, a bipartisan group of senators wants to block U.S. military funding  for Syrian rebels.  You may like the sound of that, but will we have to  spend even more if we don't act now?  One of the many top experts breaks  down the numbers for us.  </p><p/><p> Piles of \"money\" coming up.  </p><p/><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>  MELISSA FRANCIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  New developments today in  the case of convicted white-collar felon, Jeffrey Skilling.  The former  Enron CEO has served six and half years of a 24-year sentence, so far, for  bringing down the world's largest energy trader.  It was one of the worst  acts of corporate fraud in U.S. history.</p><p/><p>  But today, his sentence was sliced by 10 years.  Meaning, now, he's  going to be out in just seven and a half years instead of 17 1/2 years from  now.  So, what does his short and sentence mean for white-collar criminals?   Here with the dish is our go to lawyer, Arthur Aidala.</p><p/><p>ARTHUR AIDALA, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST:  Dish?</p><p/><p>  FRANCIS:  Dish.  Yes.</p><p/><p>AIDALA:  Is that a legal term?</p><p/><p>  FRANCIS:  It is.  You didn't know that, because you're a lawyer.  You  should know.</p><p/><p>AIDALA:  -- any Italian food, so I don't know what the dishes (ph) are  about.</p><p/><p>  FRANCIS:  What is the deal?</p><p/><p>AIDALA:  The deal here is this.  He appeals -- he gets convicted, gets  this huge sentence -- </p><p/><p>  (CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>  FRANCIS:  I mean, he didn't kill anyone.</p><p/><p>AIDALA:  He didn't kill anyone, but let me double check my map here.   $60 billion in Enron stock was rendered worthless.  $2 billion in employee  pension were rented worthless.  It's a lot of guilt (ph).</p><p/><p>  FRANCIS:  Yes.</p><p/><p>AIDALA:  That's a lot of money going on there.  So -- and more  importantly that a lot of money, it's a lot of people who got affected.  I  mean, lives were ruined, lives were destroyed.  So, he gets this really  rough sentence.  He -- (INAUDIBLE) who supposed to go get sentenced and get  wiped out, he dies, so that wipes out his conviction.  And, he appeals all  the way up to the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court basing the rules in  his favor saying one of the ways -- one of the convictions against him was  improper.</p><p/><p>  They go to a lower court about it.  Should there be a new trial?   Should there be a new trial?  The bottom line is, they say that he was  sentenced to nine years too many, and for them not to re-appeal, because he  could have, the government said look -- </p><p/><p>  FRANCIS:  Nine years too many in which -- in what then?  Why?</p><p/><p>AIDALA:  Because the guideline calculations, which is the very  complicated way.</p><p/><p>  FRANCIS:  They did the bath rock (ph).</p><p/><p>AIDALA:  Well, they applied things the wrong way.  In federal court  unlike state court, to figure someone's sentence, you need like a small  calculus degree.  It's crazy.  And basically, in court, the judges said,  you did this the wrong way, you came about this the wrong way, therefore,  there's at least nine years that he's got tacked on that shouldn't be  tacked on.</p><p/><p>  FRANCIS:  So, are white-collar criminals everywhere rejoining because  the scuttlebutt on this all week long has been that the sentences for  financial crimes up late.  I mean, if you look at (INAUDIBLE).  I mean, all  of this has been very stiff.</p><p/><p>AIDALA:  Well, what -- right.</p><p/><p>  FRANCIS:  And is this the beginning of a reduction in the sentences  for financial crisis, which as you said, ruined a lot of lives -- </p><p/><p>AIDALA:  A lot of lives.</p><p/><p>  FRANCIS:  -- but in many cases are longer than murder convictions.</p><p/><p>AIDALA:  Correct.  But literally, like a murder conviction, you're  really affecting like one person and one family.  This affected -- </p><p/><p>  FRANCIS:  Right.  But they're dead as opposed to I don't have money.   I mean, we should rather be alive -- </p><p/><p>  (CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>AIDALA:  But there are these charts in the federal law that when you  commit a crime, you start off at a very -- a below base level which is like  a non-jail sentence.  And then depending on how much money was stolen or  how much fraud or how much tax evasion, that's what you come up with the  numbers.  So, if it's just a minimal amount like 100 million, you're at one  level.</p><p/><p>  FRANCIS:  Very little.  Yes.</p><p/><p>AIDALA:  When it's 60 billion, you're at the highest level.  You're  literally off the charts.  The United State Supreme Court did say that the  way they convicted him under this honest services fraud law, which is a  very complicated thing to explain, was not done properly.  So, yes, a door  has been opened to criminal defendants to tell the government, you need to  prosecute us in this way, not in that way.  And it may have lightened the  load on them.  But, you know -- </p><p/><p>  FRANCIS:  Sounds like you don't think the original 24 was that unfair  (ph), though.</p><p/><p>AIDALA:  I mean, they did some bad stuff.  They hurt a lot of people.   They hurt a lot of retired people who are like -- I mean, you go from  thinking like, going to bed, thinking I have a half a million dollars in  the bank and I'm 80 years old to I have nothing in the bank and I'm 80  years old.</p><p/><p>  FRANCIS:  Yes.</p><p/><p>AIDALA:  Hello!</p><p/><p>  FRANCIS:  Arthur, thank you so much.</p><p/><p>  (CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>  FRANCIS:  You did a great job.  There's smoke coming out of your ears.</p><p/><p>AIDALA:  I learn about the dish.  I dished it.  I knew about the dish.   Thank you, folks.</p><p/><p>  FRANCIS:  Turning now to a much more serious topic, the unsettling  situation in Syria.  All eyes are on the country's reports (ph) on chemical  weapons use and see frightening images of escalating violence.  Now, some  Lawmakers here at home are trying to block any U.S. funding to armed  rebels.</p><p/><p>  Of course, we know the story is about a lot more than money.  There's  an enormous human toll, but our show is called MONEY, so we're going to  focus on that angle.  We're going to take a closer look at whether or not  it would actually cost us more to get involved now or not.</p><p/><p>  Joining us now with his take is Zuhdi Jasser, president of the  American Islamic Forum for Democracy.  Always nice to have you, Zuhdi.</p><p/><p>  ZUHDI JASSER, AMERICAN ISLAMIC FORUM FOR DEMOCRACY:  Thanks, Melissa.   It's great to be with you.</p><p/><p>  FRANCIS:  You know, we're trying to break down the cost.  As we said,  huge human toll, you know, for humanitarian reasons you may or may not want  to get involved, but looking at just the dollar part of it, what is the  cost of doing nothing at this point?</p><p/><p>  JASSER:  Well, we have two and half years, Melissa, of the revolution  to know what that cost is.  And just some numbers from Tel Aviv University,  it looks like in Jordan, it costs $35 per refugee just to house them per  year.  So, you're looking right now at three to four million refugees that  have been displaced in Syria.</p><p/><p>  FRANCIS:  Who's paying for that?</p><p/><p>  JASSER:  That's the thing.  Jordan is paying for some of it, but we're  paying a lot of it.  We've already paid over half a billion dollars through  USAID into the region, and it's looking like the refugees are going to  reach six million by the end of the year, and our money is into it.</p><p/><p>  It's going to be in the billions whether we do, you know, nothing  militarily or not, it's going to be -- it's a part of the region that if  we're going to continue to try to maintain stability, the humanitarian aid  is not only the compassionate thing to do, it has to be done militarily  strategically or otherwise the entire region will implode with sectarian  violence and our ally in the region.  Israel will certainly be threatened.</p><p/><p>  FRANCIS:  If we do something, that is incredibly expensive, already  looking at the estimates.  A no-fly zone in the first 10 days alone would  cost $1.4 billion.  And it expands from there, right?</p><p/><p>  JASSER:  Oh, absolutely.  And you know, the no-fly zone -- yes, Libya  was a bit cheaper, but they're looking -- this is more like Iraq.  Syria  has a more sophisticated military that would need to be taken out, and  somewhere of 50 to 100 million a day, they say.  But still, I think the  cost and a lot of experts have said this the cost are going to be less, as  Michael O'Hanlon (ph) from Brookings said, it's a bargain if we can end  this war earlier.</p><p/><p>  Because look, two and half years have proven this war is going  nowhere.  Assad maybe winning as far as militarily, but the attrition from  the Syrian army continues.  It's only how long, how many months or years  when Assad will finally fall.  And if we want to have a play in the region  and be involved in the right side of history and help move them towards, we  defeat Assad first as the strategy and second defeat al Qaeda.</p><p/><p>  If we want to play a role in that, we have to be on the right side of  history to fight against the Iran, fight against Hezbollah, et cetera.  Not  with troops.</p><p/><p>  FRANCIS:  -- on the right side of history and some are arguing that  it's too late for that.  That early on, we could have been fighting against  Hezbollah and Assad.  And when we originally saw pictures of children being  slaughtered, that was the time to get involved, but we didn't.  And now, at  this point, al Qaeda and extremists have gotten involved.</p><p/><p>  On the other side, and it's become now al Qaeda versus Hezbollah,  which isn't our fight, neither of those folks are our friends, and we  should just stay out of it.  That is one of the theories that's out there.   I'll give you the last word on why you don't agree with that, if you don't.</p><p/><p>  JASSER:  Well, that calculus of characterizing the opposition of al  Qaeda is just not correct.  The Syrian population has become more  radicalized and they're becoming more, you know, chaotic and committing  atrocities, but that's because we've done nothing.  If we come to the side  of helping the millions -- there's only tens of thousands of al Qaeda --  the millions of Syrians in this opposition, we will help defeat the  ultimate source of the radicalization which is Assad.</p><p/><p>  And remember, Hezbollah, the forms of terror in the Middle East is  Iran.  So, those on my (ph) conservative side that believe that doing  nothing will allow al Qaeda to die, actually, al Qaeda is thriving,  Hezbollah is thriving.  Terror will thrive without our involvement.  So,  the question is, which side has less terror?  I believe doing something  would.</p><p/><p>  FRANCIS:  Zuhdi Jasser, thank you so much for your thoughts tonight.   We always appreciate it.</p><p/><p>  JASSER:  Thank you.  Appreciate it.</p><p/><p>  FRANCIS:  We have some breaking news right now on Facebook.  Let's go  to Fox Business' Jo Ling Kent with the latest.  Jo Ling, what do you have? </p><p/><p>  JO LING KENT, FOX BUSINESS:  Melissa, Facebook is confirming on their  website that a security breach has exposed six million e-mail addresses and  telephone numbers.  And let me tell you a little bit more of what they're  saying on the website.</p><p/><p>  They found, they said, through their white hat security researching  program that they use that, quote, \"that may have allowed some of a  person's contact information e-mail or phone number to be accessed by  people who either had some contact information about the person or some  connection to that person.\"</p><p/><p>  So, they're saying six million e-mail addresses and telephone numbers  were shared, but Facebook was also very quick to note in its statement that  no other types of personal or financial information were included and only  people on Facebook, not developers or advertisers, had access to this  information.</p><p/><p>  So, certainly, a very alarming security breach has happened at  Facebook, and we'll continue to bring you more a little bit later, Melissa.</p><p/><p>  FRANCIS:  Wow.  Jo Ling, thanks so much.</p><p/><p>  All right.  Coming up on MONEY, surviving the end of the world sounds  tough.  Indoor pool, a bowling alley, a golf, maybe it wouldn't be that  bad.  A California developer is opening the world's largest doomsday  shelter.  This will be an underground resort.  It's fabulous.  He's taking  reservations.  He joins us with all the details, because at the end of the  day, the end of the world, it's all about MONEY.</p><p/><p>  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>  FRANCIS:  Talk about surviving in style.  Vivos Survival Shelter and  Resort is the chicest doomsday shelter out there.  For a few thousand  bucks, you and yours (ph) can be safe from any number of impending  disasters.  Cozily nestled 100 feet below in Atchison Kansas, and you can  live in your shelter in your very own RV -- wow! -- for up to a year.   There is big money to be made in the bunker business.</p><p/><p>  Joining me now is Robert Vicino.  He is founder and CEO of Vivos Group  and the owner of the fabulous shelter.  Thank you so much for coming on.</p><p/><p>  ROBERT VICINO, VIVOS GROUP FOUNDER AND CEO:  It's my honor.</p><p/><p>  FRANCIS:  I understand that this is a space that the army previously  used.  They auctioned it off.  And what gave you the idea to make it into a  doomsday shelter? </p><p/><p>  VICINO:  Well, we've been in the shelter business for the last five  years building Vivos shelters around the world.  And, typically, whenever a  government shelter or facility comes up, we try to buy it and then  retrofitted and convert it into a modern day blast shelter.  This one was  auctioned by the GSA and we jumped on it.</p><p/><p>  FRANCIS:  What is it like?  What happens when I arrived there?</p><p/><p>  VICINO:  It is a turnkey four-star underground hotel/cruise ship.   It's everything you could imagine.  It's not just a survival shelter.  It  is truly a destination resort where you and your family and your children  would want to go to many times a year, perhaps, in the middle of the winter  where it' s 70 degrees inside this mountain year round.  So, you will be  very comfortable.</p><p/><p>  FRANCIS:  Do people come even if there's not a disaster by space (ph).   Can I come and hang out?</p><p/><p>  VICINO:  Anytime you want.  You can't permanently live there, but yes,  it's open 24/7 forever.  And so, you buy your space and you park your RV  there, whatever you're comfortable with, be it a 20-footer or 45-foot motor  home for a million dollar.  And it's a one-time charge, and you know, it's  yours, you're a co-owner of this what would be a billion dollar  replacement.</p><p/><p>  FRANCIS:  Does it cost me a million dollars?  I mean, I read that it's  $1,000 per lineal foot.  The average RV is about 30 feet, so that's  $30,000, and there's $1,500 charge per person, but I don't know what --  over what period of time.  How much would it cost me?  I have a husband and  two kids, what are you going to charge me?</p><p/><p>  VICINO:  Well, you're the perfect nuclear family.</p><p/><p>  FRANCIS:  Yes.  Thank you.</p><p/><p>  VICINO:  And, it would cost no extra charge for any of those family  members, the only thing you're paying for is the RV, itself, by the lineal  foot.  So, if you had a 30-foot RV, it's $30,000 and four children or four  people for food, that's a one year food supply.  It's another 6,000.  So,  for $36,000, you've got yourself an investment and a life assurance policy  or -- </p><p/><p>  FRANCIS:  How many people have signed up, so far?  How much money have  you made?</p><p/><p>  VICINO:  Well, not enough.  We've had 25,000 applications over the  last few years.  The primary problem has been the cost.  People can't  afford our other shelters where it's a per person rate as much as $50,000.   So, this -- </p><p/><p>  FRANCIS:  So, of those 25,000, how many people have locked it in?</p><p/><p>  VICINO:  On this new one, we just announced it last week in or  membership, and we've got a few hundred already signed up.  So, it's going  to happen very quickly.  We'll sell out.  This one will accommodate only  1,500 RVs or about 5,000 people, which I like to say is almost one in a  million people on Earth.</p><p/><p>  FRANCIS:  This one makes me nervous about this.  So, you're all the  way in Kansas.  I'm in New York, for example.  What kind of doomsday  disaster would come my way that I would have enough time to get there?</p><p/><p>  VICINO:  Oh, let's say a nuke went off in L.A. or in Washington or in  the Middle East, or let's say where about to see a major economic meltdown,  which could happen any day, as you know, or let's say the earth was  rumbling or an asteroid was on its way.  Things -- </p><p/><p>  FRANCIS:  I would have enough time to get there?</p><p/><p>  VICINO:  It's time to go.  And you may go and it may not happen, and  so, it's a false alarm just like the fireman goes to the -- </p><p/><p>  FRANCIS:  Yes.</p><p/><p>  VICINO:  -- but at least you have somewhere to go versus the other  seven billion people on the planet that will have no solution, nowhere to  go, and they'll be scrambling.  And you don't want to be a part of that  mash (ph).  You want to go.  You want to have a safe haven.  You'll be  underground in what we call effectively a fortress.</p><p/><p>  FRANCIS:  OK.  Robert, thanks for coming on the show.  Interesting  idea.  Sounds like -- I'll be interested to see if it's a good business, if  you sell out, because -- I mean, there's a lot to be afraid of these days.   I don't know.  People want an insurance policy.  Thanks for coming on.   Keep us posted.</p><p/><p>  VICINO:  My pleasure.</p><p/><p>  FRANCIS:  Here is our MONEY question of the day.  How much would you  pay for a spot on world's biggest doomsday shelter?  Not surprisingly, I  got a lot of funny responses to this one, including Less Than Zero.  \"I'd  rather die than live in Kansas.\"  Come on!  Come on.  Kansas is a nice  place.  That was mean.</p><p/><p>  We want to hear from more of you.  You can like us on Facebook at  acebook.com/MelissaFrancisFox or follow me on Twitter @MelissaAFrancis.</p><p/><p>  All right.  Coming up on MONEY.  Oh, bless you, Kanye and Kim.  You  gave your baby a name even crazier than we thought possible.  And there's  developing news on what the middle name is, too.  We've got it all in  \"Spare Change.\"  You can never have too many insane celebrities.</p><p/><p>  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>  FRANCIS:  All right.  Welcome to \"Spare Change.\"  We are joined by  Jarrod Guy Randolph and we also have Hitha Prabhakar here.  Thanks to both  of you for coming on.  A little \"Spare Change\" fun on this Friday.</p><p/><p>  HITHA PRABHAKAR, RETAIL ANALYST:  Thanks for having us.</p><p/><p>  FRANCIS:  All right.  First, we are going to look at some birthdays at  work.  If it is not already bad enough that you're in the office for your  birthday, check this out.  This birthday card we saw, you literally just  check the box next to your name.  Can you imagine that, to show your love?   I mean, come on.  You can't even sign your name anymore.</p><p/><p>  What would you do if you got this card?  You check the box next to  your names.  You check, you know, best wishes, happy birthday, get hammered  on us.  I don't know.</p><p/><p>  PRABHAKAR:  I got to be honest with you, this is actually a nicer card  than I received from most of my family members for my birthday.</p><p/><p>  FRANCIS:  What?</p><p/><p>  PRABHAKAR:  Yes.</p><p/><p>  FRANCIS:  You need a new family.</p><p/><p>  (LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>  (CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>  FRANCIS:  What is worse than this card, no card at all or do the cards  say does it have so many else's name in it?  I mean, what is worse than  this card?</p><p/><p>  PRABHAKAR:  Misspelled name.</p><p/><p>  FRANCIS:  Hitha is pretty straightforward.  Hitha Prabhakar, I don't  want to have to spell on television, but Hitha, I could do.</p><p/><p>  PRABHAKAR:  No one really sign their names either.  It was just kind  of -- </p><p/><p>  FRANCIS:  Really?</p><p/><p>  PRABHAKAR:  Yes.</p><p/><p>  FRANCIS:  Wow.</p><p/><p>  PRABHAKAR:  Yes.  So -- </p><p/><p>  FRANCIS:  You're going to be in therapy for that for a long time.</p><p/><p>  (LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>  FRANCIS:  Jarrod, what about you?</p><p/><p>  JARROD GUY RANDOLPH, CORE VICE PRESIDENT:  I don't think there was  follow-through on that card.  It was supposed to lead in the something  else, but I mean -- </p><p/><p>  FRANCIS:  Like what?</p><p/><p>  (CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>  RANDOLPH:  If birthday cards look like that, I can only imagine what  the annual holiday bonus looks like.</p><p/><p>  (LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>  FRANCIS:  Yes.</p><p/><p>  RANDOLPH:  So, for me, I'd be a little upset if my co-workers gave  that to me.</p><p/><p>  FRANCIS:  OK.  So, this is a new case for your iPhone.  It doubles as  a stun gun to prevent any accidental discharge.  Yes, I would hope.  Users  have to flip two switches before activating the gun.  The case sells for  140 bucks.  And the co-founder says sales could exceed a million dollars  this year.</p><p/><p>  Is this just a must have or is it a lawsuit waiting to happen?  I'm  wondering, what happens when you accidentally but dial with your iPhone.   That's a stun gun (ph).  That would be quite a shock.</p><p/><p>  PRABHAKAR:  Not only is it a lawsuit waiting to happen, it's a  disaster waiting to happen.  I mean, I can't tell you how many times I get  misdialed phones from different people.  I misdial (ph) phone.  Also, if  you're getting attacked, why would you want to on latch (ph) something and  then security check this.  I mean, wouldn't you want to just kind of go for  it and try to protect yourself?</p><p/><p>  RANDOLPH:  I see the value on this product.</p><p/><p>  FRANCIS:  You do?</p><p/><p>  RANDOLPH:  This will be even (ph) my secret weapon.  You will buy a  $50 million apartment.  I'm going to start using this with my client.</p><p/><p>  (LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>  RANDOLPH:  I mean, I don't see why not.  If this actually became an  approved Apple accessory.  So -- </p><p/><p>  FRANCIS:  What?  Really?</p><p/><p>  RANDOLPH:  It's kind of amazing.</p><p/><p>  FRANCIS:  There should be a breathalyzer attached to it.</p><p/><p>  (CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>  RANDOLPH:  They're going to come up with that.</p><p/><p>  PRABHAKAR:  Right.</p><p/><p>  RANDOLPH:  And if you go on the website, the pink ones are the ones  that have sold out first.  I'm just waiting for the camouflage.</p><p/><p>  FRANCIS:  How much is the cost?  Does anybody know?</p><p/><p>  RANDOLPH:  I think it's about $140.</p><p/><p>  FRANCIS:  Wow!  That's amazing.  Well, there's a Christmas gift.</p><p/><p>  All right.  So, the big baby news of the week, a bizarre name given.   Reality princess, Kim Kardashian and rapper baby daddy, Kanye West, have  chosen the name North, North, for their baby girl.  Think about that for a  second.  The baby's name is Northwest, no middle name.  I mean, they're  running this child's life or they giving it direction.</p><p/><p>  PRABHAKAR:  All right.  We can safely assume that it's not a fan of  One Direction, right, the band?</p><p/><p>  (LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>  FRANCIS:  OK.  All right.  I like that.  That was good.  Jarrod, what  do you think about this?</p><p/><p>  RANDOLPH:  The middle name should be Southeast.  So, it's north,  south, east, west.  I mean, I actually can't believe we're talking about  this right now.</p><p/><p>  (LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>  RANDOLPH:  But think about it, there were other names that could have  come up with.  Lampshade, soda can.  I mean, they could have named it  anything.</p><p/><p>  FRANCIS:  Seven, Pepsi.  I don't know.  All those -- </p><p/><p>  (LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>  FRANCIS:  One of the worst names ever.</p><p/><p>  PRABHAKAR:  I like the east and west.  Wasn't east and west -- </p><p/><p>  (CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>  FRANCIS:  And we wrap up the week.  Our own Tom Sullivan has some  doubts about the direction of our economy.  Take a listen.</p><p/><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>  TOM SULLIVAN, FOX BUSINESS:  Something isn't right about the economy.   I'm trying to be positive, and yes, the economy has expanded every quarter  going back to 2009.  But it's consistently weak growth.  The job market,  it's also improving, but not enough to soak up all of the new people that  are coming into the job market, the young grads and immigrants.  And  housing, it seems to be doing better.  In fact, in some places, there's  another price bubble growing.</p><p/><p>  But, it's because there are two few homes for sale and that's largely  because whopping (ph) number, 44 percent of homeowners are either under  water or they don't have enough equity to pay a realtor to sell their home,  so they sit.  And it's the same number, 44 percent of people who told CNN  in a poll this week that they are worse off economically now than compared  to just one year ago.</p><p/><p>  The huge portion of the country is still hurting.  The markets are  nervous about the fed slowing down its artificial pumping of the economy.   I get that, but even though I don't like what the fed is done, I don't see  the fed making any big changes, and I don't see this fragile economy  jumping out of its sick bed anytime soon.</p><p/><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>  FRANCIS:  Well, that's true.  Thanks, Tom.  Be sure to watch \"The Tom  Sullivan Show\" this weekend.  You can catch it at 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m.  on Saturday, and on Sunday at 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m.  Happy Friday,  everyone.

With the fed making a financial mess, how to prepare with  what is coming next.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus, surviving the apocalypse in style.  A California developer is opening  the world's largest doomsday shelter and resort.  Where do I make my  reservation?  The man behind it joins us.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And who lost \"Money\" today?  One of America's top CEO, it is so much money,  it would make John B. Rockefeller cry.  Stay tuned to find out who it is. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Because even when they say t is not, it is always about \"Money.\" </p><p>It is the end of a very tumultuous week on Wall Street and it is time for  some serious crisis management for the fed.  So, you are entering the spin  zone.  Ben Bernanke is getting slam for statements this week about the  possibility of easing off the bond buying program which came just two days  of the fed chairman was basically fired on the Charlie Rose show.  I don't  know if you saw this, a lot of moving pieces but we want you to know what  you have to do right now to protect yourself in the midst of all of it.  </p><p>Joining me now is Barron's senior editor, Jack Hough and Pat Howell, CEO of  Howell financial group.  Welcome back to the show.  </p><p>Jack, let me start with you.  Have the wheels come off the fed here?  I  mean, it has been quite a week for those guys.  </p><p>JACK HOUGH, SENIOR EDITOR, BARRON:  I'm not sure what the dissent is about.   I mean, are we supposed to keep interest rates near zero forever?  I mean,  at this point, you are trading off this much improvement in the economy  versus this much distortion of every kind of asset class investors have a  choice of.  It is time, isn't it?  </p><p>FRANCIS:  It is time.  But that is not really what we're talking about.  I  mean, what we are talking about is sort of the chaos that ensued this week.   For example, I mean, let me play you the sound bite.  President Obama  basically fired Ben Bernanke in Charlie Rose.  And we will get both your  reactions on the other side.  Listen to this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I think Ben Bernanke has  done an outstanding job.  Ben Bernanke is a little bit like Bob Mueller,  the head of the FBI where he has already stayed a lot longer than he wanted  or he was supposed to.  But, I think --  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE, TV HOST:  But if he wanted to be reappointed, you would  reappoint him?  </p><p>OBAMA:  He has been outstanding partner along with the White House.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FRANCIS:  What?  I mean, that is not really a ringing endorsement.  Pat,  that is like somebody saying, you know, how is your husband?  You are like,  well, he has been outstanding partner until now.  </p><p>PATRICIA POWELL, CEO, POWELL FINANCIAL GROUP:  Anybody can be a loose  cannon, it is just odd it is the president of the United States.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Is he a loose cannon or was that on purpose?  I mean, don't know.   There is a lot of negativity there.  </p><p>POWELL:  He is making some telegraphing things too.  He is not going to  Jackson hole, you know, that was a little odd.  I mean, he has been  telegraphing things.  And a lot of people say that he is tired, this has  been exhausting thing, and it was not really -- this is now what he had in  mind when he became chairman of the fed.  </p><p>HOUGH:  He was looking at his shoes when he said that, right?  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Right.  </p><p>HOUGH:  I'm not a body language expert, but that says stayed.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  He stayed a lot longer than he was supposed to or he wanted to.   I mean, that is pretty harsh.  So then, it is not surprising that Ben  Bernanke comes out, rocks the boat a bit.  I mean, they are all over the  place.  You have James Bullard, Ben coming out today saying, well maybe,  you know, we are going t have more combination down the road if we need it.   Basically, going against everything that Ben Bernanke said, which is sort  of all over the map.  Where does that leave investors?  </p><p>HOUGH:  It is unusual to see a special press release like that with a sort  of dissenting view.  And I think it is already a tumultuous time for the  market.  I don't think there's any kind of financial Armageddon.  I mean,  where people are getting crazy about losing a few percent in the stock  market.  Keep in mind the market is double in nearly, you know, in about  four years, and treasury rates are up (INAUDIBLE), were 2.5 percent for the  average over the past 50 years, it is over six percent.  So we don't have  skyrocketing interest rates something like that.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  It says that the whole point is we need these guys.  I mean, they  are doing -- they have done policy that we have never seen before in our  lives.  So, we need them to dismount in the cleanest way possible her and  get out of it.  So far just this week it has been utter chaos.  </p><p>My favorite comment because the twitter universe and online to block its  fear was alive, with all of these different machination during the week.  I  love Lawrence McDonald tweeted, somebody that a lot of us follow, he is on  TV all the time.  He said job opening, portfolio manager need for $3.5  trillion, 70-tons leverage Hedge Fund unlimited borrow, no marked market,  see Federal Reserve.  </p><p>Does not inspire confidence?  I mean, everybody is joking about what is  going on.  It does tell you don't have a lot of confidence of what is going  on.  </p><p>POWELL:  Well, nobody here has confidence because we don't know how this is  going to be around.  But, it is so much better that they are telling us  this stuff.  We don't want to invest blindly.  We don't want to have  another secret.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  They telling us, what though?  They are telling us all different  things.  I mean, Bullard says we could ease more.  Ben Bernanke says we are  getting out, President Obama says he is fired, telling us what?  </p><p>POWELL:  Well, Bernanke started, I think, on the 22nd of May by giving us  the first inkling that there thinking about chasing, and I think in this  particular -- the comments this week really dealt with the fact that we are  creating a plan to taper.  This is a very good thing.  It is so much better  to have a plan than to be shooting from the hips which was not good.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  So, how do we all set ourselves up for this because this is the  take away that we want for our audience here?  It means that interest rates  are going up, maybe, my thought is give anything interest-rate sensitive  whether it is an adjustable mortgage or it is credit card rates you want to  keep an eye on that, maybe it is a great time in real estate to transact  whether you are a buyer or a seller.  I mean, if you are a buyer, this is  probably as good as the rates are going to be.  If you are seller, you may  want to transact because it is the most money that a buyer is going to  have.  What do you think? </p><p>POWELL:  Buyers may start rushing in because they have been sitting back  waiting to see what is going to happen, now they saw a real choice.  If  interest rates go up, every point that goes up they lose purchasing power  or borrowing power.  So, it can push the real estate market, actually, up  in the short run.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  In the short run.  In the long run, I mean, Jack, would you agree  with that?  In the long run, it is bad for the real estate market because  higher interest rates make it tougher.  </p><p>HOUGH:  I'm on sure there is anyone here is on the fence right now, that  waiting for a little less of the mortgage rate before they buy, I mean,  that ship has sailed.  But I think in terms of investors right now, you  hold onto some extra cash because there's a possibility both stocks and  bonds are going to be weak at the same time.  We don't a lynch how an  interesting piece of research what they said.  Right now, inflations is  actually coming down and interest rates are going up, which is a rarity.   It happened in 1994, at that time tech stocks outperformed, utilities got  hurt, they were recommending the same thing right now.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Interesting point of view.  </p><p>All right, thanks to both of you.  Good stuff.  </p><p>HOUGH:  Thank you.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Time now for today's fuel gauge report.  China and Russia signing  $270 billion oil deal.  It is one of the biggest in history.  Rosneft,  Russian's state owned oil company will double supplies to China.  It could  reach up to 900,000 barrels per day.  That is according to Vladimir Putin.   The 25 year deal makes chin China the biggest customer for Russian oil.  </p><p>U.S. gasoline demand for May fell to a 13 year low.  That is according to  the American Petroleum Institute.  Demand slipped by 3.3 percent to about  8.7 million barrels per day.  </p><p>And Oil futures is getting smacked for a second session, a stronger U.S.  dollar largely fueling oil decline.  It posted its biggest two-day drop in  a year losing about 4.5 percent.  Crude settled at $93.69 a barrel.  Big  move on the week.  </p><p>All right, up next, Michael Dell versus Carl Icahn, it is the face-off only  the power of money could create.  We are going to tell you how it is  turning personal now.  </p><p>Plus, the reason the government has gotten so good at spying on you is  because it is coaching top talent from Silicon Valley.  Maybe you didn't  know that.  We got details on the stunning revelation in the NSA scandal.  </p><p>More \"Money\" coming up.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  The battle between two Wall Street titans is getting bigger and  personal, by the way.  Michael Dell now launching a personal pitch to buy  out his ubiquitous company, and pushed Icahn's offer out of the way, but  will it deliver or well Icahn when out?  It is all about the power of  \"Money.\"  </p><p>Here to weigh in is \"Wall Street Journal\" business editor, Dennis Berman  and Jonas Max Ferris at MaxFunds.com. </p><p>Great to have you both on the show.  </p><p>Dennis, let me start with you.  This is battle of the titans.  I mean,  these are two enormous egos out there, so how do you size of the whole  think?  </p><p>DENNIS BERMAN, BUSINESS EDITOR, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  I see Dell winning,  Icahn losing.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Really?  How come?  </p><p>BERMAN:  Simple reason.  The best chance for Dell to beaten was a potential  rival bid from another private equity firm.  Carl Icahn, at this point, he  could do a lot of great noise and smoke and a lot of activity, but when it  comes down to it the shareholder will have to say that he wants to take  this offer or do we not?  And right now, given the market where they are,  they are probably going to take the offer of $14 per share.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  So Jonas, what do you think?  I mean, his basically saying Silver  Lake wins the day because, of course, that too smacky (ph) Michael Dell?  </p><p>JONAS MAX FERRIS, MARKET WATCHER, MAXFUNDS.COM:  Because I think people  would rather side with the guy who started the company in his dorm room  then some Wall Street raider.  I just don't think that that is -- that guy  is going to fix it.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  The guy has started the company in his dorm room, but has kind of  driven it into the ground, right?  </p><p>FERRIS:  Well, by that logic every tech CEO who isn't Apple or Samsung  should be fired because they all missed the smart phone revolution.  Go  down the line, everybody screwed up.  And the whole PC, this has come on  land.  That was original cornerstone of the business was assembling PC box.   That is a dying business and it is easy to say, he missed the smart phone  and pad revolution, yes, it is good.  But everybody didn't because it is  really hard to compete.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  I don't know.  I mean, Dennis, right here you have his whole  plan, Michael Dell's whole plan right here, for how he will turn the  company around.  And we were talking about this is the commercial break is  that if he has this brilliance, why hasn't he done it already, why doesn't  he do it while the company is public?  I mean, just do it, you know.  Why  do you have to take (INAUDIBLE).  </p><p>BERMAN:  I think you make a really good point.  I agree with you.  And, if  you read this and it doesn't take long because he doesn't write very much  here you will be relatively uninspired by what with Michael dell has to  say.  You will be relatively uninspired by what Michael Dell has to say.   It is what I would call problem.  It is generic.  It does not say anything.  </p><p>But, whether he says anything here or not or whether Carl Icahn is the  right person to be a part of dell, really, it doesn't matter is there's  only one thing that matters, to shareholders want to accept the price for  dell right now?  There are no offers being the price of the stock is  trading below the $14 offer.  It the market that telling us that will  probably be accepted.  Although, it may not be easy at the moment.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Jonas, if you are a shareholder -- but, are you, by the way?  </p><p>FERRIS:  We all own it through mutual funds indirectly.  Directly, don't  bow and very few people only this directly.  It is not growth stock getting  more and the public only owns like Apple directly users all along by --.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  So, would say, give me the $14 let me the hell out of the stock?   So, I can just forget about Dell and go off.  </p><p>FERRIS:  Because I think Icahn is playing an a head start for proxy movie,  who with all the movie with the executives try to pretend the company was  worthless so they can buy the stock at a cheap price and then by putting  the bad CEO in.  That was the movie.  I think that is what the spin is  here, the Dell rule is down talking the stock so he could take it private.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  So you think it has more value than Roe (ph).  </p><p>FERRIS:  I do think so.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Really?  Why, what is so valuable?  </p><p>FERRIS:  Well, it is a long shot, but without the PC business, I think  there is still an angle to be some sort of IBM asks more, you know, selling  silver type in software company.  It is not a huge growth opportunity, but  I think there is something there that is more valuable than the current  share price.  That is a better price for a lot of non-Apple, Samsung  companies today.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  What do you think, Dennis?  Is that possible?  </p><p>BERMAN:  It is certainly possible.  And this is that the fundamental  complex.  The real tension inside this management by IPOs, what does the  guy at the top of the ladder know that I don't know that he shares with us?   And should I trust him, or should I not?  </p><p>Here is another great example.  J. Crew, great company.  We all know that  company.  It went private after the CEO basically forced and offer down his  owned shareholder's growth.  So, Jonas makes a fair point about the  conflicts inherent in that those dynamics.  But again, as it stands now,  roughly 15 percent or so of shares are a lied against BBO (ph).  </p><p>FRANCIS:  But wait, but other than him knowing something we all don't, what  would be his other reason for wanting to take it private?  </p><p>FERRIS:  I would say vanity.  It is his business.  He has got his name on  it.  It is hard to walk away.  You don't want it to die.  It is called  Dell.  It is not Microsoft, you know.  It holds on Bill Gates' software.   So, it is like there's a certain element where you want it to succeed.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  So, it is either vanity or he knows something we don't?  Real  quick before we go, what is your bet, vanity or he knows something we  don't?  </p><p>FERRIS:  I think it is still worth more than it is.  I do think all these  tycoons, these are old, are going to go private at some point because --.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  So, he knows something we don't.  That's how I'm going to  interpret that.  </p><p>Dennis, what do you think, vanity or he know something we don't?  </p><p>BERMAN:  I say the answer is both.  But, in the end --  </p><p>FRANCIS:  How can it be both?  Pick one.  </p><p>BERMAN:  Well, he is both vain and he knows something that we don't.  Those  can both motivations.  In the end, the shareholders are going to bite  because --.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  OK.  Guys, you are fantastic, thank you.  </p><p>BERMAN:  Thank you.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Coming up on \"Money,\" if you knew facebook former chief security  officer but feel like he has dropped off the radar, here is why.  He is now  working for the NSA and he is not alone.  We will tell you how Silicon  Valley is getting help to the government's prying eyes.  </p><p>Plus, former Enron CEO, Jeff Skilling, hits 10 years, why he stop his  prison sentence?  And it could be a dream come true for white-collar  criminals.  </p><p>Stay right where you are and find out why.  </p><p>Do you ever have too much \"Money\"?  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  Weather it is on Wall Street or Main Street, here is to make  \"Money\" today.  </p><p>Actually, I can start with who made money.  Larry Ellison, the CEO of  Oracle, lost so much money I have to do that one first.  Oracle's latest  earnings were a big disappointment on Wall Street.  And as a result, the  shares plunged more than nine percent today.  So Larry Ellison owns 1.1  billion shares of Oracle.  That means he lost $3.4 billion today, $3.4  billion.  I had to put that in perspective.  Ellison bought the whole  island of Lanai last year for $300 million.  So, he lost the equivalent of  11 Hawaiian Islands today.  </p><p>Meanwhile, trying to make \"Money\" today, Starbucks, it is raising drink  cause for first time in almost two years.  The average price hike will be  about one percent.  Starbucks blames rising rent and labor cost for the  increase.  </p><p>And the Miami heat championship win proving a ratings gold mine for ABC.   Nearly 18 percent of you at home watched game seven last night.  That is  according to Nielsen.  It is the second highest rating for an NBA game in  11 years, a sign of the times and congratulations.  </p><p>So, if you have been following the NSA spy scandal you may wonder how tight  the government really is with big tech companies like facebook, for  example.  Well, a shocking report reveal that actually left to go work for  the NSA back in 2010 and evidently, he is not the only big tech exec that's  made the move from Silicon Valley to government spy agency.  </p><p>That brings up a lot of questions and concerns, namely what kinds of info  are these ex-tech employees bringing to their new job.  With me on this  frightening development is managing director of TechnoBuffalo, Roy Choi.  </p><p>Welcome back to the show, Roy.  </p><p>ROY CHOI, MANAGING DIRECTOR, TECHNOBUFFALO:  Thank you.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  I mean, should we be afraid of this?  I mean, this is a guy who  was in charge of protecting our own private personal information on  facebook and he eventually took the knowledge and the keys of the kingdom  and went to go work for an agency that is now spying on us.  </p><p>CHOI:  I think we have to assume that, you know, employees as tech  companies like facebook, Google, Skype, they have this information and  they're going to go somewhere and may be to the NSA and feed that.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  So, you are basically saying, we have to assume that everything  we put online could eventually be handed over to people who are spying on  us?  And you just have to be satisfied with that?  </p><p>CHOI:  Yes.  They have policies in place, but when you turn into reality  you will see that information isn't always word is supposed to be.  We will  claim it is 100 percent locks down, but how many times have we seen leaks  weathered his credit card information or online information leaks either  accidentally or a hole in the security software or malicious hackers going  in and getting this information.  </p><p>So, I can't say that people are always going to be secure.  And you know, I  think people are under the assumption when I post something online, it is  going to be there for public consumption.  But you know, it is beyond that,  it is the metadata, it is the stuff you don't necessarily see.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  What will be his motivation for leaving a place like facebook?   You have to imagine that at the level he was, he was making a lot of money  and owned a lot of stock and did really well.  Why would you leave and go  and work for the government?  </p><p>CHOI:  Who knows?  Maybe it is a greater challenge.  Maybe, you know,  facebook has been a huge supporter of helping fight crime a couple of years  ago.  And I am not saying this particular security official, but the most  recent security official actually implemented a program where they could  actually search through content, so there was anything that is a sexual  predator was out there and putting in language that would be a little worry  some for law enforcement, they would openly give that information out.  And  you know, they have actually stated their policy is as long as there is a  court order or any type of subpoena they would hand that information freely  in order to protect users.  And at that point, they were under a lot of  pressure to help especially with lots of sexual predators lurking on  facebook.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  That's one thing.  But you know, when I have asked that question  in the past of hackers and the like, why would you go from the private  sector where you are making a lot of money to work for the NSA or any  government agency for a lot less.  They say that they are allowed to do  things when you're working for the NSA that you're not allowed to do in  regular life, and you are allowed to spy in a way that you can't do for a  private company.  So you combine sort of that ability and ambition with  someone who knows the intimate ins and outs of a facebook or a Google and  you get a very powerful government who could spy on us even more than we  ever imagined.  Your thoughts on that?  </p><p>CHOI:  Definitely.  And I think, when we look at, in terms of national  security, in terms of our own security, privately, you are going to see the  internet as like the next forum, whether that is in a proactive manner or a  reactive manner.  So, for someone to leave from Silicon Valley, the  constraints of, you know, regulations and whatever else, you know, maybe  you go to the NSA, maybe you go to another government agency, but you do  get that level of freedom to go out and use your talents to make your mark.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes.  </p><p>Roy, thank you so much for coming on the show.  Appreciate your time.  </p><p>CHOI:  Thank you.  Appreciate it.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Up next on \"Money,\" we are going to Jeffrey Skilling.  He  committed one of the worst acts of corporate fraud in U.S. history.  Well,  the former Enron CEO is now getting out of prison 10 years ahead of  schedule.  We are going to explain why this is music to the ears of white- collar criminals everywhere.  </p><p>Plus, a bipartisan group of senators wants to block U.S. military funding  for Syrian rebels.  You may like the sound of that, but will we have to  spend even more if we don't act now?  One of the many top experts breaks  down the numbers for us.  </p><p>Piles of \"money\" coming up.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MELISSA FRANCIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  New developments today in  the case of convicted white-collar felon, Jeffrey Skilling.  The former  Enron CEO has served six and half years of a 24-year sentence, so far, for  bringing down the world's largest energy trader.  It was one of the worst  acts of corporate fraud in U.S. history.</p><p>But today, his sentence was sliced by 10 years.  Meaning, now, he's  going to be out in just seven and a half years instead of 17 1/2 years from  now.  So, what does his short and sentence mean for white-collar criminals?   Here with the dish is our go to lawyer, Arthur Aidala.</p><p>ARTHUR AIDALA, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST:  Dish?</p><p>FRANCIS:  Dish.  Yes.</p><p>AIDALA:  Is that a legal term?</p><p>FRANCIS:  It is.  You didn't know that, because you're a lawyer.  You  should know.</p><p>AIDALA:  -- any Italian food, so I don't know what the dishes (ph) are  about.</p><p>FRANCIS:  What is the deal?</p><p>AIDALA:  The deal here is this.  He appeals -- he gets convicted, gets  this huge sentence -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  I mean, he didn't kill anyone.</p><p>AIDALA:  He didn't kill anyone, but let me double check my map here.   $60 billion in Enron stock was rendered worthless.  $2 billion in employee  pension were rented worthless.  It's a lot of guilt (ph).</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes.</p><p>AIDALA:  That's a lot of money going on there.  So -- and more  importantly that a lot of money, it's a lot of people who got affected.  I  mean, lives were ruined, lives were destroyed.  So, he gets this really  rough sentence.  He -- (INAUDIBLE) who supposed to go get sentenced and get  wiped out, he dies, so that wipes out his conviction.  And, he appeals all  the way up to the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court basing the rules in  his favor saying one of the ways -- one of the convictions against him was  improper.</p><p>They go to a lower court about it.  Should there be a new trial?   Should there be a new trial?  The bottom line is, they say that he was  sentenced to nine years too many, and for them not to re-appeal, because he  could have, the government said look -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  Nine years too many in which -- in what then?  Why?</p><p>AIDALA:  Because the guideline calculations, which is the very  complicated way.</p><p>FRANCIS:  They did the bath rock (ph).</p><p>AIDALA:  Well, they applied things the wrong way.  In federal court  unlike state court, to figure someone's sentence, you need like a small  calculus degree.  It's crazy.  And basically, in court, the judges said,  you did this the wrong way, you came about this the wrong way, therefore,  there's at least nine years that he's got tacked on that shouldn't be  tacked on.</p><p>FRANCIS:  So, are white-collar criminals everywhere rejoining because  the scuttlebutt on this all week long has been that the sentences for  financial crimes up late.  I mean, if you look at (INAUDIBLE).  I mean, all  of this has been very stiff.</p><p>AIDALA:  Well, what -- right.</p><p>FRANCIS:  And is this the beginning of a reduction in the sentences  for financial crisis, which as you said, ruined a lot of lives -- </p><p>AIDALA:  A lot of lives.</p><p>FRANCIS:  -- but in many cases are longer than murder convictions.</p><p>AIDALA:  Correct.  But literally, like a murder conviction, you're  really affecting like one person and one family.  This affected -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  Right.  But they're dead as opposed to I don't have money.   I mean, we should rather be alive -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>AIDALA:  But there are these charts in the federal law that when you  commit a crime, you start off at a very -- a below base level which is like  a non-jail sentence.  And then depending on how much money was stolen or  how much fraud or how much tax evasion, that's what you come up with the  numbers.  So, if it's just a minimal amount like 100 million, you're at one  level.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Very little.  Yes.</p><p>AIDALA:  When it's 60 billion, you're at the highest level.  You're  literally off the charts.  The United State Supreme Court did say that the  way they convicted him under this honest services fraud law, which is a  very complicated thing to explain, was not done properly.  So, yes, a door  has been opened to criminal defendants to tell the government, you need to  prosecute us in this way, not in that way.  And it may have lightened the  load on them.  But, you know -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  Sounds like you don't think the original 24 was that unfair  (ph), though.</p><p>AIDALA:  I mean, they did some bad stuff.  They hurt a lot of people.   They hurt a lot of retired people who are like -- I mean, you go from  thinking like, going to bed, thinking I have a half a million dollars in  the bank and I'm 80 years old to I have nothing in the bank and I'm 80  years old.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes.</p><p>AIDALA:  Hello!</p><p>FRANCIS:  Arthur, thank you so much.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  You did a great job.  There's smoke coming out of your ears.</p><p>AIDALA:  I learn about the dish.  I dished it.  I knew about the dish.   Thank you, folks.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Turning now to a much more serious topic, the unsettling  situation in Syria.  All eyes are on the country's reports (ph) on chemical  weapons use and see frightening images of escalating violence.  Now, some  Lawmakers here at home are trying to block any U.S. funding to armed  rebels.</p><p>Of course, we know the story is about a lot more than money.  There's  an enormous human toll, but our show is called MONEY, so we're going to  focus on that angle.  We're going to take a closer look at whether or not  it would actually cost us more to get involved now or not.</p><p>Joining us now with his take is Zuhdi Jasser, president of the  American Islamic Forum for Democracy.  Always nice to have you, Zuhdi.</p><p>ZUHDI JASSER, AMERICAN ISLAMIC FORUM FOR DEMOCRACY:  Thanks, Melissa.   It's great to be with you.</p><p>FRANCIS:  You know, we're trying to break down the cost.  As we said,  huge human toll, you know, for humanitarian reasons you may or may not want  to get involved, but looking at just the dollar part of it, what is the  cost of doing nothing at this point?</p><p>JASSER:  Well, we have two and half years, Melissa, of the revolution  to know what that cost is.  And just some numbers from Tel Aviv University,  it looks like in Jordan, it costs $35 per refugee just to house them per  year.  So, you're looking right now at three to four million refugees that  have been displaced in Syria.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Who's paying for that?</p><p>JASSER:  That's the thing.  Jordan is paying for some of it, but we're  paying a lot of it.  We've already paid over half a billion dollars through  USAID into the region, and it's looking like the refugees are going to  reach six million by the end of the year, and our money is into it.</p><p>It's going to be in the billions whether we do, you know, nothing  militarily or not, it's going to be -- it's a part of the region that if  we're going to continue to try to maintain stability, the humanitarian aid  is not only the compassionate thing to do, it has to be done militarily  strategically or otherwise the entire region will implode with sectarian  violence and our ally in the region.  Israel will certainly be threatened.</p><p>FRANCIS:  If we do something, that is incredibly expensive, already  looking at the estimates.  A no-fly zone in the first 10 days alone would  cost $1.4 billion.  And it expands from there, right?</p><p>JASSER:  Oh, absolutely.  And you know, the no-fly zone -- yes, Libya  was a bit cheaper, but they're looking -- this is more like Iraq.  Syria  has a more sophisticated military that would need to be taken out, and  somewhere of 50 to 100 million a day, they say.  But still, I think the  cost and a lot of experts have said this the cost are going to be less, as  Michael O'Hanlon (ph) from Brookings said, it's a bargain if we can end  this war earlier.</p><p>Because look, two and half years have proven this war is going  nowhere.  Assad maybe winning as far as militarily, but the attrition from  the Syrian army continues.  It's only how long, how many months or years  when Assad will finally fall.  And if we want to have a play in the region  and be involved in the right side of history and help move them towards, we  defeat Assad first as the strategy and second defeat al Qaeda.</p><p>If we want to play a role in that, we have to be on the right side of  history to fight against the Iran, fight against Hezbollah, et cetera.  Not  with troops.</p><p>FRANCIS:  -- on the right side of history and some are arguing that  it's too late for that.  That early on, we could have been fighting against  Hezbollah and Assad.  And when we originally saw pictures of children being  slaughtered, that was the time to get involved, but we didn't.  And now, at  this point, al Qaeda and extremists have gotten involved.</p><p>On the other side, and it's become now al Qaeda versus Hezbollah,  which isn't our fight, neither of those folks are our friends, and we  should just stay out of it.  That is one of the theories that's out there.   I'll give you the last word on why you don't agree with that, if you don't.</p><p>JASSER:  Well, that calculus of characterizing the opposition of al  Qaeda is just not correct.  The Syrian population has become more  radicalized and they're becoming more, you know, chaotic and committing  atrocities, but that's because we've done nothing.  If we come to the side  of helping the millions -- there's only tens of thousands of al Qaeda --  the millions of Syrians in this opposition, we will help defeat the  ultimate source of the radicalization which is Assad.</p><p>And remember, Hezbollah, the forms of terror in the Middle East is  Iran.  So, those on my (ph) conservative side that believe that doing  nothing will allow al Qaeda to die, actually, al Qaeda is thriving,  Hezbollah is thriving.  Terror will thrive without our involvement.  So,  the question is, which side has less terror?  I believe doing something  would.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Zuhdi Jasser, thank you so much for your thoughts tonight.   We always appreciate it.</p><p>JASSER:  Thank you.  Appreciate it.</p><p>FRANCIS:  We have some breaking news right now on Facebook.  Let's go  to Fox Business' Jo Ling Kent with the latest.  Jo Ling, what do you have? </p><p>JO LING KENT, FOX BUSINESS:  Melissa, Facebook is confirming on their  website that a security breach has exposed six million e-mail addresses and  telephone numbers.  And let me tell you a little bit more of what they're  saying on the website.</p><p>They found, they said, through their white hat security researching  program that they use that, quote, \"that may have allowed some of a  person's contact information e-mail or phone number to be accessed by  people who either had some contact information about the person or some  connection to that person.\"</p><p>So, they're saying six million e-mail addresses and telephone numbers  were shared, but Facebook was also very quick to note in its statement that  no other types of personal or financial information were included and only  people on Facebook, not developers or advertisers, had access to this  information.</p><p>So, certainly, a very alarming security breach has happened at  Facebook, and we'll continue to bring you more a little bit later, Melissa.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Wow.  Jo Ling, thanks so much.</p><p>All right.  Coming up on MONEY, surviving the end of the world sounds  tough.  Indoor pool, a bowling alley, a golf, maybe it wouldn't be that  bad.  A California developer is opening the world's largest doomsday  shelter.  This will be an underground resort.  It's fabulous.  He's taking  reservations.  He joins us with all the details, because at the end of the  day, the end of the world, it's all about MONEY.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  Talk about surviving in style.  Vivos Survival Shelter and  Resort is the chicest doomsday shelter out there.  For a few thousand  bucks, you and yours (ph) can be safe from any number of impending  disasters.  Cozily nestled 100 feet below in Atchison Kansas, and you can  live in your shelter in your very own RV -- wow! -- for up to a year.   There is big money to be made in the bunker business.</p><p>Joining me now is Robert Vicino.  He is founder and CEO of Vivos Group  and the owner of the fabulous shelter.  Thank you so much for coming on.</p><p>ROBERT VICINO, VIVOS GROUP FOUNDER AND CEO:  It's my honor.</p><p>FRANCIS:  I understand that this is a space that the army previously  used.  They auctioned it off.  And what gave you the idea to make it into a  doomsday shelter? </p><p>VICINO:  Well, we've been in the shelter business for the last five  years building Vivos shelters around the world.  And, typically, whenever a  government shelter or facility comes up, we try to buy it and then  retrofitted and convert it into a modern day blast shelter.  This one was  auctioned by the GSA and we jumped on it.</p><p>FRANCIS:  What is it like?  What happens when I arrived there?</p><p>VICINO:  It is a turnkey four-star underground hotel/cruise ship.   It's everything you could imagine.  It's not just a survival shelter.  It  is truly a destination resort where you and your family and your children  would want to go to many times a year, perhaps, in the middle of the winter  where it' s 70 degrees inside this mountain year round.  So, you will be  very comfortable.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Do people come even if there's not a disaster by space (ph).   Can I come and hang out?</p><p>VICINO:  Anytime you want.  You can't permanently live there, but yes,  it's open 24/7 forever.  And so, you buy your space and you park your RV  there, whatever you're comfortable with, be it a 20-footer or 45-foot motor  home for a million dollar.  And it's a one-time charge, and you know, it's  yours, you're a co-owner of this what would be a billion dollar  replacement.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Does it cost me a million dollars?  I mean, I read that it's  $1,000 per lineal foot.  The average RV is about 30 feet, so that's  $30,000, and there's $1,500 charge per person, but I don't know what --  over what period of time.  How much would it cost me?  I have a husband and  two kids, what are you going to charge me?</p><p>VICINO:  Well, you're the perfect nuclear family.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes.  Thank you.</p><p>VICINO:  And, it would cost no extra charge for any of those family  members, the only thing you're paying for is the RV, itself, by the lineal  foot.  So, if you had a 30-foot RV, it's $30,000 and four children or four  people for food, that's a one year food supply.  It's another 6,000.  So,  for $36,000, you've got yourself an investment and a life assurance policy  or -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  How many people have signed up, so far?  How much money have  you made?</p><p>VICINO:  Well, not enough.  We've had 25,000 applications over the  last few years.  The primary problem has been the cost.  People can't  afford our other shelters where it's a per person rate as much as $50,000.   So, this -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  So, of those 25,000, how many people have locked it in?</p><p>VICINO:  On this new one, we just announced it last week in or  membership, and we've got a few hundred already signed up.  So, it's going  to happen very quickly.  We'll sell out.  This one will accommodate only  1,500 RVs or about 5,000 people, which I like to say is almost one in a  million people on Earth.</p><p>FRANCIS:  This one makes me nervous about this.  So, you're all the  way in Kansas.  I'm in New York, for example.  What kind of doomsday  disaster would come my way that I would have enough time to get there?</p><p>VICINO:  Oh, let's say a nuke went off in L.A. or in Washington or in  the Middle East, or let's say where about to see a major economic meltdown,  which could happen any day, as you know, or let's say the earth was  rumbling or an asteroid was on its way.  Things -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  I would have enough time to get there?</p><p>VICINO:  It's time to go.  And you may go and it may not happen, and  so, it's a false alarm just like the fireman goes to the -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes.</p><p>VICINO:  -- but at least you have somewhere to go versus the other  seven billion people on the planet that will have no solution, nowhere to  go, and they'll be scrambling.  And you don't want to be a part of that  mash (ph).  You want to go.  You want to have a safe haven.  You'll be  underground in what we call effectively a fortress.</p><p>FRANCIS:  OK.  Robert, thanks for coming on the show.  Interesting  idea.  Sounds like -- I'll be interested to see if it's a good business, if  you sell out, because -- I mean, there's a lot to be afraid of these days.   I don't know.  People want an insurance policy.  Thanks for coming on.   Keep us posted.</p><p>VICINO:  My pleasure.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Here is our MONEY question of the day.  How much would you  pay for a spot on world's biggest doomsday shelter?  Not surprisingly, I  got a lot of funny responses to this one, including Less Than Zero.  \"I'd  rather die than live in Kansas.\"  Come on!  Come on.  Kansas is a nice  place.  That was mean.</p><p>We want to hear from more of you.  You can like us on Facebook at  acebook.com/MelissaFrancisFox or follow me on Twitter @MelissaAFrancis.</p><p>All right.  Coming up on MONEY.  Oh, bless you, Kanye and Kim.  You  gave your baby a name even crazier than we thought possible.  And there's  developing news on what the middle name is, too.  We've got it all in  \"Spare Change.\"  You can never have too many insane celebrities.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  All right.  Welcome to \"Spare Change.\"  We are joined by  Jarrod Guy Randolph and we also have Hitha Prabhakar here.  Thanks to both  of you for coming on.  A little \"Spare Change\" fun on this Friday.</p><p>HITHA PRABHAKAR, RETAIL ANALYST:  Thanks for having us.</p><p>FRANCIS:  All right.  First, we are going to look at some birthdays at  work.  If it is not already bad enough that you're in the office for your  birthday, check this out.  This birthday card we saw, you literally just  check the box next to your name.  Can you imagine that, to show your love?   I mean, come on.  You can't even sign your name anymore.</p><p>What would you do if you got this card?  You check the box next to  your names.  You check, you know, best wishes, happy birthday, get hammered  on us.  I don't know.</p><p>PRABHAKAR:  I got to be honest with you, this is actually a nicer card  than I received from most of my family members for my birthday.</p><p>FRANCIS:  What?</p><p>PRABHAKAR:  Yes.</p><p>FRANCIS:  You need a new family.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  What is worse than this card, no card at all or do the cards  say does it have so many else's name in it?  I mean, what is worse than  this card?</p><p>PRABHAKAR:  Misspelled name.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Hitha is pretty straightforward.  Hitha Prabhakar, I don't  want to have to spell on television, but Hitha, I could do.</p><p>PRABHAKAR:  No one really sign their names either.  It was just kind  of -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  Really?</p><p>PRABHAKAR:  Yes.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Wow.</p><p>PRABHAKAR:  Yes.  So -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  You're going to be in therapy for that for a long time.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRANCIS:  Jarrod, what about you?</p><p>JARROD GUY RANDOLPH, CORE VICE PRESIDENT:  I don't think there was  follow-through on that card.  It was supposed to lead in the something  else, but I mean -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  Like what?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RANDOLPH:  If birthday cards look like that, I can only imagine what  the annual holiday bonus looks like.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes.</p><p>RANDOLPH:  So, for me, I'd be a little upset if my co-workers gave  that to me.</p><p>FRANCIS:  OK.  So, this is a new case for your iPhone.  It doubles as  a stun gun to prevent any accidental discharge.  Yes, I would hope.  Users  have to flip two switches before activating the gun.  The case sells for  140 bucks.  And the co-founder says sales could exceed a million dollars  this year.</p><p>Is this just a must have or is it a lawsuit waiting to happen?  I'm  wondering, what happens when you accidentally but dial with your iPhone.   That's a stun gun (ph).  That would be quite a shock.</p><p>PRABHAKAR:  Not only is it a lawsuit waiting to happen, it's a  disaster waiting to happen.  I mean, I can't tell you how many times I get  misdialed phones from different people.  I misdial (ph) phone.  Also, if  you're getting attacked, why would you want to on latch (ph) something and  then security check this.  I mean, wouldn't you want to just kind of go for  it and try to protect yourself?</p><p>RANDOLPH:  I see the value on this product.</p><p>FRANCIS:  You do?</p><p>RANDOLPH:  This will be even (ph) my secret weapon.  You will buy a  $50 million apartment.  I'm going to start using this with my client.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>RANDOLPH:  I mean, I don't see why not.  If this actually became an  approved Apple accessory.  So -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  What?  Really?</p><p>RANDOLPH:  It's kind of amazing.</p><p>FRANCIS:  There should be a breathalyzer attached to it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RANDOLPH:  They're going to come up with that.</p><p>PRABHAKAR:  Right.</p><p>RANDOLPH:  And if you go on the website, the pink ones are the ones  that have sold out first.  I'm just waiting for the camouflage.</p><p>FRANCIS:  How much is the cost?  Does anybody know?</p><p>RANDOLPH:  I think it's about $140.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Wow!  That's amazing.  Well, there's a Christmas gift.</p><p>All right.  So, the big baby news of the week, a bizarre name given.   Reality princess, Kim Kardashian and rapper baby daddy, Kanye West, have  chosen the name North, North, for their baby girl.  Think about that for a  second.  The baby's name is Northwest, no middle name.  I mean, they're  running this child's life or they giving it direction.</p><p>PRABHAKAR:  All right.  We can safely assume that it's not a fan of  One Direction, right, the band?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRANCIS:  OK.  All right.  I like that.  That was good.  Jarrod, what  do you think about this?</p><p>RANDOLPH:  The middle name should be Southeast.  So, it's north,  south, east, west.  I mean, I actually can't believe we're talking about  this right now.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>RANDOLPH:  But think about it, there were other names that could have  come up with.  Lampshade, soda can.  I mean, they could have named it  anything.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Seven, Pepsi.  I don't know.  All those -- </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRANCIS:  One of the worst names ever.</p><p>PRABHAKAR:  I like the east and west.  Wasn't east and west -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  And we wrap up the week.  Our own Tom Sullivan has some  doubts about the direction of our economy.  Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TOM SULLIVAN, FOX BUSINESS:  Something isn't right about the economy.   I'm trying to be positive, and yes, the economy has expanded every quarter  going back to 2009.  But it's consistently weak growth.  The job market,  it's also improving, but not enough to soak up all of the new people that  are coming into the job market, the young grads and immigrants.  And  housing, it seems to be doing better.  In fact, in some places, there's  another price bubble growing.</p><p>But, it's because there are two few homes for sale and that's largely  because whopping (ph) number, 44 percent of homeowners are either under  water or they don't have enough equity to pay a realtor to sell their home,  so they sit.  And it's the same number, 44 percent of people who told CNN  in a poll this week that they are worse off economically now than compared  to just one year ago.</p><p>The huge portion of the country is still hurting.  The markets are  nervous about the fed slowing down its artificial pumping of the economy.   I get that, but even though I don't like what the fed is done, I don't see  the fed making any big changes, and I don't see this fragile economy  jumping out of its sick bed anytime soon.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FRANCIS:  Well, that's true.  Thanks, Tom.  Be sure to watch \"The Tom  Sullivan Show\" this weekend.  You can catch it at 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m.  on Saturday, and on Sunday at 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m.  Happy Friday,  everyone.

With the fed making a financial mess, how to prepare with what is coming next.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus, surviving the apocalypse in style. A California developer is opening the world's largest doomsday shelter and resort. Where do I make my reservation? The man behind it joins us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And who lost \"Money\" today? One of America's top CEO, it is so much money, it would make John B. Rockefeller cry. Stay tuned to find out who it is.</p><p/><p>Because even when they say t is not, it is always about \"Money.\"</p><p/><p>It is the end of a very tumultuous week on Wall Street and it is time for some serious crisis management for the fed. So, you are entering the spin zone. <person><nameText>Ben Bernanke </nameText></person>is getting slam for statements this week about the possibility of easing off the bond buying program which came just two days of the fed chairman was basically fired on <person><nameText>the Charlie Rose show. </nameText></person>I don't know if you saw this, a lot of moving pieces but we want you to know what you have to do right now to protect yourself in the midst of all of it.</p><p/><p>Joining me now is Barron's senior editor, Jack Hough and Pat Howell, CEO of Howell financial group. Welcome back to the show.</p><p/><p>Jack, let me start with you. Have the wheels come off the fed here? I mean, it has been quite a week for those guys.</p><p/><p>JACK HOUGH, SENIOR EDITOR, BARRON: I'm not sure what the dissent is about. I mean, are we supposed to keep interest rates near zero forever? I mean, at this point, you are trading off this much improvement in the economy versus this much distortion of every kind of asset class investors have a choice of. It is time, isn't it?</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: It is time. But that is not really what we're talking about. I mean, what we are talking about is sort of the chaos that ensued this week. For example, I mean, let me play you the sound bite. President Obama basically fired <person><nameText>Ben Bernanke </nameText></person>in <person><nameText>Charlie Rose. </nameText></person>And we will get both your reactions on the other side. Listen to this.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think <person><nameText>Ben Bernanke </nameText></person>has done an outstanding job. <person><nameText>Ben Bernanke </nameText></person>is a little bit like Bob Mueller, the head of the FBI where he has already stayed a lot longer than he wanted or he was supposed to. But, I think --</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE, </nameText></person>TV HOST: But if he wanted to be reappointed, you would reappoint him?</p><p/><p>OBAMA: He has been outstanding partner along with the White House.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: What? I mean, that is not really a ringing endorsement. Pat, that is like somebody saying, you know, how is your husband? You are like, well, he has been outstanding partner until now.</p><p/><p>PATRICIA POWELL, CEO, POWELL FINANCIAL GROUP: Anybody can be a loose cannon, it is just odd it is the president of the United States.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Is he a loose cannon or was that on purpose? I mean, don't know. There is a lot of negativity there.</p><p/><p>POWELL: He is making some telegraphing things too. He is not going to Jackson hole, you know, that was a little odd. I mean, he has been telegraphing things. And a lot of people say that he is tired, this has been exhausting thing, and it was not really -- this is now what he had in mind when he became chairman of the fed.</p><p/><p>HOUGH: He was looking at his shoes when he said that, right?</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p/><p>HOUGH: I'm not a body language expert, but that says stayed.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: He stayed a lot longer than he was supposed to or he wanted to. I mean, that is pretty harsh. So then, it is not surprising that <person><nameText>Ben Bernanke </nameText></person>comes out, rocks the boat a bit. I mean, they are all over the place. You have James Bullard, Ben coming out today saying, well maybe, you know, we are going t have more combination down the road if we need it. Basically, going against everything that <person><nameText>Ben Bernanke </nameText></person>said, which is sort of all over the map. Where does that leave investors?</p><p/><p>HOUGH: It is unusual to see a special press release like that with a sort of dissenting view. And I think it is already a tumultuous time for the market. I don't think there's any kind of financial Armageddon. I mean, where people are getting crazy about losing a few percent in the stock market. Keep in mind the market is double in nearly, you know, in about four years, and treasury rates are up (INAUDIBLE), were 2.5 percent for the average over the past 50 years, it is over six percent. So we don't have skyrocketing interest rates something like that.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: It says that the whole point is we need these guys. I mean, they are doing -- they have done policy that we have never seen before in our lives. So, we need them to dismount in the cleanest way possible her and get out of it. So far just this week it has been utter chaos.</p><p/><p>My favorite comment because the twitter universe and online to block its fear was alive, with all of these different machination during the week. I love Lawrence McDonald tweeted, somebody that a lot of us follow, he is on TV all the time. He said job opening, portfolio manager need for $3.5 trillion, 70-tons leverage Hedge Fund unlimited borrow, no marked market, see Federal Reserve.</p><p/><p>Does not inspire confidence? I mean, everybody is joking about what is going on. It does tell you don't have a lot of confidence of what is going on.</p><p/><p>POWELL: Well, nobody here has confidence because we don't know how this is going to be around. But, it is so much better that they are telling us this stuff. We don't want to invest blindly. We don't want to have another secret.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: They telling us, what though? They are telling us all different things. I mean, Bullard says we could ease more. <person><nameText>Ben Bernanke </nameText></person>says we are getting out, President Obama says he is fired, telling us what?</p><p/><p>POWELL: Well, <person><nameText>Bernanke </nameText></person>started, I think, on the 22nd of May by giving us the first inkling that there thinking about chasing, and I think in this particular -- the comments this week really dealt with the fact that we are creating a plan to taper. This is a very good thing. It is so much better to have a plan than to be shooting from the hips which was not good.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: So, how do we all set ourselves up for this because this is the take away that we want for our audience here? It means that interest rates are going up, maybe, my thought is give anything interest-rate sensitive whether it is an adjustable mortgage or it is credit card rates you want to keep an eye on that, maybe it is a great time in real estate to transact whether you are a buyer or a seller. I mean, if you are a buyer, this is probably as good as the rates are going to be. If you are seller, you may want to transact because it is the most money that a buyer is going to have. What do you think?</p><p/><p>POWELL: Buyers may start rushing in because they have been sitting back waiting to see what is going to happen, now they saw a real choice. If interest rates go up, every point that goes up they lose purchasing power or borrowing power. So, it can push the real estate market, actually, up in the short run.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: In the short run. In the long run, I mean, Jack, would you agree with that? In the long run, it is bad for the real estate market because higher interest rates make it tougher.</p><p/><p>HOUGH: I'm on sure there is anyone here is on the fence right now, that waiting for a little less of the mortgage rate before they buy, I mean, that ship has sailed. But I think in terms of investors right now, you hold onto some extra cash because there's a possibility both stocks and bonds are going to be weak at the same time. We don't a lynch how an interesting piece of research what they said. Right now, inflations is actually coming down and interest rates are going up, which is a rarity. It happened in 1994, at that time tech stocks outperformed, utilities got hurt, they were recommending the same thing right now.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Interesting point of view.</p><p/><p>All right, thanks to both of you. Good stuff.</p><p/><p>HOUGH: Thank you.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Time now for today's fuel gauge report. China and Russia signing $270 billion oil deal. It is one of the biggest in history. Rosneft, Russian's state owned oil company will double supplies to China. It could reach up to 900,000 barrels per day. That is according to Vladimir Putin. The 25 year deal makes chin China the biggest customer for Russian oil.</p><p/><p>U.S. gasoline demand for May fell to a 13 year low. That is according to the American Petroleum Institute. Demand slipped by 3.3 percent to about 8.7 million barrels per day.</p><p/><p>And Oil futures is getting smacked for a second session, a stronger U.S. dollar largely fueling oil decline. It posted its biggest two-day drop in a year losing about 4.5 percent. Crude settled at $93.69 a barrel. Big move on the week.</p><p/><p>All right, up next, <person><nameText>Michael Dell </nameText></person>versus Carl Icahn, it is the face-off only the power of money could create. We are going to tell you how it is turning personal now.</p><p/><p>Plus, the reason the government has gotten so good at spying on you is because it is coaching top talent from Silicon Valley. Maybe you didn't know that. We got details on the stunning revelation in the NSA scandal.</p><p/><p>More \"Money\" coming up.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: The battle between two Wall Street titans is getting bigger and personal, by the way. <person><nameText>Michael Dell </nameText></person>now launching a personal pitch to buy out his ubiquitous company, and pushed Icahn's offer out of the way, but will it deliver or well Icahn when out? It is all about the power of \"Money.\"</p><p/><p>Here to weigh in is \"Wall Street Journal\" business editor, Dennis Berman and Jonas Max Ferris at MaxFunds.com.</p><p/><p>Great to have you both on the show.</p><p/><p>Dennis, let me start with you. This is battle of the titans. I mean, these are two enormous egos out there, so how do you size of the whole think?</p><p/><p>DENNIS BERMAN, BUSINESS EDITOR, WALL STREET JOURNAL: I see Dell winning, Icahn losing.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Really? How come?</p><p/><p>BERMAN: Simple reason. The best chance for Dell to beaten was a potential rival bid from another private equity firm. Carl Icahn, at this point, he could do a lot of great noise and smoke and a lot of activity, but when it comes down to it the shareholder will have to say that he wants to take this offer or do we not? And right now, given the market where they are, they are probably going to take the offer of $14 per share.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: So Jonas, what do you think? I mean, his basically saying Silver Lake wins the day because, of course, that too smacky (ph) <person><nameText>Michael Dell?</nameText></person></p><p/><p>JONAS MAX FERRIS, MARKET WATCHER, MAXFUNDS.COM: Because I think people would rather side with the guy who started the company in his dorm room then some Wall Street raider. I just don't think that that is -- that guy is going to fix it.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: The guy has started the company in his dorm room, but has kind of driven it into the ground, right?</p><p/><p>FERRIS: Well, by that logic every tech CEO who isn't Apple or Samsung should be fired because they all missed the smart phone revolution. Go down the line, everybody screwed up. And the whole PC, this has come on land. That was original cornerstone of the business was assembling PC box. That is a dying business and it is easy to say, he missed the smart phone and pad revolution, yes, it is good. But everybody didn't because it is really hard to compete.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: I don't know. I mean, Dennis, right here you have his whole plan, <person><nameText>Michael Dell's </nameText></person>whole plan right here, for how he will turn the company around. And we were talking about this is the commercial break is that if he has this brilliance, why hasn't he done it already, why doesn't he do it while the company is public? I mean, just do it, you know. Why do you have to take (INAUDIBLE).</p><p/><p>BERMAN: I think you make a really good point. I agree with you. And, if you read this and it doesn't take long because he doesn't write very much here you will be relatively uninspired by what with <person><nameText>Michael dell </nameText></person>has to say. You will be relatively uninspired by what <person><nameText>Michael Dell </nameText></person>has to say. It is what I would call problem. It is generic. It does not say anything.</p><p/><p>But, whether he says anything here or not or whether Carl Icahn is the right person to be a part of dell, really, it doesn't matter is there's only one thing that matters, to shareholders want to accept the price for dell right now? There are no offers being the price of the stock is trading below the $14 offer. It the market that telling us that will probably be accepted. Although, it may not be easy at the moment.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Jonas, if you are a shareholder -- but, are you, by the way?</p><p/><p>FERRIS: We all own it through mutual funds indirectly. Directly, don't bow and very few people only this directly. It is not growth stock getting more and the public only owns like Apple directly users all along by --.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: So, would say, give me the $14 let me the hell out of the stock? So, I can just forget about Dell and go off.</p><p/><p>FERRIS: Because I think Icahn is playing an a head start for proxy movie, who with all the movie with the executives try to pretend the company was worthless so they can buy the stock at a cheap price and then by putting the bad CEO in. That was the movie. I think that is what the spin is here, the Dell rule is down talking the stock so he could take it private.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: So you think it has more value than Roe (ph).</p><p/><p>FERRIS: I do think so.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Really? Why, what is so valuable?</p><p/><p>FERRIS: Well, it is a long shot, but without the PC business, I think there is still an angle to be some sort of IBM asks more, you know, selling silver type in software company. It is not a huge growth opportunity, but I think there is something there that is more valuable than the current share price. That is a better price for a lot of non-Apple, Samsung companies today.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: What do you think, Dennis? Is that possible?</p><p/><p>BERMAN: It is certainly possible. And this is that the fundamental complex. The real tension inside this management by IPOs, what does the guy at the top of the ladder know that I don't know that he shares with us? And should I trust him, or should I not?</p><p/><p>Here is another great example. J. Crew, great company. We all know that company. It went private after the CEO basically forced and offer down his owned shareholder's growth. So, Jonas makes a fair point about the conflicts inherent in that those dynamics. But again, as it stands now, roughly 15 percent or so of shares are a lied against BBO (ph).</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: But wait, but other than him knowing something we all don't, what would be his other reason for wanting to take it private?</p><p/><p>FERRIS: I would say vanity. It is his business. He has got his name on it. It is hard to walk away. You don't want it to die. It is called Dell. It is not Microsoft, you know. It holds on Bill Gates' software. So, it is like there's a certain element where you want it to succeed.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: So, it is either vanity or he knows something we don't? Real quick before we go, what is your bet, vanity or he knows something we don't?</p><p/><p>FERRIS: I think it is still worth more than it is. I do think all these tycoons, these are old, are going to go private at some point because --.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: So, he knows something we don't. That's how I'm going to interpret that.</p><p/><p>Dennis, what do you think, vanity or he know something we don't?</p><p/><p>BERMAN: I say the answer is both. But, in the end --</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: How can it be both? Pick one.</p><p/><p>BERMAN: Well, he is both vain and he knows something that we don't. Those can both motivations. In the end, the shareholders are going to bite because --.</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: OK. Guys, you are fantastic, thank you.</p><p/><p>BERMAN: Thank you.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Coming up on \"Money,\" if you knew facebook former chief security officer but feel like he has dropped off the radar, here is why. He is now working for the NSA and he is not alone. We will tell you how Silicon Valley is getting help to the government's prying eyes.</p><p/><p>Plus, former Enron CEO, Jeff Skilling, hits 10 years, why he stop his prison sentence? And it could be a dream come true for white-collar criminals.</p><p/><p>Stay right where you are and find out why.</p><p/><p>Do you ever have too much \"Money\"?</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Weather it is on Wall Street or Main Street, here is to make \"Money\" today.</p><p/><p>Actually, I can start with who made money. Larry Ellison, the CEO of Oracle, lost so much money I have to do that one first. Oracle's latest earnings were a big disappointment on Wall Street. And as a result, the shares plunged more than nine percent today. So Larry Ellison owns 1.1 billion shares of Oracle. That means he lost $3.4 billion today, $3.4 billion. I had to put that in perspective. Ellison bought the whole island of Lanai last year for $300 million. So, he lost the equivalent of 11 Hawaiian Islands today.</p><p/><p>Meanwhile, trying to make \"Money\" today, Starbucks, it is raising drink cause for first time in almost two years. The average price hike will be about one percent. Starbucks blames rising rent and labor cost for the increase.</p><p/><p>And the Miami heat championship win proving a ratings gold mine for ABC. Nearly 18 percent of you at home watched game seven last night. That is according to Nielsen. It is the second highest rating for an NBA game in 11 years, a sign of the times and congratulations.</p><p/><p>So, if you have been following the NSA spy scandal you may wonder how tight the government really is with big tech companies like facebook, for example. Well, a shocking report reveal that actually left to go work for the NSA back in 2010 and evidently, he is not the only big tech exec that's made the move from Silicon Valley to government spy agency.</p><p/><p>That brings up a lot of questions and concerns, namely what kinds of info are these ex-tech employees bringing to their new job. With me on this frightening development is managing director of TechnoBuffalo, Roy Choi.</p><p/><p>Welcome back to the show, Roy.</p><p/><p>ROY CHOI, MANAGING DIRECTOR, TECHNOBUFFALO: Thank you.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: I mean, should we be afraid of this? I mean, this is a guy who was in charge of protecting our own private personal information on facebook and he eventually took the knowledge and the keys of the kingdom and went to go work for an agency that is now spying on us.</p><p/><p>CHOI: I think we have to assume that, you know, employees as tech companies like facebook, Google, Skype, they have this information and they're going to go somewhere and may be to the NSA and feed that.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: So, you are basically saying, we have to assume that everything we put online could eventually be handed over to people who are spying on us? And you just have to be satisfied with that?</p><p/><p>CHOI: Yes. They have policies in place, but when you turn into reality you will see that information isn't always word is supposed to be. We will claim it is 100 percent locks down, but how many times have we seen leaks weathered his credit card information or online information leaks either accidentally or a hole in the security software or malicious hackers going in and getting this information.</p><p/><p>So, I can't say that people are always going to be secure. And you know, I think people are under the assumption when I post something online, it is going to be there for public consumption. But you know, it is beyond that, it is the metadata, it is the stuff you don't necessarily see.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: What will be his motivation for leaving a place like facebook? You have to imagine that at the level he was, he was making a lot of money and owned a lot of stock and did really well. Why would you leave and go and work for the government?</p><p/><p>CHOI: Who knows? Maybe it is a greater challenge. Maybe, you know, facebook has been a huge supporter of helping fight crime a couple of years ago. And I am not saying this particular security official, but the most recent security official actually implemented a program where they could actually search through content, so there was anything that is a sexual predator was out there and putting in language that would be a little worry some for law enforcement, they would openly give that information out. And you know, they have actually stated their policy is as long as there is a court order or any type of subpoena they would hand that information freely in order to protect users. And at that point, they were under a lot of pressure to help especially with lots of sexual predators lurking on facebook.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: That's one thing. But you know, when I have asked that question in the past of hackers and the like, why would you go from the private sector where you are making a lot of money to work for the NSA or any government agency for a lot less. They say that they are allowed to do things when you're working for the NSA that you're not allowed to do in regular life, and you are allowed to spy in a way that you can't do for a private company. So you combine sort of that ability and ambition with someone who knows the intimate ins and outs of a facebook or a Google and you get a very powerful government who could spy on us even more than we ever imagined. Your thoughts on that?</p><p/><p>CHOI: Definitely. And I think, when we look at, in terms of national security, in terms of our own security, privately, you are going to see the internet as like the next forum, whether that is in a proactive manner or a reactive manner. So, for someone to leave from Silicon Valley, the constraints of, you know, regulations and whatever else, you know, maybe you go to the NSA, maybe you go to another government agency, but you do get that level of freedom to go out and use your talents to make your mark.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p/><p>Roy, thank you so much for coming on the show. Appreciate your time.</p><p/><p>CHOI: Thank you. Appreciate it.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Up next on \"Money,\" we are going to Jeffrey Skilling. He committed one of the worst acts of corporate fraud in U.S. history. Well, the former Enron CEO is now getting out of prison 10 years ahead of schedule. We are going to explain why this is music to the ears of white- collar criminals everywhere.</p><p/><p>Plus, a bipartisan group of senators wants to block U.S. military funding for Syrian rebels. You may like the sound of that, but will we have to spend even more if we don't act now? One of the many top experts breaks down the numbers for us.</p><p/><p>Piles of \"money\" coming up.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>MELISSA FRANCIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: New developments today in the case of convicted white-collar felon, Jeffrey Skilling. The former Enron CEO has served six and half years of a 24-year sentence, so far, for bringing down the world's largest energy trader. It was one of the worst acts of corporate fraud in U.S. history.</p><p/><p>But today, his sentence was sliced by 10 years. Meaning, now, he's going to be out in just seven and a half years instead of 17 1/2 years from now. So, what does his short and sentence mean for white-collar criminals? Here with the dish is our go to lawyer, Arthur Aidala.</p><p/><p>ARTHUR AIDALA, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST: Dish?</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Dish. Yes.</p><p/><p>AIDALA: Is that a legal term?</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: It is. You didn't know that, because you're a lawyer. You should know.</p><p/><p>AIDALA: -- any Italian food, so I don't know what the dishes (ph) are about.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: What is the deal?</p><p/><p>AIDALA: The deal here is this. He appeals -- he gets convicted, gets this huge sentence --</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: I mean, he didn't kill anyone.</p><p/><p>AIDALA: He didn't kill anyone, but let me double check my map here. $60 billion in Enron stock was rendered worthless. $2 billion in employee pension were rented worthless. It's a lot of guilt (ph).</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p/><p>AIDALA: That's a lot of money going on there. So -- and more importantly that a lot of money, it's a lot of people who got affected. I mean, lives were ruined, lives were destroyed. So, he gets this really rough sentence. He -- (INAUDIBLE) who supposed to go get sentenced and get wiped out, he dies, so that wipes out his conviction. And, he appeals all the way up to the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court basing the rules in his favor saying one of the ways -- one of the convictions against him was improper.</p><p/><p>They go to a lower court about it. Should there be a new trial? Should there be a new trial? The bottom line is, they say that he was sentenced to nine years too many, and for them not to re-appeal, because he could have, the government said look --</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Nine years too many in which -- in what then? Why?</p><p/><p>AIDALA: Because the guideline calculations, which is the very complicated way.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: They did the bath rock (ph).</p><p/><p>AIDALA: Well, they applied things the wrong way. In federal court unlike state court, to figure someone's sentence, you need like a small calculus degree. It's crazy. And basically, in court, the judges said, you did this the wrong way, you came about this the wrong way, therefore, there's at least nine years that he's got tacked on that shouldn't be tacked on.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: So, are white-collar criminals everywhere rejoining because the scuttlebutt on this all week long has been that the sentences for financial crimes up late. I mean, if you look at (INAUDIBLE). I mean, all of this has been very stiff.</p><p/><p>AIDALA: Well, what -- right.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: And is this the beginning of a reduction in the sentences for financial crisis, which as you said, ruined a lot of lives --</p><p/><p>AIDALA: A lot of lives.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: -- but in many cases are longer than murder convictions.</p><p/><p>AIDALA: Correct. But literally, like a murder conviction, you're really affecting like one person and one family. This affected --</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Right. But they're dead as opposed to I don't have money. I mean, we should rather be alive --</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>AIDALA: But there are these charts in the federal law that when you commit a crime, you start off at a very -- a below base level which is like a non-jail sentence. And then depending on how much money was stolen or how much fraud or how much tax evasion, that's what you come up with the numbers. So, if it's just a minimal amount like 100 million, you're at one level.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Very little. Yes.</p><p/><p>AIDALA: When it's 60 billion, you're at the highest level. You're literally off the charts. The United State Supreme Court did say that the way they convicted him under this honest services fraud law, which is a very complicated thing to explain, was not done properly. So, yes, a door has been opened to criminal defendants to tell the government, you need to prosecute us in this way, not in that way. And it may have lightened the load on them. But, you know --</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Sounds like you don't think the original 24 was that unfair (ph), though.</p><p/><p>AIDALA: I mean, they did some bad stuff. They hurt a lot of people. They hurt a lot of retired people who are like -- I mean, you go from thinking like, going to bed, thinking I have a half a million dollars in the bank and I'm 80 years old to I have nothing in the bank and I'm 80 years old.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p/><p>AIDALA: Hello!</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Arthur, thank you so much.</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: You did a great job. There's smoke coming out of your ears.</p><p/><p>AIDALA: I learn about the dish. I dished it. I knew about the dish. Thank you, folks.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Turning now to a much more serious topic, the unsettling situation in Syria. All eyes are on the country's reports (ph) on chemical weapons use and see frightening images of escalating violence. Now, some Lawmakers here at home are trying to block any U.S. funding to armed rebels.</p><p/><p>Of course, we know the story is about a lot more than money. There's an enormous human toll, but our show is called MONEY, so we're going to focus on that angle. We're going to take a closer look at whether or not it would actually cost us more to get involved now or not.</p><p/><p>Joining us now with his take is Zuhdi Jasser, president of the American Islamic Forum for Democracy. Always nice to have you, Zuhdi.</p><p/><p>ZUHDI JASSER, AMERICAN ISLAMIC FORUM FOR DEMOCRACY: Thanks, Melissa. It's great to be with you.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: You know, we're trying to break down the cost. As we said, huge human toll, you know, for humanitarian reasons you may or may not want to get involved, but looking at just the dollar part of it, what is the cost of doing nothing at this point?</p><p/><p>JASSER: Well, we have two and half years, Melissa, of the revolution to know what that cost is. And just some numbers from Tel Aviv University, it looks like in Jordan, it costs $35 per refugee just to house them per year. So, you're looking right now at three to four million refugees that have been displaced in Syria.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Who's paying for that?</p><p/><p>JASSER: That's the thing. Jordan is paying for some of it, but we're paying a lot of it. We've already paid over half a billion dollars through USAID into the region, and it's looking like the refugees are going to reach six million by the end of the year, and our money is into it.</p><p/><p>It's going to be in the billions whether we do, you know, nothing militarily or not, it's going to be -- it's a part of the region that if we're going to continue to try to maintain stability, the humanitarian aid is not only the compassionate thing to do, it has to be done militarily strategically or otherwise the entire region will implode with sectarian violence and our ally in the region. Israel will certainly be threatened.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: If we do something, that is incredibly expensive, already looking at the estimates. A no-fly zone in the first 10 days alone would cost $1.4 billion. And it expands from there, right?</p><p/><p>JASSER: Oh, absolutely. And you know, the no-fly zone -- yes, Libya was a bit cheaper, but they're looking -- this is more like Iraq. Syria has a more sophisticated military that would need to be taken out, and somewhere of 50 to 100 million a day, they say. But still, I think the cost and a lot of experts have said this the cost are going to be less, as Michael O'Hanlon (ph) from Brookings said, it's a bargain if we can end this war earlier.</p><p/><p>Because look, two and half years have proven this war is going nowhere. Assad maybe winning as far as militarily, but the attrition from the Syrian army continues. It's only how long, how many months or years when Assad will finally fall. And if we want to have a play in the region and be involved in the right side of history and help move them towards, we defeat Assad first as the strategy and second defeat al Qaeda.</p><p/><p>If we want to play a role in that, we have to be on the right side of history to fight against the Iran, fight against Hezbollah, et cetera. Not with troops.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: -- on the right side of history and some are arguing that it's too late for that. That early on, we could have been fighting against Hezbollah and Assad. And when we originally saw pictures of children being slaughtered, that was the time to get involved, but we didn't. And now, at this point, al Qaeda and extremists have gotten involved.</p><p/><p>On the other side, and it's become now al Qaeda versus Hezbollah, which isn't our fight, neither of those folks are our friends, and we should just stay out of it. That is one of the theories that's out there. I'll give you the last word on why you don't agree with that, if you don't.</p><p/><p>JASSER: Well, that calculus of characterizing the opposition of al Qaeda is just not correct. The Syrian population has become more radicalized and they're becoming more, you know, chaotic and committing atrocities, but that's because we've done nothing. If we come to the side of helping the millions -- there's only tens of thousands of al Qaeda -- the millions of Syrians in this opposition, we will help defeat the ultimate source of the radicalization which is Assad.</p><p/><p>And remember, Hezbollah, the forms of terror in the Middle East is Iran. So, those on my (ph) conservative side that believe that doing nothing will allow al Qaeda to die, actually, al Qaeda is thriving, Hezbollah is thriving. Terror will thrive without our involvement. So, the question is, which side has less terror? I believe doing something would.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Zuhdi Jasser, thank you so much for your thoughts tonight. We always appreciate it.</p><p/><p>JASSER: Thank you. Appreciate it.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: We have some breaking news right now on Facebook. Let's go to Fox Business' Jo Ling Kent with the latest. Jo Ling, what do you have?</p><p/><p>JO LING KENT, FOX BUSINESS: Melissa, Facebook is confirming on their website that a security breach has exposed six million e-mail addresses and telephone numbers. And let me tell you a little bit more of what they're saying on the website.</p><p/><p>They found, they said, through their white hat security researching program that they use that, quote, \"that may have allowed some of a person's contact information e-mail or phone number to be accessed by people who either had some contact information about the person or some connection to that person.\"</p><p/><p>So, they're saying six million e-mail addresses and telephone numbers were shared, but Facebook was also very quick to note in its statement that no other types of personal or financial information were included and only people on Facebook, not developers or advertisers, had access to this information.</p><p/><p>So, certainly, a very alarming security breach has happened at Facebook, and we'll continue to bring you more a little bit later, Melissa.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Wow. Jo Ling, thanks so much.</p><p/><p>All right. Coming up on MONEY, surviving the end of the world sounds tough. Indoor pool, a bowling alley, a golf, maybe it wouldn't be that bad. A California developer is opening the world's largest doomsday shelter. This will be an underground resort. It's fabulous. He's taking reservations. He joins us with all the details, because at the end of the day, the end of the world, it's all about MONEY.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Talk about surviving in style. Vivos Survival Shelter and Resort is the chicest doomsday shelter out there. For a few thousand bucks, you and yours (ph) can be safe from any number of impending disasters. Cozily nestled 100 feet below in Atchison Kansas, and you can live in your shelter in your very own RV -- wow! -- for up to a year. There is big money to be made in the bunker business.</p><p/><p>Joining me now is Robert Vicino. He is founder and CEO of Vivos Group and the owner of the fabulous shelter. Thank you so much for coming on.</p><p/><p>ROBERT VICINO, VIVOS GROUP FOUNDER AND CEO: It's my honor.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: I understand that this is a space that the army previously used. They auctioned it off. And what gave you the idea to make it into a doomsday shelter?</p><p/><p>VICINO: Well, we've been in the shelter business for the last five years building Vivos shelters around the world. And, typically, whenever a government shelter or facility comes up, we try to buy it and then retrofitted and convert it into a modern day blast shelter. This one was auctioned by the GSA and we jumped on it.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: What is it like? What happens when I arrived there?</p><p/><p>VICINO: It is a turnkey four-star underground hotel/cruise ship. It's everything you could imagine. It's not just a survival shelter. It is truly a destination resort where you and your family and your children would want to go to many times a year, perhaps, in the middle of the winter where it' s 70 degrees inside this mountain year round. So, you will be very comfortable.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Do people come even if there's not a disaster by space (ph). Can I come and hang out?</p><p/><p>VICINO: Anytime you want. You can't permanently live there, but yes, it's open 24/7 forever. And so, you buy your space and you park your RV there, whatever you're comfortable with, be it a 20-footer or 45-foot motor home for a million dollar. And it's a one-time charge, and you know, it's yours, you're a co-owner of this what would be a billion dollar replacement.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Does it cost me a million dollars? I mean, I read that it's $1,000 per lineal foot. The average RV is about 30 feet, so that's $30,000, and there's $1,500 charge per person, but I don't know what -- over what period of time. How much would it cost me? I have a husband and two kids, what are you going to charge me?</p><p/><p>VICINO: Well, you're the perfect nuclear family.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Yes. Thank you.</p><p/><p>VICINO: And, it would cost no extra charge for any of those family members, the only thing you're paying for is the RV, itself, by the lineal foot. So, if you had a 30-foot RV, it's $30,000 and four children or four people for food, that's a one year food supply. It's another 6,000. So, for $36,000, you've got yourself an investment and a life assurance policy or --</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: How many people have signed up, so far? How much money have you made?</p><p/><p>VICINO: Well, not enough. We've had 25,000 applications over the last few years. The primary problem has been the cost. People can't afford our other shelters where it's a per person rate as much as $50,000. So, this --</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: So, of those 25,000, how many people have locked it in?</p><p/><p>VICINO: On this new one, we just announced it last week in or membership, and we've got a few hundred already signed up. So, it's going to happen very quickly. We'll sell out. This one will accommodate only 1,500 RVs or about 5,000 people, which I like to say is almost one in a million people on Earth.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: This one makes me nervous about this. So, you're all the way in Kansas. I'm in New York, for example. What kind of doomsday disaster would come my way that I would have enough time to get there?</p><p/><p>VICINO: Oh, let's say a nuke went off in L.A. or in Washington or in the Middle East, or let's say where about to see a major economic meltdown, which could happen any day, as you know, or let's say the earth was rumbling or an asteroid was on its way. Things --</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: I would have enough time to get there?</p><p/><p>VICINO: It's time to go. And you may go and it may not happen, and so, it's a false alarm just like the fireman goes to the --</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p/><p>VICINO: -- but at least you have somewhere to go versus the other seven billion people on the planet that will have no solution, nowhere to go, and they'll be scrambling. And you don't want to be a part of that mash (ph). You want to go. You want to have a safe haven. You'll be underground in what we call effectively a fortress.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: OK. Robert, thanks for coming on the show. Interesting idea. Sounds like -- I'll be interested to see if it's a good business, if you sell out, because -- I mean, there's a lot to be afraid of these days. I don't know. People want an insurance policy. Thanks for coming on. Keep us posted.</p><p/><p>VICINO: My pleasure.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Here is our MONEY question of the day. How much would you pay for a spot on world's biggest doomsday shelter? Not surprisingly, I got a lot of funny responses to this one, including Less Than Zero. \"I'd rather die than live in Kansas.\" Come on! Come on. Kansas is a nice place. That was mean.</p><p/><p>We want to hear from more of you. You can like us on Facebook at acebook.com/MelissaFrancisFox or follow me on Twitter @MelissaAFrancis.</p><p/><p>All right. Coming up on MONEY. Oh, bless you, Kanye and Kim. You gave your baby a name even crazier than we thought possible. And there's developing news on what the middle name is, too. We've got it all in \"Spare Change.\" You can never have too many insane celebrities.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: All right. Welcome to \"Spare Change.\" We are joined by Jarrod Guy Randolph and we also have Hitha Prabhakar here. Thanks to both of you for coming on. A little \"Spare Change\" fun on this Friday.</p><p/><p>HITHA PRABHAKAR, RETAIL ANALYST: Thanks for having us.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: All right. First, we are going to look at some birthdays at work. If it is not already bad enough that you're in the office for your birthday, check this out. This birthday card we saw, you literally just check the box next to your name. Can you imagine that, to show your love? I mean, come on. You can't even sign your name anymore.</p><p/><p>What would you do if you got this card? You check the box next to your names. You check, you know, best wishes, happy birthday, get hammered on us. I don't know.</p><p/><p>PRABHAKAR: I got to be honest with you, this is actually a nicer card than I received from most of my family members for my birthday.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: What?</p><p/><p>PRABHAKAR: Yes.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: You need a new family.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: What is worse than this card, no card at all or do the cards say does it have so many else's name in it? I mean, what is worse than this card?</p><p/><p>PRABHAKAR: Misspelled name.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Hitha is pretty straightforward. Hitha Prabhakar, I don't want to have to spell on television, but Hitha, I could do.</p><p/><p>PRABHAKAR: No one really sign their names either. It was just kind of --</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Really?</p><p/><p>PRABHAKAR: Yes.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Wow.</p><p/><p>PRABHAKAR: Yes. So --</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: You're going to be in therapy for that for a long time.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Jarrod, what about you?</p><p/><p>JARROD GUY RANDOLPH, CORE VICE PRESIDENT: I don't think there was follow-through on that card. It was supposed to lead in the something else, but I mean --</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Like what?</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>RANDOLPH: If birthday cards look like that, I can only imagine what the annual holiday bonus looks like.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p/><p>RANDOLPH: So, for me, I'd be a little upset if my co-workers gave that to me.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: OK. So, this is a new case for your iPhone. It doubles as a stun gun to prevent any accidental discharge. Yes, I would hope. Users have to flip two switches before activating the gun. The case sells for 140 bucks. And the co-founder says sales could exceed a million dollars this year.</p><p/><p>Is this just a must have or is it a lawsuit waiting to happen? I'm wondering, what happens when you accidentally but dial with your iPhone. That's a stun gun (ph). That would be quite a shock.</p><p/><p>PRABHAKAR: Not only is it a lawsuit waiting to happen, it's a disaster waiting to happen. I mean, I can't tell you how many times I get misdialed phones from different people. I misdial (ph) phone. Also, if you're getting attacked, why would you want to on latch (ph) something and then security check this. I mean, wouldn't you want to just kind of go for it and try to protect yourself?</p><p/><p>RANDOLPH: I see the value on this product.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: You do?</p><p/><p>RANDOLPH: This will be even (ph) my secret weapon. You will buy a $50 million apartment. I'm going to start using this with my client.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>RANDOLPH: I mean, I don't see why not. If this actually became an approved Apple accessory. So --</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: What? Really?</p><p/><p>RANDOLPH: It's kind of amazing.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: There should be a breathalyzer attached to it.</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>RANDOLPH: They're going to come up with that.</p><p/><p>PRABHAKAR: Right.</p><p/><p>RANDOLPH: And if you go on the website, the pink ones are the ones that have sold out first. I'm just waiting for the camouflage.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: How much is the cost? Does anybody know?</p><p/><p>RANDOLPH: I think it's about $140.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Wow! That's amazing. Well, there's a Christmas gift.</p><p/><p>All right. So, the big baby news of the week, a bizarre name given. Reality princess, Kim Kardashian and rapper baby daddy, Kanye West, have chosen the name North, North, for their baby girl. Think about that for a second. The baby's name is Northwest, no middle name. I mean, they're running this child's life or they giving it direction.</p><p/><p>PRABHAKAR: All right. We can safely assume that it's not a fan of One Direction, right, the band?</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: OK. All right. I like that. That was good. Jarrod, what do you think about this?</p><p/><p>RANDOLPH: The middle name should be Southeast. So, it's north, south, east, west. I mean, I actually can't believe we're talking about this right now.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>RANDOLPH: But think about it, there were other names that could have come up with. Lampshade, soda can. I mean, they could have named it anything.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Seven, Pepsi. I don't know. All those --</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: One of the worst names ever.</p><p/><p>PRABHAKAR: I like the east and west. Wasn't east and west --</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: And we wrap up the week. Our own Tom Sullivan has some doubts about the direction of our economy. Take a listen.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>TOM SULLIVAN, FOX BUSINESS: Something isn't right about the economy. I'm trying to be positive, and yes, the economy has expanded every quarter going back to 2009. But it's consistently weak growth. The job market, it's also improving, but not enough to soak up all of the new people that are coming into the job market, the young grads and immigrants. And housing, it seems to be doing better. In fact, in some places, there's another price bubble growing.</p><p/><p>But, it's because there are two few homes for sale and that's largely because whopping (ph) number, 44 percent of homeowners are either under water or they don't have enough equity to pay a realtor to sell their home, so they sit. And it's the same number, 44 percent of people who told CNN in a poll this week that they are worse off economically now than compared to just one year ago.</p><p/><p>The huge portion of the country is still hurting. The markets are nervous about the fed slowing down its artificial pumping of the economy. I get that, but even though I don't like what the fed is done, I don't see the fed making any big changes, and I don't see this fragile economy jumping out of its sick bed anytime soon.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Well, that's true. Thanks, Tom. Be sure to watch \"The Tom Sullivan Show\" this weekend. You can catch it at 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. on Saturday, and on Sunday at 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. Happy Friday, everyone.

With the fed making a financial mess, how to prepare with  what is coming next.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus, surviving the apocalypse in style.  A California developer is opening  the world's largest doomsday shelter and resort.  Where do I make my  reservation?  The man behind it joins us.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And who lost \"Money\" today?  One of America's top CEO, it is so much money,  it would make John B. Rockefeller cry.  Stay tuned to find out who it is. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Because even when they say t is not, it is always about \"Money.\" </p><p>It is the end of a very tumultuous week on Wall Street and it is time for  some serious crisis management for the fed.  So, you are entering the spin  zone.  Ben Bernanke is getting slam for statements this week about the  possibility of easing off the bond buying program which came just two days  of the fed chairman was basically fired on the Charlie Rose show.  I don't  know if you saw this, a lot of moving pieces but we want you to know what  you have to do right now to protect yourself in the midst of all of it.  </p><p>Joining me now is Barron's senior editor, Jack Hough and Pat Howell, CEO of  Howell financial group.  Welcome back to the show.  </p><p>Jack, let me start with you.  Have the wheels come off the fed here?  I  mean, it has been quite a week for those guys.  </p><p>JACK HOUGH, SENIOR EDITOR, BARRON:  I'm not sure what the dissent is about.   I mean, are we supposed to keep interest rates near zero forever?  I mean,  at this point, you are trading off this much improvement in the economy  versus this much distortion of every kind of asset class investors have a  choice of.  It is time, isn't it?  </p><p>FRANCIS:  It is time.  But that is not really what we're talking about.  I  mean, what we are talking about is sort of the chaos that ensued this week.   For example, I mean, let me play you the sound bite.  President Obama  basically fired Ben Bernanke in Charlie Rose.  And we will get both your  reactions on the other side.  Listen to this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I think Ben Bernanke has  done an outstanding job.  Ben Bernanke is a little bit like Bob Mueller,  the head of the FBI where he has already stayed a lot longer than he wanted  or he was supposed to.  But, I think --  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE, TV HOST:  But if he wanted to be reappointed, you would  reappoint him?  </p><p>OBAMA:  He has been outstanding partner along with the White House.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FRANCIS:  What?  I mean, that is not really a ringing endorsement.  Pat,  that is like somebody saying, you know, how is your husband?  You are like,  well, he has been outstanding partner until now.  </p><p>PATRICIA POWELL, CEO, POWELL FINANCIAL GROUP:  Anybody can be a loose  cannon, it is just odd it is the president of the United States.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Is he a loose cannon or was that on purpose?  I mean, don't know.   There is a lot of negativity there.  </p><p>POWELL:  He is making some telegraphing things too.  He is not going to  Jackson hole, you know, that was a little odd.  I mean, he has been  telegraphing things.  And a lot of people say that he is tired, this has  been exhausting thing, and it was not really -- this is now what he had in  mind when he became chairman of the fed.  </p><p>HOUGH:  He was looking at his shoes when he said that, right?  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Right.  </p><p>HOUGH:  I'm not a body language expert, but that says stayed.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  He stayed a lot longer than he was supposed to or he wanted to.   I mean, that is pretty harsh.  So then, it is not surprising that Ben  Bernanke comes out, rocks the boat a bit.  I mean, they are all over the  place.  You have James Bullard, Ben coming out today saying, well maybe,  you know, we are going t have more combination down the road if we need it.   Basically, going against everything that Ben Bernanke said, which is sort  of all over the map.  Where does that leave investors?  </p><p>HOUGH:  It is unusual to see a special press release like that with a sort  of dissenting view.  And I think it is already a tumultuous time for the  market.  I don't think there's any kind of financial Armageddon.  I mean,  where people are getting crazy about losing a few percent in the stock  market.  Keep in mind the market is double in nearly, you know, in about  four years, and treasury rates are up (INAUDIBLE), were 2.5 percent for the  average over the past 50 years, it is over six percent.  So we don't have  skyrocketing interest rates something like that.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  It says that the whole point is we need these guys.  I mean, they  are doing -- they have done policy that we have never seen before in our  lives.  So, we need them to dismount in the cleanest way possible her and  get out of it.  So far just this week it has been utter chaos.  </p><p>My favorite comment because the twitter universe and online to block its  fear was alive, with all of these different machination during the week.  I  love Lawrence McDonald tweeted, somebody that a lot of us follow, he is on  TV all the time.  He said job opening, portfolio manager need for $3.5  trillion, 70-tons leverage Hedge Fund unlimited borrow, no marked market,  see Federal Reserve.  </p><p>Does not inspire confidence?  I mean, everybody is joking about what is  going on.  It does tell you don't have a lot of confidence of what is going  on.  </p><p>POWELL:  Well, nobody here has confidence because we don't know how this is  going to be around.  But, it is so much better that they are telling us  this stuff.  We don't want to invest blindly.  We don't want to have  another secret.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  They telling us, what though?  They are telling us all different  things.  I mean, Bullard says we could ease more.  Ben Bernanke says we are  getting out, President Obama says he is fired, telling us what?  </p><p>POWELL:  Well, Bernanke started, I think, on the 22nd of May by giving us  the first inkling that there thinking about chasing, and I think in this  particular -- the comments this week really dealt with the fact that we are  creating a plan to taper.  This is a very good thing.  It is so much better  to have a plan than to be shooting from the hips which was not good.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  So, how do we all set ourselves up for this because this is the  take away that we want for our audience here?  It means that interest rates  are going up, maybe, my thought is give anything interest-rate sensitive  whether it is an adjustable mortgage or it is credit card rates you want to  keep an eye on that, maybe it is a great time in real estate to transact  whether you are a buyer or a seller.  I mean, if you are a buyer, this is  probably as good as the rates are going to be.  If you are seller, you may  want to transact because it is the most money that a buyer is going to  have.  What do you think? </p><p>POWELL:  Buyers may start rushing in because they have been sitting back  waiting to see what is going to happen, now they saw a real choice.  If  interest rates go up, every point that goes up they lose purchasing power  or borrowing power.  So, it can push the real estate market, actually, up  in the short run.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  In the short run.  In the long run, I mean, Jack, would you agree  with that?  In the long run, it is bad for the real estate market because  higher interest rates make it tougher.  </p><p>HOUGH:  I'm on sure there is anyone here is on the fence right now, that  waiting for a little less of the mortgage rate before they buy, I mean,  that ship has sailed.  But I think in terms of investors right now, you  hold onto some extra cash because there's a possibility both stocks and  bonds are going to be weak at the same time.  We don't a lynch how an  interesting piece of research what they said.  Right now, inflations is  actually coming down and interest rates are going up, which is a rarity.   It happened in 1994, at that time tech stocks outperformed, utilities got  hurt, they were recommending the same thing right now.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Interesting point of view.  </p><p>All right, thanks to both of you.  Good stuff.  </p><p>HOUGH:  Thank you.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Time now for today's fuel gauge report.  China and Russia signing  $270 billion oil deal.  It is one of the biggest in history.  Rosneft,  Russian's state owned oil company will double supplies to China.  It could  reach up to 900,000 barrels per day.  That is according to Vladimir Putin.   The 25 year deal makes chin China the biggest customer for Russian oil.  </p><p>U.S. gasoline demand for May fell to a 13 year low.  That is according to  the American Petroleum Institute.  Demand slipped by 3.3 percent to about  8.7 million barrels per day.  </p><p>And Oil futures is getting smacked for a second session, a stronger U.S.  dollar largely fueling oil decline.  It posted its biggest two-day drop in  a year losing about 4.5 percent.  Crude settled at $93.69 a barrel.  Big  move on the week.  </p><p>All right, up next, Michael Dell versus Carl Icahn, it is the face-off only  the power of money could create.  We are going to tell you how it is  turning personal now.  </p><p>Plus, the reason the government has gotten so good at spying on you is  because it is coaching top talent from Silicon Valley.  Maybe you didn't  know that.  We got details on the stunning revelation in the NSA scandal.  </p><p>More \"Money\" coming up.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  The battle between two Wall Street titans is getting bigger and  personal, by the way.  Michael Dell now launching a personal pitch to buy  out his ubiquitous company, and pushed Icahn's offer out of the way, but  will it deliver or well Icahn when out?  It is all about the power of  \"Money.\"  </p><p>Here to weigh in is \"Wall Street Journal\" business editor, Dennis Berman  and Jonas Max Ferris at MaxFunds.com. </p><p>Great to have you both on the show.  </p><p>Dennis, let me start with you.  This is battle of the titans.  I mean,  these are two enormous egos out there, so how do you size of the whole  think?  </p><p>DENNIS BERMAN, BUSINESS EDITOR, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  I see Dell winning,  Icahn losing.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Really?  How come?  </p><p>BERMAN:  Simple reason.  The best chance for Dell to beaten was a potential  rival bid from another private equity firm.  Carl Icahn, at this point, he  could do a lot of great noise and smoke and a lot of activity, but when it  comes down to it the shareholder will have to say that he wants to take  this offer or do we not?  And right now, given the market where they are,  they are probably going to take the offer of $14 per share.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  So Jonas, what do you think?  I mean, his basically saying Silver  Lake wins the day because, of course, that too smacky (ph) Michael Dell?  </p><p>JONAS MAX FERRIS, MARKET WATCHER, MAXFUNDS.COM:  Because I think people  would rather side with the guy who started the company in his dorm room  then some Wall Street raider.  I just don't think that that is -- that guy  is going to fix it.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  The guy has started the company in his dorm room, but has kind of  driven it into the ground, right?  </p><p>FERRIS:  Well, by that logic every tech CEO who isn't Apple or Samsung  should be fired because they all missed the smart phone revolution.  Go  down the line, everybody screwed up.  And the whole PC, this has come on  land.  That was original cornerstone of the business was assembling PC box.   That is a dying business and it is easy to say, he missed the smart phone  and pad revolution, yes, it is good.  But everybody didn't because it is  really hard to compete.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  I don't know.  I mean, Dennis, right here you have his whole  plan, Michael Dell's whole plan right here, for how he will turn the  company around.  And we were talking about this is the commercial break is  that if he has this brilliance, why hasn't he done it already, why doesn't  he do it while the company is public?  I mean, just do it, you know.  Why  do you have to take (INAUDIBLE).  </p><p>BERMAN:  I think you make a really good point.  I agree with you.  And, if  you read this and it doesn't take long because he doesn't write very much  here you will be relatively uninspired by what with Michael dell has to  say.  You will be relatively uninspired by what Michael Dell has to say.   It is what I would call problem.  It is generic.  It does not say anything.  </p><p>But, whether he says anything here or not or whether Carl Icahn is the  right person to be a part of dell, really, it doesn't matter is there's  only one thing that matters, to shareholders want to accept the price for  dell right now?  There are no offers being the price of the stock is  trading below the $14 offer.  It the market that telling us that will  probably be accepted.  Although, it may not be easy at the moment.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Jonas, if you are a shareholder -- but, are you, by the way?  </p><p>FERRIS:  We all own it through mutual funds indirectly.  Directly, don't  bow and very few people only this directly.  It is not growth stock getting  more and the public only owns like Apple directly users all along by --.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  So, would say, give me the $14 let me the hell out of the stock?   So, I can just forget about Dell and go off.  </p><p>FERRIS:  Because I think Icahn is playing an a head start for proxy movie,  who with all the movie with the executives try to pretend the company was  worthless so they can buy the stock at a cheap price and then by putting  the bad CEO in.  That was the movie.  I think that is what the spin is  here, the Dell rule is down talking the stock so he could take it private.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  So you think it has more value than Roe (ph).  </p><p>FERRIS:  I do think so.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Really?  Why, what is so valuable?  </p><p>FERRIS:  Well, it is a long shot, but without the PC business, I think  there is still an angle to be some sort of IBM asks more, you know, selling  silver type in software company.  It is not a huge growth opportunity, but  I think there is something there that is more valuable than the current  share price.  That is a better price for a lot of non-Apple, Samsung  companies today.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  What do you think, Dennis?  Is that possible?  </p><p>BERMAN:  It is certainly possible.  And this is that the fundamental  complex.  The real tension inside this management by IPOs, what does the  guy at the top of the ladder know that I don't know that he shares with us?   And should I trust him, or should I not?  </p><p>Here is another great example.  J. Crew, great company.  We all know that  company.  It went private after the CEO basically forced and offer down his  owned shareholder's growth.  So, Jonas makes a fair point about the  conflicts inherent in that those dynamics.  But again, as it stands now,  roughly 15 percent or so of shares are a lied against BBO (ph).  </p><p>FRANCIS:  But wait, but other than him knowing something we all don't, what  would be his other reason for wanting to take it private?  </p><p>FERRIS:  I would say vanity.  It is his business.  He has got his name on  it.  It is hard to walk away.  You don't want it to die.  It is called  Dell.  It is not Microsoft, you know.  It holds on Bill Gates' software.   So, it is like there's a certain element where you want it to succeed.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  So, it is either vanity or he knows something we don't?  Real  quick before we go, what is your bet, vanity or he knows something we  don't?  </p><p>FERRIS:  I think it is still worth more than it is.  I do think all these  tycoons, these are old, are going to go private at some point because --.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  So, he knows something we don't.  That's how I'm going to  interpret that.  </p><p>Dennis, what do you think, vanity or he know something we don't?  </p><p>BERMAN:  I say the answer is both.  But, in the end --  </p><p>FRANCIS:  How can it be both?  Pick one.  </p><p>BERMAN:  Well, he is both vain and he knows something that we don't.  Those  can both motivations.  In the end, the shareholders are going to bite  because --.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  OK.  Guys, you are fantastic, thank you.  </p><p>BERMAN:  Thank you.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Coming up on \"Money,\" if you knew facebook former chief security  officer but feel like he has dropped off the radar, here is why.  He is now  working for the NSA and he is not alone.  We will tell you how Silicon  Valley is getting help to the government's prying eyes.  </p><p>Plus, former Enron CEO, Jeff Skilling, hits 10 years, why he stop his  prison sentence?  And it could be a dream come true for white-collar  criminals.  </p><p>Stay right where you are and find out why.  </p><p>Do you ever have too much \"Money\"?  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  Weather it is on Wall Street or Main Street, here is to make  \"Money\" today.  </p><p>Actually, I can start with who made money.  Larry Ellison, the CEO of  Oracle, lost so much money I have to do that one first.  Oracle's latest  earnings were a big disappointment on Wall Street.  And as a result, the  shares plunged more than nine percent today.  So Larry Ellison owns 1.1  billion shares of Oracle.  That means he lost $3.4 billion today, $3.4  billion.  I had to put that in perspective.  Ellison bought the whole  island of Lanai last year for $300 million.  So, he lost the equivalent of  11 Hawaiian Islands today.  </p><p>Meanwhile, trying to make \"Money\" today, Starbucks, it is raising drink  cause for first time in almost two years.  The average price hike will be  about one percent.  Starbucks blames rising rent and labor cost for the  increase.  </p><p>And the Miami heat championship win proving a ratings gold mine for ABC.   Nearly 18 percent of you at home watched game seven last night.  That is  according to Nielsen.  It is the second highest rating for an NBA game in  11 years, a sign of the times and congratulations.  </p><p>So, if you have been following the NSA spy scandal you may wonder how tight  the government really is with big tech companies like facebook, for  example.  Well, a shocking report reveal that actually left to go work for  the NSA back in 2010 and evidently, he is not the only big tech exec that's  made the move from Silicon Valley to government spy agency.  </p><p>That brings up a lot of questions and concerns, namely what kinds of info  are these ex-tech employees bringing to their new job.  With me on this  frightening development is managing director of TechnoBuffalo, Roy Choi.  </p><p>Welcome back to the show, Roy.  </p><p>ROY CHOI, MANAGING DIRECTOR, TECHNOBUFFALO:  Thank you.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  I mean, should we be afraid of this?  I mean, this is a guy who  was in charge of protecting our own private personal information on  facebook and he eventually took the knowledge and the keys of the kingdom  and went to go work for an agency that is now spying on us.  </p><p>CHOI:  I think we have to assume that, you know, employees as tech  companies like facebook, Google, Skype, they have this information and  they're going to go somewhere and may be to the NSA and feed that.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  So, you are basically saying, we have to assume that everything  we put online could eventually be handed over to people who are spying on  us?  And you just have to be satisfied with that?  </p><p>CHOI:  Yes.  They have policies in place, but when you turn into reality  you will see that information isn't always word is supposed to be.  We will  claim it is 100 percent locks down, but how many times have we seen leaks  weathered his credit card information or online information leaks either  accidentally or a hole in the security software or malicious hackers going  in and getting this information.  </p><p>So, I can't say that people are always going to be secure.  And you know, I  think people are under the assumption when I post something online, it is  going to be there for public consumption.  But you know, it is beyond that,  it is the metadata, it is the stuff you don't necessarily see.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  What will be his motivation for leaving a place like facebook?   You have to imagine that at the level he was, he was making a lot of money  and owned a lot of stock and did really well.  Why would you leave and go  and work for the government?  </p><p>CHOI:  Who knows?  Maybe it is a greater challenge.  Maybe, you know,  facebook has been a huge supporter of helping fight crime a couple of years  ago.  And I am not saying this particular security official, but the most  recent security official actually implemented a program where they could  actually search through content, so there was anything that is a sexual  predator was out there and putting in language that would be a little worry  some for law enforcement, they would openly give that information out.  And  you know, they have actually stated their policy is as long as there is a  court order or any type of subpoena they would hand that information freely  in order to protect users.  And at that point, they were under a lot of  pressure to help especially with lots of sexual predators lurking on  facebook.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  That's one thing.  But you know, when I have asked that question  in the past of hackers and the like, why would you go from the private  sector where you are making a lot of money to work for the NSA or any  government agency for a lot less.  They say that they are allowed to do  things when you're working for the NSA that you're not allowed to do in  regular life, and you are allowed to spy in a way that you can't do for a  private company.  So you combine sort of that ability and ambition with  someone who knows the intimate ins and outs of a facebook or a Google and  you get a very powerful government who could spy on us even more than we  ever imagined.  Your thoughts on that?  </p><p>CHOI:  Definitely.  And I think, when we look at, in terms of national  security, in terms of our own security, privately, you are going to see the  internet as like the next forum, whether that is in a proactive manner or a  reactive manner.  So, for someone to leave from Silicon Valley, the  constraints of, you know, regulations and whatever else, you know, maybe  you go to the NSA, maybe you go to another government agency, but you do  get that level of freedom to go out and use your talents to make your mark.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes.  </p><p>Roy, thank you so much for coming on the show.  Appreciate your time.  </p><p>CHOI:  Thank you.  Appreciate it.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Up next on \"Money,\" we are going to Jeffrey Skilling.  He  committed one of the worst acts of corporate fraud in U.S. history.  Well,  the former Enron CEO is now getting out of prison 10 years ahead of  schedule.  We are going to explain why this is music to the ears of white- collar criminals everywhere.  </p><p>Plus, a bipartisan group of senators wants to block U.S. military funding  for Syrian rebels.  You may like the sound of that, but will we have to  spend even more if we don't act now?  One of the many top experts breaks  down the numbers for us.  </p><p>Piles of \"money\" coming up.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MELISSA FRANCIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  New developments today in  the case of convicted white-collar felon, Jeffrey Skilling.  The former  Enron CEO has served six and half years of a 24-year sentence, so far, for  bringing down the world's largest energy trader.  It was one of the worst  acts of corporate fraud in U.S. history.</p><p>But today, his sentence was sliced by 10 years.  Meaning, now, he's  going to be out in just seven and a half years instead of 17 1/2 years from  now.  So, what does his short and sentence mean for white-collar criminals?   Here with the dish is our go to lawyer, Arthur Aidala.</p><p>ARTHUR AIDALA, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST:  Dish?</p><p>FRANCIS:  Dish.  Yes.</p><p>AIDALA:  Is that a legal term?</p><p>FRANCIS:  It is.  You didn't know that, because you're a lawyer.  You  should know.</p><p>AIDALA:  -- any Italian food, so I don't know what the dishes (ph) are  about.</p><p>FRANCIS:  What is the deal?</p><p>AIDALA:  The deal here is this.  He appeals -- he gets convicted, gets  this huge sentence -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  I mean, he didn't kill anyone.</p><p>AIDALA:  He didn't kill anyone, but let me double check my map here.   $60 billion in Enron stock was rendered worthless.  $2 billion in employee  pension were rented worthless.  It's a lot of guilt (ph).</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes.</p><p>AIDALA:  That's a lot of money going on there.  So -- and more  importantly that a lot of money, it's a lot of people who got affected.  I  mean, lives were ruined, lives were destroyed.  So, he gets this really  rough sentence.  He -- (INAUDIBLE) who supposed to go get sentenced and get  wiped out, he dies, so that wipes out his conviction.  And, he appeals all  the way up to the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court basing the rules in  his favor saying one of the ways -- one of the convictions against him was  improper.</p><p>They go to a lower court about it.  Should there be a new trial?   Should there be a new trial?  The bottom line is, they say that he was  sentenced to nine years too many, and for them not to re-appeal, because he  could have, the government said look -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  Nine years too many in which -- in what then?  Why?</p><p>AIDALA:  Because the guideline calculations, which is the very  complicated way.</p><p>FRANCIS:  They did the bath rock (ph).</p><p>AIDALA:  Well, they applied things the wrong way.  In federal court  unlike state court, to figure someone's sentence, you need like a small  calculus degree.  It's crazy.  And basically, in court, the judges said,  you did this the wrong way, you came about this the wrong way, therefore,  there's at least nine years that he's got tacked on that shouldn't be  tacked on.</p><p>FRANCIS:  So, are white-collar criminals everywhere rejoining because  the scuttlebutt on this all week long has been that the sentences for  financial crimes up late.  I mean, if you look at (INAUDIBLE).  I mean, all  of this has been very stiff.</p><p>AIDALA:  Well, what -- right.</p><p>FRANCIS:  And is this the beginning of a reduction in the sentences  for financial crisis, which as you said, ruined a lot of lives -- </p><p>AIDALA:  A lot of lives.</p><p>FRANCIS:  -- but in many cases are longer than murder convictions.</p><p>AIDALA:  Correct.  But literally, like a murder conviction, you're  really affecting like one person and one family.  This affected -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  Right.  But they're dead as opposed to I don't have money.   I mean, we should rather be alive -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>AIDALA:  But there are these charts in the federal law that when you  commit a crime, you start off at a very -- a below base level which is like  a non-jail sentence.  And then depending on how much money was stolen or  how much fraud or how much tax evasion, that's what you come up with the  numbers.  So, if it's just a minimal amount like 100 million, you're at one  level.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Very little.  Yes.</p><p>AIDALA:  When it's 60 billion, you're at the highest level.  You're  literally off the charts.  The United State Supreme Court did say that the  way they convicted him under this honest services fraud law, which is a  very complicated thing to explain, was not done properly.  So, yes, a door  has been opened to criminal defendants to tell the government, you need to  prosecute us in this way, not in that way.  And it may have lightened the  load on them.  But, you know -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  Sounds like you don't think the original 24 was that unfair  (ph), though.</p><p>AIDALA:  I mean, they did some bad stuff.  They hurt a lot of people.   They hurt a lot of retired people who are like -- I mean, you go from  thinking like, going to bed, thinking I have a half a million dollars in  the bank and I'm 80 years old to I have nothing in the bank and I'm 80  years old.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes.</p><p>AIDALA:  Hello!</p><p>FRANCIS:  Arthur, thank you so much.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  You did a great job.  There's smoke coming out of your ears.</p><p>AIDALA:  I learn about the dish.  I dished it.  I knew about the dish.   Thank you, folks.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Turning now to a much more serious topic, the unsettling  situation in Syria.  All eyes are on the country's reports (ph) on chemical  weapons use and see frightening images of escalating violence.  Now, some  Lawmakers here at home are trying to block any U.S. funding to armed  rebels.</p><p>Of course, we know the story is about a lot more than money.  There's  an enormous human toll, but our show is called MONEY, so we're going to  focus on that angle.  We're going to take a closer look at whether or not  it would actually cost us more to get involved now or not.</p><p>Joining us now with his take is Zuhdi Jasser, president of the  American Islamic Forum for Democracy.  Always nice to have you, Zuhdi.</p><p>ZUHDI JASSER, AMERICAN ISLAMIC FORUM FOR DEMOCRACY:  Thanks, Melissa.   It's great to be with you.</p><p>FRANCIS:  You know, we're trying to break down the cost.  As we said,  huge human toll, you know, for humanitarian reasons you may or may not want  to get involved, but looking at just the dollar part of it, what is the  cost of doing nothing at this point?</p><p>JASSER:  Well, we have two and half years, Melissa, of the revolution  to know what that cost is.  And just some numbers from Tel Aviv University,  it looks like in Jordan, it costs $35 per refugee just to house them per  year.  So, you're looking right now at three to four million refugees that  have been displaced in Syria.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Who's paying for that?</p><p>JASSER:  That's the thing.  Jordan is paying for some of it, but we're  paying a lot of it.  We've already paid over half a billion dollars through  USAID into the region, and it's looking like the refugees are going to  reach six million by the end of the year, and our money is into it.</p><p>It's going to be in the billions whether we do, you know, nothing  militarily or not, it's going to be -- it's a part of the region that if  we're going to continue to try to maintain stability, the humanitarian aid  is not only the compassionate thing to do, it has to be done militarily  strategically or otherwise the entire region will implode with sectarian  violence and our ally in the region.  Israel will certainly be threatened.</p><p>FRANCIS:  If we do something, that is incredibly expensive, already  looking at the estimates.  A no-fly zone in the first 10 days alone would  cost $1.4 billion.  And it expands from there, right?</p><p>JASSER:  Oh, absolutely.  And you know, the no-fly zone -- yes, Libya  was a bit cheaper, but they're looking -- this is more like Iraq.  Syria  has a more sophisticated military that would need to be taken out, and  somewhere of 50 to 100 million a day, they say.  But still, I think the  cost and a lot of experts have said this the cost are going to be less, as  Michael O'Hanlon (ph) from Brookings said, it's a bargain if we can end  this war earlier.</p><p>Because look, two and half years have proven this war is going  nowhere.  Assad maybe winning as far as militarily, but the attrition from  the Syrian army continues.  It's only how long, how many months or years  when Assad will finally fall.  And if we want to have a play in the region  and be involved in the right side of history and help move them towards, we  defeat Assad first as the strategy and second defeat al Qaeda.</p><p>If we want to play a role in that, we have to be on the right side of  history to fight against the Iran, fight against Hezbollah, et cetera.  Not  with troops.</p><p>FRANCIS:  -- on the right side of history and some are arguing that  it's too late for that.  That early on, we could have been fighting against  Hezbollah and Assad.  And when we originally saw pictures of children being  slaughtered, that was the time to get involved, but we didn't.  And now, at  this point, al Qaeda and extremists have gotten involved.</p><p>On the other side, and it's become now al Qaeda versus Hezbollah,  which isn't our fight, neither of those folks are our friends, and we  should just stay out of it.  That is one of the theories that's out there.   I'll give you the last word on why you don't agree with that, if you don't.</p><p>JASSER:  Well, that calculus of characterizing the opposition of al  Qaeda is just not correct.  The Syrian population has become more  radicalized and they're becoming more, you know, chaotic and committing  atrocities, but that's because we've done nothing.  If we come to the side  of helping the millions -- there's only tens of thousands of al Qaeda --  the millions of Syrians in this opposition, we will help defeat the  ultimate source of the radicalization which is Assad.</p><p>And remember, Hezbollah, the forms of terror in the Middle East is  Iran.  So, those on my (ph) conservative side that believe that doing  nothing will allow al Qaeda to die, actually, al Qaeda is thriving,  Hezbollah is thriving.  Terror will thrive without our involvement.  So,  the question is, which side has less terror?  I believe doing something  would.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Zuhdi Jasser, thank you so much for your thoughts tonight.   We always appreciate it.</p><p>JASSER:  Thank you.  Appreciate it.</p><p>FRANCIS:  We have some breaking news right now on Facebook.  Let's go  to Fox Business' Jo Ling Kent with the latest.  Jo Ling, what do you have? </p><p>JO LING KENT, FOX BUSINESS:  Melissa, Facebook is confirming on their  website that a security breach has exposed six million e-mail addresses and  telephone numbers.  And let me tell you a little bit more of what they're  saying on the website.</p><p>They found, they said, through their white hat security researching  program that they use that, quote, \"that may have allowed some of a  person's contact information e-mail or phone number to be accessed by  people who either had some contact information about the person or some  connection to that person.\"</p><p>So, they're saying six million e-mail addresses and telephone numbers  were shared, but Facebook was also very quick to note in its statement that  no other types of personal or financial information were included and only  people on Facebook, not developers or advertisers, had access to this  information.</p><p>So, certainly, a very alarming security breach has happened at  Facebook, and we'll continue to bring you more a little bit later, Melissa.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Wow.  Jo Ling, thanks so much.</p><p>All right.  Coming up on MONEY, surviving the end of the world sounds  tough.  Indoor pool, a bowling alley, a golf, maybe it wouldn't be that  bad.  A California developer is opening the world's largest doomsday  shelter.  This will be an underground resort.  It's fabulous.  He's taking  reservations.  He joins us with all the details, because at the end of the  day, the end of the world, it's all about MONEY.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  Talk about surviving in style.  Vivos Survival Shelter and  Resort is the chicest doomsday shelter out there.  For a few thousand  bucks, you and yours (ph) can be safe from any number of impending  disasters.  Cozily nestled 100 feet below in Atchison Kansas, and you can  live in your shelter in your very own RV -- wow! -- for up to a year.   There is big money to be made in the bunker business.</p><p>Joining me now is Robert Vicino.  He is founder and CEO of Vivos Group  and the owner of the fabulous shelter.  Thank you so much for coming on.</p><p>ROBERT VICINO, VIVOS GROUP FOUNDER AND CEO:  It's my honor.</p><p>FRANCIS:  I understand that this is a space that the army previously  used.  They auctioned it off.  And what gave you the idea to make it into a  doomsday shelter? </p><p>VICINO:  Well, we've been in the shelter business for the last five  years building Vivos shelters around the world.  And, typically, whenever a  government shelter or facility comes up, we try to buy it and then  retrofitted and convert it into a modern day blast shelter.  This one was  auctioned by the GSA and we jumped on it.</p><p>FRANCIS:  What is it like?  What happens when I arrived there?</p><p>VICINO:  It is a turnkey four-star underground hotel/cruise ship.   It's everything you could imagine.  It's not just a survival shelter.  It  is truly a destination resort where you and your family and your children  would want to go to many times a year, perhaps, in the middle of the winter  where it' s 70 degrees inside this mountain year round.  So, you will be  very comfortable.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Do people come even if there's not a disaster by space (ph).   Can I come and hang out?</p><p>VICINO:  Anytime you want.  You can't permanently live there, but yes,  it's open 24/7 forever.  And so, you buy your space and you park your RV  there, whatever you're comfortable with, be it a 20-footer or 45-foot motor  home for a million dollar.  And it's a one-time charge, and you know, it's  yours, you're a co-owner of this what would be a billion dollar  replacement.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Does it cost me a million dollars?  I mean, I read that it's  $1,000 per lineal foot.  The average RV is about 30 feet, so that's  $30,000, and there's $1,500 charge per person, but I don't know what --  over what period of time.  How much would it cost me?  I have a husband and  two kids, what are you going to charge me?</p><p>VICINO:  Well, you're the perfect nuclear family.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes.  Thank you.</p><p>VICINO:  And, it would cost no extra charge for any of those family  members, the only thing you're paying for is the RV, itself, by the lineal  foot.  So, if you had a 30-foot RV, it's $30,000 and four children or four  people for food, that's a one year food supply.  It's another 6,000.  So,  for $36,000, you've got yourself an investment and a life assurance policy  or -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  How many people have signed up, so far?  How much money have  you made?</p><p>VICINO:  Well, not enough.  We've had 25,000 applications over the  last few years.  The primary problem has been the cost.  People can't  afford our other shelters where it's a per person rate as much as $50,000.   So, this -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  So, of those 25,000, how many people have locked it in?</p><p>VICINO:  On this new one, we just announced it last week in or  membership, and we've got a few hundred already signed up.  So, it's going  to happen very quickly.  We'll sell out.  This one will accommodate only  1,500 RVs or about 5,000 people, which I like to say is almost one in a  million people on Earth.</p><p>FRANCIS:  This one makes me nervous about this.  So, you're all the  way in Kansas.  I'm in New York, for example.  What kind of doomsday  disaster would come my way that I would have enough time to get there?</p><p>VICINO:  Oh, let's say a nuke went off in L.A. or in Washington or in  the Middle East, or let's say where about to see a major economic meltdown,  which could happen any day, as you know, or let's say the earth was  rumbling or an asteroid was on its way.  Things -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  I would have enough time to get there?</p><p>VICINO:  It's time to go.  And you may go and it may not happen, and  so, it's a false alarm just like the fireman goes to the -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes.</p><p>VICINO:  -- but at least you have somewhere to go versus the other  seven billion people on the planet that will have no solution, nowhere to  go, and they'll be scrambling.  And you don't want to be a part of that  mash (ph).  You want to go.  You want to have a safe haven.  You'll be  underground in what we call effectively a fortress.</p><p>FRANCIS:  OK.  Robert, thanks for coming on the show.  Interesting  idea.  Sounds like -- I'll be interested to see if it's a good business, if  you sell out, because -- I mean, there's a lot to be afraid of these days.   I don't know.  People want an insurance policy.  Thanks for coming on.   Keep us posted.</p><p>VICINO:  My pleasure.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Here is our MONEY question of the day.  How much would you  pay for a spot on world's biggest doomsday shelter?  Not surprisingly, I  got a lot of funny responses to this one, including Less Than Zero.  \"I'd  rather die than live in Kansas.\"  Come on!  Come on.  Kansas is a nice  place.  That was mean.</p><p>We want to hear from more of you.  You can like us on Facebook at  acebook.com/MelissaFrancisFox or follow me on Twitter @MelissaAFrancis.</p><p>All right.  Coming up on MONEY.  Oh, bless you, Kanye and Kim.  You  gave your baby a name even crazier than we thought possible.  And there's  developing news on what the middle name is, too.  We've got it all in  \"Spare Change.\"  You can never have too many insane celebrities.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  All right.  Welcome to \"Spare Change.\"  We are joined by  Jarrod Guy Randolph and we also have Hitha Prabhakar here.  Thanks to both  of you for coming on.  A little \"Spare Change\" fun on this Friday.</p><p>HITHA PRABHAKAR, RETAIL ANALYST:  Thanks for having us.</p><p>FRANCIS:  All right.  First, we are going to look at some birthdays at  work.  If it is not already bad enough that you're in the office for your  birthday, check this out.  This birthday card we saw, you literally just  check the box next to your name.  Can you imagine that, to show your love?   I mean, come on.  You can't even sign your name anymore.</p><p>What would you do if you got this card?  You check the box next to  your names.  You check, you know, best wishes, happy birthday, get hammered  on us.  I don't know.</p><p>PRABHAKAR:  I got to be honest with you, this is actually a nicer card  than I received from most of my family members for my birthday.</p><p>FRANCIS:  What?</p><p>PRABHAKAR:  Yes.</p><p>FRANCIS:  You need a new family.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  What is worse than this card, no card at all or do the cards  say does it have so many else's name in it?  I mean, what is worse than  this card?</p><p>PRABHAKAR:  Misspelled name.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Hitha is pretty straightforward.  Hitha Prabhakar, I don't  want to have to spell on television, but Hitha, I could do.</p><p>PRABHAKAR:  No one really sign their names either.  It was just kind  of -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  Really?</p><p>PRABHAKAR:  Yes.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Wow.</p><p>PRABHAKAR:  Yes.  So -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  You're going to be in therapy for that for a long time.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRANCIS:  Jarrod, what about you?</p><p>JARROD GUY RANDOLPH, CORE VICE PRESIDENT:  I don't think there was  follow-through on that card.  It was supposed to lead in the something  else, but I mean -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  Like what?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RANDOLPH:  If birthday cards look like that, I can only imagine what  the annual holiday bonus looks like.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes.</p><p>RANDOLPH:  So, for me, I'd be a little upset if my co-workers gave  that to me.</p><p>FRANCIS:  OK.  So, this is a new case for your iPhone.  It doubles as  a stun gun to prevent any accidental discharge.  Yes, I would hope.  Users  have to flip two switches before activating the gun.  The case sells for  140 bucks.  And the co-founder says sales could exceed a million dollars  this year.</p><p>Is this just a must have or is it a lawsuit waiting to happen?  I'm  wondering, what happens when you accidentally but dial with your iPhone.   That's a stun gun (ph).  That would be quite a shock.</p><p>PRABHAKAR:  Not only is it a lawsuit waiting to happen, it's a  disaster waiting to happen.  I mean, I can't tell you how many times I get  misdialed phones from different people.  I misdial (ph) phone.  Also, if  you're getting attacked, why would you want to on latch (ph) something and  then security check this.  I mean, wouldn't you want to just kind of go for  it and try to protect yourself?</p><p>RANDOLPH:  I see the value on this product.</p><p>FRANCIS:  You do?</p><p>RANDOLPH:  This will be even (ph) my secret weapon.  You will buy a  $50 million apartment.  I'm going to start using this with my client.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>RANDOLPH:  I mean, I don't see why not.  If this actually became an  approved Apple accessory.  So -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  What?  Really?</p><p>RANDOLPH:  It's kind of amazing.</p><p>FRANCIS:  There should be a breathalyzer attached to it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RANDOLPH:  They're going to come up with that.</p><p>PRABHAKAR:  Right.</p><p>RANDOLPH:  And if you go on the website, the pink ones are the ones  that have sold out first.  I'm just waiting for the camouflage.</p><p>FRANCIS:  How much is the cost?  Does anybody know?</p><p>RANDOLPH:  I think it's about $140.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Wow!  That's amazing.  Well, there's a Christmas gift.</p><p>All right.  So, the big baby news of the week, a bizarre name given.   Reality princess, Kim Kardashian and rapper baby daddy, Kanye West, have  chosen the name North, North, for their baby girl.  Think about that for a  second.  The baby's name is Northwest, no middle name.  I mean, they're  running this child's life or they giving it direction.</p><p>PRABHAKAR:  All right.  We can safely assume that it's not a fan of  One Direction, right, the band?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRANCIS:  OK.  All right.  I like that.  That was good.  Jarrod, what  do you think about this?</p><p>RANDOLPH:  The middle name should be Southeast.  So, it's north,  south, east, west.  I mean, I actually can't believe we're talking about  this right now.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>RANDOLPH:  But think about it, there were other names that could have  come up with.  Lampshade, soda can.  I mean, they could have named it  anything.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Seven, Pepsi.  I don't know.  All those -- </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRANCIS:  One of the worst names ever.</p><p>PRABHAKAR:  I like the east and west.  Wasn't east and west -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  And we wrap up the week.  Our own Tom Sullivan has some  doubts about the direction of our economy.  Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TOM SULLIVAN, FOX BUSINESS:  Something isn't right about the economy.   I'm trying to be positive, and yes, the economy has expanded every quarter  going back to 2009.  But it's consistently weak growth.  The job market,  it's also improving, but not enough to soak up all of the new people that  are coming into the job market, the young grads and immigrants.  And  housing, it seems to be doing better.  In fact, in some places, there's  another price bubble growing.</p><p>But, it's because there are two few homes for sale and that's largely  because whopping (ph) number, 44 percent of homeowners are either under  water or they don't have enough equity to pay a realtor to sell their home,  so they sit.  And it's the same number, 44 percent of people who told CNN  in a poll this week that they are worse off economically now than compared  to just one year ago.</p><p>The huge portion of the country is still hurting.  The markets are  nervous about the fed slowing down its artificial pumping of the economy.   I get that, but even though I don't like what the fed is done, I don't see  the fed making any big changes, and I don't see this fragile economy  jumping out of its sick bed anytime soon.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FRANCIS:  Well, that's true.  Thanks, Tom.  Be sure to watch \"The Tom  Sullivan Show\" this weekend.  You can catch it at 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m.  on Saturday, and on Sunday at 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m.  Happy Friday,  everyone.  Thanks to both of you for joining us.  Have a great weekend.   I'll see you back here on Monday.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2013 Fox News Network, LLC.

With the fed making a financial mess, how to prepare with what is coming next.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus, surviving the apocalypse in style. A California developer is opening the world's largest doomsday shelter and resort. Where do I make my reservation? The man behind it joins us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And who lost \"Money\" today? One of America's top CEO, it is so much money, it would make John B. Rockefeller cry. Stay tuned to find out who it is.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Because even when they say t is not, it is always about \"Money.\"</p><p>It is the end of a very tumultuous week on Wall Street and it is time for some serious crisis management for the fed. So, you are entering the spin zone. <person><nameText>Ben Bernanke </nameText></person>is getting slam for statements this week about the possibility of easing off the bond buying program which came just two days of the fed chairman was basically fired on <person><nameText>the Charlie Rose show. </nameText></person>I don't know if you saw this, a lot of moving pieces but we want you to know what you have to do right now to protect yourself in the midst of all of it.</p><p>Joining me now is Barron's senior editor, Jack Hough and Pat Howell, CEO of Howell financial group. Welcome back to the show.</p><p>Jack, let me start with you. Have the wheels come off the fed here? I mean, it has been quite a week for those guys.</p><p>JACK HOUGH, SENIOR EDITOR, BARRON: I'm not sure what the dissent is about. I mean, are we supposed to keep interest rates near zero forever? I mean, at this point, you are trading off this much improvement in the economy versus this much distortion of every kind of asset class investors have a choice of. It is time, isn't it?</p><p>FRANCIS: It is time. But that is not really what we're talking about. I mean, what we are talking about is sort of the chaos that ensued this week. For example, I mean, let me play you the sound bite. President Obama basically fired <person><nameText>Ben Bernanke </nameText></person>in <person><nameText>Charlie Rose. </nameText></person>And we will get both your reactions on the other side. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think <person><nameText>Ben Bernanke </nameText></person>has done an outstanding job. <person><nameText>Ben Bernanke </nameText></person>is a little bit like Bob Mueller, the head of the FBI where he has already stayed a lot longer than he wanted or he was supposed to. But, I think --</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE, </nameText></person>TV HOST: But if he wanted to be reappointed, you would reappoint him?</p><p>OBAMA: He has been outstanding partner along with the White House.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FRANCIS: What? I mean, that is not really a ringing endorsement. Pat, that is like somebody saying, you know, how is your husband? You are like, well, he has been outstanding partner until now.</p><p>PATRICIA POWELL, CEO, POWELL FINANCIAL GROUP: Anybody can be a loose cannon, it is just odd it is the president of the United States.</p><p>FRANCIS: Is he a loose cannon or was that on purpose? I mean, don't know. There is a lot of negativity there.</p><p>POWELL: He is making some telegraphing things too. He is not going to Jackson hole, you know, that was a little odd. I mean, he has been telegraphing things. And a lot of people say that he is tired, this has been exhausting thing, and it was not really -- this is now what he had in mind when he became chairman of the fed.</p><p>HOUGH: He was looking at his shoes when he said that, right?</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>HOUGH: I'm not a body language expert, but that says stayed.</p><p>FRANCIS: He stayed a lot longer than he was supposed to or he wanted to. I mean, that is pretty harsh. So then, it is not surprising that <person><nameText>Ben Bernanke </nameText></person>comes out, rocks the boat a bit. I mean, they are all over the place. You have James Bullard, Ben coming out today saying, well maybe, you know, we are going t have more combination down the road if we need it. Basically, going against everything that <person><nameText>Ben Bernanke </nameText></person>said, which is sort of all over the map. Where does that leave investors?</p><p>HOUGH: It is unusual to see a special press release like that with a sort of dissenting view. And I think it is already a tumultuous time for the market. I don't think there's any kind of financial Armageddon. I mean, where people are getting crazy about losing a few percent in the stock market. Keep in mind the market is double in nearly, you know, in about four years, and treasury rates are up (INAUDIBLE), were 2.5 percent for the average over the past 50 years, it is over six percent. So we don't have skyrocketing interest rates something like that.</p><p>FRANCIS: It says that the whole point is we need these guys. I mean, they are doing -- they have done policy that we have never seen before in our lives. So, we need them to dismount in the cleanest way possible her and get out of it. So far just this week it has been utter chaos.</p><p>My favorite comment because the twitter universe and online to block its fear was alive, with all of these different machination during the week. I love Lawrence McDonald tweeted, somebody that a lot of us follow, he is on TV all the time. He said job opening, portfolio manager need for $3.5 trillion, 70-tons leverage Hedge Fund unlimited borrow, no marked market, see Federal Reserve.</p><p>Does not inspire confidence? I mean, everybody is joking about what is going on. It does tell you don't have a lot of confidence of what is going on.</p><p>POWELL: Well, nobody here has confidence because we don't know how this is going to be around. But, it is so much better that they are telling us this stuff. We don't want to invest blindly. We don't want to have another secret.</p><p>FRANCIS: They telling us, what though? They are telling us all different things. I mean, Bullard says we could ease more. <person><nameText>Ben Bernanke </nameText></person>says we are getting out, President Obama says he is fired, telling us what?</p><p>POWELL: Well, <person><nameText>Bernanke </nameText></person>started, I think, on the 22nd of May by giving us the first inkling that there thinking about chasing, and I think in this particular -- the comments this week really dealt with the fact that we are creating a plan to taper. This is a very good thing. It is so much better to have a plan than to be shooting from the hips which was not good.</p><p>FRANCIS: So, how do we all set ourselves up for this because this is the take away that we want for our audience here? It means that interest rates are going up, maybe, my thought is give anything interest-rate sensitive whether it is an adjustable mortgage or it is credit card rates you want to keep an eye on that, maybe it is a great time in real estate to transact whether you are a buyer or a seller. I mean, if you are a buyer, this is probably as good as the rates are going to be. If you are seller, you may want to transact because it is the most money that a buyer is going to have. What do you think?</p><p>POWELL: Buyers may start rushing in because they have been sitting back waiting to see what is going to happen, now they saw a real choice. If interest rates go up, every point that goes up they lose purchasing power or borrowing power. So, it can push the real estate market, actually, up in the short run.</p><p>FRANCIS: In the short run. In the long run, I mean, Jack, would you agree with that? In the long run, it is bad for the real estate market because higher interest rates make it tougher.</p><p>HOUGH: I'm on sure there is anyone here is on the fence right now, that waiting for a little less of the mortgage rate before they buy, I mean, that ship has sailed. But I think in terms of investors right now, you hold onto some extra cash because there's a possibility both stocks and bonds are going to be weak at the same time. We don't a lynch how an interesting piece of research what they said. Right now, inflations is actually coming down and interest rates are going up, which is a rarity. It happened in 1994, at that time tech stocks outperformed, utilities got hurt, they were recommending the same thing right now.</p><p>FRANCIS: Interesting point of view.</p><p>All right, thanks to both of you. Good stuff.</p><p>HOUGH: Thank you.</p><p>FRANCIS: Time now for today's fuel gauge report. China and Russia signing $270 billion oil deal. It is one of the biggest in history. Rosneft, Russian's state owned oil company will double supplies to China. It could reach up to 900,000 barrels per day. That is according to Vladimir Putin. The 25 year deal makes chin China the biggest customer for Russian oil.</p><p>U.S. gasoline demand for May fell to a 13 year low. That is according to the American Petroleum Institute. Demand slipped by 3.3 percent to about 8.7 million barrels per day.</p><p>And Oil futures is getting smacked for a second session, a stronger U.S. dollar largely fueling oil decline. It posted its biggest two-day drop in a year losing about 4.5 percent. Crude settled at $93.69 a barrel. Big move on the week.</p><p>All right, up next, <person><nameText>Michael Dell </nameText></person>versus Carl Icahn, it is the face-off only the power of money could create. We are going to tell you how it is turning personal now.</p><p>Plus, the reason the government has gotten so good at spying on you is because it is coaching top talent from Silicon Valley. Maybe you didn't know that. We got details on the stunning revelation in the NSA scandal.</p><p>More \"Money\" coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS: The battle between two Wall Street titans is getting bigger and personal, by the way. <person><nameText>Michael Dell </nameText></person>now launching a personal pitch to buy out his ubiquitous company, and pushed Icahn's offer out of the way, but will it deliver or well Icahn when out? It is all about the power of \"Money.\"</p><p>Here to weigh in is \"Wall Street Journal\" business editor, Dennis Berman and Jonas Max Ferris at MaxFunds.com.</p><p>Great to have you both on the show.</p><p>Dennis, let me start with you. This is battle of the titans. I mean, these are two enormous egos out there, so how do you size of the whole think?</p><p>DENNIS BERMAN, BUSINESS EDITOR, WALL STREET JOURNAL: I see Dell winning, Icahn losing.</p><p>FRANCIS: Really? How come?</p><p>BERMAN: Simple reason. The best chance for Dell to beaten was a potential rival bid from another private equity firm. Carl Icahn, at this point, he could do a lot of great noise and smoke and a lot of activity, but when it comes down to it the shareholder will have to say that he wants to take this offer or do we not? And right now, given the market where they are, they are probably going to take the offer of $14 per share.</p><p>FRANCIS: So Jonas, what do you think? I mean, his basically saying Silver Lake wins the day because, of course, that too smacky (ph) <person><nameText>Michael Dell?</nameText></person></p><p>JONAS MAX FERRIS, MARKET WATCHER, MAXFUNDS.COM: Because I think people would rather side with the guy who started the company in his dorm room then some Wall Street raider. I just don't think that that is -- that guy is going to fix it.</p><p>FRANCIS: The guy has started the company in his dorm room, but has kind of driven it into the ground, right?</p><p>FERRIS: Well, by that logic every tech CEO who isn't Apple or Samsung should be fired because they all missed the smart phone revolution. Go down the line, everybody screwed up. And the whole PC, this has come on land. That was original cornerstone of the business was assembling PC box. That is a dying business and it is easy to say, he missed the smart phone and pad revolution, yes, it is good. But everybody didn't because it is really hard to compete.</p><p>FRANCIS: I don't know. I mean, Dennis, right here you have his whole plan, <person><nameText>Michael Dell's </nameText></person>whole plan right here, for how he will turn the company around. And we were talking about this is the commercial break is that if he has this brilliance, why hasn't he done it already, why doesn't he do it while the company is public? I mean, just do it, you know. Why do you have to take (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>BERMAN: I think you make a really good point. I agree with you. And, if you read this and it doesn't take long because he doesn't write very much here you will be relatively uninspired by what with <person><nameText>Michael dell </nameText></person>has to say. You will be relatively uninspired by what <person><nameText>Michael Dell </nameText></person>has to say. It is what I would call problem. It is generic. It does not say anything.</p><p>But, whether he says anything here or not or whether Carl Icahn is the right person to be a part of dell, really, it doesn't matter is there's only one thing that matters, to shareholders want to accept the price for dell right now? There are no offers being the price of the stock is trading below the $14 offer. It the market that telling us that will probably be accepted. Although, it may not be easy at the moment.</p><p>FRANCIS: Jonas, if you are a shareholder -- but, are you, by the way?</p><p>FERRIS: We all own it through mutual funds indirectly. Directly, don't bow and very few people only this directly. It is not growth stock getting more and the public only owns like Apple directly users all along by --.</p><p>FRANCIS: So, would say, give me the $14 let me the hell out of the stock? So, I can just forget about Dell and go off.</p><p>FERRIS: Because I think Icahn is playing an a head start for proxy movie, who with all the movie with the executives try to pretend the company was worthless so they can buy the stock at a cheap price and then by putting the bad CEO in. That was the movie. I think that is what the spin is here, the Dell rule is down talking the stock so he could take it private.</p><p>FRANCIS: So you think it has more value than Roe (ph).</p><p>FERRIS: I do think so.</p><p>FRANCIS: Really? Why, what is so valuable?</p><p>FERRIS: Well, it is a long shot, but without the PC business, I think there is still an angle to be some sort of IBM asks more, you know, selling silver type in software company. It is not a huge growth opportunity, but I think there is something there that is more valuable than the current share price. That is a better price for a lot of non-Apple, Samsung companies today.</p><p>FRANCIS: What do you think, Dennis? Is that possible?</p><p>BERMAN: It is certainly possible. And this is that the fundamental complex. The real tension inside this management by IPOs, what does the guy at the top of the ladder know that I don't know that he shares with us? And should I trust him, or should I not?</p><p>Here is another great example. J. Crew, great company. We all know that company. It went private after the CEO basically forced and offer down his owned shareholder's growth. So, Jonas makes a fair point about the conflicts inherent in that those dynamics. But again, as it stands now, roughly 15 percent or so of shares are a lied against BBO (ph).</p><p>FRANCIS: But wait, but other than him knowing something we all don't, what would be his other reason for wanting to take it private?</p><p>FERRIS: I would say vanity. It is his business. He has got his name on it. It is hard to walk away. You don't want it to die. It is called Dell. It is not Microsoft, you know. It holds on Bill Gates' software. So, it is like there's a certain element where you want it to succeed.</p><p>FRANCIS: So, it is either vanity or he knows something we don't? Real quick before we go, what is your bet, vanity or he knows something we don't?</p><p>FERRIS: I think it is still worth more than it is. I do think all these tycoons, these are old, are going to go private at some point because --.</p><p>FRANCIS: So, he knows something we don't. That's how I'm going to interpret that.</p><p>Dennis, what do you think, vanity or he know something we don't?</p><p>BERMAN: I say the answer is both. But, in the end --</p><p>FRANCIS: How can it be both? Pick one.</p><p>BERMAN: Well, he is both vain and he knows something that we don't. Those can both motivations. In the end, the shareholders are going to bite because --.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS: OK. Guys, you are fantastic, thank you.</p><p>BERMAN: Thank you.</p><p>FRANCIS: Coming up on \"Money,\" if you knew facebook former chief security officer but feel like he has dropped off the radar, here is why. He is now working for the NSA and he is not alone. We will tell you how Silicon Valley is getting help to the government's prying eyes.</p><p>Plus, former Enron CEO, Jeff Skilling, hits 10 years, why he stop his prison sentence? And it could be a dream come true for white-collar criminals.</p><p>Stay right where you are and find out why.</p><p>Do you ever have too much \"Money\"?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS: Weather it is on Wall Street or Main Street, here is to make \"Money\" today.</p><p>Actually, I can start with who made money. Larry Ellison, the CEO of Oracle, lost so much money I have to do that one first. Oracle's latest earnings were a big disappointment on Wall Street. And as a result, the shares plunged more than nine percent today. So Larry Ellison owns 1.1 billion shares of Oracle. That means he lost $3.4 billion today, $3.4 billion. I had to put that in perspective. Ellison bought the whole island of Lanai last year for $300 million. So, he lost the equivalent of 11 Hawaiian Islands today.</p><p>Meanwhile, trying to make \"Money\" today, Starbucks, it is raising drink cause for first time in almost two years. The average price hike will be about one percent. Starbucks blames rising rent and labor cost for the increase.</p><p>And the Miami heat championship win proving a ratings gold mine for ABC. Nearly 18 percent of you at home watched game seven last night. That is according to Nielsen. It is the second highest rating for an NBA game in 11 years, a sign of the times and congratulations.</p><p>So, if you have been following the NSA spy scandal you may wonder how tight the government really is with big tech companies like facebook, for example. Well, a shocking report reveal that actually left to go work for the NSA back in 2010 and evidently, he is not the only big tech exec that's made the move from Silicon Valley to government spy agency.</p><p>That brings up a lot of questions and concerns, namely what kinds of info are these ex-tech employees bringing to their new job. With me on this frightening development is managing director of TechnoBuffalo, Roy Choi.</p><p>Welcome back to the show, Roy.</p><p>ROY CHOI, MANAGING DIRECTOR, TECHNOBUFFALO: Thank you.</p><p>FRANCIS: I mean, should we be afraid of this? I mean, this is a guy who was in charge of protecting our own private personal information on facebook and he eventually took the knowledge and the keys of the kingdom and went to go work for an agency that is now spying on us.</p><p>CHOI: I think we have to assume that, you know, employees as tech companies like facebook, Google, Skype, they have this information and they're going to go somewhere and may be to the NSA and feed that.</p><p>FRANCIS: So, you are basically saying, we have to assume that everything we put online could eventually be handed over to people who are spying on us? And you just have to be satisfied with that?</p><p>CHOI: Yes. They have policies in place, but when you turn into reality you will see that information isn't always word is supposed to be. We will claim it is 100 percent locks down, but how many times have we seen leaks weathered his credit card information or online information leaks either accidentally or a hole in the security software or malicious hackers going in and getting this information.</p><p>So, I can't say that people are always going to be secure. And you know, I think people are under the assumption when I post something online, it is going to be there for public consumption. But you know, it is beyond that, it is the metadata, it is the stuff you don't necessarily see.</p><p>FRANCIS: What will be his motivation for leaving a place like facebook? You have to imagine that at the level he was, he was making a lot of money and owned a lot of stock and did really well. Why would you leave and go and work for the government?</p><p>CHOI: Who knows? Maybe it is a greater challenge. Maybe, you know, facebook has been a huge supporter of helping fight crime a couple of years ago. And I am not saying this particular security official, but the most recent security official actually implemented a program where they could actually search through content, so there was anything that is a sexual predator was out there and putting in language that would be a little worry some for law enforcement, they would openly give that information out. And you know, they have actually stated their policy is as long as there is a court order or any type of subpoena they would hand that information freely in order to protect users. And at that point, they were under a lot of pressure to help especially with lots of sexual predators lurking on facebook.</p><p>FRANCIS: That's one thing. But you know, when I have asked that question in the past of hackers and the like, why would you go from the private sector where you are making a lot of money to work for the NSA or any government agency for a lot less. They say that they are allowed to do things when you're working for the NSA that you're not allowed to do in regular life, and you are allowed to spy in a way that you can't do for a private company. So you combine sort of that ability and ambition with someone who knows the intimate ins and outs of a facebook or a Google and you get a very powerful government who could spy on us even more than we ever imagined. Your thoughts on that?</p><p>CHOI: Definitely. And I think, when we look at, in terms of national security, in terms of our own security, privately, you are going to see the internet as like the next forum, whether that is in a proactive manner or a reactive manner. So, for someone to leave from Silicon Valley, the constraints of, you know, regulations and whatever else, you know, maybe you go to the NSA, maybe you go to another government agency, but you do get that level of freedom to go out and use your talents to make your mark.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p>Roy, thank you so much for coming on the show. Appreciate your time.</p><p>CHOI: Thank you. Appreciate it.</p><p>FRANCIS: Up next on \"Money,\" we are going to Jeffrey Skilling. He committed one of the worst acts of corporate fraud in U.S. history. Well, the former Enron CEO is now getting out of prison 10 years ahead of schedule. We are going to explain why this is music to the ears of white- collar criminals everywhere.</p><p>Plus, a bipartisan group of senators wants to block U.S. military funding for Syrian rebels. You may like the sound of that, but will we have to spend even more if we don't act now? One of the many top experts breaks down the numbers for us.</p><p>Piles of \"money\" coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MELISSA FRANCIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: New developments today in the case of convicted white-collar felon, Jeffrey Skilling. The former Enron CEO has served six and half years of a 24-year sentence, so far, for bringing down the world's largest energy trader. It was one of the worst acts of corporate fraud in U.S. history.</p><p>But today, his sentence was sliced by 10 years. Meaning, now, he's going to be out in just seven and a half years instead of 17 1/2 years from now. So, what does his short and sentence mean for white-collar criminals? Here with the dish is our go to lawyer, Arthur Aidala.</p><p>ARTHUR AIDALA, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST: Dish?</p><p>FRANCIS: Dish. Yes.</p><p>AIDALA: Is that a legal term?</p><p>FRANCIS: It is. You didn't know that, because you're a lawyer. You should know.</p><p>AIDALA: -- any Italian food, so I don't know what the dishes (ph) are about.</p><p>FRANCIS: What is the deal?</p><p>AIDALA: The deal here is this. He appeals -- he gets convicted, gets this huge sentence --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS: I mean, he didn't kill anyone.</p><p>AIDALA: He didn't kill anyone, but let me double check my map here. $60 billion in Enron stock was rendered worthless. $2 billion in employee pension were rented worthless. It's a lot of guilt (ph).</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p>AIDALA: That's a lot of money going on there. So -- and more importantly that a lot of money, it's a lot of people who got affected. I mean, lives were ruined, lives were destroyed. So, he gets this really rough sentence. He -- (INAUDIBLE) who supposed to go get sentenced and get wiped out, he dies, so that wipes out his conviction. And, he appeals all the way up to the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court basing the rules in his favor saying one of the ways -- one of the convictions against him was improper.</p><p>They go to a lower court about it. Should there be a new trial? Should there be a new trial? The bottom line is, they say that he was sentenced to nine years too many, and for them not to re-appeal, because he could have, the government said look --</p><p>FRANCIS: Nine years too many in which -- in what then? Why?</p><p>AIDALA: Because the guideline calculations, which is the very complicated way.</p><p>FRANCIS: They did the bath rock (ph).</p><p>AIDALA: Well, they applied things the wrong way. In federal court unlike state court, to figure someone's sentence, you need like a small calculus degree. It's crazy. And basically, in court, the judges said, you did this the wrong way, you came about this the wrong way, therefore, there's at least nine years that he's got tacked on that shouldn't be tacked on.</p><p>FRANCIS: So, are white-collar criminals everywhere rejoining because the scuttlebutt on this all week long has been that the sentences for financial crimes up late. I mean, if you look at (INAUDIBLE). I mean, all of this has been very stiff.</p><p>AIDALA: Well, what -- right.</p><p>FRANCIS: And is this the beginning of a reduction in the sentences for financial crisis, which as you said, ruined a lot of lives --</p><p>AIDALA: A lot of lives.</p><p>FRANCIS: -- but in many cases are longer than murder convictions.</p><p>AIDALA: Correct. But literally, like a murder conviction, you're really affecting like one person and one family. This affected --</p><p>FRANCIS: Right. But they're dead as opposed to I don't have money. I mean, we should rather be alive --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>AIDALA: But there are these charts in the federal law that when you commit a crime, you start off at a very -- a below base level which is like a non-jail sentence. And then depending on how much money was stolen or how much fraud or how much tax evasion, that's what you come up with the numbers. So, if it's just a minimal amount like 100 million, you're at one level.</p><p>FRANCIS: Very little. Yes.</p><p>AIDALA: When it's 60 billion, you're at the highest level. You're literally off the charts. The United State Supreme Court did say that the way they convicted him under this honest services fraud law, which is a very complicated thing to explain, was not done properly. So, yes, a door has been opened to criminal defendants to tell the government, you need to prosecute us in this way, not in that way. And it may have lightened the load on them. But, you know --</p><p>FRANCIS: Sounds like you don't think the original 24 was that unfair (ph), though.</p><p>AIDALA: I mean, they did some bad stuff. They hurt a lot of people. They hurt a lot of retired people who are like -- I mean, you go from thinking like, going to bed, thinking I have a half a million dollars in the bank and I'm 80 years old to I have nothing in the bank and I'm 80 years old.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p>AIDALA: Hello!</p><p>FRANCIS: Arthur, thank you so much.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS: You did a great job. There's smoke coming out of your ears.</p><p>AIDALA: I learn about the dish. I dished it. I knew about the dish. Thank you, folks.</p><p>FRANCIS: Turning now to a much more serious topic, the unsettling situation in Syria. All eyes are on the country's reports (ph) on chemical weapons use and see frightening images of escalating violence. Now, some Lawmakers here at home are trying to block any U.S. funding to armed rebels.</p><p>Of course, we know the story is about a lot more than money. There's an enormous human toll, but our show is called MONEY, so we're going to focus on that angle. We're going to take a closer look at whether or not it would actually cost us more to get involved now or not.</p><p>Joining us now with his take is Zuhdi Jasser, president of the American Islamic Forum for Democracy. Always nice to have you, Zuhdi.</p><p>ZUHDI JASSER, AMERICAN ISLAMIC FORUM FOR DEMOCRACY: Thanks, Melissa. It's great to be with you.</p><p>FRANCIS: You know, we're trying to break down the cost. As we said, huge human toll, you know, for humanitarian reasons you may or may not want to get involved, but looking at just the dollar part of it, what is the cost of doing nothing at this point?</p><p>JASSER: Well, we have two and half years, Melissa, of the revolution to know what that cost is. And just some numbers from Tel Aviv University, it looks like in Jordan, it costs $35 per refugee just to house them per year. So, you're looking right now at three to four million refugees that have been displaced in Syria.</p><p>FRANCIS: Who's paying for that?</p><p>JASSER: That's the thing. Jordan is paying for some of it, but we're paying a lot of it. We've already paid over half a billion dollars through USAID into the region, and it's looking like the refugees are going to reach six million by the end of the year, and our money is into it.</p><p>It's going to be in the billions whether we do, you know, nothing militarily or not, it's going to be -- it's a part of the region that if we're going to continue to try to maintain stability, the humanitarian aid is not only the compassionate thing to do, it has to be done militarily strategically or otherwise the entire region will implode with sectarian violence and our ally in the region. Israel will certainly be threatened.</p><p>FRANCIS: If we do something, that is incredibly expensive, already looking at the estimates. A no-fly zone in the first 10 days alone would cost $1.4 billion. And it expands from there, right?</p><p>JASSER: Oh, absolutely. And you know, the no-fly zone -- yes, Libya was a bit cheaper, but they're looking -- this is more like Iraq. Syria has a more sophisticated military that would need to be taken out, and somewhere of 50 to 100 million a day, they say. But still, I think the cost and a lot of experts have said this the cost are going to be less, as Michael O'Hanlon (ph) from Brookings said, it's a bargain if we can end this war earlier.</p><p>Because look, two and half years have proven this war is going nowhere. Assad maybe winning as far as militarily, but the attrition from the Syrian army continues. It's only how long, how many months or years when Assad will finally fall. And if we want to have a play in the region and be involved in the right side of history and help move them towards, we defeat Assad first as the strategy and second defeat al Qaeda.</p><p>If we want to play a role in that, we have to be on the right side of history to fight against the Iran, fight against Hezbollah, et cetera. Not with troops.</p><p>FRANCIS: -- on the right side of history and some are arguing that it's too late for that. That early on, we could have been fighting against Hezbollah and Assad. And when we originally saw pictures of children being slaughtered, that was the time to get involved, but we didn't. And now, at this point, al Qaeda and extremists have gotten involved.</p><p>On the other side, and it's become now al Qaeda versus Hezbollah, which isn't our fight, neither of those folks are our friends, and we should just stay out of it. That is one of the theories that's out there. I'll give you the last word on why you don't agree with that, if you don't.</p><p>JASSER: Well, that calculus of characterizing the opposition of al Qaeda is just not correct. The Syrian population has become more radicalized and they're becoming more, you know, chaotic and committing atrocities, but that's because we've done nothing. If we come to the side of helping the millions -- there's only tens of thousands of al Qaeda -- the millions of Syrians in this opposition, we will help defeat the ultimate source of the radicalization which is Assad.</p><p>And remember, Hezbollah, the forms of terror in the Middle East is Iran. So, those on my (ph) conservative side that believe that doing nothing will allow al Qaeda to die, actually, al Qaeda is thriving, Hezbollah is thriving. Terror will thrive without our involvement. So, the question is, which side has less terror? I believe doing something would.</p><p>FRANCIS: Zuhdi Jasser, thank you so much for your thoughts tonight. We always appreciate it.</p><p>JASSER: Thank you. Appreciate it.</p><p>FRANCIS: We have some breaking news right now on Facebook. Let's go to Fox Business' Jo Ling Kent with the latest. Jo Ling, what do you have?</p><p>JO LING KENT, FOX BUSINESS: Melissa, Facebook is confirming on their website that a security breach has exposed six million e-mail addresses and telephone numbers. And let me tell you a little bit more of what they're saying on the website.</p><p>They found, they said, through their white hat security researching program that they use that, quote, \"that may have allowed some of a person's contact information e-mail or phone number to be accessed by people who either had some contact information about the person or some connection to that person.\"</p><p>So, they're saying six million e-mail addresses and telephone numbers were shared, but Facebook was also very quick to note in its statement that no other types of personal or financial information were included and only people on Facebook, not developers or advertisers, had access to this information.</p><p>So, certainly, a very alarming security breach has happened at Facebook, and we'll continue to bring you more a little bit later, Melissa.</p><p>FRANCIS: Wow. Jo Ling, thanks so much.</p><p>All right. Coming up on MONEY, surviving the end of the world sounds tough. Indoor pool, a bowling alley, a golf, maybe it wouldn't be that bad. A California developer is opening the world's largest doomsday shelter. This will be an underground resort. It's fabulous. He's taking reservations. He joins us with all the details, because at the end of the day, the end of the world, it's all about MONEY.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS: Talk about surviving in style. Vivos Survival Shelter and Resort is the chicest doomsday shelter out there. For a few thousand bucks, you and yours (ph) can be safe from any number of impending disasters. Cozily nestled 100 feet below in Atchison Kansas, and you can live in your shelter in your very own RV -- wow! -- for up to a year. There is big money to be made in the bunker business.</p><p>Joining me now is Robert Vicino. He is founder and CEO of Vivos Group and the owner of the fabulous shelter. Thank you so much for coming on.</p><p>ROBERT VICINO, VIVOS GROUP FOUNDER AND CEO: It's my honor.</p><p>FRANCIS: I understand that this is a space that the army previously used. They auctioned it off. And what gave you the idea to make it into a doomsday shelter?</p><p>VICINO: Well, we've been in the shelter business for the last five years building Vivos shelters around the world. And, typically, whenever a government shelter or facility comes up, we try to buy it and then retrofitted and convert it into a modern day blast shelter. This one was auctioned by the GSA and we jumped on it.</p><p>FRANCIS: What is it like? What happens when I arrived there?</p><p>VICINO: It is a turnkey four-star underground hotel/cruise ship. It's everything you could imagine. It's not just a survival shelter. It is truly a destination resort where you and your family and your children would want to go to many times a year, perhaps, in the middle of the winter where it' s 70 degrees inside this mountain year round. So, you will be very comfortable.</p><p>FRANCIS: Do people come even if there's not a disaster by space (ph). Can I come and hang out?</p><p>VICINO: Anytime you want. You can't permanently live there, but yes, it's open 24/7 forever. And so, you buy your space and you park your RV there, whatever you're comfortable with, be it a 20-footer or 45-foot motor home for a million dollar. And it's a one-time charge, and you know, it's yours, you're a co-owner of this what would be a billion dollar replacement.</p><p>FRANCIS: Does it cost me a million dollars? I mean, I read that it's $1,000 per lineal foot. The average RV is about 30 feet, so that's $30,000, and there's $1,500 charge per person, but I don't know what -- over what period of time. How much would it cost me? I have a husband and two kids, what are you going to charge me?</p><p>VICINO: Well, you're the perfect nuclear family.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes. Thank you.</p><p>VICINO: And, it would cost no extra charge for any of those family members, the only thing you're paying for is the RV, itself, by the lineal foot. So, if you had a 30-foot RV, it's $30,000 and four children or four people for food, that's a one year food supply. It's another 6,000. So, for $36,000, you've got yourself an investment and a life assurance policy or --</p><p>FRANCIS: How many people have signed up, so far? How much money have you made?</p><p>VICINO: Well, not enough. We've had 25,000 applications over the last few years. The primary problem has been the cost. People can't afford our other shelters where it's a per person rate as much as $50,000. So, this --</p><p>FRANCIS: So, of those 25,000, how many people have locked it in?</p><p>VICINO: On this new one, we just announced it last week in or membership, and we've got a few hundred already signed up. So, it's going to happen very quickly. We'll sell out. This one will accommodate only 1,500 RVs or about 5,000 people, which I like to say is almost one in a million people on Earth.</p><p>FRANCIS: This one makes me nervous about this. So, you're all the way in Kansas. I'm in New York, for example. What kind of doomsday disaster would come my way that I would have enough time to get there?</p><p>VICINO: Oh, let's say a nuke went off in L.A. or in Washington or in the Middle East, or let's say where about to see a major economic meltdown, which could happen any day, as you know, or let's say the earth was rumbling or an asteroid was on its way. Things --</p><p>FRANCIS: I would have enough time to get there?</p><p>VICINO: It's time to go. And you may go and it may not happen, and so, it's a false alarm just like the fireman goes to the --</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p>VICINO: -- but at least you have somewhere to go versus the other seven billion people on the planet that will have no solution, nowhere to go, and they'll be scrambling. And you don't want to be a part of that mash (ph). You want to go. You want to have a safe haven. You'll be underground in what we call effectively a fortress.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK. Robert, thanks for coming on the show. Interesting idea. Sounds like -- I'll be interested to see if it's a good business, if you sell out, because -- I mean, there's a lot to be afraid of these days. I don't know. People want an insurance policy. Thanks for coming on. Keep us posted.</p><p>VICINO: My pleasure.</p><p>FRANCIS: Here is our MONEY question of the day. How much would you pay for a spot on world's biggest doomsday shelter? Not surprisingly, I got a lot of funny responses to this one, including Less Than Zero. \"I'd rather die than live in Kansas.\" Come on! Come on. Kansas is a nice place. That was mean.</p><p>We want to hear from more of you. You can like us on Facebook at acebook.com/MelissaFrancisFox or follow me on Twitter @MelissaAFrancis.</p><p>All right. Coming up on MONEY. Oh, bless you, Kanye and Kim. You gave your baby a name even crazier than we thought possible. And there's developing news on what the middle name is, too. We've got it all in \"Spare Change.\" You can never have too many insane celebrities.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS: All right. Welcome to \"Spare Change.\" We are joined by Jarrod Guy Randolph and we also have Hitha Prabhakar here. Thanks to both of you for coming on. A little \"Spare Change\" fun on this Friday.</p><p>HITHA PRABHAKAR, RETAIL ANALYST: Thanks for having us.</p><p>FRANCIS: All right. First, we are going to look at some birthdays at work. If it is not already bad enough that you're in the office for your birthday, check this out. This birthday card we saw, you literally just check the box next to your name. Can you imagine that, to show your love? I mean, come on. You can't even sign your name anymore.</p><p>What would you do if you got this card? You check the box next to your names. You check, you know, best wishes, happy birthday, get hammered on us. I don't know.</p><p>PRABHAKAR: I got to be honest with you, this is actually a nicer card than I received from most of my family members for my birthday.</p><p>FRANCIS: What?</p><p>PRABHAKAR: Yes.</p><p>FRANCIS: You need a new family.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS: What is worse than this card, no card at all or do the cards say does it have so many else's name in it? I mean, what is worse than this card?</p><p>PRABHAKAR: Misspelled name.</p><p>FRANCIS: Hitha is pretty straightforward. Hitha Prabhakar, I don't want to have to spell on television, but Hitha, I could do.</p><p>PRABHAKAR: No one really sign their names either. It was just kind of --</p><p>FRANCIS: Really?</p><p>PRABHAKAR: Yes.</p><p>FRANCIS: Wow.</p><p>PRABHAKAR: Yes. So --</p><p>FRANCIS: You're going to be in therapy for that for a long time.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRANCIS: Jarrod, what about you?</p><p>JARROD GUY RANDOLPH, CORE VICE PRESIDENT: I don't think there was follow-through on that card. It was supposed to lead in the something else, but I mean --</p><p>FRANCIS: Like what?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RANDOLPH: If birthday cards look like that, I can only imagine what the annual holiday bonus looks like.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p>RANDOLPH: So, for me, I'd be a little upset if my co-workers gave that to me.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK. So, this is a new case for your iPhone. It doubles as a stun gun to prevent any accidental discharge. Yes, I would hope. Users have to flip two switches before activating the gun. The case sells for 140 bucks. And the co-founder says sales could exceed a million dollars this year.</p><p>Is this just a must have or is it a lawsuit waiting to happen? I'm wondering, what happens when you accidentally but dial with your iPhone. That's a stun gun (ph). That would be quite a shock.</p><p>PRABHAKAR: Not only is it a lawsuit waiting to happen, it's a disaster waiting to happen. I mean, I can't tell you how many times I get misdialed phones from different people. I misdial (ph) phone. Also, if you're getting attacked, why would you want to on latch (ph) something and then security check this. I mean, wouldn't you want to just kind of go for it and try to protect yourself?</p><p>RANDOLPH: I see the value on this product.</p><p>FRANCIS: You do?</p><p>RANDOLPH: This will be even (ph) my secret weapon. You will buy a $50 million apartment. I'm going to start using this with my client.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>RANDOLPH: I mean, I don't see why not. If this actually became an approved Apple accessory. So --</p><p>FRANCIS: What? Really?</p><p>RANDOLPH: It's kind of amazing.</p><p>FRANCIS: There should be a breathalyzer attached to it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RANDOLPH: They're going to come up with that.</p><p>PRABHAKAR: Right.</p><p>RANDOLPH: And if you go on the website, the pink ones are the ones that have sold out first. I'm just waiting for the camouflage.</p><p>FRANCIS: How much is the cost? Does anybody know?</p><p>RANDOLPH: I think it's about $140.</p><p>FRANCIS: Wow! That's amazing. Well, there's a Christmas gift.</p><p>All right. So, the big baby news of the week, a bizarre name given. Reality princess, Kim Kardashian and rapper baby daddy, Kanye West, have chosen the name North, North, for their baby girl. Think about that for a second. The baby's name is Northwest, no middle name. I mean, they're running this child's life or they giving it direction.</p><p>PRABHAKAR: All right. We can safely assume that it's not a fan of One Direction, right, the band?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRANCIS: OK. All right. I like that. That was good. Jarrod, what do you think about this?</p><p>RANDOLPH: The middle name should be Southeast. So, it's north, south, east, west. I mean, I actually can't believe we're talking about this right now.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>RANDOLPH: But think about it, there were other names that could have come up with. Lampshade, soda can. I mean, they could have named it anything.</p><p>FRANCIS: Seven, Pepsi. I don't know. All those --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRANCIS: One of the worst names ever.</p><p>PRABHAKAR: I like the east and west. Wasn't east and west --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS: And we wrap up the week. Our own Tom Sullivan has some doubts about the direction of our economy. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TOM SULLIVAN, FOX BUSINESS: Something isn't right about the economy. I'm trying to be positive, and yes, the economy has expanded every quarter going back to 2009. But it's consistently weak growth. The job market, it's also improving, but not enough to soak up all of the new people that are coming into the job market, the young grads and immigrants. And housing, it seems to be doing better. In fact, in some places, there's another price bubble growing.</p><p>But, it's because there are two few homes for sale and that's largely because whopping (ph) number, 44 percent of homeowners are either under water or they don't have enough equity to pay a realtor to sell their home, so they sit. And it's the same number, 44 percent of people who told CNN in a poll this week that they are worse off economically now than compared to just one year ago.</p><p>The huge portion of the country is still hurting. The markets are nervous about the fed slowing down its artificial pumping of the economy. I get that, but even though I don't like what the fed is done, I don't see the fed making any big changes, and I don't see this fragile economy jumping out of its sick bed anytime soon.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FRANCIS: Well, that's true. Thanks, Tom. Be sure to watch \"The Tom Sullivan Show\" this weekend. You can catch it at 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. on Saturday, and on Sunday at 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. Happy Friday, everyone. Thanks to both of you for joining us. Have a great weekend. I'll see you back here on Monday.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2013 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

With the fed making a financial mess, how to prepare with what is coming next.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus, surviving the apocalypse in style. A California developer is opening the world's largest doomsday shelter and resort. Where do I make my reservation?

Stay tuned to find out who it is.</p><p/><p>Because even when they say t is not, it is always about \"Money.\"</p><p/><p>It is the end of a very tumultuous week on Wall Street and it is time for some serious crisis management for the fed. So, you are entering the spin zone. <person><nameText>Ben Bernanke </nameText></person>is getting slam for statements this week about the possibility of easing off the bond buying program which came just two days of the fed chairman was basically fired on <person><nameText>the Charlie Rose show. </nameText></person>I don't know if you saw this, a lot of moving pieces but we want you to know what you have to do right now to protect yourself in the midst of all of it.</p><p/><p>Joining me now is Barron's senior editor, Jack Hough and Pat Howell, CEO of Howell financial group. Welcome back to the show.</p><p/><p>Jack, let me start with you. Have the wheels come off the fed here? I mean, it has been quite a week for those guys.</p><p/><p>JACK HOUGH, SENIOR EDITOR, BARRON: I'm not sure what the dissent is about. I mean, are we supposed to keep interest rates near zero forever? I mean, at this point, you are trading off this much improvement in the economy versus this much distortion of every kind of asset class investors have a choice of. It is time, isn't it?</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: It is time. But that is not really what we're talking about. I mean, what we are talking about is sort of the chaos that ensued this week. For example, I mean, let me play you the sound bite. President Obama basically fired <person><nameText>Ben Bernanke </nameText></person>in <person><nameText>Charlie Rose. </nameText></person>And we will get both your reactions on the other side. Listen to this.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think <person><nameText>Ben Bernanke </nameText></person>has done an outstanding job. <person><nameText>Ben Bernanke </nameText></person>is a little bit like Bob Mueller, the head of the FBI where he has already stayed a lot longer than he wanted or he was supposed to. But, I think --</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE, </nameText></person>TV HOST: But if he wanted to be reappointed, you would reappoint him?</p><p/><p>OBAMA: He has been outstanding partner along with the White House.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: What? I mean, that is not really a ringing endorsement. Pat, that is like somebody saying, you know, how is your husband? You are like, well, he has been outstanding partner until now.</p><p/><p>PATRICIA POWELL, CEO, POWELL FINANCIAL GROUP: Anybody can be a loose cannon, it is just odd it is the president of the United States.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Is he a loose cannon or was that on purpose? I mean, don't know. There is a lot of negativity there.</p><p/><p>POWELL: He is making some telegraphing things too. He is not going to Jackson hole, you know, that was a little odd. I mean, he has been telegraphing things. And a lot of people say that he is tired, this has been exhausting thing, and it was not really -- this is now what he had in mind when he became chairman of the fed.</p><p/><p>HOUGH: He was looking at his shoes when he said that, right?</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p/><p>HOUGH: I'm not a body language expert, but that says stayed.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: He stayed a lot longer than he was supposed to or he wanted to. I mean, that is pretty harsh. So then, it is not surprising that <person><nameText>Ben Bernanke </nameText></person>comes out, rocks the boat a bit. I mean, they are all over the place. You have James Bullard, Ben coming out today saying, well maybe, you know, we are going t have more combination down the road if we need it. Basically, going against everything that <person><nameText>Ben Bernanke </nameText></person>said, which is sort of all over the map. Where does that leave investors?</p><p/><p>HOUGH: It is unusual to see a special press release like that with a sort of dissenting view. And I think it is already a tumultuous time for the market. I don't think there's any kind of financial Armageddon. I mean, where people are getting crazy about losing a few percent in the stock market. Keep in mind the market is double in nearly, you know, in about four years, and treasury rates are up (INAUDIBLE), were 2.5 percent for the average over the past 50 years, it is over six percent. So we don't have skyrocketing interest rates something like that.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: It says that the whole point is we need these guys. I mean, they are doing -- they have done policy that we have never seen before in our lives. So, we need them to dismount in the cleanest way possible her and get out of it. So far just this week it has been utter chaos.</p><p/><p>My favorite comment because the twitter universe and online to block its fear was alive, with all of these different machination during the week. I love Lawrence McDonald tweeted, somebody that a lot of us follow, he is on TV all the time. He said job opening, portfolio manager need for $3.5 trillion, 70-tons leverage Hedge Fund unlimited borrow, no marked market, see Federal Reserve.</p><p/><p>Does not inspire confidence? I mean, everybody is joking about what is going on. It does tell you don't have a lot of confidence of what is going on.</p><p/><p>POWELL: Well, nobody here has confidence because we don't know how this is going to be around. But, it is so much better that they are telling us this stuff. We don't want to invest blindly. We don't want to have another secret.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: They telling us, what though? They are telling us all different things. I mean, Bullard says we could ease more. <person><nameText>Ben Bernanke </nameText></person>says we are getting out, President Obama says he is fired, telling us what?</p><p/><p>POWELL: Well, <person><nameText>Bernanke </nameText></person>started, I think, on the 22nd of May by giving us the first inkling that there thinking about chasing, and I think in this particular -- the comments this week really dealt with the fact that we are creating a plan to taper. This is a very good thing. It is so much better to have a plan than to be shooting from the hips which was not good.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: So, how do we all set ourselves up for this because this is the take away that we want for our audience here? It means that interest rates are going up, maybe, my thought is give anything interest-rate sensitive whether it is an adjustable mortgage or it is credit card rates you want to keep an eye on that, maybe it is a great time in real estate to transact whether you are a buyer or a seller. I mean, if you are a buyer, this is probably as good as the rates are going to be. If you are seller, you may want to transact because it is the most money that a buyer is going to have. What do you think?</p><p/><p>POWELL: Buyers may start rushing in because they have been sitting back waiting to see what is going to happen, now they saw a real choice. If interest rates go up, every point that goes up they lose purchasing power or borrowing power. So, it can push the real estate market, actually, up in the short run.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: In the short run. In the long run, I mean, Jack, would you agree with that? In the long run, it is bad for the real estate market because higher interest rates make it tougher.</p><p/><p>HOUGH: I'm on sure there is anyone here is on the fence right now, that waiting for a little less of the mortgage rate before they buy, I mean, that ship has sailed. But I think in terms of investors right now, you hold onto some extra cash because there's a possibility both stocks and bonds are going to be weak at the same time. We don't a lynch how an interesting piece of research what they said. Right now, inflations is actually coming down and interest rates are going up, which is a rarity. It happened in 1994, at that time tech stocks outperformed, utilities got hurt, they were recommending the same thing right now.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Interesting point of view.</p><p/><p>All right, thanks to both of you. Good stuff.</p><p/><p>HOUGH: Thank you.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Time now for today's fuel gauge report. China and Russia signing $270 billion oil deal. It is one of the biggest in history. Rosneft, Russian's state owned oil company will double supplies to China. It could reach up to 900,000 barrels per day. That is according to Vladimir Putin. The 25 year deal makes chin China the biggest customer for Russian oil.</p><p/><p>U.S. gasoline demand for May fell to a 13 year low. That is according to the American Petroleum Institute.

We are going to tell you how it is turning personal now.</p><p/><p>Plus, the reason the government has gotten so good at spying on you is because it is coaching top talent from Silicon Valley. Maybe you didn't know that. We got details on the stunning revelation in the NSA scandal.</p><p/><p>More \"Money\" coming up.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: The battle between two Wall Street titans is getting bigger and personal, by the way. <person><nameText>Michael Dell </nameText></person>now launching a personal pitch to buy out his ubiquitous company, and pushed Icahn's offer out of the way, but will it deliver or well Icahn when out? It is all about the power of \"Money.\"</p><p/><p>Here to weigh in is \"Wall Street Journal\" business editor, Dennis Berman and Jonas Max Ferris at MaxFunds.com.</p><p/><p>Great to have you both on the show.</p><p/><p>Dennis, let me start with you. This is battle of the titans. I mean, these are two enormous egos out there, so how do you size of the whole think?</p><p/><p>DENNIS BERMAN, BUSINESS EDITOR, WALL STREET JOURNAL: I see Dell winning, Icahn losing.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Really? How come?</p><p/><p>BERMAN: Simple reason. The best chance for Dell to beaten was a potential rival bid from another private equity firm. Carl Icahn, at this point, he could do a lot of great noise and smoke and a lot of activity, but when it comes down to it the shareholder will have to say that he wants to take this offer or do we not? And right now, given the market where they are, they are probably going to take the offer of $14 per share.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: So Jonas, what do you think? I mean, his basically saying Silver Lake wins the day because, of course, that too smacky (ph) <person><nameText>Michael Dell?</nameText></person></p><p/><p>JONAS MAX FERRIS, MARKET WATCHER, MAXFUNDS.COM: Because I think people would rather side with the guy who started the company in his dorm room then some Wall Street raider. I just don't think that that is -- that guy is going to fix it.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: The guy has started the company in his dorm room, but has kind of driven it into the ground, right?</p><p/><p>FERRIS: Well, by that logic every tech CEO who isn't Apple or Samsung should be fired because they all missed the smart phone revolution. Go down the line, everybody screwed up. And the whole PC, this has come on land. That was original cornerstone of the business was assembling PC box. That is a dying business and it is easy to say, he missed the smart phone and pad revolution, yes, it is good. But everybody didn't because it is really hard to compete.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: I don't know. I mean, Dennis, right here you have his whole plan, <person><nameText>Michael Dell's </nameText></person>whole plan right here, for how he will turn the company around. And we were talking about this is the commercial break is that if he has this brilliance, why hasn't he done it already, why doesn't he do it while the company is public? I mean, just do it, you know. Why do you have to take (INAUDIBLE).</p><p/><p>BERMAN: I think you make a really good point. I agree with you. And, if you read this and it doesn't take long because he doesn't write very much here you will be relatively uninspired by what with <person><nameText>Michael dell </nameText></person>has to say. You will be relatively uninspired by what <person><nameText>Michael Dell </nameText></person>has to say. It is what I would call problem. It is generic. It does not say anything.</p><p/><p>But, whether he says anything here or not or whether Carl Icahn is the right person to be a part of dell, really, it doesn't matter is there's only one thing that matters, to shareholders want to accept the price for dell right now? There are no offers being the price of the stock is trading below the $14 offer. It the market that telling us that will probably be accepted. Although, it may not be easy at the moment.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Jonas, if you are a shareholder -- but, are you, by the way?</p><p/><p>FERRIS: We all own it through mutual funds indirectly. Directly, don't bow and very few people only this directly. It is not growth stock getting more and the public only owns like Apple directly users all along by --.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: So, would say, give me the $14 let me the hell out of the stock? So, I can just forget about Dell and go off.</p><p/><p>FERRIS: Because I think Icahn is playing an a head start for proxy movie, who with all the movie with the executives try to pretend the company was worthless so they can buy the stock at a cheap price and then by putting the bad CEO in. That was the movie. I think that is what the spin is here, the Dell rule is down talking the stock so he could take it private.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: So you think it has more value than Roe (ph).</p><p/><p>FERRIS: I do think so.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Really? Why, what is so valuable?</p><p/><p>FERRIS: Well, it is a long shot, but without the PC business, I think there is still an angle to be some sort of IBM asks more, you know, selling silver type in software company. It is not a huge growth opportunity, but I think there is something there that is more valuable than the current share price. That is a better price for a lot of non-Apple, Samsung companies today.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: What do you think, Dennis? Is that possible?</p><p/><p>BERMAN: It is certainly possible. And this is that the fundamental complex. The real tension inside this management by IPOs, what does the guy at the top of the ladder know that I don't know that he shares with us? And should I trust him, or should I not?</p><p/><p>Here is another great example. J. Crew, great company. We all know that company. It went private after the CEO basically forced and offer down his owned shareholder's growth. So, Jonas makes a fair point about the conflicts inherent in that those dynamics. But again, as it stands now, roughly 15 percent or so of shares are a lied against BBO (ph).</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: But wait, but other than him knowing something we all don't, what would be his other reason for wanting to take it private?</p><p/><p>FERRIS: I would say vanity. It is his business. He has got his name on it. It is hard to walk away. You don't want it to die. It is called Dell. It is not Microsoft, you know. It holds on Bill Gates' software. So, it is like there's a certain element where you want it to succeed.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: So, it is either vanity or he knows something we don't? Real quick before we go, what is your bet, vanity or he knows something we don't?</p><p/><p>FERRIS: I think it is still worth more than it is. I do think all these tycoons, these are old, are going to go private at some point because --.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: So, he knows something we don't. That's how I'm going to interpret that.</p><p/><p>Dennis, what do you think, vanity or he know something we don't?</p><p/><p>BERMAN: I say the answer is both. But, in the end --</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: How can it be both? Pick one.</p><p/><p>BERMAN: Well, he is both vain and he knows something that we don't. Those can both motivations. In the end, the shareholders are going to bite because --.</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: OK. Guys, you are fantastic, thank you.</p><p/><p>BERMAN: Thank you.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Coming up on \"Money,\" if you knew facebook former chief security officer but feel like he has dropped off the radar, here is why. He is now working for the NSA and he is not alone. We will tell you how Silicon Valley is getting help to the government's prying eyes.</p><p/><p>Plus, former Enron CEO, Jeff Skilling, hits 10 years, why he stop his prison sentence? And it could be a dream come true for white-collar criminals.</p><p/><p>Stay right where you are and find out why.</p><p/><p>Do you ever have too much \"Money\"?</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Weather it is on Wall Street or Main Street, here is to make \"Money\" today.</p><p/><p>Actually, I can start with who made money. Larry Ellison, the CEO of Oracle, lost so much money I have to do that one first. Oracle's latest earnings were a big disappointment on Wall Street. And as a result, the shares plunged more than nine percent today. So Larry Ellison owns 1.1 billion shares of Oracle. That means he lost $3.4 billion today, $3.4 billion. I had to put that in perspective. Ellison bought the whole island of Lanai last year for $300 million. So, he lost the equivalent of 11 Hawaiian Islands today.</p><p/><p>Meanwhile, trying to make \"Money\" today, Starbucks, it is raising drink cause for first time in almost two years. The average price hike will be about one percent. Starbucks blames rising rent and labor cost for the increase.</p><p/><p>And the Miami heat championship win proving a ratings gold mine for ABC. Nearly 18 percent of you at home watched game seven last night. That is according to Nielsen. It is the second highest rating for an NBA game in 11 years, a sign of the times and congratulations.</p><p/><p>So, if you have been following the NSA spy scandal you may wonder how tight the government really is with big tech companies like facebook, for example. Well, a shocking report reveal that actually left to go work for the NSA back in 2010 and evidently, he is not the only big tech exec that's made the move from Silicon Valley to government spy agency.</p><p/><p>That brings up a lot of questions and concerns, namely what kinds of info are these ex-tech employees bringing to their new job. With me on this frightening development is managing director of TechnoBuffalo, Roy Choi.</p><p/><p>Welcome back to the show, Roy.</p><p/><p>ROY CHOI, MANAGING DIRECTOR, TECHNOBUFFALO: Thank you.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: I mean, should we be afraid of this? I mean, this is a guy who was in charge of protecting our own private personal information on facebook and he eventually took the knowledge and the keys of the kingdom and went to go work for an agency that is now spying on us.</p><p/><p>CHOI: I think we have to assume that, you know, employees as tech companies like facebook, Google, Skype, they have this information and they're going to go somewhere and may be to the NSA and feed that.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: So, you are basically saying, we have to assume that everything we put online could eventually be handed over to people who are spying on us? And you just have to be satisfied with that?</p><p/><p>CHOI: Yes. They have policies in place, but when you turn into reality you will see that information isn't always word is supposed to be. We will claim it is 100 percent locks down, but how many times have we seen leaks weathered his credit card information or online information leaks either accidentally or a hole in the security software or malicious hackers going in and getting this information.</p><p/><p>So, I can't say that people are always going to be secure. And you know, I think people are under the assumption when I post something online, it is going to be there for public consumption. But you know, it is beyond that, it is the metadata, it is the stuff you don't necessarily see.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: What will be his motivation for leaving a place like facebook? You have to imagine that at the level he was, he was making a lot of money and owned a lot of stock and did really well. Why would you leave and go and work for the government?</p><p/><p>CHOI: Who knows? Maybe it is a greater challenge. Maybe, you know, facebook has been a huge supporter of helping fight crime a couple of years ago. And I am not saying this particular security official, but the most recent security official actually implemented a program where they could actually search through content, so there was anything that is a sexual predator was out there and putting in language that would be a little worry some for law enforcement, they would openly give that information out. And you know, they have actually stated their policy is as long as there is a court order or any type of subpoena they would hand that information freely in order to protect users. And at that point, they were under a lot of pressure to help especially with lots of sexual predators lurking on facebook.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: That's one thing. But you know, when I have asked that question in the past of hackers and the like, why would you go from the private sector where you are making a lot of money to work for the NSA or any government agency for a lot less. They say that they are allowed to do things when you're working for the NSA that you're not allowed to do in regular life, and you are allowed to spy in a way that you can't do for a private company. So you combine sort of that ability and ambition with someone who knows the intimate ins and outs of a facebook or a Google and you get a very powerful government who could spy on us even more than we ever imagined. Your thoughts on that?</p><p/><p>CHOI: Definitely. And I think, when we look at, in terms of national security, in terms of our own security, privately, you are going to see the internet as like the next forum, whether that is in a proactive manner or a reactive manner. So, for someone to leave from Silicon Valley, the constraints of, you know, regulations and whatever else, you know, maybe you go to the NSA, maybe you go to another government agency, but you do get that level of freedom to go out and use your talents to make your mark.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p/><p>Roy, thank you so much for coming on the show. Appreciate your time.</p><p/><p>CHOI: Thank you. Appreciate it.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Up next on \"Money,\" we are going to Jeffrey Skilling. He committed one of the worst acts of corporate fraud in U.S. history. Well, the former Enron CEO is now getting out of prison 10 years ahead of schedule. We are going to explain why this is music to the ears of white- collar criminals everywhere.</p><p/><p>Plus, a bipartisan group of senators wants to block U.S. military funding for Syrian rebels. You may like the sound of that, but will we have to spend even more if we don't act now? One of the many top experts breaks down the numbers for us.</p><p/><p>Piles of \"money\" coming up.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>MELISSA FRANCIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: New developments today in the case of convicted white-collar felon, Jeffrey Skilling. The former Enron CEO has served six and half years of a 24-year sentence, so far, for bringing down the world's largest energy trader. It was one of the worst acts of corporate fraud in U.S. history.</p><p/><p>But today, his sentence was sliced by 10 years. Meaning, now, he's going to be out in just seven and a half years instead of 17 1/2 years from now. So, what does his short and sentence mean for white-collar criminals? Here with the dish is our go to lawyer, Arthur Aidala.</p><p/><p>ARTHUR AIDALA, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST: Dish?</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Dish. Yes.</p><p/><p>AIDALA: Is that a legal term?</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: It is. You didn't know that, because you're a lawyer. You should know.</p><p/><p>AIDALA: -- any Italian food, so I don't know what the dishes (ph) are about.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: What is the deal?</p><p/><p>AIDALA: The deal here is this. He appeals -- he gets convicted, gets this huge sentence --</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: I mean, he didn't kill anyone.</p><p/><p>AIDALA: He didn't kill anyone, but let me double check my map here. $60 billion in Enron stock was rendered worthless. $2 billion in employee pension were rented worthless. It's a lot of guilt (ph).</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p/><p>AIDALA: That's a lot of money going on there. So -- and more importantly that a lot of money, it's a lot of people who got affected. I mean, lives were ruined, lives were destroyed. So, he gets this really rough sentence. He -- (INAUDIBLE) who supposed to go get sentenced and get wiped out, he dies, so that wipes out his conviction. And, he appeals all the way up to the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court basing the rules in his favor saying one of the ways -- one of the convictions against him was improper.</p><p/><p>They go to a lower court about it. Should there be a new trial? Should there be a new trial? The bottom line is, they say that he was sentenced to nine years too many, and for them not to re-appeal, because he could have, the government said look --</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Nine years too many in which -- in what then? Why?</p><p/><p>AIDALA: Because the guideline calculations, which is the very complicated way.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: They did the bath rock (ph).</p><p/><p>AIDALA: Well, they applied things the wrong way. In federal court unlike state court, to figure someone's sentence, you need like a small calculus degree. It's crazy. And basically, in court, the judges said, you did this the wrong way, you came about this the wrong way, therefore, there's at least nine years that he's got tacked on that shouldn't be tacked on.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: So, are white-collar criminals everywhere rejoining because the scuttlebutt on this all week long has been that the sentences for financial crimes up late. I mean, if you look at (INAUDIBLE). I mean, all of this has been very stiff.</p><p/><p>AIDALA: Well, what -- right.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: And is this the beginning of a reduction in the sentences for financial crisis, which as you said, ruined a lot of lives --</p><p/><p>AIDALA: A lot of lives.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: -- but in many cases are longer than murder convictions.</p><p/><p>AIDALA: Correct. But literally, like a murder conviction, you're really affecting like one person and one family. This affected --</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Right. But they're dead as opposed to I don't have money. I mean, we should rather be alive --</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>AIDALA: But there are these charts in the federal law that when you commit a crime, you start off at a very -- a below base level which is like a non-jail sentence. And then depending on how much money was stolen or how much fraud or how much tax evasion, that's what you come up with the numbers. So, if it's just a minimal amount like 100 million, you're at one level.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Very little. Yes.</p><p/><p>AIDALA: When it's 60 billion, you're at the highest level. You're literally off the charts. The United State Supreme Court did say that the way they convicted him under this honest services fraud law, which is a very complicated thing to explain, was not done properly. So, yes, a door has been opened to criminal defendants to tell the government, you need to prosecute us in this way, not in that way. And it may have lightened the load on them. But, you know --</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Sounds like you don't think the original 24 was that unfair (ph), though.</p><p/><p>AIDALA: I mean, they did some bad stuff. They hurt a lot of people. They hurt a lot of retired people who are like -- I mean, you go from thinking like, going to bed, thinking I have a half a million dollars in the bank and I'm 80 years old to I have nothing in the bank and I'm 80 years old.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p/><p>AIDALA: Hello!</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Arthur, thank you so much.</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: You did a great job. There's smoke coming out of your ears.</p><p/><p>AIDALA: I learn about the dish. I dished it. I knew about the dish. Thank you, folks.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Turning now to a much more serious topic, the unsettling situation in Syria. All eyes are on the country's reports (ph) on chemical weapons use and see frightening images of escalating violence. Now, some Lawmakers here at home are trying to block any U.S. funding to armed rebels.</p><p/><p>Of course, we know the story is about a lot more than money. There's an enormous human toll, but our show is called MONEY, so we're going to focus on that angle. We're going to take a closer look at whether or not it would actually cost us more to get involved now or not.</p><p/><p>Joining us now with his take is Zuhdi Jasser, president of the American Islamic Forum for Democracy. Always nice to have you, Zuhdi.</p><p/><p>ZUHDI JASSER, AMERICAN ISLAMIC FORUM FOR DEMOCRACY: Thanks, Melissa. It's great to be with you.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: You know, we're trying to break down the cost. As we said, huge human toll, you know, for humanitarian reasons you may or may not want to get involved, but looking at just the dollar part of it, what is the cost of doing nothing at this point?</p><p/><p>JASSER: Well, we have two and half years, Melissa, of the revolution to know what that cost is. And just some numbers from Tel Aviv University, it looks like in Jordan, it costs $35 per refugee just to house them per year. So, you're looking right now at three to four million refugees that have been displaced in Syria.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Who's paying for that?</p><p/><p>JASSER: That's the thing. Jordan is paying for some of it, but we're paying a lot of it. We've already paid over half a billion dollars through USAID into the region, and it's looking like the refugees are going to reach six million by the end of the year, and our money is into it.</p><p/><p>It's going to be in the billions whether we do, you know, nothing militarily or not, it's going to be -- it's a part of the region that if we're going to continue to try to maintain stability, the humanitarian aid is not only the compassionate thing to do, it has to be done militarily strategically or otherwise the entire region will implode with sectarian violence and our ally in the region. Israel will certainly be threatened.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: If we do something, that is incredibly expensive, already looking at the estimates. A no-fly zone in the first 10 days alone would cost $1.4 billion. And it expands from there, right?</p><p/><p>JASSER: Oh, absolutely. And you know, the no-fly zone -- yes, Libya was a bit cheaper, but they're looking -- this is more like Iraq. Syria has a more sophisticated military that would need to be taken out, and somewhere of 50 to 100 million a day, they say. But still, I think the cost and a lot of experts have said this the cost are going to be less, as Michael O'Hanlon (ph) from Brookings said, it's a bargain if we can end this war earlier.</p><p/><p>Because look, two and half years have proven this war is going nowhere. Assad maybe winning as far as militarily, but the attrition from the Syrian army continues. It's only how long, how many months or years when Assad will finally fall. And if we want to have a play in the region and be involved in the right side of history and help move them towards, we defeat Assad first as the strategy and second defeat al Qaeda.</p><p/><p>If we want to play a role in that, we have to be on the right side of history to fight against the Iran, fight against Hezbollah, et cetera. Not with troops.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: -- on the right side of history and some are arguing that it's too late for that. That early on, we could have been fighting against Hezbollah and Assad. And when we originally saw pictures of children being slaughtered, that was the time to get involved, but we didn't. And now, at this point, al Qaeda and extremists have gotten involved.</p><p/><p>On the other side, and it's become now al Qaeda versus Hezbollah, which isn't our fight, neither of those folks are our friends, and we should just stay out of it. That is one of the theories that's out there. I'll give you the last word on why you don't agree with that, if you don't.</p><p/><p>JASSER: Well, that calculus of characterizing the opposition of al Qaeda is just not correct. The Syrian population has become more radicalized and they're becoming more, you know, chaotic and committing atrocities, but that's because we've done nothing. If we come to the side of helping the millions -- there's only tens of thousands of al Qaeda -- the millions of Syrians in this opposition, we will help defeat the ultimate source of the radicalization which is Assad.</p><p/><p>And remember, Hezbollah, the forms of terror in the Middle East is Iran. So, those on my (ph) conservative side that believe that doing nothing will allow al Qaeda to die, actually, al Qaeda is thriving, Hezbollah is thriving. Terror will thrive without our involvement. So, the question is, which side has less terror? I believe doing something would.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Zuhdi Jasser, thank you so much for your thoughts tonight. We always appreciate it.</p><p/><p>JASSER: Thank you. Appreciate it.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: We have some breaking news right now on Facebook. Let's go to Fox Business' Jo Ling Kent with the latest. Jo Ling, what do you have?</p><p/><p>JO LING KENT, FOX BUSINESS: Melissa, Facebook is confirming on their website that a security breach has exposed six million e-mail addresses and telephone numbers. And let me tell you a little bit more of what they're saying on the website.</p><p/><p>They found, they said, through their white hat security researching program that they use that, quote, \"that may have allowed some of a person's contact information e-mail or phone number to be accessed by people who either had some contact information about the person or some connection to that person.\"</p><p/><p>So, they're saying six million e-mail addresses and telephone numbers were shared, but Facebook was also very quick to note in its statement that no other types of personal or financial information were included and only people on Facebook, not developers or advertisers, had access to this information.</p><p/><p>So, certainly, a very alarming security breach has happened at Facebook, and we'll continue to bring you more a little bit later, Melissa.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Wow. Jo Ling, thanks so much.</p><p/><p>All right. Coming up on MONEY, surviving the end of the world sounds tough. Indoor pool, a bowling alley, a golf, maybe it wouldn't be that bad. A California developer is opening the world's largest doomsday shelter. This will be an underground resort. It's fabulous. He's taking reservations. He joins us with all the details, because at the end of the day, the end of the world, it's all about MONEY.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Talk about surviving in style. Vivos Survival Shelter and Resort is the chicest doomsday shelter out there. For a few thousand bucks, you and yours (ph) can be safe from any number of impending disasters. Cozily nestled 100 feet below in Atchison Kansas, and you can live in your shelter in your very own RV -- wow! -- for up to a year. There is big money to be made in the bunker business.</p><p/><p>Joining me now is Robert Vicino. He is founder and CEO of Vivos Group and the owner of the fabulous shelter. Thank you so much for coming on.</p><p/><p>ROBERT VICINO, VIVOS GROUP FOUNDER AND CEO: It's my honor.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: I understand that this is a space that the army previously used. They auctioned it off. And what gave you the idea to make it into a doomsday shelter?</p><p/><p>VICINO: Well, we've been in the shelter business for the last five years building Vivos shelters around the world. And, typically, whenever a government shelter or facility comes up, we try to buy it and then retrofitted and convert it into a modern day blast shelter. This one was auctioned by the GSA and we jumped on it.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: What is it like? What happens when I arrived there?</p><p/><p>VICINO: It is a turnkey four-star underground hotel/cruise ship. It's everything you could imagine. It's not just a survival shelter. It is truly a destination resort where you and your family and your children would want to go to many times a year, perhaps, in the middle of the winter where it' s 70 degrees inside this mountain year round. So, you will be very comfortable.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Do people come even if there's not a disaster by space (ph). Can I come and hang out?</p><p/><p>VICINO: Anytime you want. You can't permanently live there, but yes, it's open 24/7 forever. And so, you buy your space and you park your RV there, whatever you're comfortable with, be it a 20-footer or 45-foot motor home for a million dollar. And it's a one-time charge, and you know, it's yours, you're a co-owner of this what would be a billion dollar replacement.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Does it cost me a million dollars? I mean, I read that it's $1,000 per lineal foot. The average RV is about 30 feet, so that's $30,000, and there's $1,500 charge per person, but I don't know what -- over what period of time. How much would it cost me? I have a husband and two kids, what are you going to charge me?</p><p/><p>VICINO: Well, you're the perfect nuclear family.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Yes. Thank you.</p><p/><p>VICINO: And, it would cost no extra charge for any of those family members, the only thing you're paying for is the RV, itself, by the lineal foot. So, if you had a 30-foot RV, it's $30,000 and four children or four people for food, that's a one year food supply. It's another 6,000. So, for $36,000, you've got yourself an investment and a life assurance policy or --</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: How many people have signed up, so far? How much money have you made?</p><p/><p>VICINO: Well, not enough. We've had 25,000 applications over the last few years. The primary problem has been the cost. People can't afford our other shelters where it's a per person rate as much as $50,000. So, this --</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: So, of those 25,000, how many people have locked it in?</p><p/><p>VICINO: On this new one, we just announced it last week in or membership, and we've got a few hundred already signed up. So, it's going to happen very quickly. We'll sell out. This one will accommodate only 1,500 RVs or about 5,000 people, which I like to say is almost one in a million people on Earth.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: This one makes me nervous about this. So, you're all the way in Kansas. I'm in New York, for example. What kind of doomsday disaster would come my way that I would have enough time to get there?</p><p/><p>VICINO: Oh, let's say a nuke went off in L.A. or in Washington or in the Middle East, or let's say where about to see a major economic meltdown, which could happen any day, as you know, or let's say the earth was rumbling or an asteroid was on its way. Things --</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: I would have enough time to get there?</p><p/><p>VICINO: It's time to go. And you may go and it may not happen, and so, it's a false alarm just like the fireman goes to the --</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p/><p>VICINO: -- but at least you have somewhere to go versus the other seven billion people on the planet that will have no solution, nowhere to go, and they'll be scrambling. And you don't want to be a part of that mash (ph). You want to go. You want to have a safe haven. You'll be underground in what we call effectively a fortress.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: OK. Robert, thanks for coming on the show. Interesting idea. Sounds like -- I'll be interested to see if it's a good business, if you sell out, because -- I mean, there's a lot to be afraid of these days. I don't know. People want an insurance policy. Thanks for coming on. Keep us posted.</p><p/><p>VICINO: My pleasure.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Here is our MONEY question of the day. How much would you pay for a spot on world's biggest doomsday shelter? Not surprisingly, I got a lot of funny responses to this one, including Less Than Zero. \"I'd rather die than live in Kansas.\" Come on! Come on. Kansas is a nice place. That was mean.</p><p/><p>We want to hear from more of you. You can like us on Facebook at acebook.com/MelissaFrancisFox or follow me on Twitter @MelissaAFrancis.</p><p/><p>All right. Coming up on MONEY. Oh, bless you, Kanye and Kim. You gave your baby a name even crazier than we thought possible. And there's developing news on what the middle name is, too. We've got it all in \"Spare Change.\" You can never have too many insane celebrities.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: All right. Welcome to \"Spare Change.\" We are joined by Jarrod Guy Randolph and we also have Hitha Prabhakar here. Thanks to both of you for coming on. A little \"Spare Change\" fun on this Friday.</p><p/><p>HITHA PRABHAKAR, RETAIL ANALYST: Thanks for having us.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: All right. First, we are going to look at some birthdays at work. If it is not already bad enough that you're in the office for your birthday, check this out. This birthday card we saw, you literally just check the box next to your name. Can you imagine that, to show your love? I mean, come on. You can't even sign your name anymore.</p><p/><p>What would you do if you got this card? You check the box next to your names. You check, you know, best wishes, happy birthday, get hammered on us. I don't know.</p><p/><p>PRABHAKAR: I got to be honest with you, this is actually a nicer card than I received from most of my family members for my birthday.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: What?</p><p/><p>PRABHAKAR: Yes.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: You need a new family.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: What is worse than this card, no card at all or do the cards say does it have so many else's name in it? I mean, what is worse than this card?</p><p/><p>PRABHAKAR: Misspelled name.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Hitha is pretty straightforward. Hitha Prabhakar, I don't want to have to spell on television, but Hitha, I could do.</p><p/><p>PRABHAKAR: No one really sign their names either. It was just kind of --</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Really?</p><p/><p>PRABHAKAR: Yes.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Wow.</p><p/><p>PRABHAKAR: Yes. So --</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: You're going to be in therapy for that for a long time.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Jarrod, what about you?</p><p/><p>JARROD GUY RANDOLPH, CORE VICE PRESIDENT: I don't think there was follow-through on that card. It was supposed to lead in the something else, but I mean --</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Like what?</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>RANDOLPH: If birthday cards look like that, I can only imagine what the annual holiday bonus looks like.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p/><p>RANDOLPH: So, for me, I'd be a little upset if my co-workers gave that to me.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: OK. So, this is a new case for your iPhone. It doubles as a stun gun to prevent any accidental discharge. Yes, I would hope. Users have to flip two switches before activating the gun. The case sells for 140 bucks. And the co-founder says sales could exceed a million dollars this year.</p><p/><p>Is this just a must have or is it a lawsuit waiting to happen? I'm wondering, what happens when you accidentally but dial with your iPhone. That's a stun gun (ph). That would be quite a shock.</p><p/><p>PRABHAKAR: Not only is it a lawsuit waiting to happen, it's a disaster waiting to happen. I mean, I can't tell you how many times I get misdialed phones from different people. I misdial (ph) phone. Also, if you're getting attacked, why would you want to on latch (ph) something and then security check this. I mean, wouldn't you want to just kind of go for it and try to protect yourself?</p><p/><p>RANDOLPH: I see the value on this product.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: You do?</p><p/><p>RANDOLPH: This will be even (ph) my secret weapon. You will buy a $50 million apartment. I'm going to start using this with my client.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>RANDOLPH: I mean, I don't see why not. If this actually became an approved Apple accessory. So --</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: What? Really?</p><p/><p>RANDOLPH: It's kind of amazing.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: There should be a breathalyzer attached to it.</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>RANDOLPH: They're going to come up with that.</p><p/><p>PRABHAKAR: Right.</p><p/><p>RANDOLPH: And if you go on the website, the pink ones are the ones that have sold out first. I'm just waiting for the camouflage.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: How much is the cost? Does anybody know?</p><p/><p>RANDOLPH: I think it's about $140.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Wow! That's amazing. Well, there's a Christmas gift.</p><p/><p>All right. So, the big baby news of the week, a bizarre name given. Reality princess, Kim Kardashian and rapper baby daddy, Kanye West, have chosen the name North, North, for their baby girl. Think about that for a second. The baby's name is Northwest, no middle name. I mean, they're running this child's life or they giving it direction.</p><p/><p>PRABHAKAR: All right. We can safely assume that it's not a fan of One Direction, right, the band?</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: OK. All right. I like that. That was good. Jarrod, what do you think about this?</p><p/><p>RANDOLPH: The middle name should be Southeast. So, it's north, south, east, west. I mean, I actually can't believe we're talking about this right now.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>RANDOLPH: But think about it, there were other names that could have come up with. Lampshade, soda can. I mean, they could have named it anything.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Seven, Pepsi. I don't know. All those --</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: One of the worst names ever.</p><p/><p>PRABHAKAR: I like the east and west. Wasn't east and west --</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: And we wrap up the week. Our own Tom Sullivan has some doubts about the direction of our economy. Take a listen.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>TOM SULLIVAN, FOX BUSINESS: Something isn't right about the economy. I'm trying to be positive, and yes, the economy has expanded every quarter going back to 2009. But it's consistently weak growth. The job market, it's also improving, but not enough to soak up all of the new people that are coming into the job market, the young grads and immigrants. And housing, it seems to be doing better. In fact, in some places, there's another price bubble growing.</p><p/><p>But, it's because there are two few homes for sale and that's largely because whopping (ph) number, 44 percent of homeowners are either under water or they don't have enough equity to pay a realtor to sell their home, so they sit. And it's the same number, 44 percent of people who told CNN in a poll this week that they are worse off economically now than compared to just one year ago.</p><p/><p>The huge portion of the country is still hurting. The markets are nervous about the fed slowing down its artificial pumping of the economy. I get that, but even though I don't like what the fed is done, I don't see the fed making any big changes, and I don't see this fragile economy jumping out of its sick bed anytime soon.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Well, that's true. Thanks, Tom. Be sure to watch \"The Tom Sullivan Show\" this weekend. You can catch it at 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. on Saturday, and on Sunday at 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. Happy Friday, everyone. Thanks to both of you for joining us. Have a great weekend. I'll see you back here on Monday.</p><p/><p>END</p><p/><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2013 Fox News Network, LLC.

A California developer is opening the world's largest doomsday shelter and resort. Where do I make my reservation? The man behind it joins us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And who lost \"Money\" today? One of America's top CEO, it is so much money, it would make John B. Rockefeller cry. Stay tuned to find out who it is.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Because even when they say t is not, it is always about \"Money.\"</p><p>It is the end of a very tumultuous week on Wall Street and it is time for some serious crisis management for the fed. So, you are entering the spin zone. <person><nameText>Ben Bernanke </nameText></person>is getting slam for statements this week about the possibility of easing off the bond buying program which came just two days of the fed chairman was basically fired on the Charlie Rose show. I don't know if you saw this, a lot of moving pieces but we want you to know what you have to do right now to protect yourself in the midst of all of it.</p><p>Joining me now is Barron's senior editor, Jack Hough and Pat Howell, CEO of Howell financial group. Welcome back to the show.</p><p>Jack, let me start with you. Have the wheels come off the fed here? I mean, it has been quite a week for those guys.</p><p>JACK HOUGH, SENIOR EDITOR, BARRON: I'm not sure what the dissent is about. I mean, are we supposed to keep interest rates near zero forever? I mean, at this point, you are trading off this much improvement in the economy versus this much distortion of every kind of asset class investors have a choice of. It is time, isn't it?</p><p>FRANCIS: It is time. But that is not really what we're talking about. I mean, what we are talking about is sort of the chaos that ensued this week. For example, I mean, let me play you the sound bite. President Obama basically fired <person><nameText>Ben Bernanke </nameText></person>in Charlie Rose. And we will get both your reactions on the other side. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think <person><nameText>Ben Bernanke </nameText></person>has done an outstanding job. <person><nameText>Ben Bernanke </nameText></person>is a little bit like Bob Mueller, the head of the FBI where he has already stayed a lot longer than he wanted or he was supposed to. But, I think --</p><p>CHARLIE ROSE, TV HOST: But if he wanted to be reappointed, you would reappoint him?</p><p>OBAMA: He has been outstanding partner along with the White House.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FRANCIS: What? I mean, that is not really a ringing endorsement. Pat, that is like somebody saying, you know, how is your husband? You are like, well, he has been outstanding partner until now.</p><p>PATRICIA POWELL, CEO, POWELL FINANCIAL GROUP: Anybody can be a loose cannon, it is just odd it is the president of the United States.</p><p>FRANCIS: Is he a loose cannon or was that on purpose? I mean, don't know. There is a lot of negativity there.</p><p>POWELL: He is making some telegraphing things too. He is not going to Jackson hole, you know, that was a little odd. I mean, he has been telegraphing things. And a lot of people say that he is tired, this has been exhausting thing, and it was not really -- this is now what he had in mind when he became chairman of the fed.</p><p>HOUGH: He was looking at his shoes when he said that, right?</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>HOUGH: I'm not a body language expert, but that says stayed.</p><p>FRANCIS: He stayed a lot longer than he was supposed to or he wanted to. I mean, that is pretty harsh. So then, it is not surprising that <person><nameText>Ben Bernanke </nameText></person>comes out, rocks the boat a bit. I mean, they are all over the place. You have James Bullard, Ben coming out today saying, well maybe, you know, we are going t have more combination down the road if we need it. Basically, going against everything that <person><nameText>Ben Bernanke </nameText></person>said, which is sort of all over the map. Where does that leave investors?</p><p>HOUGH: It is unusual to see a special press release like that with a sort of dissenting view. And I think it is already a tumultuous time for the market. I don't think there's any kind of financial Armageddon. I mean, where people are getting crazy about losing a few percent in the stock market. Keep in mind the market is double in nearly, you know, in about four years, and treasury rates are up (INAUDIBLE), were 2.5 percent for the average over the past 50 years, it is over six percent. So we don't have skyrocketing interest rates something like that.</p><p>FRANCIS: It says that the whole point is we need these guys. I mean, they are doing -- they have done policy that we have never seen before in our lives. So, we need them to dismount in the cleanest way possible her and get out of it. So far just this week it has been utter chaos.</p><p>My favorite comment because the twitter universe and online to block its fear was alive, with all of these different machination during the week. I love Lawrence McDonald tweeted, somebody that a lot of us follow, he is on TV all the time. He said job opening, portfolio manager need for $3.5 trillion, 70-tons leverage Hedge Fund unlimited borrow, no marked market, see Federal Reserve.</p><p>Does not inspire confidence? I mean, everybody is joking about what is going on. It does tell you don't have a lot of confidence of what is going on.</p><p>POWELL: Well, nobody here has confidence because we don't know how this is going to be around. But, it is so much better that they are telling us this stuff. We don't want to invest blindly. We don't want to have another secret.</p><p>FRANCIS: They telling us, what though? They are telling us all different things. I mean, Bullard says we could ease more. <person><nameText>Ben Bernanke </nameText></person>says we are getting out, President Obama says he is fired, telling us what?</p><p>POWELL: Well, <person><nameText>Bernanke </nameText></person>started, I think, on the 22nd of May by giving us the first inkling that there thinking about chasing, and I think in this particular -- the comments this week really dealt with the fact that we are creating a plan to taper. This is a very good thing. It is so much better to have a plan than to be shooting from the hips which was not good.</p><p>FRANCIS: So, how do we all set ourselves up for this because this is the take away that we want for our audience here? It means that interest rates are going up, maybe, my thought is give anything interest-rate sensitive whether it is an adjustable mortgage or it is credit card rates you want to keep an eye on that, maybe it is a great time in real estate to transact whether you are a buyer or a seller. I mean, if you are a buyer, this is probably as good as the rates are going to be. If you are seller, you may want to transact because it is the most money that a buyer is going to have. What do you think?</p><p>POWELL: Buyers may start rushing in because they have been sitting back waiting to see what is going to happen, now they saw a real choice. If interest rates go up, every point that goes up they lose purchasing power or borrowing power. So, it can push the real estate market, actually, up in the short run.</p><p>FRANCIS: In the short run. In the long run, I mean, Jack, would you agree with that? In the long run, it is bad for the real estate market because higher interest rates make it tougher.</p><p>HOUGH: I'm on sure there is anyone here is on the fence right now, that waiting for a little less of the mortgage rate before they buy, I mean, that ship has sailed. But I think in terms of investors right now, you hold onto some extra cash because there's a possibility both stocks and bonds are going to be weak at the same time. We don't a lynch how an interesting piece of research what they said. Right now, inflations is actually coming down and interest rates are going up, which is a rarity. It happened in 1994, at that time tech stocks outperformed, utilities got hurt, they were recommending the same thing right now.</p><p>FRANCIS: Interesting point of view.</p><p>All right, thanks to both of you. Good stuff.</p><p>HOUGH: Thank you.</p><p>FRANCIS: Time now for today's fuel gauge report. China and Russia signing $270 billion oil deal. It is one of the biggest in history. Rosneft, Russian's state owned oil company will double supplies to China. It could reach up to 900,000 barrels per day. That is according to Vladimir Putin. The 25 year deal makes chin China the biggest customer for Russian oil.</p><p>U.S. gasoline demand for May fell to a 13 year low. That is according to the American Petroleum Institute. Demand slipped by 3.3 percent to about 8.7 million barrels per day.</p><p>And Oil futures is getting smacked for a second session, a stronger U.S. dollar largely fueling oil decline. It posted its biggest two-day drop in a year losing about 4.5 percent. Crude settled at $93.69 a barrel. Big move on the week.</p><p>All right, up next, <person><nameText>Michael Dell </nameText></person>versus Carl Icahn, it is the face-off only the power of money could create. We are going to tell you how it is turning personal now.</p><p>Plus, the reason the government has gotten so good at spying on you is because it is coaching top talent from Silicon Valley. Maybe you didn't know that. We got details on the stunning revelation in the NSA scandal.</p><p>More \"Money\" coming up.</p><p>FRANCIS: The battle between two Wall Street titans is getting bigger and personal, by the way. <person><nameText>Michael Dell </nameText></person>now launching a personal pitch to buy out his ubiquitous company, and pushed Icahn's offer out of the way, but will it deliver or well Icahn when out? It is all about the power of \"Money.\"</p><p>Here to weigh in is \"Wall Street Journal\" business editor, Dennis Berman and Jonas Max Ferris at MaxFunds.com.</p><p>Great to have you both on the show.</p><p>Dennis, let me start with you. This is battle of the titans. I mean, these are two enormous egos out there, so how do you size of the whole think?</p><p>DENNIS BERMAN, BUSINESS EDITOR, WALL STREET JOURNAL: I see Dell winning, Icahn losing.</p><p>FRANCIS: Really? How come?</p><p>BERMAN: Simple reason. The best chance for Dell to beaten was a potential rival bid from another private equity firm. Carl Icahn, at this point, he could do a lot of great noise and smoke and a lot of activity, but when it comes down to it the shareholder will have to say that he wants to take this offer or do we not? And right now, given the market where they are, they are probably going to take the offer of $14 per share.</p><p>FRANCIS: So Jonas, what do you think? I mean, his basically saying Silver Lake wins the day because, of course, that too smacky (ph) <person><nameText>Michael Dell?</nameText></person></p><p>JONAS MAX FERRIS, MARKET WATCHER, MAXFUNDS.COM: Because I think people would rather side with the guy who started the company in his dorm room then some Wall Street raider. I just don't think that that is -- that guy is going to fix it.</p><p>FRANCIS: The guy has started the company in his dorm room, but has kind of driven it into the ground, right?</p><p>FERRIS: Well, by that logic every tech CEO who isn't Apple or Samsung should be fired because they all missed the smart phone revolution. Go down the line, everybody screwed up. And the whole PC, this has come on land. That was original cornerstone of the business was assembling PC box. That is a dying business and it is easy to say, he missed the smart phone and pad revolution, yes, it is good. But everybody didn't because it is really hard to compete.</p><p>FRANCIS: I don't know. I mean, Dennis, right here you have his whole plan, <person><nameText>Michael Dell's </nameText></person>whole plan right here, for how he will turn the company around. And we were talking about this is the commercial break is that if he has this brilliance, why hasn't he done it already, why doesn't he do it while the company is public? I mean, just do it, you know. Why do you have to take (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>BERMAN: I think you make a really good point. I agree with you. And, if you read this and it doesn't take long because he doesn't write very much here you will be relatively uninspired by what with <person><nameText>Michael dell </nameText></person>has to say. You will be relatively uninspired by what <person><nameText>Michael Dell </nameText></person>has to say. It is what I would call problem. It is generic. It does not say anything.</p><p>But, whether he says anything here or not or whether Carl Icahn is the right person to be a part of dell, really, it doesn't matter is there's only one thing that matters, to shareholders want to accept the price for dell right now? There are no offers being the price of the stock is trading below the $14 offer. It the market that telling us that will probably be accepted. Although, it may not be easy at the moment.</p><p>FRANCIS: Jonas, if you are a shareholder -- but, are you, by the way?</p><p>FERRIS: We all own it through mutual funds indirectly. Directly, don't bow and very few people only this directly. It is not growth stock getting more and the public only owns like Apple directly users all along by --.</p><p>FRANCIS: So, would say, give me the $14 let me the hell out of the stock? So, I can just forget about Dell and go off.</p><p>FERRIS: Because I think Icahn is playing an a head start for proxy movie, who with all the movie with the executives try to pretend the company was worthless so they can buy the stock at a cheap price and then by putting the bad CEO in. That was the movie. I think that is what the spin is here, the Dell rule is down talking the stock so he could take it private.</p><p>FRANCIS: So you think it has more value than Roe (ph).</p><p>FERRIS: I do think so.</p><p>FRANCIS: Really? Why, what is so valuable?</p><p>FERRIS: Well, it is a long shot, but without the PC business, I think there is still an angle to be some sort of IBM asks more, you know, selling silver type in software company. It is not a huge growth opportunity, but I think there is something there that is more valuable than the current share price. That is a better price for a lot of non-Apple, Samsung companies today.</p><p>FRANCIS: What do you think, Dennis? Is that possible?</p><p>BERMAN: It is certainly possible. And this is that the fundamental complex. The real tension inside this management by IPOs, what does the guy at the top of the ladder know that I don't know that he shares with us? And should I trust him, or should I not?</p><p>Here is another great example. J. Crew, great company. We all know that company. It went private after the CEO basically forced and offer down his owned shareholder's growth. So, Jonas makes a fair point about the conflicts inherent in that those dynamics. But again, as it stands now, roughly 15 percent or so of shares are a lied against BBO (ph).</p><p>FRANCIS: But wait, but other than him knowing something we all don't, what would be his other reason for wanting to take it private?</p><p>FERRIS: I would say vanity. It is his business. He has got his name on it. It is hard to walk away. You don't want it to die. It is called Dell. It is not Microsoft, you know. It holds on Bill Gates' software. So, it is like there's a certain element where you want it to succeed.</p><p>FRANCIS: So, it is either vanity or he knows something we don't? Real quick before we go, what is your bet, vanity or he knows something we don't?</p><p>FERRIS: I think it is still worth more than it is. I do think all these tycoons, these are old, are going to go private at some point because --.</p><p>FRANCIS: So, he knows something we don't. That's how I'm going to interpret that.</p><p>Dennis, what do you think, vanity or he know something we don't?</p><p>BERMAN: I say the answer is both. But, in the end --</p><p>FRANCIS: How can it be both? Pick one.</p><p>BERMAN: Well, he is both vain and he knows something that we don't. Those can both motivations. In the end, the shareholders are going to bite because --.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS: OK. Guys, you are fantastic, thank you.</p><p>BERMAN: Thank you.</p><p>FRANCIS: Coming up on \"Money,\" if you knew facebook former chief security officer but feel like he has dropped off the radar, here is why. He is now working for the NSA and he is not alone. We will tell you how Silicon Valley is getting help to the government's prying eyes.</p><p>Plus, former Enron CEO, Jeff Skilling, hits 10 years, why he stop his prison sentence? And it could be a dream come true for white-collar criminals.</p><p>Stay right where you are and find out why.</p><p>Do you ever have too much \"Money\"?</p><p>FRANCIS: Weather it is on Wall Street or Main Street, here is to make \"Money\" today.</p><p>Actually, I can start with who made money. Larry Ellison, the CEO of Oracle, lost so much money I have to do that one first. Oracle's latest earnings were a big disappointment on Wall Street. And as a result, the shares plunged more than nine percent today. So Larry Ellison owns 1.1 billion shares of Oracle. That means he lost $3.4 billion today, $3.4 billion. I had to put that in perspective. Ellison bought the whole island of Lanai last year for $300 million. So, he lost the equivalent of 11 Hawaiian Islands today.</p><p>Meanwhile, trying to make \"Money\" today, Starbucks, it is raising drink cause for first time in almost two years. The average price hike will be about one percent. Starbucks blames rising rent and labor cost for the increase.</p><p>And the Miami heat championship win proving a ratings gold mine for ABC. Nearly 18 percent of you at home watched game seven last night. That is according to Nielsen. It is the second highest rating for an NBA game in 11 years, a sign of the times and congratulations.</p><p>So, if you have been following the NSA spy scandal you may wonder how tight the government really is with big tech companies like facebook, for example. Well, a shocking report reveal that actually left to go work for the NSA back in 2010 and evidently, he is not the only big tech exec that's made the move from Silicon Valley to government spy agency.</p><p>That brings up a lot of questions and concerns, namely what kinds of info are these ex-tech employees bringing to their new job. With me on this frightening development is managing director of TechnoBuffalo, Roy Choi.</p><p>Welcome back to the show, Roy.</p><p>ROY CHOI, MANAGING DIRECTOR, TECHNOBUFFALO: Thank you.</p><p>FRANCIS: I mean, should we be afraid of this? I mean, this is a guy who was in charge of protecting our own private personal information on facebook and he eventually took the knowledge and the keys of the kingdom and went to go work for an agency that is now spying on us.</p><p>CHOI: I think we have to assume that, you know, employees as tech companies like facebook, Google, Skype, they have this information and they're going to go somewhere and may be to the NSA and feed that.</p><p>FRANCIS: So, you are basically saying, we have to assume that everything we put online could eventually be handed over to people who are spying on us? And you just have to be satisfied with that?</p><p>CHOI: Yes. They have policies in place, but when you turn into reality you will see that information isn't always word is supposed to be. We will claim it is 100 percent locks down, but how many times have we seen leaks weathered his credit card information or online information leaks either accidentally or a hole in the security software or malicious hackers going in and getting this information.</p><p>So, I can't say that people are always going to be secure. And you know, I think people are under the assumption when I post something online, it is going to be there for public consumption. But you know, it is beyond that, it is the metadata, it is the stuff you don't necessarily see.</p><p>FRANCIS: What will be his motivation for leaving a place like facebook? You have to imagine that at the level he was, he was making a lot of money and owned a lot of stock and did really well. Why would you leave and go and work for the government?</p><p>CHOI: Who knows? Maybe it is a greater challenge. Maybe, you know, facebook has been a huge supporter of helping fight crime a couple of years ago. And I am not saying this particular security official, but the most recent security official actually implemented a program where they could actually search through content, so there was anything that is a sexual predator was out there and putting in language that would be a little worry some for law enforcement, they would openly give that information out. And you know, they have actually stated their policy is as long as there is a court order or any type of subpoena they would hand that information freely in order to protect users. And at that point, they were under a lot of pressure to help especially with lots of sexual predators lurking on facebook.</p><p>FRANCIS: That's one thing. But you know, when I have asked that question in the past of hackers and the like, why would you go from the private sector where you are making a lot of money to work for the NSA or any government agency for a lot less. They say that they are allowed to do things when you're working for the NSA that you're not allowed to do in regular life, and you are allowed to spy in a way that you can't do for a private company. So you combine sort of that ability and ambition with someone who knows the intimate ins and outs of a facebook or a Google and you get a very powerful government who could spy on us even more than we ever imagined. Your thoughts on that?</p><p>CHOI: Definitely. And I think, when we look at, in terms of national security, in terms of our own security, privately, you are going to see the internet as like the next forum, whether that is in a proactive manner or a reactive manner. So, for someone to leave from Silicon Valley, the constraints of, you know, regulations and whatever else, you know, maybe you go to the NSA, maybe you go to another government agency, but you do get that level of freedom to go out and use your talents to make your mark.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p>Roy, thank you so much for coming on the show. Appreciate your time.</p><p>CHOI: Thank you. Appreciate it.</p><p>FRANCIS: Up next on \"Money,\" we are going to Jeffrey Skilling. He committed one of the worst acts of corporate fraud in U.S. history. Well, the former Enron CEO is now getting out of prison 10 years ahead of schedule. We are going to explain why this is music to the ears of white- collar criminals everywhere.</p><p>Plus, a bipartisan group of senators wants to block U.S. military funding for Syrian rebels. You may like the sound of that, but will we have to spend even more if we don't act now? One of the many top experts breaks down the numbers for us.</p><p>Piles of \"money\" coming up.</p><p>MELISSA FRANCIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: New developments today in the case of convicted white-collar felon, Jeffrey Skilling. The former Enron CEO has served six and half years of a 24-year sentence, so far, for bringing down the world's largest energy trader. It was one of the worst acts of corporate fraud in U.S. history.</p><p>But today, his sentence was sliced by 10 years. Meaning, now, he's going to be out in just seven and a half years instead of 17 1/2 years from now. So, what does his short and sentence mean for white-collar criminals? Here with the dish is our go to lawyer, Arthur Aidala.</p><p>ARTHUR AIDALA, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST: Dish?</p><p>FRANCIS: Dish. Yes.</p><p>AIDALA: Is that a legal term?</p><p>FRANCIS: It is. You didn't know that, because you're a lawyer. You should know.</p><p>AIDALA: -- any Italian food, so I don't know what the dishes (ph) are about.</p><p>FRANCIS: What is the deal?</p><p>AIDALA: The deal here is this. He appeals -- he gets convicted, gets this huge sentence --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS: I mean, he didn't kill anyone.</p><p>AIDALA: He didn't kill anyone, but let me double check my map here. $60 billion in Enron stock was rendered worthless. $2 billion in employee pension were rented worthless. It's a lot of guilt (ph).</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p>AIDALA: That's a lot of money going on there. So -- and more importantly that a lot of money, it's a lot of people who got affected. I mean, lives were ruined, lives were destroyed. So, he gets this really rough sentence. He -- (INAUDIBLE) who supposed to go get sentenced and get wiped out, he dies, so that wipes out his conviction. And, he appeals all the way up to the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court basing the rules in his favor saying one of the ways -- one of the convictions against him was improper.</p><p>They go to a lower court about it. Should there be a new trial? Should there be a new trial? The bottom line is, they say that he was sentenced to nine years too many, and for them not to re-appeal, because he could have, the government said look --</p><p>FRANCIS: Nine years too many in which -- in what then? Why?</p><p>AIDALA: Because the guideline calculations, which is the very complicated way.</p><p>FRANCIS: They did the bath rock (ph).</p><p>AIDALA: Well, they applied things the wrong way. In federal court unlike state court, to figure someone's sentence, you need like a small calculus degree. It's crazy. And basically, in court, the judges said, you did this the wrong way, you came about this the wrong way, therefore, there's at least nine years that he's got tacked on that shouldn't be tacked on.</p><p>FRANCIS: So, are white-collar criminals everywhere rejoining because the scuttlebutt on this all week long has been that the sentences for financial crimes up late. I mean, if you look at (INAUDIBLE). I mean, all of this has been very stiff.</p><p>AIDALA: Well, what -- right.</p><p>FRANCIS: And is this the beginning of a reduction in the sentences for financial crisis, which as you said, ruined a lot of lives --</p><p>AIDALA: A lot of lives.</p><p>FRANCIS: -- but in many cases are longer than murder convictions.</p><p>AIDALA: Correct. But literally, like a murder conviction, you're really affecting like one person and one family. This affected --</p><p>FRANCIS: Right. But they're dead as opposed to I don't have money. I mean, we should rather be alive --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>AIDALA: But there are these charts in the federal law that when you commit a crime, you start off at a very -- a below base level which is like a non-jail sentence. And then depending on how much money was stolen or how much fraud or how much tax evasion, that's what you come up with the numbers. So, if it's just a minimal amount like 100 million, you're at one level.</p><p>FRANCIS: Very little. Yes.</p><p>AIDALA: When it's 60 billion, you're at the highest level. You're literally off the charts. The United State Supreme Court did say that the way they convicted him under this honest services fraud law, which is a very complicated thing to explain, was not done properly. So, yes, a door has been opened to criminal defendants to tell the government, you need to prosecute us in this way, not in that way. And it may have lightened the load on them. But, you know --</p><p>FRANCIS: Sounds like you don't think the original 24 was that unfair (ph), though.</p><p>AIDALA: I mean, they did some bad stuff. They hurt a lot of people. They hurt a lot of retired people who are like -- I mean, you go from thinking like, going to bed, thinking I have a half a million dollars in the bank and I'm 80 years old to I have nothing in the bank and I'm 80 years old.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p>AIDALA: Hello!</p><p>FRANCIS: Arthur, thank you so much.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS: You did a great job. There's smoke coming out of your ears.</p><p>AIDALA: I learn about the dish. I dished it. I knew about the dish. Thank you, folks.</p><p>FRANCIS: Turning now to a much more serious topic, the unsettling situation in Syria. All eyes are on the country's reports (ph) on chemical weapons use and see frightening images of escalating violence. Now, some Lawmakers here at home are trying to block any U.S. funding to armed rebels.</p><p>Of course, we know the story is about a lot more than money. There's an enormous human toll, but our show is called MONEY, so we're going to focus on that angle. We're going to take a closer look at whether or not it would actually cost us more to get involved now or not.</p><p>Joining us now with his take is Zuhdi Jasser, president of the American Islamic Forum for Democracy. Always nice to have you, Zuhdi.</p><p>ZUHDI JASSER, AMERICAN ISLAMIC FORUM FOR DEMOCRACY: Thanks, Melissa. It's great to be with you.</p><p>FRANCIS: You know, we're trying to break down the cost. As we said, huge human toll, you know, for humanitarian reasons you may or may not want to get involved, but looking at just the dollar part of it, what is the cost of doing nothing at this point?</p><p>JASSER: Well, we have two and half years, Melissa, of the revolution to know what that cost is. And just some numbers from Tel Aviv University, it looks like in Jordan, it costs $35 per refugee just to house them per year. So, you're looking right now at three to four million refugees that have been displaced in Syria.</p><p>FRANCIS: Who's paying for that?</p><p>JASSER: That's the thing. Jordan is paying for some of it, but we're paying a lot of it. We've already paid over half a billion dollars through USAID into the region, and it's looking like the refugees are going to reach six million by the end of the year, and our money is into it.</p><p>It's going to be in the billions whether we do, you know, nothing militarily or not, it's going to be -- it's a part of the region that if we're going to continue to try to maintain stability, the humanitarian aid is not only the compassionate thing to do, it has to be done militarily strategically or otherwise the entire region will implode with sectarian violence and our ally in the region. Israel will certainly be threatened.</p><p>FRANCIS: If we do something, that is incredibly expensive, already looking at the estimates. A no-fly zone in the first 10 days alone would cost $1.4 billion. And it expands from there, right?</p><p>JASSER: Oh, absolutely. And you know, the no-fly zone -- yes, Libya was a bit cheaper, but they're looking -- this is more like Iraq. Syria has a more sophisticated military that would need to be taken out, and somewhere of 50 to 100 million a day, they say. But still, I think the cost and a lot of experts have said this the cost are going to be less, as Michael O'Hanlon (ph) from Brookings said, it's a bargain if we can end this war earlier.</p><p>Because look, two and half years have proven this war is going nowhere. Assad maybe winning as far as militarily, but the attrition from the Syrian army continues. It's only how long, how many months or years when Assad will finally fall. And if we want to have a play in the region and be involved in the right side of history and help move them towards, we defeat Assad first as the strategy and second defeat al Qaeda.</p><p>If we want to play a role in that, we have to be on the right side of history to fight against the Iran, fight against Hezbollah, et cetera. Not with troops.</p><p>FRANCIS: -- on the right side of history and some are arguing that it's too late for that. That early on, we could have been fighting against Hezbollah and Assad. And when we originally saw pictures of children being slaughtered, that was the time to get involved, but we didn't. And now, at this point, al Qaeda and extremists have gotten involved.</p><p>On the other side, and it's become now al Qaeda versus Hezbollah, which isn't our fight, neither of those folks are our friends, and we should just stay out of it. That is one of the theories that's out there. I'll give you the last word on why you don't agree with that, if you don't.</p><p>JASSER: Well, that calculus of characterizing the opposition of al Qaeda is just not correct. The Syrian population has become more radicalized and they're becoming more, you know, chaotic and committing atrocities, but that's because we've done nothing. If we come to the side of helping the millions -- there's only tens of thousands of al Qaeda -- the millions of Syrians in this opposition, we will help defeat the ultimate source of the radicalization which is Assad.</p><p>And remember, Hezbollah, the forms of terror in the Middle East is Iran. So, those on my (ph) conservative side that believe that doing nothing will allow al Qaeda to die, actually, al Qaeda is thriving, Hezbollah is thriving. Terror will thrive without our involvement. So, the question is, which side has less terror? I believe doing something would.</p><p>FRANCIS: Zuhdi Jasser, thank you so much for your thoughts tonight. We always appreciate it.</p><p>JASSER: Thank you. Appreciate it.</p><p>FRANCIS: We have some breaking news right now on Facebook. Let's go to Fox Business' Jo Ling Kent with the latest. Jo Ling, what do you have?</p><p>JO LING KENT, FOX BUSINESS: Melissa, Facebook is confirming on their website that a security breach has exposed six million e-mail addresses and telephone numbers. And let me tell you a little bit more of what they're saying on the website.</p><p>They found, they said, through their white hat security researching program that they use that, quote, \"that may have allowed some of a person's contact information e-mail or phone number to be accessed by people who either had some contact information about the person or some connection to that person.\"</p><p>So, they're saying six million e-mail addresses and telephone numbers were shared, but Facebook was also very quick to note in its statement that no other types of personal or financial information were included and only people on Facebook, not developers or advertisers, had access to this information.</p><p>So, certainly, a very alarming security breach has happened at Facebook, and we'll continue to bring you more a little bit later, Melissa.</p><p>FRANCIS: Wow. Jo Ling, thanks so much.</p><p>All right. Coming up on MONEY, surviving the end of the world sounds tough. Indoor pool, a bowling alley, a golf, maybe it wouldn't be that bad. A California developer is opening the world's largest doomsday shelter. This will be an underground resort. It's fabulous. He's taking reservations. He joins us with all the details, because at the end of the day, the end of the world, it's all about MONEY.</p><p>FRANCIS: Talk about surviving in style. Vivos Survival Shelter and Resort is the chicest doomsday shelter out there. For a few thousand bucks, you and yours (ph) can be safe from any number of impending disasters. Cozily nestled 100 feet below in Atchison Kansas, and you can live in your shelter in your very own RV -- wow! -- for up to a year. There is big money to be made in the bunker business.</p><p>Joining me now is Robert Vicino. He is founder and CEO of Vivos Group and the owner of the fabulous shelter. Thank you so much for coming on.</p><p>ROBERT VICINO, VIVOS GROUP FOUNDER AND CEO: It's my honor.</p><p>FRANCIS: I understand that this is a space that the army previously used. They auctioned it off. And what gave you the idea to make it into a doomsday shelter?</p><p>VICINO: Well, we've been in the shelter business for the last five years building Vivos shelters around the world. And, typically, whenever a government shelter or facility comes up, we try to buy it and then retrofitted and convert it into a modern day blast shelter. This one was auctioned by the GSA and we jumped on it.</p><p>FRANCIS: What is it like? What happens when I arrived there?</p><p>VICINO: It is a turnkey four-star underground hotel/cruise ship. It's everything you could imagine. It's not just a survival shelter. It is truly a destination resort where you and your family and your children would want to go to many times a year, perhaps, in the middle of the winter where it' s 70 degrees inside this mountain year round. So, you will be very comfortable.</p><p>FRANCIS: Do people come even if there's not a disaster by space (ph). Can I come and hang out?</p><p>VICINO: Anytime you want. You can't permanently live there, but yes, it's open 24/7 forever. And so, you buy your space and you park your RV there, whatever you're comfortable with, be it a 20-footer or 45-foot motor home for a million dollar. And it's a one-time charge, and you know, it's yours, you're a co-owner of this what would be a billion dollar replacement.</p><p>FRANCIS: Does it cost me a million dollars? I mean, I read that it's $1,000 per lineal foot. The average RV is about 30 feet, so that's $30,000, and there's $1,500 charge per person, but I don't know what -- over what period of time. How much would it cost me? I have a husband and two kids, what are you going to charge me?</p><p>VICINO: Well, you're the perfect nuclear family.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes. Thank you.</p><p>VICINO: And, it would cost no extra charge for any of those family members, the only thing you're paying for is the RV, itself, by the lineal foot. So, if you had a 30-foot RV, it's $30,000 and four children or four people for food, that's a one year food supply. It's another 6,000. So, for $36,000, you've got yourself an investment and a life assurance policy or --</p><p>FRANCIS: How many people have signed up, so far? How much money have you made?</p><p>VICINO: Well, not enough. We've had 25,000 applications over the last few years. The primary problem has been the cost. People can't afford our other shelters where it's a per person rate as much as $50,000. So, this --</p><p>FRANCIS: So, of those 25,000, how many people have locked it in?</p><p>VICINO: On this new one, we just announced it last week in or membership, and we've got a few hundred already signed up. So, it's going to happen very quickly. We'll sell out. This one will accommodate only 1,500 RVs or about 5,000 people, which I like to say is almost one in a million people on Earth.</p><p>FRANCIS: This one makes me nervous about this. So, you're all the way in Kansas. I'm in New York, for example. What kind of doomsday disaster would come my way that I would have enough time to get there?</p><p>VICINO: Oh, let's say a nuke went off in L.A. or in Washington or in the Middle East, or let's say where about to see a major economic meltdown, which could happen any day, as you know, or let's say the earth was rumbling or an asteroid was on its way. Things --</p><p>FRANCIS: I would have enough time to get there?</p><p>VICINO: It's time to go. And you may go and it may not happen, and so, it's a false alarm just like the fireman goes to the --</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p>VICINO: -- but at least you have somewhere to go versus the other seven billion people on the planet that will have no solution, nowhere to go, and they'll be scrambling. And you don't want to be a part of that mash (ph). You want to go. You want to have a safe haven. You'll be underground in what we call effectively a fortress.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK. Robert, thanks for coming on the show. Interesting idea. Sounds like -- I'll be interested to see if it's a good business, if you sell out, because -- I mean, there's a lot to be afraid of these days. I don't know. People want an insurance policy. Thanks for coming on. Keep us posted.</p><p>VICINO: My pleasure.</p><p>FRANCIS: Here is our MONEY question of the day. How much would you pay for a spot on world's biggest doomsday shelter? Not surprisingly, I got a lot of funny responses to this one, including Less Than Zero. \"I'd rather die than live in Kansas.\" Come on! Come on. Kansas is a nice place. That was mean.</p><p>We want to hear from more of you. You can like us on Facebook at acebook.com/MelissaFrancisFox or follow me on Twitter @MelissaAFrancis.</p><p>All right. Coming up on MONEY. Oh, bless you, Kanye and Kim. You gave your baby a name even crazier than we thought possible. And there's developing news on what the middle name is, too. We've got it all in \"Spare Change.\" You can never have too many insane celebrities.</p><p>FRANCIS: All right. Welcome to \"Spare Change.\" We are joined by Jarrod Guy Randolph and we also have Hitha Prabhakar here. Thanks to both of you for coming on. A little \"Spare Change\" fun on this Friday.</p><p>HITHA PRABHAKAR, RETAIL ANALYST: Thanks for having us.</p><p>FRANCIS: All right. First, we are going to look at some birthdays at work. If it is not already bad enough that you're in the office for your birthday, check this out. This birthday card we saw, you literally just check the box next to your name. Can you imagine that, to show your love? I mean, come on. You can't even sign your name anymore.</p><p>What would you do if you got this card? You check the box next to your names. You check, you know, best wishes, happy birthday, get hammered on us. I don't know.</p><p>PRABHAKAR: I got to be honest with you, this is actually a nicer card than I received from most of my family members for my birthday.</p><p>FRANCIS: What?</p><p>PRABHAKAR: Yes.</p><p>FRANCIS: You need a new family.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS: What is worse than this card, no card at all or do the cards say does it have so many else's name in it? I mean, what is worse than this card?</p><p>PRABHAKAR: Misspelled name.</p><p>FRANCIS: Hitha is pretty straightforward. Hitha Prabhakar, I don't want to have to spell on television, but Hitha, I could do.</p><p>PRABHAKAR: No one really sign their names either. It was just kind of --</p><p>FRANCIS: Really?</p><p>PRABHAKAR: Yes.</p><p>FRANCIS: Wow.</p><p>PRABHAKAR: Yes. So --</p><p>FRANCIS: You're going to be in therapy for that for a long time.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRANCIS: Jarrod, what about you?</p><p>JARROD GUY RANDOLPH, CORE VICE PRESIDENT: I don't think there was follow-through on that card. It was supposed to lead in the something else, but I mean --</p><p>FRANCIS: Like what?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RANDOLPH: If birthday cards look like that, I can only imagine what the annual holiday bonus looks like.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p>RANDOLPH: So, for me, I'd be a little upset if my co-workers gave that to me.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK. So, this is a new case for your iPhone. It doubles as a stun gun to prevent any accidental discharge. Yes, I would hope. Users have to flip two switches before activating the gun. The case sells for 140 bucks. And the co-founder says sales could exceed a million dollars this year.</p><p>Is this just a must have or is it a lawsuit waiting to happen? I'm wondering, what happens when you accidentally but dial with your iPhone. That's a stun gun (ph). That would be quite a shock.</p><p>PRABHAKAR: Not only is it a lawsuit waiting to happen, it's a disaster waiting to happen. I mean, I can't tell you how many times I get misdialed phones from different people. I misdial (ph) phone. Also, if you're getting attacked, why would you want to on latch (ph) something and then security check this. I mean, wouldn't you want to just kind of go for it and try to protect yourself?</p><p>RANDOLPH: I see the value on this product.</p><p>FRANCIS: You do?</p><p>RANDOLPH: This will be even (ph) my secret weapon. You will buy a $50 million apartment. I'm going to start using this with my client.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>RANDOLPH: I mean, I don't see why not. If this actually became an approved Apple accessory. So --</p><p>FRANCIS: What? Really?</p><p>RANDOLPH: It's kind of amazing.</p><p>FRANCIS: There should be a breathalyzer attached to it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RANDOLPH: They're going to come up with that.</p><p>PRABHAKAR: Right.</p><p>RANDOLPH: And if you go on the website, the pink ones are the ones that have sold out first. I'm just waiting for the camouflage.</p><p>FRANCIS: How much is the cost? Does anybody know?</p><p>RANDOLPH: I think it's about $140.</p><p>FRANCIS: Wow! That's amazing. Well, there's a Christmas gift.</p><p>All right. So, the big baby news of the week, a bizarre name given. Reality princess, Kim Kardashian and rapper baby daddy, Kanye West, have chosen the name North, North, for their baby girl. Think about that for a second. The baby's name is Northwest, no middle name. I mean, they're running this child's life or they giving it direction.</p><p>PRABHAKAR: All right. We can safely assume that it's not a fan of One Direction, right, the band?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRANCIS: OK. All right. I like that. That was good. Jarrod, what do you think about this?</p><p>RANDOLPH: The middle name should be Southeast. So, it's north, south, east, west. I mean, I actually can't believe we're talking about this right now.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>RANDOLPH: But think about it, there were other names that could have come up with. Lampshade, soda can. I mean, they could have named it anything.</p><p>FRANCIS: Seven, Pepsi. I don't know. All those --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRANCIS: One of the worst names ever.</p><p>PRABHAKAR: I like the east and west. Wasn't east and west --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS: And we wrap up the week. Our own Tom Sullivan has some doubts about the direction of our economy. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TOM SULLIVAN, FOX BUSINESS: Something isn't right about the economy. I'm trying to be positive, and yes, the economy has expanded every quarter going back to 2009. But it's consistently weak growth. The job market, it's also improving, but not enough to soak up all of the new people that are coming into the job market, the young grads and immigrants. And housing, it seems to be doing better. In fact, in some places, there's another price bubble growing.</p><p>But, it's because there are two few homes for sale and that's largely because whopping (ph) number, 44 percent of homeowners are either under water or they don't have enough equity to pay a realtor to sell their home, so they sit. And it's the same number, 44 percent of people who told CNN in a poll this week that they are worse off economically now than compared to just one year ago.</p><p>The huge portion of the country is still hurting. The markets are nervous about the fed slowing down its artificial pumping of the economy. I get that, but even though I don't like what the fed is done, I don't see the fed making any big changes, and I don't see this fragile economy jumping out of its sick bed anytime soon.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FRANCIS: Well, that's true. Thanks, Tom. Be sure to watch \"The Tom Sullivan Show\" this weekend. You can catch it at 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. on Saturday, and on Sunday at 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. Happy Friday, everyone. Thanks to both of you for joining us. Have a great weekend. I'll see you back here on Monday.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MONEY-2013062101cb230</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2013</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:58PV-W8J1-JB20-G121-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416174</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-06-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7441\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2013 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MONEY</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"06\" year=\"2013\"><dateText>June 21, 2013 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Budget</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Economy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Internet</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Middle East</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Technology</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Congress</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Protected Rights</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

In Part II, McNamee, the co-founder of Integral Capital Partners and Silver Lake Partners, discusses technology companies that primarily serve corporate America. His outlook for 2003 and beyond isn't exactly rosy: McNamee doesn't see IT spending picking up, and he expects the Nasdaq to trail the S&amp;P 500 this year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Nonetheless, McNamee does find a few stocks worth buying, including Cisco (CSCO:Nasdaq) and Microsoft (MSFT:Nasdaq). For a better understanding of the tech environment, read on.</p><p>1. OK, let's talk about the enterprise side. You haven't sounded many cheery notes on this area. What do you envision going forward?</p><p>Well, I wanted to start with the positives, so I focused on consumer stuff. (Laughs.)</p><p>The enterprise side we'll start with something positive, also. The difference between January 2002 and January 2003 is that a year ago, there were a huge number of companies that were committed to the notion that the bad news they saw everywhere around them was merely a blip down in an otherwise upward trend. In short, they were expecting some kind of return to the late 1990s, which they perceived as normal. \u00a0(Chart Omitted)</p><p>Today, I don't think there's anybody who believes that. Everyone has recalibrated their business using the current environment as a new baseline. Although cost structures are not uniformly in line with the current level of business, people are committed to getting there. This is a huge change.</p><p>If you want to understand why there were so many upside earnings surprises in the September quarter, all you need to know is that the largest companies were the ones that started making those rightsizing changes first. Wall Street's estimates for the quarter were based on spreadsheets. Spreadsheets just don't do a good job of capturing cost-structure subtleties, where very small favorable variances in revenue produce huge changes in profitability.</p><p> September earnings were terrible, right? But they weren't as bad as Wall Street expected, particularly on a market capitalization-weighted basis. And that's a huge deal.</p><p>2. So they're doing better on the cost-structure side, but what about demand?</p><p>On the demand side, 2003 is likely to be better than 2002. How much better is hard to say. On average, I don't think it's going to be much better. What you're going to see is a very large standard deviation.</p><p>So, you would expect average growth will be very low, but some people are going to benefit disproportionately. People don't buy a little of everything, except when they aren't buying anything.</p><p>Companies have gotten their IT spending down to a much lower level. Now, let's remember one of the rules of enterprise sending: It's a capital expenditure, which means it comes out of profits. In the last three years, there hasn't been much in the way of profits among Fortune 500 companies.</p><p>People have been cutting costs and headcounts willy-nilly to get their cost structure in line. Tech's been an easy place to cut back because the budgets were bloated, a lot of the things they were buying weren't providing a decent return on investment and, if you will, people wanted to just put it behind them.</p><p>Now, companies are deferring some projects that probably are very viable. They're doing so because corporate politics currently is more driven by the cost side. But if you read the data, the economy is starting to perk up a little bit. If you get two or three quarters of expansion even a little bit, you'll get companies saying, OK, we're past the bottom. I can gain competitive advantage through technology. What can I do to do that?</p><p>I think this will start as a trickle, not a flood. I don't expect anything like ERP [enterprise-resource planning] or Y2K in 2003 and maybe even in 2004.</p><p> But some companies are going to start using new tech spending to gain competitive advantage.  You see it already in the tech industry itself, companies like Microsoft and Dell (DELL:Nasdaq) investing and putting a world of hurt on their competitors. Some of their customers will start to do the same thing. That'll provide the signal as to what the next big things are going to be.</p><p>You're going to move from an environment where people are spending on stuff like security to something else. I mean, companies have solved the supply-chain problem, so maybe they'll spend some of it there. They still haven't solved the customer-relationship management problem. And they have to figure out what those problems really are.</p><p>Part of the problem was that companies defined the problems incorrectly. For instance, they thought that the supply-chain problem was solved by B2B Web sites and that customer-relationship management was solved by sticking a gun at the head of your sales guy and saying, \"Give me your contacts.\"</p><p>They ignored some really obvious lessons. The thing that made Amazon.com (AMZN:Nasdaq) so compelling was one-click ordering. How many guys besides Amazon had that, you know? That's customer-relationship management: making the customer happy.</p><p>In turns out there are a couple guys who have the equivalent of that. One of the reasons Ameritrade (AMTD:Nasdaq) has been so successful is that they execute orders a lot faster than their competitors do. Their competitors were sitting there trying to give customers 10,000 pieces of research, Ameritrade figured out that the Internet is the world's largest repository of research. That's not what their customers wanted. They wanted fast execution.</p><p>The secret to success in Silicon Valley on the enterprise side has always been about making enterprises more successful through technology. The problem is, we're coming off a period of time where we sold them a bunch of technology that didn't help them. (Laughs.) So they're suspicious of what we offer, and we're not quite sure what we ought to be offering.</p><p> I suspect we're going to spend most of 2003 figuring that out. This means 2003 is going to be a better year for the incumbents than it is for the start-ups.</p><p>3. Which incumbents specifically will benefit?</p><p>That means market share for guys like Cisco, Microsoft, Oracle (ORCL:Nasdaq) and SAP (SAP:NYSE ADR) is going to go up. [McNamee owns shares of Cisco and Microsoft, but not Oracle and SAP.]</p><p>I don't expect a significant PC upgrade cycle this year. The thing that people are missing is that, again, the law of large numbers has gotten in the way. The PC industry is so big that it's hard to move the needle. They look back at all those PCs bought in 1999 as part of Y2K. Half those people no longer work at those companies. You don't need to upgrade a computer for a guy who's not working anymore. So, these upgrade cycles just feel like business as usual. They're happening, they just don't move the needle.</p><p>It may move it a little this year if people are sufficiently confident because a lot of deferred purchasing may take place.</p><p>Prices are down a ton, right? In an environment where units aren't growing because business is too big and prices are falling, that's a formula for an ugly environment.</p><p>4. Why, in this environment, do you own Cisco as a top 10 holding? This time a year ago, you were saying Cisco wasn't a good bet. What's changed?</p><p>We bought Cisco back in September.</p><p>Here's the way I look at Cisco: They have more cash than their competitors have in market cap. They're really smart. They're doing things designed to make them stronger.</p><p>Their competitors have been weakened by a lot of factors, not the least of which was the apparent fraud of many of its customers, right? You can say what you will about the folks at Lucent (LU:NYSE) and Nortel (NT:NYSE), but their customer base included a lot of people who appear to be very dishonest.</p><p>Cisco was less exposed to that. You can say that Cisco was lucky in this regard, but the reality is, they're taking advantage of that good fortune.</p><p>I'm of the view that when the market bottoms and starts back up, you want to start out by owning the most-liquid, best-known things. That's where the money goes first. And it eventually broadens out.</p><p>In this first phase, you want to own companies like Cisco and Microsoft. We own both of those companies. There are reasons why we don't own Oracle and SAP. We think valuations relative to the prospects for the coming year aren't right. Dell is somewhere in between. The stock is OK, and it's a great company. You can't get a more appealing fundamental situation.</p><p>Hewlett-Packard (HWP:NYSE) may work as a stock over the coming year because they can make the numbers work. But, boy, are they going to give up a lot of market share. Heck, they've already given up a lot of market share.</p><p>5. You have mentioned recently the disparity between large-cap tech stocks and smaller-cap tech stocks. Is this still the case, and do you think the small-cap and mid-cap tech companies will represent a better opportunity?</p><p>It's less [of a disparity] since October because you had a great bounce across the board in the little ones.</p><p>I think inevitably over the course of the cycle, the smaller guys will be a better opportunity. The problem with the big companies is they're at some level an index. Also, technology has gone from 4% of the economy to 10% in the course of 20 years. And it won't go from 10% to 20%. It'll go to 12% or 14%. That'll be great, but it will be a lot better for smaller companies.</p><p>Here's the problem: In the public markets, you have to be a stock picker. I think the average tech company is going to underperform the market over the next year or two. But, again, the standard deviation is going to be really high. If you can pick someone with a really good product cycle, you're going to do great, just as you did in 2002.</p><p> One of our funds was up in double digits, the other was basically flat. I'm not going to tell you what the returns were, but I will say it was a really good year for us. There were two reasons. One, I think we had an appropriately cautious view all year. And two, we concentrated our bets most heavily in the consumer area, and that turned out to be right.</p><p>It looks like another tough year for most companies on the enterprise side. The really big incumbents will do relatively better, and some folks who have good product cycles will do well. And it's tricky to predict who those guys are going to be.</p><p>We happen to be very fond of some folks that I can't talk about, sadly. But the pattern-recognition filter you want to have is: You want to find a company that's gaining market share in an industry that is at least stable, which has demonstrated profitability at current business levels.</p><p>That package should be the core of your portfolio. Then you can pick a moderate number of smaller-capitalization folks where there is an opportunity for a product cycle that will cause the company to go from unprofitable to profitable. With the latter, you'll make a larger percentage return but you're also going to have some that don't work out.</p><p>There is an amazing number of really cheap stocks. And the beautiful thing is that the market is far more democratic. As an individual investor, the amount of data that you can get over the Internet is breathtaking. You can get on all the conference calls. But one of the things you learn pretty quickly when you look at all that stuff: It's not really that valuable.</p><p>The really valuable stuff is insight. Figuring out, look, wireless is going to be a much bigger deal in five years than it is today. That doesn't mean that everything in wireless is going to be successful. Quite the opposite, in fact: A lot of things in wireless are not going to be successful. The most successful things in the technology economy are most likely in wireless. Ditto with the consumer.</p><p> But on the enterprise side, we're in a period where there is no obvious next big thing, other than wireless data. But that's OK.</p><p>6. What sort of returns do you expect from the broader market this year?</p><p>We're looking at a year of tough sledding, but people who pick the right stocks are going to have a terrific year.</p><p>My guess is that the S&amp;P 500 actually has a nice positive return -- something in the teens. I think we're due. We've had three negative years in a row, and not just a little negative -- a lot negative. Maybe it's back-end-loaded, who knows? But I think it has a pretty good year.</p><p>But I think tech doesn't do as well. The reason is so much of the resources are on the enterprise side, and the big-cap guys have already moved. So it feels to me that tech probably lags. But you know what? That doesn't mean every tech stock lags. There are going to be some tech stocks that go up 200%, 300%. If you own one of two of them, you're going to have a great year.</p><p>We've made a bunch of bets, and I'm prepared to have to change them as the year goes on. I think some new things are going to emerge.</p><p>You know when the Apollo astronauts were returning from the moon? There's a part of the Earth's atmosphere where they lose communication. We're kind of in the stock-market equivalent of that. There's a lot of stuff going on, and it's really hard to tell what it all means. Each passing month is going to tell us a lot.</p><p>For example, it's very hard to tell what the impact of Iraq and North Korea will be. I can't imagine that it'll be good. But I don't know how bad it will be or for how long. It depends on how it goes. And there's a bunch of stuff going on like that, where you look at it and say, \"Don't know!\"</p><p> We don't have a crystal ball here, and survival as a tech investor is as much as anything a function of knowing when you're in one of those periods where what you know isn't worth much, and what you don't know is really important.</p><p>For sure, we are in one of those. So our investment time horizon is uncharacteristically short; we normally think in multiyear blocks.</p><p>7. Any stocks you feel comfortable with for the long haul?</p><p>We have a few things that look good for the long term -- things like Overture Services (OVER:Nasdaq), which we've owned for several years. We've cut way back on Take-Two (TTWO:Nasdaq), but we've owned that for years. We have owned Symantec (SYMC:Nasdaq) for a couple years, and we own a ton of Verisign (VRSN:Nasdaq). At the price that thing was at in October, it was like we would own it for years. Now, I don't know how long we'll own it, but you know what I mean.</p><p>A lot of these investments get down to P/Es of 4 or 5 and you say, \"That can't be right.\" Either the E is wrong, or the stock's cheap.</p><p>You have to face up to what a friend of mine says: There are no cheap stocks, only wrong estimates. The reality is, we have just come off a prodigious bear market and there were some incredibly cheap stocks. And it's not obvious to me that the ones you want to own for the next five years will get back to the lows of September. And that's a really important point.</p><p>If you're only willing to buy stocks at September valuations, you probably shouldn't be looking at tech. Because the things you're likely to buy, you probably don't want to own.</p><p>This is the point in the cycle where P/E has less meaning than normal. The reason is because the Wall Street estimates are all done on spreadsheets and are all normalized, and it's really hard to forecast the impact of fundamental cost reductions. You have two levels of problem: First, you can't forecast the impact of incremental revenue. Second, you have no idea whether there's incremental revenue or not. You have two ways of being wrong.</p><p> The spreadsheet tends to cause you to hedge your bets both ways. So when people have upside surprises, they tend to have huge upside surprises.</p><p>8. Recently, you've expressed concerns that some of the governmental attempts to reform Wall Street and corporate governance are misguided. Would you elaborate?</p><p>It is really important that we reform the securities industry. During the bull market, there were several flaws in the regulatory fabric that were exposed. They were compounded by bad behavior by what appears to be a small number of very influential people.</p><p>My concern is largely that regulators appear motivated by as much political concerns as a desire to make the securities business a better place. In the process, they've chosen a set of issues that to me don't feel like the most important ones.</p><p>To me, the American capital markets are the greatest in the world and are a crown jewel in our economy. Protecting the integrity of the capital markets is the prime directive of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the accounting industry and the brokerage industry. That's how we make our livelihood and it's really important that we all protect it.</p><p>When it comes to issues like financial disclosure and all that, we should always err on the side of more disclosure to the extent that new regulatory efforts induce greater levels of transparency.</p><p>What we shouldn't lose sight of is that most of what Enron did was actually legal. It is alleged that they looted the company. But those off balance sheet things, where they owned 97% but got to remove it from the balance sheet, that was perfectly legal! You know who allowed that to happen: The Financial Accounting Standards Board.</p><p>They actually passed specific rules to enable that during the 1990s! People are not paying attention to the role the accounting industry, in particular the FASB, played in the financial shenanigans of the past few years.</p><p> Almost all the efforts for reform so far have been more along the lines of putting the fox in charge of the chicken coop -- or the inmates in charge of the asylum, as it were.</p><p>They had that guy from TIAA-CREF [John Biggs] that they were talking about putting on the accounting board -- that would've been great. I don't know that guy at all, and I think CREF has been a little bit crazy on their corporate governance stuff. But I'd rather err on the side of caution than having the way things are currently going, which is to pretend that the accounting industry is part of the solution, not part of the problem.</p><p>There are several levels of things that went wrong in the accounting industry. The most obvious is that the industry was allowed to consolidate too far. There are just too few firms. Second, they were allowed to build consulting businesses serving both information-technology consulting and financial-accounting consulting that operated in direct conflict with their public-accounting mission. They did this to the point where they effectively hollowed out their audit and tax practices to bolster the profitability of these, shall we say, unregulated consulting practices. And they were aided and abetted in this by FASB.</p><p>It would be interesting to get a stack of FASB regulations from the 1990s and see how tall the stack is. Back in 1982, when I started my investment career, the accounting industry was black and white. It was limited, but really clear. Accounting today is needlessly complex and frequently the subject of negotiation. Nothing is black and white anymore.</p><p>As a result, financial statements don't mean much. That is really dangerous. The fact that regulators don't see this scares me. The idea that FASB is independent and doing great things is a joke. If you put a bullet in FASB's head and started over, that would be a great outcome.</p><p> 9. What do you make of the push to tax options?</p><p>Whether we tax options is less significant in the long run than it's being given credit for. You can see what's going on: FASB has proposed taxing options so that they can declare victory on an issue and deflect attention from their own guilt.</p><p>Regulators love this thing because it appears to be a way to help balance budgets and all that stuff. The reality is: It's not the issue. It wasn't the problem. They'll do this, declare victory and move onto some issue like housing. And they'll leave behind this incredible mess and pretend like they've taken care of securities regulation. That's nonsense.</p><p>The reason why you don't want to tax options is very straightforward. Thirty years ago, we viewed the economy in terms of labor and management: Management was the owners; labor worked. Thanks to Silicon Valley and the broad distribution of options that accelerated in the late 1980s, everyone's an owner. It's really democratic. If you tax options, you're not going to cut the amount of options that the management team gets because they hand out the options. You're going to cut the options that they give out to everyday people -- it's less democratic.</p><p>I don't care if that's inconvenient for the accountants. Deal with it! But this will result in more pro forma accounting, because no two companies will do it the same way.</p><p>This whole pursuit of analysts is silly. Did some analysts do things that were really wrong? I suspect they did. Was that really the core of the problem? You must be kidding. When those guys touted stocks up $100 a day, people loved them. The people who hung around the party too long now want to blame everybody but themselves. The analysts are easy people to pick on. The idea that investors didn't know that analysts were being paid by brokerage firms who did investment banking is silly. They weren't paying anything for the research; why did they think it would be unbiased?</p><p> I think it's amazing that the attorney general of New York hasn't figured out yet that the smoking gun is on the investment-banking side.</p><p>Am I surprised by these regulation attempts? No. Am I disappointed? Sure, I'm depressed about it. I thought this was the administration's big chance to do something great for the economy and business, and they just mangled it.</p><p>10. How do you assess management when investing in technology companies, and does it differ at all when viewing a venture opportunity or a mega-cap company?</p><p>This is a great question. I have a new prime directive. The old prime directive is: Technology is always at the top of the list. Here's the problem: The world has changed.</p><p>The analogy I would use is the military in World War I. Between the American Civil War and World War I, the technology of armament progressed very rapidly, and military strategy didn't move at all. In Europe, almost no lessons were learned from the American Civil War.</p><p>The result: People persisted with outmoded strategies in the face of mass destruction. The incredible tragedy of World War I is that, for all intents and purposes, nobody figured it out. They just stopped the war. Incredibly, the French replicated the problem with the Maginot Line. And Hitler was the first guy to figure out\u2026</p><p>Just go around it.</p><p>Yeah, the technology allows you to fight differently. During the course of World War II, various armies made progress in direct proportion to how quickly they incorporated these lessons.</p><p>We have a similar situation today in Silicon Valley. The rules have changed. The skills that made people successful in the late 1990s are not particularly useful right now. We look for executives who have the insight and flexibility to change with the times or companies who make, in effect, battlefield promotions of people who are willing to take the world as it is and make the best of it.</p><p> It's not just that management is at the top of your list -- the skills are also different. In the late 1990s, it was people who showed well. Now it's about people who actually get something done -- it's a lot like it was in the 1980s. It's: \"I don't care what you're going to do next month, what are you doing today?\"</p><p>The sense of urgency in the late 1990s was about marketing communications. The sense of urgency today is about the substance of your business.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSC-#10061363#</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSC2003</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:47MN-X5R0-01HP-11PB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">220623</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3928\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>TheStreet.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19301\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><copyright>Copyright 2003 TheStreet.com, Inc.</copyright><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"01\" year=\"2003\"><dateText>January 7, 2003 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>CISCO SYSTEMS INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><className>\u00a0MICROSOFT CORP\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>\u00a0SILVER LAKE PARTNERS LTD\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>CSCO (NASDAQ)\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><className>\u00a0MSFT (NASDAQ)\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS334210 TELEPHONE APPARATUS MANUFACTURING\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>\u00a0SIC3661 TELEPHONE &amp;

But the software giant has stood apart from Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple in one important respect: Once the bully of the tech world, it has escaped antitrust scrutiny so far.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now Slack Technologies, whose popular chat and collaboration software has become embedded in the daily routines of millions of workers at thousands of companies, is hoping to change that.</p><p>Slack said Wednesday that it had filed a complaint against Microsoft with the European Commission, accusing the tech giant of using its market power to try to crush the upstart rival.</p><p>Slack claims that Microsoft has illegally tied its collaboration software, Microsoft Teams, to its dominant suite of productivity programs, Microsoft Office, wHich includes Outlook, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. That bundling tactic, Slack contends, is part of a pattern of anti-competitive behavior by Microsoft.</p><p>\"Slack threatens Microsoft's hold on business e-mail, the cornerstone of Office, which means Slack threatens Microsoft's lock on enterprise software,\" Jonathan Prince, vice president of communications and policy at Slack, said in a statement.</p><p>Slack's complaint is just a first step. The European Commission must decide if a formal investigation is warranted. In recent years, European regulators have more aggressively pursued antitrust actions against large tech companies than American officials.</p><p>But the complaint threatens Microsoft's recent ability to largely avoid regulatory scrutiny. Federal and state regulators in the US are investigating whether the other tech giants have broken antitrust laws. On Monday, the chief executives of Apple, Amazon, Google, and Facebook will testify before Congress, which is also looking into them.</p><p>Under European rules, the Slack complaint is not made public. But in a news conference, David Schellhase, Slack's general counsel, said the company sought an order to remove Teams from Office, make it a stand-alone product, and charge a \"fair price.\"</p><p>In a statement, Microsoft said, \"We created Teams to combine the ability to collaborate with the ability to connect via video,\" noting that Slack lacks video conferencing.</p><p>Microsoft, the statement added, is \"committed to offering customers not only the best of new innovation but a wide variety of choice in how they purchase and use the product.\" And the company said that it looked forward to \"providing additional information to the European Commission and answering any questions they may have.\"</p><p>The Slack-Microsoft confrontation has some echoes of the Internet browser competition in the 1990s. The browser wars led to a landmark federal antitrust case against Microsoft in the US that found the company repeatedly violated the nation's antitrust laws. Europe also ruled against Microsoft.</p><p>The Internet browser was a layer of software that could be a gateway to online computing. Developers could write software applications that ran on the browser, potentially undermining the role of Microsoft's Windows operating system, the dominant technology of the personal computer era.</p><p>The browser was a rival computing platform. And Netscape Communications, the commercial pioneer of browser software, was Microsoft's enemy.</p><p>Today, Slack serves as a gateway to online work for many people. Developers can write apps that run on Slack. And it is a nascent challenge to one part of Microsoft's business. Now online cloud software is the major platform, and Teams is included in Microsoft's Office 365 cloud suite.</p><p>\"Online collaboration platforms and related tools have become as important to us as smartphones and computers,\" said Michael Cusumano, a professor at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p><p>Whether a software program like Slack could emerge as a genuine business threat to Microsoft is uncertain, industry analysts said. Microsoft has positioned Teams as an all-in-one stop for online video meetings, calls, chat, and collaboration, and it works seamlessly with Microsoft's Office software.</p><p>\"For Microsoft, Teams is increasingly where online work is done,\" said Wayne Kurtzman, an analyst at IDC, a technology research firm. \"It is becoming a platform for Microsoft.\"</p><p>Slack is making its complaint as adoption of collaboration technology is surging. Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Zoom are all experiencing huge demand because of the coronavirus-induced shutdowns that have forced much of the workforce to toil from home.</p><p>In April, when the company reported its quarterly financial results, Microsoft said that Teams had 75 million daily users, more than double the number in early March. At the time, Satya Nadella, Microsoft's chief executive, said, \"We've seen two years' worth of digital transformation in two months.\"</p><p>Slack, which was founded in 2014, has enjoyed rapid growth this year. Last month, reporting the results for its quarter ended in April, Slack said its revenue had jumped 50 percent to $202 million. It has more than 122,000 paying customers, typically companies with annual licenses, which was a 28 percent increase from the year-earlier quarter.</p><p>Schellhase, Slack's general counsel, said, \"Microsoft is reverting to past behavior.\"</p><p>But the illegal-tying claim, which Slack makes in its complaint, was not resolved in the federal browser case. Microsoft was found to have engaged in a range of illegal tactics to thwart competition, with contract restrictions and threats. An appeals court upheld those claims but sent the tying claim back to the lower court for reconsideration. The case, which was brought by the Clinton administration, was settled early in the Bush administration.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BGLBCM-SXBPXQWMIQI6VJLLZGGUKBYQ3Q</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BGLBCM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60DR-NTV1-JB25-F006-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">469785</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"998\"/><timeReceived>11:01 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>bostonglobe.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 22, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

The confrontation between Slack and Microsoft echoes the internet browser competition of the 1990s. Jeenah Moon, The New York TimesMicrosoft is undeniably one of the Big Tech elite, given its size, wealth and stock market value. But the software giant has stood apart from Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple in one important respect: Microsoft, once the bully of the tech world, has escaped antitrust scrutiny so far.    Now Slack Technologies, whose popular chat and collaboration software has become embedded in the daily routines of millions of workers at thousands of companies, is hoping to change that.    Slack said Wednesday that it had filed a complaint against Microsoft with the European Commission, accusing the tech giant of using its market power to try to crush the upstart rival.    Slack claims that Microsoft has illegally tied its collaboration software, Microsoft Teams, to its dominant suite of productivity programs, Microsoft Office, which includes Outlook, Word, Excel and PowerPoint. That bundling tactic, Slack contends, is part of a pattern of anti-competitive behavior by Microsoft.    \u201cSlack threatens Microsoft\u2019s hold on business email, the cornerstone of Office, which means Slack threatens Microsoft\u2019s lock on enterprise software,\u201d Jonathan Prince, vice president of communications and policy at Slack, said in a statement.    Slack\u2019s complaint is just a first step. The European Commission must decide if a formal investigation is warranted. In recent years, European regulators have more aggressively pursued antitrust actions against large tech companies than American officials.    Federal and state regulators in the United States are investigating whether the other tech giants have broken antitrust laws. On Monday, the chief executives of Apple, Amazon, Alphabet (which owns Google) and Facebook will testify before Congress, which is also looking into them.    Under European rules, the Slack complaint is not made public. But in a news conference, David Schellhase, Slack\u2019s general counsel, said the company sought an order to remove Teams from Office, make it a stand-alone product and charge a \u201cfair price.\u201d    In a statement, Microsoft said it was \u201ccommitted to offering customers not only the best of new innovation but a wide variety of choice in how they purchase and use the product.\u201d And the company said it looked forward to \u201cproviding additional information to the European Commission and answering any questions they may have.\u201d    The Slack-Microsoft confrontation has some echoes of the internet browser competition in the 1990s. The browser wars led to a landmark federal antitrust case against Microsoft in the United States that found the company repeatedly violated the nation\u2019s antitrust laws. Europe also ruled against Microsoft.    The internet browser was a layer of software that could be a gateway to online computing. Developers could write software applications that ran on the browser, potentially undermining the role of Microsoft\u2019s Windows operating system, the dominant technology of the personal computer era.    The browser was a rival computing platform. And Netscape Communications, the commercial pioneer of browser software, was Microsoft\u2019s enemy.    Today, Slack serves as a gateway to online work for many people. Developers can write apps that run on Slack. And it is a nascent challenge to one part of Microsoft\u2019s business. Now online cloud software is the major platform, and Teams is included in Microsoft\u2019s Office 365 cloud suite.    \u201cOnline collaboration platforms and related tools have become as important to us as smartphones and computers,\u201d said Michael Cusumano, a professor at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.    Whether a software program like Slack could emerge as a genuine business threat to Microsoft is uncertain, industry analysts say. Microsoft has positioned Teams as an all-in-one stop for online video meetings, calls, chat and collaboration, and it works seamlessly with Microsoft\u2019s Office software.    \u201cFor Microsoft, Teams is increasingly where online work is done,\u201d said Wayne Kurtzman, an analyst at IDC, a technology research firm. \u201cIt is becoming a platform for Microsoft.\u201d    Slack is making its complaint as adoption of collaboration technology is surging. Slack, Microsoft Teams and Zoom are all experiencing huge demand because of the coronavirus-induced shutdowns that have forced much of the workforce to toil from home.    In April, when the company reported its quarterly financial results, Microsoft said that Teams had 75 million daily users, more than double the number in early March. At the time, Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, said, \u201cWe\u2019ve seen two years\u2019 worth of digital transformation in two months.\u201d    Microsoft on Wednesday reported $38 billion in revenue in the three months that ended in June, a 13 percent jump. Its operating profit increased 8 percent to $13.4 billion, or $1.46 a share. Both the company\u2019s sales and earnings per share surpassed Wall Street estimates.    Slack, which was founded in 2014, has enjoyed rapid growth this year. Last month, reporting the results for its quarter ended in April, Slack said its revenue had jumped 50 percent to $202 million. It has more than 122,000 paying customers, typically companies with annual licenses, which was a 28 percent increase from the year-earlier quarter.    Schellhase, Slack\u2019s general counsel, said, \u201cMicrosoft is reverting to past behavior.\u201d    But the illegal-tying claim, which Slack makes in its complaint, was not resolved in the federal browser case. Microsoft was found to have engaged in a range of illegal tactics to thwart competition, with contract restrictions and threats. An appeals court upheld those claims but sent the tying claim back to the lower court for reconsideration. The case, which was brought by the Clinton administration, was settled early in the Bush administration.    Slack contends that bundling Teams with Office is \u201cclearly a violation of European law,\u201d said Prince, the company\u2019s vice president for policy.    Google announced last week that it was more tightly integrating video, chat and email into its GSuite bundle of products. But the difference, Slack says, is that Google is not a dominant company in business software as Microsoft is.       c.2020 The New York Times Company</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42661473701</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60DS-B1J1-F07F-80X8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1119\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>ABS-CBN News</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 23, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Slack Technologies Inc., maker of the eponymous workplace platform, on Wednesday filed a complaint before the European Commission, the EU's top competition regulator, accusing Microsoft of violating EU competition law by tying its Teams collaboration software to its widely used Microsoft Office productivity-software suite.    Slack alleges that Microsoft forces Office users to install the Teams software, blocks its removal, and makes certain types of interoperability with rivals impossible. The company is asking the EU to force Microsoft to sell Teams as a standalone product, rather than bundling it with Office.    Wednesday's complaint is the latest of several in the EU and U.S. accusing large technology companies of abusing their alleged dominance.

This valuation would make it that much more expensive for a larger tech company to buy it, and thus, at least a little less likely. </p><p>But it's also been coy about a potential IPO, raising questions about the master plan. All the while, Microsoft has been reinforcing Microsoft Teams, its own work chat product.Slack, the work chat app that's become a poster child for Silicon Valley startup success, is on something of a hot streak. First, Slack bought the intellectual property to Atlassian's HipChat[1], which had been one of its chief rivals. Then, no less than Microsoft recognized Slack as a major rival[2] to the Microsoft Office suite in an official regulatory filing. Now, Slack can add one more to its win column, as it takes in a whopping $427 million in an investment round led by Dragoneer Investment Group and General Atlantic, with participation from T. Rowe Price, Wellington Management, and others, including its existing roster of investors. This investment, in turn, leads to two other figures of interest: Slack is now valued at \"more than $7.1 billion,\" according to a press release. And now, all told, Slack has raised just about $1.27 billion of venture capital. That includes the $250 million mega-round it took in last September at a $5 billion valuation, in a deal led by Softbank. Slack is also using the opportunity to tout its growth. It has 8 million daily active users (DAUs), and 70,000 paid teams, up from the 6 million DAUs and 50,000 paid teams it announced in September[3]. Also in September, Slack said it was at $200 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR), though it doesn't have an updated figure to share today.More money means more questionsAll of that said, this funding round raises some questions for the future of Slack. This $7.1 billion valuation makes it that much more unlikely that Slack will get bought up by a big tech company. If Amazon, for example, were to revisit its reported interest in buying Slack, it would likely have to pay a big premium over that valuation to seal the deal. Even for a gigantic tech company like Amazon, that would be a hefty price tag. At the same time, Slack has so far played coy about a possible IPO[4], declining to announce any plans one way or the other. With so much money going into the startup, though, some kind of exit seems like it will have to come sooner rather than later. And all the while, Slack is facing down the continued threat of Microsoft, whose Microsoft Teams product comes bundled with the mega-popular Office 365 productivity suite for businesses. While Slack has its fair share of super-fans and champions, Microsoft wields significant might in this market, and the startup has its work cut out for it. Microsoft hasn't taken this lying down, either, and has made moves to make Teams more competitive with Skype \u2014 most recently, launching a free version of Microsoft Teams[5] to hook in smaller groups, and hopefully lure them to the paid version. So while the ability to raise so much cash, so quickly, is a definite feather in the company's cap, it now falls on Slack to show the world that it can take on its much larger competitor...and win.NOW

The San Francisco-based company's stock began trading Thursday as WORK on the New York Stock Exchange at $38.50, well above its reference price of $26. By midafternoon, it was closing in on $41.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The big thing for us was in the traditional IPO, it's the company that's offering shares, you might raise, you know, a billion dollars or something like that,\" Slack chief executive Stewart Butterfield said Thursday during an interview on CNBC. \"When you raise a billion dollars, you dilute existing shareholders, by issuing new shares. So, we are not doing that. We're just opening it up for trading.\"</p><p>Spotify is the only other major company to go the direct listing route recently; it debuted in April 2018 with a reference price of $132, and its stock has climbed about 15 percent since.</p><p>It's a somewhat risky move, because a direct offering means there are no underwriters helping to drum up interest and capital, or to hold shares that aren't sold through the initial public offering to ensure a strong debut. But it also streamlines what is generally a time-consuming and costly process, and analysts have said that Slack's popularity could allow it to generate plenty of interest on the strength of its brand alone. Experts think other big names, like Airbnb, could follow the same strategy.</p><p>\"While Spotify proved that a direct listing is a viable alternative to an underwritten IPO, the process is certainly not right for every issuer,\" Latham &amp; Watkins, the law firm that guided both Spotify and Slack through their direct offerings, wrote in a case study. \"The success of Spotify's direct listing was due, in part, to Spotify being a well-capitalized company with no immediate need to raise additional capital, while also having a large and diverse shareholder base that could provide sufficient supply-side liquidity on the first day of trading, as well as a well-recognized brand name and an easily understood business model.\"</p><p>Goldman Sachs, Allen &amp; Co. and Morgan Stanley, which worked with Spotify on its direct listing last year, are also assisting Slack.</p><p>Analysts had expected Slack to trade well above its reference price, which was set by the NYSE and based on the company's recent private market trading and consultations with Slack's financial advisers. Slack has raised more than $1.3 billion in funding from investors, and a regulatory filing pegged its value near $12 billion.</p><p>As a darling of Silicon Valley, Slack enjoys rare name recognition for a relatively young company. But that also places it in a highly competitive environment, along with juggernauts like Google, Facebook and Microsoft, which tried to buy Slack outright for $8 billion in 2016.</p><p>\"Growing competition from big tech is a direct headline negative for Slack,\" Rohit Kulkarni, an analyst with MKM Partners, wrote in a note to investors this week. \"However we believe the market opportunity for Slack's products is quite large and growing quickly. Put another way, we believe competitive intensity may not manifest in Slack's top-line growth rate. However, it might show up in pushing the profitability can further down the road.\"</p><p>Slack has reported \"significant net losses\" each year since its founding in 2009 and warned it \"may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future,\" regulatory filings show. Its explosive growth has also cooled, with the company projecting a 49 percent increase in revenue this fiscal year, versus the 82 percent surge reported last year. But the strength of its debut so far suggests investors are willing to bet on Slack, said Alejandro Ortiz, a SharesPost analyst.</p><p>\"It's clear that, for now, public investors see value in the future potential growth of the company, despite its losses to date,\" Ortiz said. \"It's too early to see if this direct listing was a success, but the company's life as a public company is off to a strong start.\"</p><p>Slack's offering follows a slew of unicorn initial public offerings, some of which ended with more whimper than bang. On its first day of trading, ride-share giant Lyft saw its shares surge, then sink. It now trades well below its IPO price. Uber closed well below its IPO price on opening day and has only recently clawed its way back. But other software companies have fared better: Shares of the cybersecurity company CrowdStrike and cloud conferencing company Zoom Video Communications have more than doubled since their IPOs.</p><p>\"The absence of a potentially notable pop, as seen with traditional IPOs, may also hamper Slack's retail demand,\" Ortiz wrote recently.           </p><p>More than 600,000 organizations around the world use Slack, which was founded by the creators of Flickr. Its 10 million users collectively spend 50 million hours on it in a typical week.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-bc65a95bbaa34ee88a6203e28247674a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WCS-1MW1-JB4M-V1XR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"849\"/><timeReceived>3:01 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 20, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"81\"><classCode>CC0002E0D</classCode><className>LATHAM &amp;

The San Francisco-based company's stock began trading Thursday as WORK on the New York Stock Exchange at $38.50, well above its reference price of $26. By midafternoon, it was closing in on $41.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The big thing for us was in the traditional IPO, it's the company that's offering shares, you might raise, you know, a billion dollars or something like that,\" Slack chief executive Stewart Butterfield said Thursday during an interview on CNBC. \"When you raise a billion dollars, you dilute existing shareholders, by issuing new shares. So, we are not doing that. We're just opening it up for trading.\"</p><p>Spotify is the only other major company to go the direct listing route recently; it debuted in April 2018 with a reference price of $132, and its stock has climbed about 15 percent since.</p><p>It's a somewhat risky move, because a direct offering means there are no underwriters helping to drum up interest and capital, or to hold shares that aren't sold through the initial public offering to ensure a strong debut. But it also streamlines what is generally a time-consuming and costly process, and analysts have said that Slack's popularity could allow it to generate plenty of interest on the strength of its brand alone. Experts think other big names, like Airbnb, could follow the same strategy.</p><p>\"While Spotify proved that a direct listing is a viable alternative to an underwritten IPO, the process is certainly not right for every issuer,\" Latham &amp; Watkins, the law firm that guided both Spotify and Slack through their direct offerings, wrote in a case study. \"The success of Spotify's direct listing was due, in part, to Spotify being a well-capitalized company with no immediate need to raise additional capital, while also having a large and diverse shareholder base that could provide sufficient supply-side liquidity on the first day of trading, as well as a well-recognized brand name and an easily understood business model.\"</p><p>Goldman Sachs, Allen &amp; Co. and Morgan Stanley, which worked with Spotify on its direct listing last year, are also assisting Slack.</p><p>Analysts had expected Slack to trade well above its reference price, which was set by the NYSE and based on the company's recent private market trading and consultations with Slack's financial advisers. Slack has raised more than $1.3 billion in funding from investors, and a regulatory filing pegged its value near $12 billion.</p><p>As a darling of Silicon Valley, Slack enjoys rare name recognition for a relatively young company. But that also places it in a highly competitive environment, along with juggernauts like Google, Facebook and Microsoft, which tried to buy Slack outright for $8 billion in 2016.</p><p>\"Growing competition from big tech is a direct headline negative for Slack,\" Rohit Kulkarni, an analyst with MKM Partners, wrote in a note to investors this week. \"However we believe the market opportunity for Slack's products is quite large and growing quickly. Put another way, we believe competitive intensity may not manifest in Slack's top-line growth rate. However, it might show up in pushing the profitability can further down the road.\"</p><p>Slack has reported \"significant net losses\" each year since its founding in 2009 and warned it \"may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future,\" regulatory filings show. Its explosive growth has also cooled, with the company projecting a 49 percent increase in revenue this fiscal year, versus the 82 percent surge reported last year. But the strength of its debut so far suggests investors are willing to bet on Slack, said Alejandro Ortiz, a SharesPost analyst.</p><p>\"It's clear that, for now, public investors see value in the future potential growth of the company, despite its losses to date,\" Ortiz said. \"It's too early to see if this direct listing was a success, but the company's life as a public company is off to a strong start.\"</p><p>Slack's offering follows a slew of unicorn initial public offerings, some of which ended with more whimper than bang. On its first day of trading, ride-share giant Lyft saw its shares surge, then sink. It now trades well below its IPO price. Uber closed well below its IPO price on opening day and has only recently clawed its way back. But other software companies have fared better: Shares of the cybersecurity company CrowdStrike and cloud conferencing company Zoom Video Communications have more than doubled since their IPOs.</p><p>\"The absence of a potentially notable pop, as seen with traditional IPOs, may also hamper Slack's retail demand,\" Ortiz wrote recently.           </p><p>More than 600,000 organizations around the world use Slack, which was founded by the creators of Flickr. Its 10 million users collectively spend 50 million hours on it in a typical week.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPOST-bc65a95b-baa3-4ee8-8a62-03e28247674a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPOST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WCW-S7G1-JBFW-C1CW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8075</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"849\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Post</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12311\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Regional Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 21, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"81\"><classCode>CC0002E0D</classCode><className>LATHAM &amp;

The San Francisco-based company's stock began trading Thursday as WORK on the New York Stock Exchange at $38.50, well above its reference price of $26. By midafternoon, it was closing in on $41.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The big thing for us was in the traditional IPO, it's the company that's offering shares, you might raise, you know, a billion dollars or something like that,\" Slack chief executive Stewart Butterfield said Thursday during an interview on CNBC. \"When you raise a billion dollars, you dilute existing shareholders, by issuing new shares. So, we are not doing that. We're just opening it up for trading.\"</p><p>Spotify is the only other major company to go the direct listing route recently; it debuted in April 2018 with a reference price of $132, and its stock has climbed about 15 percent since.</p><p>It's a somewhat risky move, because a direct offering means there are no underwriters helping to drum up interest and capital, or to hold shares that aren't sold through the initial public offering to ensure a strong debut. But it also streamlines what is generally a time-consuming and costly process, and analysts have said that Slack's popularity could allow it to generate plenty of interest on the strength of its brand alone. Experts think other big names, like Airbnb, could follow the same strategy.</p><p>\"While Spotify proved that a direct listing is a viable alternative to an underwritten IPO, the process is certainly not right for every issuer,\" Latham &amp; Watkins, the law firm that guided both Spotify and Slack through their direct offerings, wrote in a case study. \"The success of Spotify's direct listing was due, in part, to Spotify being a well-capitalized company with no immediate need to raise additional capital, while also having a large and diverse shareholder base that could provide sufficient supply-side liquidity on the first day of trading, as well as a well-recognized brand name and an easily understood business model.\"</p><p>Goldman Sachs, Allen &amp; Co. and Morgan Stanley, which worked with Spotify on its direct listing last year, are also assisting Slack.</p><p>Analysts had expected Slack to trade well above its reference price, which was set by the NYSE and based on the company's recent private market trading and consultations with Slack's financial advisers. Slack has raised more than $1.3 billion in funding from investors, and a regulatory filing pegged its value near $12 billion.</p><p>As a darling of Silicon Valley, Slack enjoys rare name recognition for a relatively young company. But that also places it in a highly competitive environment, along with juggernauts like Google, Facebook and Microsoft, which tried to buy Slack outright for $8 billion in 2016.</p><p>\"Growing competition from big tech is a direct headline negative for Slack,\" Rohit Kulkarni, an analyst with MKM Partners, wrote in a note to investors this week. \"However we believe the market opportunity for Slack's products is quite large and growing quickly. Put another way, we believe competitive intensity may not manifest in Slack's top-line growth rate. However, it might show up in pushing the profitability can further down the road.\"</p><p>Slack has reported \"significant net losses\" each year since its founding in 2009 and warned it \"may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future,\" regulatory filings show. Its explosive growth has also cooled, with the company projecting a 49 percent increase in revenue this fiscal year, versus the 82 percent surge reported last year. But the strength of its debut so far suggests investors are willing to bet on Slack, said Alejandro Ortiz, a SharesPost analyst.</p><p>\"It's clear that, for now, public investors see value in the future potential growth of the company, despite its losses to date,\" Ortiz said. \"It's too early to see if this direct listing was a success, but the company's life as a public company is off to a strong start.\"</p><p>Slack's offering follows a slew of unicorn initial public offerings, some of which ended with more whimper than bang. On its first day of trading, ride-share giant Lyft saw its shares surge, then sink. It now trades well below its IPO price. Uber closed well below its IPO price on opening day and has only recently clawed its way back. But other software companies have fared better: Shares of the cybersecurity company CrowdStrike and cloud conferencing company Zoom Video Communications have more than doubled since their IPOs.</p><p>\"The absence of a potentially notable pop, as seen with traditional IPOs, may also hamper Slack's retail demand,\" Ortiz wrote recently.           </p><p>More than 600,000 organizations around the world use Slack, which was founded by the creators of Flickr. Its 10 million users collectively spend 50 million hours on it in a typical week.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPCOM-bc65a95bbaa34ee88a6203e28247674a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WCW-M5R1-JCDY-T3Y9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">265544</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"849\"/><timeReceived>12:02 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washingtonpost.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33547\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 21, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"81\"><classCode>CC0002E0D</classCode><className>LATHAM &amp;

But the software giant has stood apart from Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple in one important respect: Microsoft, once the bully of the tech world, has escaped antitrust scrutiny so far.  Now Slack Technologies, whose popular chat and collaboration software has become embedded in the daily routines of millions of workers at thousands of companies, is hoping to change that.  Slack said Wednesday that it had filed a complaint against Microsoft with the European Commission, accusing the tech giant of using its market power to try to crush the upstart rival.  In its filing, Slack claims that Microsoft has illegally tied its collaboration software, Microsoft Teams, to its dominant suite of productivity programs, Microsoft Office, which includes Outlook, Word, Excel and PowerPoint.  \"Slack threatens Microsoft\u2019s hold on business email, the cornerstone of Office, which means Slack threatens Microsoft\u2019s lock on enterprise software,\" Jonathan Prince, vice president of communications and policy at Slack, said in a statement.  Slack\u2019s complaint is just the first step. The European Commission must assess the complaint to see if a formal investigation is warranted. In recent years, European regulators have more aggressively pursued antitrust actions against large tech companies than US regulators.  But the complaint threatens Microsoft\u2019s recent ability to largely avoid regulatory scrutiny. Federal and state regulators in the United States are investigating whether the other tech giants have broken antitrust laws. On Monday, the chief executives of Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook will testify before Congress, which is also looking into them.  Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The Slack-Microsoft confrontation has some echoes of the internet browser competition in the 1990s. The browser wars led to a landmark federal antitrust case against Microsoft in the United States that found the company repeatedly violated the nation\u2019s antitrust laws. Europe also ruled against Microsoft.  The internet browser was a layer of software that could be a gateway to online computing. Developers could write software applications that ran on the browser, potentially undermining the role of Microsoft\u2019s Windows operating system, the dominant technology of the personal computer era.  The browser was a rival computing platform. And Netscape Communications, the commercial pioneer of browser software, was Microsoft\u2019s enemy.  Today, Slack serves as a gateway to online work for many people. Developers can write apps that run on Slack. And it is a nascent challenge to one part of Microsoft\u2019s business. Now, online cloud software is the major platform, and Teams is included in Microsoft\u2019s Office 365 cloud suite.  \"Online collaboration platforms and related tools have become as important to us as smartphones and computers,\" said Michael Cusumano, a professor at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  Whether a software program like Slack could emerge as a genuine threat to Microsoft is uncertain, industry analysts say. Microsoft has positioned Teams as an all-in-one stop for online video meetings, calls, chat and collaboration, and it works seamlessly with Microsoft\u2019s Office software.  \"For Microsoft, Teams is increasingly where online work is done,\" said Wayne Kurtzman, an analyst at IDC, a technology research firm. \"It is becoming a platform for Microsoft.\"  Slack is making its complaint as adoption of modern communication and collaboration technology is surging. Slack, Microsoft Teams and Zoom are all experiencing huge demand because of the coronavirus-induced shutdowns that have forced much of the workforce to toil from home.  In April, when the company reported its quarterly financial results, Microsoft said that Teams had 75 million daily users, more than double the number in early March. At the time, Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, said, \"We\u2019ve seen two years\u2019 worth of digital transformation in two months.\"  Microsoft will report its results for the most recent quarter later Wednesday, after the close of stock trading. Despite the coronavirus-battered economy, Microsoft is expected to report revenue of $36.5 billion, up 8 percent, according to analysts\u2019 estimates compiled by IBES Refinitiv.  Slack, which was founded in 2014, has enjoyed rapid growth this year. Last month, reporting the results for its quarter ended in April, Slack said its revenue had jumped 50% to $202 million. It has more than 122,000 paying customers, typically companies with annual licenses, which was a 28% increase from the year-earlier quarter.  David Schellhase, Slack\u2019s general counsel, said, \"Microsoft is reverting to past behavior.\"  But the illegal-tying claim, which Slack makes in its complaint, was not resolved in the federal browser case. Microsoft was found to have engaged in a range of illegal tactics to thwart competition, with contract restrictions and threats. An appeals court upheld those claims but sent the tying claim back to the lower court for reconsideration. The case, which was brought by the Clinton administration, was settled early in the Bush administration.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42658947154</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60DR-8351-F07F-82P1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"925\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Deccan Herald</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 22, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Last June, Slack made a major play in the enterprise with the introduction of Slack Connect . After a private beta in several organizations, the San Francisco-based company pushed it out into general release. Connect enables Slack users to connect with up to 20 different external organizations within the same Slack channel.    Connect was much bigger than the existing shared channels feature, which only allowed two external organizations in a channel. However, despite comprehensive security across Connect there were concerns the new tool would leave organizations\u2019 data vulnerable. Slack addressed those concerns this week with announcements about several new additions.    While there are many new features, a few stand out. Top of the list is a feature to help system administrators quickly vet external organizations before enabling them to enter a channel. Once an organization is verified it will be identified with a badge, so admins approving external channels can determine at a glance whether a new organization is credible. The result is a faster, more secure process for setting up channels for admins and users alike.    But that is not all. It is also extending the reach of its enterprise key management, or EKM, tool to give enterprises more control. Here are details:   Workflow Builder: This tool is already available to users and enables them to automate routine tasks without any coding. With this new option, organizations will be able to use their own encryption keys to encrypt workflows and form data. Data residency: Slack already lets customers decide where data will reside, in the US or outside the US. Now it is extending this capability to EKMs. Soon businesses will be able to choose where they want their encryption keys kept, too. Slack Connect encryption: Another addition to Connect will be the ability to encrypt data transferred back and forth to external organizations using an encryption key of choice.   The introduction of the new security measures is a direct response to the number of people working remotely, the Slack team wrote in a blog post . Digital transformation across previously traditional industries is happening at warp speed. Workplace technology deployment that would have taken years before the COVID-19 crisis is now happening in months or even weeks.    The result is that security has become a key digital workplace concern, especially as it looks like many people will be staying home a lot longer than originally expected. Where workers go, cybercriminals do too. In April, Google reported more than 18 million daily malware and phishing emails related to COVID-19 scams in just one week and more than 240 million daily spam messages.      Regulated industries like banking and healthcare have been hit especially hard, with a report by VMware Carbon Black showing that attacks targeting the financial sector growing by 238% from February to April 2020.    With no signs of the pandemic tailing off, expect a lot more additions like this to Slack and other vendors like Google and Microsoft.   Zoom Integrates With Facebook, Google, Amazon   Meanwhile, San Jose, Calif.-based Zoom is also clearly anticipating a long period of remote work before things get back to normal and is looking to expand its reach as a result. The company announced its Zoom for Home offering is going to be integrated with several smart displays, including Amazon Echo Show, Portal from Facebook and Google Nest Hub Max.    Zoom for Home is a device that incorporates three wide-angle cameras and an eight-microphone array into the build for enhanced audio and visuals compared with a standard laptop or mobile Zoom meetings.    Everyone wins here. By integrating with these commonly used devices, workers will be able to use Zoom with friends and family as well as with colleagues. If all three displays are more widely associated with the consumer market than the enterprise market, the addition of Zoom for Home will also enable vendors to gain deeper traction in the digital workplace. The result is that Zoom for Home gets a wider audience while the displays of all three vendors get more enterprise exposure.    The timing could not be better. According to a recent study from Morning Consult, \" Working from Home &amp; The Future of Work ,\" the number of adults working exclusively from home has tripled since pre-COVID, with one-third wanting to upgrade their work-from-home set-up if their company subsidized it.    Gartner has also been revisiting its figures and in a July survey found that nearly half (47%) of companies surveyed said they intend to allow employees to work remotely full time going forward. For some organizations, flex time will be the new norm, as 43% of survey respondents reported they will grant employees flex days while 42% will provide flex hours.    The addition of Zoom for Home will undoubtedly add a better calling experience to calls and meetings, but it is still not clear why any of these vendors would allow Zoom on their screens. There are a number of possibilities, including the fact that anti-trust regulators on both sides of the Atlantic are watching big tech companies and video calling is undoubtedly being scrutinized given the fact that it impacts both organizations and consumers.   Colligo Releases Content Manager for Microsoft 365   There are a couple of things to say about Canada-based Colligo  after it slipped off the radar recently. The first is that in February this year, the company was taken over by Olbia Software in a deal that went largely unnoticed in the media. It has only come into focus this week, because the company is continuing its mission to provide enterprise-strength email management and document management solutions for Microsoft SharePoint with the release of a new Colligo Content Manager for Microsoft 365.    In a statement about the new release, the new CEO Tim Brady confirmed that his company Olbia bought Colligo in February. The statement also says that Colligo will continue to do what it has been doing for the past 20 years. It reads: \u201cWith new leadership, new additions to the team and more product innovation to come, Colligo is continuing to adapt to best perform in our modern world.\u201d    For its part, he explained that the new Content Manager will act as an extension of Colligo's existing Microsoft 365 Email Management and Document Management solutions.    Colligo Email Manager for Microsoft 365 and Colligo Document Manager for Microsoft 365 help workers capture and tag files from Office applications into SharePoint with the most sophisticated metadata and label classification tools available on the market.    By layering the Content Manager module on top, Colligo users can not only capture and share links to email or document files, they can browse and view to any type of file at any SharePoint location right from within Microsoft 365.    It also seems that Colligo will keep on course and focus on making Microsoft productivity tools easier to use. There will be more from Colligo as it happens.   Claravine Brings Metadata Management to Adobe EM   Elsewhere, Lehi, Utah-based Claravine has announced that it is integrating with Adobe Experience Manager. According to the company this will provide users with a smarter way to control content metadata and tagging within Experience Manager Sites and Experience Manager Assets.    The integration addresses one of the biggest problems for enterprises going through digital transformations now, notably the inability to provide standardized content that works for all channels.    The result is that because organizations cannot develop marketing metadata across a fragmented marketing technology stack, they are unable to automate the creation and optimization of digital experiences.    The integration is in response to customer demand for better ways to track, maintain and scale metadata across large enterprises, especially those with many agencies and teams creating campaign assets.    With Claravine, users can connect to Adobe Experience Manager and quickly view and manage data about all the video, images, web pages, product offers and other assets that are part of their campaign.    Then, as Claravine standardizes the data model that is crucial for all areas of digital marketing operations, users can easily find missing metadata and synchronize it back into Adobe Experience Manager, saving teams valuable time and improving their analytics, SEO, personalization experiences and more. Existing Adobe Experience Manager customers can take advantage of this integration.   Microsoft Kills Internet Explorer   Finally, this week, while not exclusive to the digital workplace, it would be remiss of us not to mention that Microsoft is finally killing off Internet Explorer.    In a blog post , Microsoft explained that the Microsoft Teams web app will no longer support Internet Explorer 11 \u2014 the most recent and final iteration of the browser \u2014 from Nov. 30, 2020. The remaining Microsoft 365 apps and services will end support for the browser next year.    Microsoft Edge, the new browser which relies on Chromium open-source software, developed by Google for Google Chrome, will replace IE. That gives Edge more features than Internet Explorer. As way of solace to those who invested heavily in IE, the post reads:    \u201cWe understand the need to 'do more with less' in the new business environment. By the dates listed above, customers should no longer access Microsoft 365 apps and services using IE 11, but we want to be clear that IE 11 isn\u2019t going away and that our customers\u2019 own legacy IE 11 apps and investments will continue to work. Customers have made business-critical investments in IE 11 legacy apps and we respect that those apps are still functioning.\u201d    There is an older version of Edge which does not use Chromium. That too will be phased out on March 9, 2021.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42893160234</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60N4-9PY1-JCSC-J1RG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1699\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>CMS Wire</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 21, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The company has tapped into an interesting new trend for tech firms going public, doing a \"direct listing\" which avoids the usual Wall Street IPO process. The startup plans to directly list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange with the ticker symbol SK. Slack reported a net loss of $146 million on $105.2 million in revenue for its fiscal 2017; then a net loss of $140 million on $220.5 million in revenue for 2018; and a $138.9 million loss on $400.6 million in revenue for fiscal 2019. The company mostly makes its money from monthly or annual subscriptions and has 88,000 paying customers. </p><p>It has 575 customers bringing in more than $100,000 in recurring yearly revenue, who make up 40% of its business. It's one of the most hotly anticipated offerings in a year of blockbuster tech IPOs that include Uber, Lyft, Pinterest, and Zoom. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[2] Slack[3], the workplace chat platform that's taken offices by storm, filed the paperwork to go public on Friday, kicking off the final countdown to its listing and shedding light on the financial happenings at one of Silicon Valley's most valuable startups. Slack was last valued around $17 billion on secondary market trades, according to CNBC[4]. It was officially valued at $7.1 billion after its latest financing round last August. In its S-1 filing[5], Slack said it plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol \"SK\" through a direct listing \u2014 a unique alternative to the IPO in which private shareholders such as investors and employees sell their holdings directly to the public. The company said $100 million worth of shares will be sold, although that's most likely a placeholder number. Unlike a standard IPO, Slack won't raise a bunch of new cash from investors rushing to buy its stock, and it won't set a share price. It's the second big tech company to go public in this way recently after Spotify did a direct listing[6] in April.Slack is trimming its losses but says it may never be profitableThe firm also lifted the lid on its financial performance over the last three years. During the year ended January 31, 2017, Slack lost $146 million on $105.2 million in revenue. The following year it lost $140 million on $220.5 million in revenue. And in the year ending January 31, 2019, it lost $138.9 million on $400.6 million in revenue. The company predominantly makes money from monthly or yearly subscriptions, and counts 88,000 customers. Of those, 575 customers account for more than $100,000 in recurring yearly revenue and make up 40% of Slack's total business. The startup has 500,000 organizations on its free tier. The firm wrote: \"We expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future and we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future. \"Because the market for Slack, and the features, integrations, and capabilities we offer on Slack, is rapidly evolving and has not yet reached widespread adoption, it is difficult for us to predict our future results of operations or the limits of our market opportunity.\" The company expects a significant increase in operating expenses thanks to hiring and development. Slack said it has more than 10 million daily active users globally, with more than half of those outside the US. More than 600,000 organizations are using its messaging platform. Slack has always billed itself as an email killer and, listing the risks to its business, said that email was a competitor. In terms of other companies, the firm listed Microsoft as its primary competitor and also described Google, Facebook, and Cisco as business software rivals. It also said existing partners such as Atlassian, Okta, Oracle, ServiceNow, SAP, Workday, Zoom, and Salesforce as potential direct or indirect rivals to Slack.It's a banner year for tech IPOsSlack is the latest in the parade of unicorn tech companies, named such for their $1 billion-plus valuations, to go public this year. Uber filed an amended S-1 early Friday with a price range of $44 to $50 per share[7]. The company is expected to start trading in mid-May. Ride-hailing company Lyft[8] went public at the end of March in an IPO that valued the company at $21 billion. It was followed by the IT management company PagerDuty[9], which was valued at $1.76 billion. Last week brought two IPOs: video conferencing company Zoom[10], with a $9 billion valuation, as well online scrapbooking platform Pinterest[11], which was valued at $10 billion.NOW WATCH: Facial

Rather he believes that \"over time the balance has shifted more and more in favour of the big companies\".</p><p>\"I'm not going to get intimidated when they say 'You're not a real Liberal and you just want to introduce more regulations on companies',\" he says.</p><p>Morrison added that it was only when governments stood up to behemoths like banks and electricity companies that they made better offers. The same must be assumed of tech companies, who use our data and our lives as their own money-making devices.</p><p>If we expect the tech giants to treat customers and business in our country fairly we must stand up to them. And this needs to be a political solution.</p><p>The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's landmark preliminary report into the local operations of Facebook and Google has been a good start.</p><p>One of the agency's key proposals is for closer scrutiny by a government agency. The final ACCC report is not due until June 3 - after the federal election. But if he wants to take on this fight, Morrison will have to take steps sooner than that.</p><p>Strategists close to Morrison see the impact of Facebook and Google as a problem that seeps into households, families and businesses across the country.</p><p>It may not feel like a bread and -butter political issue, but in fact the creep of the tech giants into modern Australia transcends class, culture and geography.</p><p>If the government can sell the battle right - a challenge in itself - a war with tech titans could be a topic that speaks to everyday mums and dads who moan that \"Facebook is listening to them\" and taunting them with ads.</p><p>It's certainly a topic that speaks to small businesses, who are edged out by algorithms they can't conquer.</p><p>And it's a topic that speaks to simply anyone who is affronted by international companies making money out of Australians' data and operating on their own rules with no transparency.</p><p>Morrison's team is conscious of this. I've been told the PM is also planning to put greater focus on the safety of children on these online sites in coming months.</p><p>Those close to Morrison remark that he is a decisive and fast-acting Prime Minister - a man who wants to get things done.</p><p>In recent weeks alone that has been evident as he tackled the seemingly gargantuan problem of the revolving door of leaders in his own party, in a generational shift that will change how the Liberals back a leader.</p><p>In the final week of Parliament he also secured the passage of major encryption laws that also upset the big tech companies, and the big stick energy divestment legislation.</p><p>We don't know yet if this get-stuff-done approach will ever translate in the polls.</p><p>But the simple fact that Morrison may only have months left in the job is spurring him to not waste a second.</p><p>Morrison is right to put the tech companies on notice.And with time ticking he should stick to his playbook and take action against them sooner rather than later.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DAITEL-49ca34c2fe7011e89ee435b4ed0b3c5d52fd9b7d9cc2b2a37d3122ff47da04cb</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DAITEL2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TYF-1XK1-F0JP-W0XG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244786</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"789\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Telegraph (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Telegraph Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>December 14, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It was only in hindsight that Blade Runner has taken on classic status.</p><p>The threads opened up by Blade Runner are picked up in Ex Machina, Alex Garland's telling exploration of artificial intelligence that has sleek, clinical good looks that could have come from the early 1970s but which have been deployed to explore very modern concerns.</p><p>Domhnall Gleeson plays a talented computer programmer working for an invasive technology company run by a brilliant and elusive technocrat (Oscar Isaac).</p><p>Gleeson wins an in-house lottery to travel to Isaac's impossibly remote home to undertake a special assignment for his boss.</p><p>He arrives in the back of beyond to find Isaac partying solo in a house that's part hi-tech lab and part prison - Gleeson gets a key card that allows him in but also keeps him out of most of the complex.</p><p>His mission is to perform the Turing Test on a cyborg that Isaac has created, with the aim of establishing whether or not the android has enough intelligence and awareness to make a human unsure whether they are dealing with a real or artificial life-form.</p><p>The film essentially breaks down into a series of electric verbal confrontations between Gleeson and the robot and Gleeson and Isaac.</p><p>The artificial life form comes with the hands and face of a young woman with the name Ava and Gleeson is quickly seduced by her disarming 'personality'. That's effectively achieved by <person><nameText>Alicia Vikander, </nameText></person>whose movements and language expertly straddle the line between the real and unreal.</p><p>Swedish actress Vikander is flavour of the month at the moment (she can also be seen in Testament of Youth) and it's not hard to see why - she has a strong screen presence and an adaptability that's going to make her much in demand.</p><p> Gleeson, who was adept at romantic comedy in About Time, is the nominal star of the film but plays second fiddle to both Vikander and  the impressive Isaac.</p><p> Indeed, Isaac's is perhaps the most telling performance in the film.</p><p>As the tech genius with enough wealth to make even the most implausible ambitions possible, he's far from a typical Frankenstein figure - his justifications of his experiments are not only convincing but disconcerting and his performance gives the movie a chilling edge.</p><p>This is Garland's directorial debut but he's been screenwriter on a string of compelling movies, most notably working with Danny Boyle (The Beach, 28 Days Later and Sunshine). </p><p>But the tone of Ex Machina mostly echoes his adaptation of Never Let Me Go.</p><p>Here, as writer and director, he's in perfect position to ensure all his ideas are fully explored.</p><p>That's not just how far we should push the artificial intelligence envelope and what the consequences might be, but also the danger of the power that rests with the big tech companies and how they are above regulation and government intervention.</p><p>Isaac's wealth was generated by Bluebook, an all-pervading mix of Facebook and Google, that dominates the internet and harvests our personal information to use for whatever ends it deems fit. </p><p>This future is certainly both imaginable and not far distant.</p><p>Garland also remembers that he has a mass audience to please and makes us uneasy voyeurs of his occasionally unclothed female androids.</p><p>Nudity and sexual frissons are the staples of exploitation films but few are brave enough to question what they are doing within the film.</p><p>Gleeson's character comes straight out and asks Isaac why he chose to sexualise his cyborg and why Ava had to be so attractive?</p><p>Isaac's answer is only partially satisfactory but it's a brave question to ask and part of the reason you walk out of the cinema with plenty to think about.</p><p>There's not too many movies that will unsettle and agitate you as Ex Machina does and equally few that almost immediately demand a second viewing.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>THOUGHT-PROVOKING . . .
