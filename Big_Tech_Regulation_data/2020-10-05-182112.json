The discovery raising more questions about how long a person is immune after infection.</p><p>Time for the Word on Wall Street. Joining me right now is PRICE Futures Group Senior Market Analyst and Fox Business Contributor Phil Flynn. Labenthal Global Advisors President Dominick Tavella and PacersETF Distributors President Sean O'Hara.</p><p>First up, great to see everybody this morning, thank you so much for being here.</p><p>PHIL FLYNN, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR: Good morning.</p><p>DOMINICK TAVELLA, LABENTHAL GLOBAL ADVISORS PRESIDENT: Good morning.</p><p>SEAN O'HARA, PACERSETF DISTRIBUTORS PRESIDENT: Good morning Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let's talk about these markets that will now quite. Futures up again. All three major induces with major gains yesterday, adding to it this morning. The Dow jumping above 28,000 for the first time in six months. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq seeing record high closes.</p><p>You got a major day yesterday, but the market is up almost 200 points right now, Dominick. To what do you attribute this euphoria and can we expect this market to continue surging?</p><p>TAVELLA: Well, I think we're seeing a little bit better breadth than we have in the past, but overall it's still these five stocks that dominate the headlines. And we're getting an awful lot of new investors coming into the market. We see what's going on at Robinhood, the number of new accounts that are open and specifically the kind of stocks that they're buying.</p><p>And so when you're thinking about Apple specifically and Tesla, they're really driving the markets, they're really pushing these markets much higher than really they should be. So, I think in the short run we've got to be a little careful here. I think they've gotten way over their skis.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, you want to sell into some rallies then, Dominick?</p><p>TAVELLA: We've been trimming back, absolutely. We did our first sale of equities this week, we lowered our equity exposure by 5 percent. I don't want to -- I'm not predicting a major correction here.</p><p>I do think though that when you look at that 1 percent of the stocks of the S&amp;P 500 represent 25 percent of the overall weighting and everyday the phone rings, should we being buying Apple now or should we buy it after the split. It's just crazy Maria.</p><p>We -- you have to look at where the value of the market is. Look at the mid-cap sector of the S&amp;P 500, still negative about 6 percent of the year and the small-cap sector in the S&amp;P still negative in average of 11 percent for the year. There's value there. It's time to start rotating your portfolio. Sell a little bit of your winners and start accumulating some of the things that have not done as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, next up, the storm threat to the Gulf of Mexico. We are watching these storms today. Oil and gasoline surging to five month highs this week. Around 82 percent of oil production suspended by mid-day yesterday in the Gulf of Mexico.</p><p>Tropical Storm Laura expected to strengthen to a major hurricane, so we could have even more impact. Phil, how do you see things in the oil markets given what we're seeing in the weather?</p><p>FLYNN: You know, I think this is the most significant challenge we've seen from these storms in many, many years, because it isn't just one, Maria, it's two, right? We -- first we had to shut down production for tropical depression now Marco and now a possible cat-4, which means production in the Gulf is going to be closed down more than in recent memory.</p><p>Now, the bigger concern I have right now is for gasoline prices. We have over a million barrels a day of refining capacity shut in because of these storms and the track of the storm is going right over refinery row, so there's a possibility that these refiners could be down for a period of time.</p><p>That means higher gasoline prices, and we're already seeing it reflected in the pump already. So, it's amazing how quickly those prices go up when they want to go up when prices start to get tight.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And then there's this, the Dow shakeup this morning, the Blue Chip Index swapping out three components, Apple's four for one stock split will reduce the benchmark's exposure to the information technology sector, so they're putting Salesforce, that will replace Exxon Mobile, Amgen will replace Pfizer and Honeywell will replace Raytheon Technologies, that all happens on August 31, Sean.</p><p>And we've got these stocks moving up this morning as a result, because we know that when you're in the Dow 30 it allows more -- those money managers that track the Dow 30 will now be buying those stocks in the Dow 30, so it's much more buying power, which is setting the stocks up.</p><p>O'HARA: Yes, and so -- you know -- the affect of this kind of a couple of things. Although there's more money that tracks the S&amp;P 500 because it's a little bit broader, but the Apple reducing its exposure because of the split or Dow reducing Apple's exposure because of their stock split will lower the weight.</p><p>And so, what we'll likely see is a little bit more of a disconnect between the Dow and the S&amp;P 500, for example, or the Dow and the Nasdaq 100.</p><p>It will also probably lower a little bit the overall P.E. ratio, which I think people are worried about as you take a name like Apple that's trading at almost 40 times earnings and reduce its exposure and when it was a fairly big name is these broad indexes that will have a minor affect of lowering overall P.E.s, which may make people a little bit more comfortable.</p><p>For the markets to keep going forward from here, really we need two things to happen. We need to have the continued improvement and the pace of opening up the economy, and then the second thing we need is the other 495 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 and the other 95 stocks in the, say, Nasdaq 100 to start picking up.</p><p>You know, I was talking to a colleague yesterday and said would you rather buy Apple or American Airlines here? I own Apple personally, and I'm thinking maybe I might actually put a little American Airlines in my portfolio because if you think about American Airlines and you think let's say a two-year time horizon there's probably more upside in a name like American Airlines than there is in Apple if we are able to open up the economy and if air travelers feel more comfortable about getting on the place, so it's a really interesting time. So thanks - I mean, so I'm being told to wrap, so I'm sorry.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Phil Flynn, Dominick Tavella, Sean O'Hara, it's great to have you this morning. Thank you so much, gentlemen. Quick break, and then coming up Ohio Congressman, House Judiciary Committee Member, Jim Jordan, on the first night of the Republican National Convention. Former U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., Nikki Haley, is here speaking at the RNC last night talking about the Trump foreign policy agenda. In the 8 a.m. hour this morning, former Foreign Policy Advisor to Donald Trump, Carter Page, is here on the latest fallout from the Russia investigation along with former Deputy Chief of Staff to President Obama, Jim Messina, joining us with his take on the first night of the RNC. Plus Jerry Seinfeld hitting back, the comedian defending New York City. You are watching Mornings with Maria live on Fox Business. Stay with us.</p><p>Welcome back. Not until 2021, that is when New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio predicts indoor dining will return to the Big Apple. It is a critical time for New York restaurants as the warm days are numbered for outdoor dining. A recent Wall Street Journal article highlighting new thinking that COVID lockdowns were overly blunt and costly. This is important, Dagen, because you are talking about industries that will not come back. I spoke to a restaurant guy just yesterday, and he said, Maria, so many restaurants have closed down. They can't make it. They're not going to make it unless indoor dining comes back. Your take?</p><p>MCDOWELL: These are - so we know that Bill de Blasio hates the rich and the - he just acts like rich people don't pay taxes and don't basically support New York City. OK, we got that. I do also think he hates everybody because when you talk about restaurants and keeping restaurants closed for this long, you're talking about destroying the livelihoods of families. You're talking about destroying jobs permanently for people who work in the front of the house, waiters, waitresses, and people who work in kitchens across this city. It will be - if we keep these restaurants closed - and by the way I want to point out Cheryl Casone reported this on the news channel earlier, the infection rate, you know, the number of positive tests coming back in New York state has been below 1 percent for 17 days in a row. There is no reason that these restaurants can't open in a safe way to ensure that they are around for months if not years to come.</p><p>BARTIROMO: This is a serious thing. They are not going to come back in some capacity. Jon Hilsenrath, how do you see it?</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR: Well I mean, New York has an especially big problem when it comes to restaurants because rents are so high and taxes are so high. You have to pack people very closely together in New York, restaurants to cover all your costs, and that becomes a health hazard in a coronavirus era, so it's a big problem. You know, I think that we've learned as a country that we need to find some alternative to the very tight grip shutdowns that we did back in March and April. You know, one of the obvious alternatives that seems to work is wearing masks, you know, and I think that's the kind of compromise that the whole country has to be making right now especially in cities to try to get business back to - going again without suffering the consequences of such big shutdowns.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, for sure. Well, we'll see how this plays out. We will take a break. Yes, go ahead, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: New COVID cases in the U.S. fall to lowest level in more than two months, and I would credit mask wearing. I was down in Virginia, rural Virginia. They hand out masks at the grocery store now, and I actually yelled at somebody who refused to put a mask on. I yelled him out in the parking - yelled him out of the store into the parking lot I was so angry. I was like don't come in here and make people sick if you're not going to wear a mask, so there's that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Well no, it's true. I mean, it makes people feel better, and Matt Schlapp, really what we need is confidence. People need confidence to go back to restaurants. If it's masks, it's masks. If it's, you know, social distancing, that's what it is. You need confidence.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We will take - Matt, you didn't hear my I guess. Matt Schlapp -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCHLAPP: Oh, no -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- we want to get back to you in a minute.</p><p>SCHLAPP: -- OK, sounds good. I have a lot of opinions to share Dagen (ph).</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're staring there blank face at me. I'm like what? Hello? Matt?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>SCHLAPP: Hello? Again, I have to - what's going on here?</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Yes, yes. We're going to take a break and then we're going to come back to you. Fresh greens are making a comeback. We are speaking with one farmer about the positive growth. She turned her life and her family's life around in America's heartland. Wait till you see her story. Then the power of The Office. A heartfelt reaction from one star after wrapping up the TV favorite. You're watching Mornings with Maria live on Fox Business.</p><p>Welcome back. Going green. Fresh produce making a big comeback packing grocery store shelves. It is a huge rebound for farmers recently destroying their harvest because of COVID-19 supply chain delays. The uptick is positive, but it's unclear if American farmers are out of the woods just yet. My next guest owns farmland across seven states and is one of the country's largest fresh produce growers. She is the author of the new book \"The Growing Season\". Sarah Frey is with us now. Sarah, it is great to have you this morning. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>SARAH FREY, \"THE GROWING SEASON\" AUTHOR: Good morning, Maria. Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You have such a great story in terms of building your business. I want to get to that, but first tell me how things are going in terms of farming. How is business? The fresh vegetable and fruit juice market could be really more than an $8 billion business in the U.S. over the next few years. Is that right?</p><p>FREY: It is. It is. You know, the restaurant industry as you know has taken quite a hit, and in the fresh produce industry we're losing about a billion dollars every single week in our industry. There are about 250,000 fresh produce farms across the country, and those farms are really struggling right now. We need to get things, you know, back open.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What do farmers need right now, Sarah?</p><p>FREY: You know, farmers really - you know, they need their markets to open back up. They need that restaurant business to come back. I know from our own personal experience we farm fresh fruits and vegetables in seven different states. Fortunately for Frey Farms most of our business was heavily weighted grocery retail, so companies like Walmart, Kroger, Publics, those stores and those retailers are doing fantastic, but on the beverage side of our business, you know, we do business with great American companies like Subway that provide fresh, very affordable food. And so, we've seen our beverage sales really decline, you know, since March. And they're starting to come back, and we're really rooting for the franchisees at those stores to, you know, get back up and running, but we just need things to open back up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And you juice sometimes the imperfect fruit that would otherwise be wasted, right? Tell me about your beverage business.</p><p>FREY: We do. We do. So Frey Farms is best known as the nation's largest pumpkin farm, but we actually sell more watermelons than we do pumpkins, although it's kind of a pumpkiny time of the year right now. And we make watermelon juice.</p><p>We start out by making watermelon juice on the farm. So, we would take the imperfect melons and we would juice them on the farm, bottle that juice, and it's -- it's sold under the brand Tsamma, T-S-A-M-M-A.</p><p>And it -- why the funky name? It's -- Tsamma is the mother of all watermelons and since we're farmer geeks that's why we -- that's why we named our juice Tsamma.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I love it. So Sarah, you sell more pumpkins than any other producer in the country right now. Do you expect any change in demand this year? And what about the government's aid, was that -- was that a big game changer for the farmers?</p><p>FREY: It wasn't necessarily helpful to us in our business, although some of the commodities that we grow are going to get a little bit of help here. I think watermelons just made the list.</p><p>But, we shipped thousands of loads of fresh fruits and vegetables. Beginning in March I think we shipped -- like in Q2 we shipped nearly 2,000 semi loads of fresh watermelons off our farm in Florida and we kept going through COVID.</p><p>You know, obviously with worker safety being -- you know -- front of center and one of -- you know -- obviously the most important thing in our -- in our business and being able to continue, and we had to make a decision very early on when we were deciding how many acres of pumpkins to plant her in the Midwest.</p><p>And one of the -- one of the things that we -- you know -- had to take into consideration was are people still going to want to -- want to buy a pumpkin this year? Should we plant as many?</p><p>But, we leaned in and we actually planted more pumpkins than -- than we ever have in the past, because I think -- I think pumpkins are a low ticket item that bring joy and happiness into people's homes. And, you know, pumpkins make people happy, so I think -- I think we could all use a little bit more of that now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're right. You wrote a great memoir, \"The Growing Season: How I Built a New Life and Saved an American Farm.\" Real quick, on building a new life, Sarah, how'd you do that?</p><p>FREY: You know, Maria, if you've had an opportunity to read the book, it's -- it's really, in my life, I have the -- you know -- the same philosophy that I have in business and that's how do you -- how do you look through life's imperfections and how do you -- how do you look at challenges and overcome those challenges. How do you look for the good and find the greater purpose.</p><p>It's no different than what we do with the ugly fruit in the fresh produce industry when -- when we take that fruit that might be visually imperfect and we turn it into delicious beverages or healthy ingredients, we find that fruit's greater purpose.</p><p>And in the book \"The Growing Season\" that -- you know -- it's a memoir, so it's some very personal stories in -- in the book about my life. But, the overall essence of the book is looking through the imperfections to find the good.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Love it. Sarah, it's great to have you this morning. Congrats to you. We'll see you soon. Thank you so much.</p><p>Sarah Frey, check out the book, \"The Growing Season.\"</p><p>FREY: Thank you so much.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll be right back.</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN ANCHOR: Welcome back. Good Tuesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Tuesday, August 25th. A look at markets right here at 7:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Futures on the rise this morning once again after another historic day driven by positive trade talks between the U.S. and China. The Dow futures are up 180 points. That's two-thirds of 1 percent. The Nasdaq has turned negative. The Nasdaq has been the leading group in this market. It is now lower by 12.5. The S&amp;P 500 up 12.75. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin speaking by phone with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He. The Nasdaq and the S&amp;P 500 hitting all-time highs yesterday.</p><p>European markets in the green this morning. Take a look. The -- yesterday the market was up strongly with the Dow up 378 points and the momentum continues in Europe. The FT 100's up 10, the CAC quarante is up 41, and the DAX index up 92.</p><p>In Asia overnight a mixed story. Take a look. Best performer was Korea. The Kospi index up one and two-thirds percent.</p><p>Meanwhile this, the California Supreme Court overturning the death sentence of Scott Peterson.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details on that now.</p><p>Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Maria.</p><p>California's high court ruled that significant errors were made in jury selection but they did uphold his murder conviction. Prosecutors have the option of seeking the death penalty again. Peterson was found guilty in 2004 of killing his pregnant wife, Lacey. His lawyer says that he hasn't told Peterson about the ruling because of a Covid-19 outbreak at that prison where he currently is residing.</p><p>Top trade negotiators for the U.S. and China say they are committed to the phase one trade deal signed in January. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He discussed the agreement in a video conference late yesterday. Not a lot of details of the call were released, but Lighthizer's office said topics included significant increases in purchases of U.S. products by China. Tensions between the U.S. and China intensifying recently with the president threatening to ban Chinese apps TikTok and WeChat here in this country.</p><p>And, finally this, hitting a record high. Apple shares closing at more than $500 each yesterday. Investors are racing to beat that eligibility deadline for the company's upcoming stock split.</p><p>Want to take a look at Apple in the pre-market right now. It's actually just a little bit lower by half a percent, but that four for one stock split is going to take place next Monday.</p><p>Meantime, a new report is swirling about the new iPhone. Apple leaked a September 10th event date on YouTube. The new device reportedly, Maria, going to be the first Apple with 5G. The first Apple phone with 5G. We're ready.</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, thank you so much, Cheryl.</p><p>The first night of the 2020 Republican National Convention now in the books. High profile names in the Republican Party making the case for President Trump as the pro-America candidate.</p><p>Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan spoke last night, recounting an emotional time when President Trump comforted his family after his nephew's death. Jordan also slammed Democrats, arguing that they support violent protesters.</p><p>Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH): Look at what's happening in American cities. Cities all run by Democrats. Crime, violence, and mob rule.</p><p>Democrats won't let you go to work, but they'll let you riot. And Democrats won't let you go to school, but they'll let you go loot.</p><p>President Trump has fought against each of their crazy ideas.</p><p>They tried the Russia hoax, the Mueller investigation and the fake impeachment. But in spite of this unbelievable opposition, this president has done what he said he would of do, taxes cut, regulations reduced, economy growing, lowest unemployment in 50 years, out of the Iran deal, embassy in Jerusalem, hostages home from North Korea, a new USMCA agreement and, of course, he's building the wall and rebuilding our economy as we speak.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is Ohio Congressman, House Judiciary Committee and House Oversight and Reform Committee member, Jim Jordan.</p><p>And, Congressman, it's always a pleasure to see you. Congratulations on the speech last night.</p><p>REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH): Thank you, Maria. Good to be with you this morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So tell me what you think is resonating most or what did resonate. You made a -- you made a good point, justification of basically showing what the Republicans are doing in terms of law and order, in terms of insuring that the economy comes back, versus what you're seeing on the other side.</p><p>JORDAN: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Is that what you're goal was?</p><p>JORDAN: Well, I think that was part of it. I think really what came through last night, the president said this Sunday night on your network, he talked about the amazing potential of the American people. And I think that was the theme last night.</p><p>I mean you think about Nikki Haley's story. You think about Senator Scott's story, his humble beginnings, now a United States senator. You think about Herschel Walker's life. You think about those frontline healthcare workers, frontline first responders that the president talked to there at the White House, the hostages he met with, the amazing potential of the American people and just the positive feel we got last night.</p><p>And I meant what I said in my -- in my -- in my speech that the Republican Party is the pro-America party, the institutions, the values, the principles that make our country great. That's what we need to defend. This president is doing that. That's why I think he's going to get reelected.</p><p>BARTIROMO: At the same time, the speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, called the president, as well as the Republicans in Congress, yesterday, domestic enemies, enemies of the state.</p><p>Did you see that?</p><p>JORDAN: Yes, that -- I mean she has -- she has said a number of things that just make no sense, that are just flat-out wrong. This president is -- I think he's that rare individual who comes to this town and actually does what he told the American people he was going to do. That's what the American people so appreciate about him. And I had that list of things we talked about.</p><p>But you think about this -- just take one example. Take putting the embassy in Jerusalem. The -- for -- for as long as I can remember, every single presidential candidate in either party, in both parties, said, if you elect me, I will put the embassy in Jerusalem. Then they get elected and they come up with a million reasons, the swamp gives them tons of reasons why they can't do it. This president did it. And the response you -- and it worked out fine. But -- but the speaker of the House criticizes the president for doing what he told the American people -- that that's how frustrated, that's how -- that's how, you know, the -- the Democrats have been out to get this president, as you know, Maria, since before he was even elected with the whole Trump/Russia investigation.</p><p>So it doesn't -- that's nothing new from her. It is so wrong. And I think the American people see through it. And like I said, I think they're going to elect President Trump as the next president.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, no, you went through it, first the -- the Russia collusion hoax and then, you know, the Mueller investigation, the impeachment, you called it the fake impeachment. You're right, they have been out to get him and take him down from day one.</p><p>Now there's a Postal Service controversy, Congressman. Walk us through this. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy defending his management of the U.S. Postal Service to the House yesterday amid these concerns that his cost- cutting measures are jeopardizing the agency's ability to serve Americans going into a presidential election.</p><p>What's at stake here?</p><p>JORDAN: Well, what the Democrats are really trying to do, and this is not me saying this, this is \"The Wall Street Journal.\" This is the latest conspiracy theory from the Democrats. But there's $14 billion cash on hand. They've got a $10 billion line of credit. What he's doing on collection boxes and sorting machines is nothing new. In fact, the Obama/Biden administration, between 2011 and 2016 removed 12,000 collection boxes around the country. So he's doing nothing new.</p><p>But the Democrats want to create chaos and confusion because they want to count ballots after Election Day. That's what this is about. You saw what happened in New York. One congressional primary, actually the chairwoman of the committee, the sponsor of the Democrats' bill, Caroline Maloney, her election was June 23rd. She wasn't declared the winner until six weeks later.</p><p>In the New Jersey primaries, it took four weeks to count the ballots after the primary election date. And, frankly, look -- go back to the Iowa Democrat caucuses. I don't even know -- I don't know if we still know who won -- who won the Democrat caucus for the -- for the presidential race.</p><p>So the Democrats want this chaos and confusion because I believe, and I'm convinced, they know President Trump is going to win on Election Day, but they want to keep counting ballots after Election Day.</p><p>So that's what this is really about. They want to send out as many live ballots, mail out as many live ballots as they can around this country and then be counting after -- after the election night, after election night's over.</p><p>So, that's what this is about. We need to call it for what it is. And -- but they're attacking the post office for the -- for those reasons. And that's what's -- that's what's scary to me. That's why they're getting so fired up.</p><p>But in -- again, in spite of all that, the president's going to win. I can just feel -- you can see it in Ohio.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But -- but, Congressman --</p><p>JORDAN: I mean he won big in Ohio.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>JORDAN: And I think it's going to be even bigger this time.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So you don't -- you don't buy the polls then because in the polls he's been lagging.</p><p>JORDAN: You can feel it in our state. You see the American flags and Trump signs all over the place.</p><p>I was in Youngstown, not in our district, but across the state, Youngstown, a huge crowd at the Youngstown Republican -- it used to be you couldn't find Republicans in the Youngstown area.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>JORDAN: But 350 people at this Republican event. You feel the energy building. I think last night was a great kickoff in our convention.</p><p>I feel that in Ohio. I feel very good about our state. There's other key states where the president -- and the president's out and about.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>JORDAN: While Joe Biden won't leave his home, the president was in Wisconsin, Minnesota, North Carolina just in the last few days. So he's out and about talking to the American people that he cares so much about.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So what are you going to do? What are you going to -- I mean, look, most people do not want a socialist agenda. Most people do not want to see $4 trillion in tax increases. So you've -- you've got, you know, the right idea in terms of policy. But what are you going to do to stop cheating if there is cheating in terms of mail-in voting? What about big tech? Congressional lawmakers investigating anti-Republican speech, anti- conservative bias at big tech, turning to Amazon as well, Congressman.</p><p>So what about the potential for cheating, whether it's big tech or whether it's mail-in voting? What are you going to do?</p><p>JORDAN: Well, we just -- well, you draw attention to it. That's all we can do at this point. You draw attention to it. That's what we did yesterday in this hearing on -- on the Postal Service. You draw attention to when every single time big tech is censoring conservatives, every single time you draw attention to it so the American people understand what's going on.</p><p>But we also have to look at legislative solutions. Unfortunately, we can't do that with Jerry Nadler running the Judiciary Committee. We need to win back the House in order to actually accomplish some of those things.</p><p>But you draw attention to every single time. When they censor the president, but Twitter also -- at the same time Twitter will allow a statement from -- from the -- the leader of Iran where he actually threatens the safety of American citizens, I mean that's how ridiculous it has gotten.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>JORDAN: So you call attention to it every single time so the American people understand.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right.</p><p>Congressman, we'll be watching, of course. Very important stuff here.</p><p>Congressman Jim Jordan, it's great to see you, sir. Thank you.</p><p>JORDAN: Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Stay right here. We've got former U.S. ambassador to the U.N., Nikki Haley, coming up next. She spoke at the RNC last night, discussing the Trump foreign policy agenda. We'll talk with her coming up.</p><p>You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NIKKI HALEY, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N.: This president has a record of strength and success. The former vice president has a record of weakness and failure. Joe Biden is good for Iran and ISIS, great for communist China, and he's a godsend to everyone who wants America to apologize, abstain and abandon our values.</p><p>Donald Trump takes a different approach. He's tough on China and he took on ISIS and won. And he tells the world what it needs to hear.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN ANCHOR: That was former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley touting the Trump administration's foreign policy record during night one of the Republican National Convention. Haley, one of the several Republican heavy-hitters to take the stage last night after the party officially nominated President Trump for a second term.</p><p>Joining me right now is former U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. herself, former South Carolina governor, Nikki Haley.</p><p>Governor, it's great to have you this morning. Thanks so much for joining us. Congratulations on your speech.</p><p>NIKKI HALEY, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N.: Oh, good morning, Maria. It was a great night last night.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So tell me about that. I felt that it was real and there was sincerity because you had real people out there talking about the impact that these policies have had on them.</p><p>Is this going to be the theme for the rest of the week? Do you feel that it resonated last night?</p><p>HALEY: Well, I think that this week is about truth. I think this week is about facts. What we saw last week was the sky is falling, the world is coming to an end. And this week is a reminder of all of the things President Trump has done in the last three and a half, four years and the progress that can be built on that.</p><p>I mean you heard from fantastic people, whether it was Andrew Pollak or Tim Scott, whether it was the Cuban dissident, Herschel Walker, I mean all of these people know the president, know what it's like to interact with him but have felt what it means to really watch his policies take effect.</p><p>And, you know, the country is continuing to move in a good direction. We've got to continue with President Trump and Vice President Pence to make that keep going.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, you talked about your parents, you talked about being born from Indian parents. And I thought it was so real and sincere the way you spoke about that. Let me -- let me ask you about your own plans because a lot of people look at you and they say, well, we wanted her to be the vice president candidate. We know that it is Mike Pence. But would you accept a job in an administration if the president does get a second term?</p><p>HALEY: Well, that's nothing that I've talked to the president about. Right now we want to see the president and Vice President Pence get over the finish line in November. I think that's what's most important.</p><p>But certainly any chance there is to serve our country, I want to do. And, you know, all that nonsense about me and Pence, he's a dear friend. He's done a great job. He's been loyal to the president and the American people should be very proud.</p><p>So, no, I think we have to get them over the finish line and whatever those two need from me or from anyone else, we want to continue our country moving in the right direction.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You also spoke out about the potential economic ramifications of a Biden presidency.</p><p>Let's' take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HALEY: Last time Joe's boss was Obama. This time, it would be Pelosi, Sanders and the squad. Their vision for America is socialism.</p><p>Joe Biden and the socialist left would be a disaster for our economy.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: So -- so, Governor, we know that a lot of the policies that we're hearing out of AOC and Elizabeth Warren are bordering on socialism, you're right. But when Joe Biden speaks, he tries to, you know, tell people that he's a moderate. In fact, the mainstream media is talking about the party as if it's a moderate. Kamala Harris as well.</p><p>So tell us why you believe that it is, in fact, a disaster and it is socialism, because that's not what he says when asked the question.</p><p>HALEY: Well, first of all, Joe Biden may have been a moderate a few decades ago, but, I mean, you can't go and increase taxes on 82 percent of the Americans when we're coming, you know, out of a Covid situation and say that you're a moderate. You can't go and ask for all of those mandates based on AOC's green new deal and say that you're a moderate. You can't sit there and allow any conversation about socialism ever taking hold in America and claim to be a moderate.</p><p>The truth is that Biden is going to be whoever Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren and AOC tell him to be. And we've seen that. We've watch him through the issues, how he's flip-flopping on the issues. But at the end of the day, he's taking a more progressive stance. He's not taking a more moderate stance and our economy can't afford it. Americans can't afford it.</p><p>What we need right now is for -- for a situation where President Trump already took us over the finish line, where we had more people working than ever before. Opportunities for African-Americans, for Hispanics, for women. We were breaking records left and right. That's where we need to go back to.</p><p>And, you know, President Trump did it once before. We know he can do it again.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>HALEY: We've watched Biden for decades. As a South Carolina governor, I can tell you, they worked against us when we were trying to bring jobs. They certainly didn't try and help us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let me ask you about foreign policy. We talked a lot about the economic successes that President Trump has had. There are foreign policy successes to speak of as well. Just recently we had this peace deal between the United Arab Emirates and Israel. And, of course, this is the president who poked back at China.</p><p>What do you believe, having spent all that time at the U.N., to be the biggest threat and how to deal with it from a foreign policy agenda standpoint?</p><p>HALEY: Well, I've got to tell you that, you know, one of the biggest surprises when I got to the United Nations was literally how the Obama/Biden administration bought -- wanted to just buy their friends. They wanted to be nice with everyone so that everyone would like us back. And -- and President Trump changed that. He -- he made sure that everyone knew what we were for and what we were against.</p><p>I mean our biggest threat hands down is China, but you have to also look at the fact that when we're looking at an Iran deal and there, you know, there's a question about whether they're going to extend the arms embargo, you've got a real problem because this is the number one sponsor of terrorism.</p><p>So we need a strong president.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>HALEY: We need someone strong on foreign policy and we need our countries to know we're taking notice.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ambassador, stay with us. We're going to slip in a short break. I want to ask you more about that foreign policy when we come right back.</p><p>I'm talking with Ambassador Nikki Haley.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>We are back now with former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and former South Carolina governor, Nikki Haley.</p><p>Ambassador, before we went to the break, we were talking about foreign policy. And in your speech last night, you said, Joe Biden is good for Iran, good with ISIS, great for communist China.</p><p>I want to ask you about this recent partnership that Iran and China are deepening. I know they do a lot of business already.</p><p>How concerned are you that it looks like China is partnering with Iran, not only on the sale of oil, but bigger projects as well? Is this an affront against the United States?</p><p>HALEY: We should absolutely be worried about China, but we should be strong against China. You know, what they're trying to do is they're trying to partner with anyone that will weaken America. And so them getting together with the country that's saying death to America is their way of doing that.</p><p>But we have put China actually in a very weak spot. Their economy is feeling it. They have seen what's happened now that we hold them accountable on stealing technology. And they're starting to feel it because of everything that we're doing to counter that, whether it's Huawei, whether it's TikTok or anything in between. I think the president has shown that we're onto them and we're not going to let them get away with anything.</p><p>But the idea that China is holding hands with Iran is very telling, not just for us, but for our allies around the world.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ambassador, let me ask you, your -- your foreign policy experience is so critical to your leadership. Are we going to see you on the 2024 ticket?</p><p>HALEY: Oh, it's too soon to tell any of that right now. Right now I want to get President Trump and Vice President Pence elected.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, we'll leave it there.</p><p>Great to see you, Nikki Haley. Thank you so much.</p><p>We'll be watching.</p><p>HALEY: Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Stay with us.</p><p>We'll be right back.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

JIM JORDAN (R-OH) IS INTERVIEWED ON FOX BUSINESS</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">AUGUST 25, 2020</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SPEAKERS:      REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN ANCHOR</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[*]      MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN ANCHOR:  Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan spoke last night, recounting an emotional time when President Trump comforted his family after his nephew's death. Jordan also slammed Democrats, arguing that they support violent protesters.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Take a listen.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH):  Look at what's happening in American cities. Cities all run by Democrats. Crime, violence, and mob rule.</p><p>Democrats won't let you go to work, but they'll let you riot. And Democrats won't let you go to school, but they'll let you go loot.</p><p>President Trump has fought against each of their crazy ideas.</p><p>They tried the Russia hoax, the Mueller investigation and the fake impeachment. But in spite of this unbelievable opposition, this president has done what he said he would of do, taxes cut, regulations reduced, economy growing, lowest unemployment in 50 years, out of the Iran deal, embassy in Jerusalem, hostages home from North Korea, a new USMCA agreement and, of course, he's building the wall and rebuilding our economy as we speak.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is Ohio Congressman, House Judiciary Committee and House Oversight and Reform Committee member, Jim Jordan.</p><p>And, Congressman, it's always a pleasure to see you. Congratulations on the speech last night.</p><p>REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH):  Thank you, Maria. Good to be with you this morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So tell me what you think is resonating most or what did resonate. You made a -- you made a good point, justification of basically showing what the Republicans are doing in terms of law and order, in terms of insuring that the economy comes back, versus what you're seeing on the other side.</p><p>JORDAN:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is that what you're goal was?</p><p>JORDAN:  Well, I think that was part of it. I think really what came through last night, the president said this Sunday night on your network, he talked about the amazing potential of the American people. And I think that was the theme last night.</p><p>I mean you think about Nikki Haley's story. You think about Senator Scott's story, his humble beginnings, now a United States senator. You think about Herschel Walker's life. You think about those frontline healthcare workers, frontline first responders that the president talked to there at the White House, the hostages he met with, the amazing potential of the American people and just the positive feel we got last night.</p><p>And I meant what I said in my -- in my -- in my speech that the Republican Party is the pro-America party, the institutions, the values, the principles that make our country great. That's what we need to defend. This president is doing that. That's why I think he's going to get reelected.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  At the same time, the speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, called the president, as well as the Republicans in Congress, yesterday, domestic enemies, enemies of the state.</p><p>Did you see that?</p><p>JORDAN:  Yes, that -- I mean she has -- she has said a number of things that just make no sense, that are just flat-out wrong. This president is -- I think he's that rare individual who comes to this town and actually does what he told the American people he was going to do. That's what the American people so appreciate about him. And I had that list of things we talked about.</p><p>But you think about this -- just take one example. Take putting the embassy in Jerusalem. The -- for -- for as long as I can remember, every single presidential candidate in either party, in both parties, said, if you elect me, I will put the embassy in Jerusalem. Then they get elected and they come up with a million reasons, the swamp gives them tons of reasons why they can't do it. This president did it. And the response you -- and it worked out fine. But -- but the speaker of the House criticizes the president for doing what he told the American people -- that that's how frustrated, that's how -- that's how, you know, the -- the Democrats have been out to get this president, as you know, Maria, since before he was even elected with the whole Trump/Russia investigation.</p><p>So it doesn't -- that's nothing new from her. It is so wrong. And I think the American people see through it. And like I said, I think they're going to elect President Trump as the next president.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, no, you went through it, first the -- the Russia collusion hoax and then, you know, the Mueller investigation, the impeachment, you called it the fake impeachment. You're right, they have been out to get him and take him down from day one.</p><p>Now there's a Postal Service controversy, Congressman. Walk us through this. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy defending his management of the U.S. Postal Service to the House yesterday amid these concerns that his cost-cutting measures are jeopardizing the agency's ability to serve Americans going into a presidential election.</p><p>What's at stake here?</p><p>JORDAN:  Well, what the Democrats are really trying to do, and this is not me saying this, this is \"The Wall Street Journal.\" This is the latest conspiracy theory from the Democrats. But there's $14 billion cash on hand. They've got a $10 billion line of credit. What he's doing on collection boxes and sorting machines is nothing new. In fact, the Obama/Biden administration, between 2011 and 2016 removed 12,000 collection boxes around the country. So he's doing nothing new.</p><p>But the Democrats want to create chaos and confusion because they want to count ballots after Election Day. That's what this is about. You saw what happened in New York. One congressional primary, actually the chairwoman of the committee, the sponsor of the Democrats' bill, Caroline Maloney, her election was June 23rd. She wasn't declared the winner until six weeks later.</p><p>In the New Jersey primaries, it took four weeks to count the ballots after the primary election date. And, frankly, look -- go back to the Iowa Democrat caucuses. I don't even know -- I don't know if we still know who won -- who won the Democrat caucus for the -- for the presidential race.</p><p>So the Democrats want this chaos and confusion because I believe, and I'm convinced, they know President Trump is going to win on Election Day, but they want to keep counting ballots after Election Day.</p><p>So that's what this is really about. They want to send out as many live ballots, mail out as many live ballots as they can around this country and then be counting after -- after the election night, after election night's over.</p><p>So, that's what this is about. We need to call it for what it is. And -- but they're attacking the post office for the -- for those reasons. And that's what's -- that's what's scary to me. That's why they're getting so fired up.</p><p>But in -- again, in spite of all that, the president's going to win. I can just feel -- you can see it in Ohio.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But -- but, Congressman --</p><p>JORDAN:  I mean he won big in Ohio.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>JORDAN:  And I think it's going to be even bigger this time.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you don't -- you don't buy the polls then because in the polls he's been lagging.</p><p>JORDAN:  You can feel it in our state. You see the American flags and Trump signs all over the place.</p><p>I was in Youngstown, not in our district, but across the state, Youngstown, a huge crowd at the Youngstown Republican -- it used to be you couldn't find Republicans in the Youngstown area.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>JORDAN:  But 350 people at this Republican event. You feel the energy building. I think last night was a great kickoff in our convention.</p><p>I feel that in Ohio. I feel very good about our state. There's other key states where the president -- and the president's out and about.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>JORDAN:  While Joe Biden won't leave his home, the president was in Wisconsin, Minnesota, North Carolina just in the last few days. So he's out and about talking to the American people that he cares so much about.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what are you going to do? What are you going to -- I mean, look, most people do not want a socialist agenda. Most people do not want to see $4 trillion in tax increases. So you've -- you've got, you know, the right idea in terms of policy. But what are you going to do to stop cheating if there is cheating in terms of mail-in voting? What about big tech? Congressional lawmakers investigating anti-Republican speech, anti-conservative bias at big tech, turning to Amazon as well, Congressman.</p><p>So what about the potential for cheating, whether it's big tech or whether it's mail-in voting? What are you going to do?</p><p>JORDAN:  Well, we just -- well, you draw attention to it. That's all we can do at this point. You draw attention to it. That's what we did yesterday in this hearing on -- on the Postal Service. You draw attention to when every single time big tech is censoring conservatives, every single time you draw attention to it so the American people understand what's going on.</p><p>But we also have to look at legislative solutions. Unfortunately, we can't do that with Jerry Nadler running the Judiciary Committee. We need to win back the House in order to actually accomplish some of those things.</p><p>But you draw attention to every single time. When they censor the president, but Twitter also -- at the same time Twitter will allow a statement from -- from the -- the leader of Iran where he actually threatens the safety of American citizens, I mean that's how ridiculous it has gotten.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>JORDAN:  So you call attention to it every single time so the American people understand.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.</p><p>Congressman, we'll be watching, of course. Very important stuff here.</p><p>Congressman Jim Jordan, it's great to see you, sir.

Jordan also slammed Democrats, arguing that they support violent protesters.   </p><p>      Take a listen.   </p><p>      (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH)</emphasis>:  Look at what's happening in American cities. Cities all run by Democrats. Crime, violence, and mob rule.   </p><p>      Democrats won't let you go to work, but they'll let you riot. And Democrats won't let you go to school, but they'll let you go loot.   </p><p>      President Trump has fought against each of their crazy ideas.   </p><p>      They tried the Russia hoax, the Mueller investigation and the fake impeachment. But in spite of this unbelievable opposition, this president has done what he said he would of do, taxes cut, regulations reduced, economy growing, lowest unemployment in 50 years, out of the Iran deal, embassy in Jerusalem, hostages home from North Korea, a new USMCA agreement and, of course, he's building the wall and rebuilding our economy as we speak.   </p><p>      (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Joining me right now is Ohio Congressman, House Judiciary Committee and House Oversight and Reform Committee member, Jim Jordan.   </p><p>      And, Congressman, it's always a pleasure to see you. Congratulations on the speech last night.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH)</emphasis>:  Thank you, Maria. Good to be with you this morning.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  So tell me what you think is resonating most or what did resonate. You made a -- you made a good point, justification of basically showing what the Republicans are doing in terms of law and order, in terms of insuring that the economy comes back, versus what you're seeing on the other side.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JORDAN</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Is that what you're goal was?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JORDAN</emphasis>:  Well, I think that was part of it. I think really what came through last night, the president said this Sunday night on your network, he talked about the amazing potential of the American people. And I think that was the theme last night.   </p><p>      I mean you think about Nikki Haley's story. You think about Senator Scott's story, his humble beginnings, now a United States senator. You think about Herschel Walker's life. You think about those frontline healthcare workers, frontline first responders that the president talked to there at the White House, the hostages he met with, the amazing potential of the American people and just the positive feel we got last night.   </p><p>      And I meant what I said in my -- in my -- in my speech that the Republican Party is the pro-America party, the institutions, the values, the principles that make our country great. That's what we need to defend. This president is doing that. That's why I think he's going to get reelected.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  At the same time, the speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, called the president, as well as the Republicans in Congress, yesterday, domestic enemies, enemies of the state.   </p><p>      Did you see that?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JORDAN</emphasis>:  Yes, that -- I mean she has -- she has said a number of things that just make no sense, that are just flat-out wrong. This president is -- I think he's that rare individual who comes to this town and actually does what he told the American people he was going to do. That's what the American people so appreciate about him. And I had that list of things we talked about.   </p><p>      But you think about this -- just take one example. Take putting the embassy in Jerusalem. The -- for -- for as long as I can remember, every single presidential candidate in either party, in both parties, said, if you elect me, I will put the embassy in Jerusalem. Then they get elected and they come up with a million reasons, the swamp gives them tons of reasons why they can't do it. This president did it. And the response you -- and it worked out fine. But -- but the speaker of the House criticizes the president for doing what he told the American people -- that that's how frustrated, that's how -- that's how, you know, the -- the Democrats have been out to get this president, as you know, Maria, since before he was even elected with the whole Trump/Russia investigation.   </p><p>      So it doesn't -- that's nothing new from her. It is so wrong. And I think the American people see through it. And like I said, I think they're going to elect President Trump as the next president.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Yes, no, you went through it, first the -- the Russia collusion hoax and then, you know, the Mueller investigation, the impeachment, you called it the fake impeachment. You're right, they have been out to get him and take him down from day one.   </p><p>      Now there's a Postal Service controversy, Congressman. Walk us through this. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy defending his management of the U.S. Postal Service to the House yesterday amid these concerns that his cost-cutting measures are jeopardizing the agency's ability to serve Americans going into a presidential election.   </p><p>      What's at stake here?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JORDAN</emphasis>:  Well, what the Democrats are really trying to do, and this is not me saying this, this is \"The Wall Street Journal.\" This is the latest conspiracy theory from the Democrats. But there's $14 billion cash on hand. They've got a $10 billion line of credit. What he's doing on collection boxes and sorting machines is nothing new. In fact, the Obama/Biden administration, between 2011 and 2016 removed 12,000 collection boxes around the country. So he's doing nothing new.   </p><p>      But the Democrats want to create chaos and confusion because they want to count ballots after Election Day. That's what this is about. You saw what happened in New York. One congressional primary, actually the chairwoman of the committee, the sponsor of the Democrats' bill, Caroline Maloney, her election was June 23rd. She wasn't declared the winner until six weeks later.   </p><p>      In the New Jersey primaries, it took four weeks to count the ballots after the primary election date. And, frankly, look -- go back to the Iowa Democrat caucuses. I don't even know -- I don't know if we still know who won -- who won the Democrat caucus for the -- for the presidential race.   </p><p>      So the Democrats want this chaos and confusion because I believe, and I'm convinced, they know President Trump is going to win on Election Day, but they want to keep counting ballots after Election Day.   </p><p>      So that's what this is really about. They want to send out as many live ballots, mail out as many live ballots as they can around this country and then be counting after -- after the election night, after election night's over.   </p><p>      So, that's what this is about. We need to call it for what it is. And -- but they're attacking the post office for the -- for those reasons. And that's what's -- that's what's scary to me. That's why they're getting so fired up.   </p><p>      But in -- again, in spite of all that, the president's going to win. I can just feel -- you can see it in Ohio.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  But -- but, Congressman --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JORDAN</emphasis>:  I mean he won big in Ohio.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JORDAN</emphasis>:  And I think it's going to be even bigger this time.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  So you don't -- you don't buy the polls then because in the polls he's been lagging.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JORDAN</emphasis>:  You can feel it in our state. You see the American flags and Trump signs all over the place.   </p><p>      I was in Youngstown, not in our district, but across the state, Youngstown, a huge crowd at the Youngstown Republican -- it used to be you couldn't find Republicans in the Youngstown area.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JORDAN</emphasis>:  But 350 people at this Republican event. You feel the energy building. I think last night was a great kickoff in our convention.   </p><p>      I feel that in Ohio. I feel very good about our state. There's other key states where the president -- and the president's out and about.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JORDAN</emphasis>:  While Joe Biden won't leave his home, the president was in Wisconsin, Minnesota, North Carolina just in the last few days. So he's out and about talking to the American people that he cares so much about.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  So what are you going to do? What are you going to -- I mean, look, most people do not want a socialist agenda. Most people do not want to see $4 trillion in tax increases. So you've -- you've got, you know, the right idea in terms of policy. But what are you going to do to stop cheating if there is cheating in terms of mail-in voting? What about big tech? Congressional lawmakers investigating anti-Republican speech, anti-conservative bias at big tech, turning to Amazon as well, Congressman.   </p><p>      So what about the potential for cheating, whether it's big tech or whether it's mail-in voting? What are you going to do?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JORDAN</emphasis>:  Well, we just -- well, you draw attention to it. That's all we can do at this point. You draw attention to it. That's what we did yesterday in this hearing on -- on the Postal Service. You draw attention to when every single time big tech is censoring conservatives, every single time you draw attention to it so the American people understand what's going on.   </p><p>      But we also have to look at legislative solutions. Unfortunately, we can't do that with Jerry Nadler running the Judiciary Committee. We need to win back the House in order to actually accomplish some of those things.   </p><p>      But you draw attention to every single time. When they censor the president, but Twitter also -- at the same time Twitter will allow a statement from -- from the -- the leader of Iran where he actually threatens the safety of American citizens, I mean that's how ridiculous it has gotten.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JORDAN</emphasis>:  So you call attention to it every single time so the American people understand.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  All right.   </p><p>      Congressman, we'll be watching, of course.

JIM JORDAN (R-OH) IS INTERVIEWED ON FOX BUSINESS</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">AUGUST 6, 2020</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SPEAKERS:      REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS HOST</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[*]      STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS HOST:  He's going there. He's going there today. And as we've said, he's going to visit the Whirlpool factory.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Joining us now is Congressman Jim Jordan. He's from Ohio. He will be with the president.</p><p>First of all, Congressman, why Whirlpool?</p><p>REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH):  Well, this president has been manufacturing's best friend. And Whirlpool is a company with thousands of employees across our great state and all around the -- all around the country.</p><p>And as you mentioned, the trade policies that the president has enacted has benefited not just Whirlpool but all of Ohio manufacturing and, frankly, manufacturing across the country. So this is a great place to visit. It's right in the northern part, north-central part of our great state and in our -- in our district. So we're -- we're happy the president's going to be here and I think he's going to get a tremendous reception.</p><p>Remember, Stuart, he won Ohio by 8.5 points in '16. I think he's going to do the same in 2020 and he's going to be re-elected as president of the United States.</p><p>VARNEY:  Well, that's interesting because, at this moment, in a -- in a latest poll, Biden leads Mr. Trump by only one point in Ohio. And I noticed that today Joe Biden is going on a virtual tour of Ohio, but the president will actually be there in person.</p><p>JORDAN:  Yes. Yes. No, the president's going to be here. Then he's going to head to Cleveland, talk to some folks there. I mean it's -- it's going to be a great day for our state.</p><p>And as I said, Joe Biden can hang out in his basement and he can do his virtual tours and he can keep making all the mistakes he makes every time he speaks. This president's going to get out and about and talk with the American people and remind them of the great economy we had. Remember, before this virus, taxes cut, regulations reduced, economy growing at an unbelievable clip, lowest unemployment in 50 years, wages up. Everything was going great. And, guess what? That great -- the virus hit but the great American comeback has started.</p><p>VARNEY:  Good (ph).</p><p>JORDAN:  The numbers you had at the top of your program, the jobs numbers, the market numbers, I mean it's all moving in the right direction. And if we can get Democrat governors to actually let their citizens, let Americans go back to work, you would see this -- you would see us right back to where we were in March. It would happen but for these -- these Democrat governors that don't want to let Americans go back to work.</p><p>VARNEY:  I've got to get this in. You are the perfect person to talk to about censorship.</p><p>JORDAN:  Yes. VARNEY:  Facebook and Twitter taking down that post from President Trump where he said children were almost immune from the virus. I call it flat-out censorship.</p><p>JORDAN:  It is.</p><p>VARNEY:  And I guess you do, too?</p><p>JORDAN:  No, it is. And why is it always conservatives?</p><p>VARNEY:  Right.</p><p>JORDAN:  You never hear about anyone on the left getting censored. It's always conservatives. Here's what Twitter did just a couple weeks ago. They let the leader of Iran, the largest state sponsor of terrorism, put a tweet out that said he will strike a blow against American citizens. That was fine but they censor the president of the United States?</p><p>So, look, over the next 80 some days, before this election, we got to call them out every time it happens. And then when President Trump wins re-election and Republicans take back the House, we have to look at the consequences for big tech targeting conservatives.</p><p>And there's no other way to say it, Stuart. It's not a hunch. It's not a suspicion.</p><p>VARNEY:  It's --</p><p>JORDAN:  Big tech is out to get conservatives.</p><p>VARNEY:  Absolutely. Absolutely.</p><p>JORDAN:  And if they're going to continue to do it, there has to be -- there has to be implications and consequences for those actions.</p><p>VARNEY:  It is incredible to me that the largest, most powerful companies in the world are run by vigorous anti-Trump people from top to bottom. That seems to be the way it is.</p><p>JORDAN:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  Congressman, I know you'd love to keep talking about this and so would I, but you know what, we've got to make some money by playing a commercial.</p><p>We will see you again, sir. Good luck.</p><p>JORDAN:  Take care. Thanks, Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY:  Thank you.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTNW-2430644111</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTNW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60J0-5H71-DY0W-445V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">319798</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"731\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 CQ Roll Call Aug 6, 2020</copyright><publicationName>Political Transcript Wire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 6, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>Whirlpool Corp</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Trump, Donald J</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>United States--US</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Biden, Joseph R Jr</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Ohio</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Presidents</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>State elections</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Manufacturing</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Corporate profiles</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Censorship</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company-number\"><classificationItem><className>NAICS: 335220</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST0008ZF6</classCode><className>INTERVIEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921120CC</classCode><className>LEGISLATIVE BODIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009TD5</classCode><className>US REPUBLICAN PARTY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DF5U</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DNV7</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX000246</classCode><className>CAMPAIGNS &amp;

He's going there today. And as we've said, he's going to visit the Whirlpool factory.  </p><p>      Joining us now is Congressman Jim Jordan. He's from Ohio. He will be with the president.  </p><p>      First of all, Congressman, why Whirlpool?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH)</emphasis>:  Well, this president has been manufacturing's best friend. And Whirlpool is a company with thousands of employees across our great state and all around the -- all around the country.  </p><p>      And as you mentioned, the trade policies that the president has enacted has benefited not just Whirlpool but all of Ohio manufacturing and, frankly, manufacturing across the country. So this is a great place to visit. It's right in the northern part, north-central part of our great state and in our -- in our district. So we're -- we're happy the president's going to be here and I think he's going to get a tremendous reception.  </p><p>      Remember, Stuart, he won Ohio by 8.5 points in '16. I think he's going to do the same in 2020 and he's going to be re-elected as president of the United States.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VARNEY</emphasis>:  Well, that's interesting because, at this moment, in a -- in a latest poll, Biden leads Mr. Trump by only one point in Ohio. And I noticed that today Joe Biden is going on a virtual tour of Ohio, but the president will actually be there in person.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JORDAN</emphasis>:  Yes. Yes. No, the president's going to be here. Then he's going to head to Cleveland, talk to some folks there. I mean it's -- it's going to be a great day for our state.  </p><p>      And as I said, Joe Biden can hang out in his basement and he can do his virtual tours and he can keep making all the mistakes he makes every time he speaks. This president's going to get out and about and talk with the American people and remind them of the great economy we had. Remember, before this virus, taxes cut, regulations reduced, economy growing at an unbelievable clip, lowest unemployment in 50 years, wages up. Everything was going great. And, guess what? That great -- the virus hit but the great American comeback has started.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VARNEY</emphasis>:  Good (ph).  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JORDAN</emphasis>:  The numbers you had at the top of your program, the jobs numbers, the market numbers, I mean it's all moving in the right direction. And if we can get Democrat governors to actually let their citizens, let Americans go back to work, you would see this -- you would see us right back to where we were in March. It would happen but for these -- these Democrat governors that don't want to let Americans go back to work.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VARNEY</emphasis>:  I've got to get this in. You are the perfect person to talk to about censorship.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JORDAN</emphasis>:  Yes. VARNEY:  Facebook and Twitter taking down that post from President Trump where he said children were almost immune from the virus. I call it flat-out censorship.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JORDAN</emphasis>:  It is.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VARNEY</emphasis>:  And I guess you do, too?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JORDAN</emphasis>:  No, it is. And why is it always conservatives?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VARNEY</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JORDAN</emphasis>:  You never hear about anyone on the left getting censored. It's always conservatives. Here's what Twitter did just a couple weeks ago. They let the leader of Iran, the largest state sponsor of terrorism, put a tweet out that said he will strike a blow against American citizens. That was fine but they censor the president of the United States?  </p><p>      So, look, over the next 80 some days, before this election, we got to call them out every time it happens. And then when President Trump wins re-election and Republicans take back the House, we have to look at the consequences for big tech targeting conservatives.  </p><p>      And there's no other way to say it, Stuart. It's not a hunch. It's not a suspicion.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VARNEY</emphasis>:  It's --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JORDAN</emphasis>:  Big tech is out to get conservatives.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VARNEY</emphasis>:  Absolutely. Absolutely.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JORDAN</emphasis>:  And if they're going to continue to do it, there has to be -- there has to be implications and consequences for those actions.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VARNEY</emphasis>:  It is incredible to me that the largest, most powerful companies in the world are run by vigorous anti-Trump people from top to bottom. That seems to be the way it is.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JORDAN</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VARNEY</emphasis>:  Congressman, I know you'd love to keep talking about this and so would I, but you know what, we've got to make some money by playing a commercial.  </p><p>      We will see you again, sir. Good luck.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JORDAN</emphasis>:  Take care. Thanks, Stuart.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VARNEY</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p>      END   </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60HY-0V41-F15W-H2MK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

That's not a suspicion. That's not a hunch. </p><p>That's a fact.'Jordan slammed Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg for being openly biased against conservatives and for trying to throttle political opposition as the 2020 election approaches. He observed, '[W]e're 97 days before an election,' and Big Tech is engaged in 'censoring conservatives and trying to impact elections.' He warned, 'If it doesn't end, there have to be consequences.'Jordan summarized at the House Committee on the Judiciary's Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law Subcommittee[1] how Twitter allows the leadership of Iran to use the platform, the very same nation he called the 'largest state sponsor of terrorism.' He remarked on how Twitter allowed Iranian leadership to threaten to 'strike a reciprocal blow' to the U.S. after Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Major General Qasem Soleimani was killed. He then observed that Iranian leadership can use Twitter to 'threaten the citizens of this great country,' but the U.S. president 'gets censored' for declaring that he will not allow violent rioters from building an autonomous zone in Washington, D.C.Jordan even trashed Big Tech across the board for censoring users who contradict the World Health Organization, 'the organization that lied to us, the organization that shilled for China,' he qualified. Jordan juxtaposed how WHO 'can say whatever they want. They can lie for China, they can shill for China,' but 'if you say something against them, you get censored.' WHO, as late as mid-January, told millions of Twitter users[2] that 'Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission' of COVID-19. He mentioned how Twitter reportedly shadowbanned Republicans, including Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL), Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) and Jordan himself. He said Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey responded by saying, 'Oh, it was just a glitch in our algorithm.'Indeed, this comes at a time when the overwhelming majority[3] of Americans from across the political spectrum are skeptical over Big Tech's unchecked power, a Pew Research Center study found. 'Overall, 72% of U.S. adults say social media companies have too much power and influence in politics today, according to the June 16-22 survey,' Pew's FactTank observed[4] July 22. In addition, about half of Americans surveyed also believe the government should do more to regulate Big Tech companies whose power appears to be unchecked.Conservatives are under attack. Give the House Committee on the Judiciary's Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law Subcommittee a call at 202-225-3951 and demand that Big Tech be held accountable.

That's not a suspicion. That's not a hunch. </p><p>That's a fact.'Jordan slammed Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg for being openly biased against conservatives and for trying to throttle political opposition as the 2020 election approaches. He observed, '[W]e're 97 days before an election,' and Big Tech is engaged in 'censoring conservatives and trying to impact elections.' He warned, 'If it doesn't end, there have to be consequences.'Jordan summarized at the House Committee on the Judiciary's Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law Subcommittee[1] how Twitter allows the leadership of Iran to use the platform, the very same nation he called the 'largest state sponsor of terrorism.' He remarked on how Twitter allowed Iranian leadership to threaten to 'strike a reciprocal blow' to the U.S. after Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Major General Qasem Soleimani was killed. He then observed that Iranian leadership can use Twitter to 'threaten the citizens of this great country,' but the U.S. president 'gets censored' for declaring that he will not allow violent rioters from building an autonomous zone in Washington, D.C.Jordan even trashed Big Tech across the board for censoring users who contradict the World Health Organization, 'the organization that lied to us, the organization that shilled for China,' he qualified. Jordan juxtaposed how WHO 'can say whatever they want. They can lie for China, they can shill for China,' but 'if you say something against them, you get censored.' WHO, as late as mid-January, told millions of Twitter users[2] that 'Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission' of COVID-19. He mentioned how Twitter reportedly shadowbanned Republicans, including Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL), Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) and Jordan himself. He said Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey responded by saying, 'Oh, it was just a glitch in our algorithm.'Indeed, this comes at a time when the overwhelming majority[3] of Americans from across the political spectrum are skeptical over Big Tech's unchecked power, a Pew Research Center study found. 'Overall, 72% of U.S. adults say social media companies have too much power and influence in politics today, according to the June 16-22 survey,' Pew's FactTank observed[4] July 22. In addition, about half of Americans surveyed also believe the government should do more to regulate Big Tech companies whose power appears to be unchecked.Conservatives are under attack. Give the House Committee on the Judiciary's Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law Subcommittee a call at 202-225-3951 and demand that Big Tech be held accountable.

That\u2019s not a suspicion. That's not a hunch. That's a fact.\u201d   Jordan slammed Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg for being openly biased against conservatives and for trying to throttle political opposition as the 2020 election approaches. He observed, \u201c[W]e\u2019re 97 days before an election,\u201d and Big Tech is engaged in \u201ccensoring conservatives and trying to impact elections.\u201d He warned, \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t end, there have to be consequences.\u201d    Jordan summarized at the House Committee on the Judiciary\u2019s Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law Subcommittee how Twitter allows the leadership of Iran to use the platform, the very same nation he called the \u201clargest state sponsor of terrorism.\u201d He remarked on how Twitter allowed Iranian leadership to threaten to \u201cstrike a reciprocal blow\u201d to the U.S. after Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Major General Qasem Soleimani was killed. He then observed that Iranian leadership can use Twitter to \u201cthreaten the citizens of this great country,\u201d but the U.S. president \u201cgets censored\u201d for declaring that he will not allow violent rioters from building an autonomous zone in Washington, D.C.    Jordan even trashed Big Tech across the board for censoring users who contradict the World Health Organization, \u201cthe organization that lied to us, the organization that shilled for China,\u201d he qualified. Jordan juxtaposed how WHO \u201ccan say whatever they want. They can lie for China, they can shill for China,\u201d but \u201cif you say something against them, you get censored.\u201d WHO, as late as mid-January, told millions of Twitter users that \u201cChinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission\u201d of COVID-19.    He mentioned how Twitter reportedly shadowbanned Republicans, including Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL), Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) and Jordan himself. He said Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey responded by saying, \u201cOh, it was just a glitch in our algorithm.\u201d    Indeed, this comes at a time when the overwhelming majority of Americans from across the political spectrum are skeptical over Big Tech\u2019s unchecked power, a Pew Research Center study found. \u201cOverall, 72% of U.S. adults say social media companies have too much power and influence in politics today, according to the June 16-22 survey,\u201d Pew\u2019s FactTank observed July 22. In addition, about half of Americans surveyed also believe the government should do more to regulate Big Tech companies whose power appears to be unchecked.     Conservatives are under attack. Give the House Committee on the Judiciary\u2019s Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law Subcommittee a call at 202-225-3951 and demand that Big Tech be held accountable.

JOE BARTON (R), TEXAS, IS INTERVIEWED ON BB TV</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">APRIL 10, 2018</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SPEAKERS: REP. JOE BARTON (R), TEXAS</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JOE WEISENTHAL, BLOOMBERG NEWS</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JULIA CHATTERLEY, BLOOMBERG NEWS</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SCARLET FU, BLOOMBERG NEWS</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[*] SCARLET FU, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: What'd You Miss? Amid all the attention on Mark Zuckerberg and Syria, House Speaker Paul Ryan today said he will not seek reelection in November.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We want to welcome Congressman Joe Barton from Capitol Hill. He is a Republican from Texas. He's also a vice chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee which Zuckerberg just testified before. Congressman, thank you so much for joining us this afternoon. I want to start with of course Speaker Ryan's announcement that he will retire. Are you sorry to see him go or are you glad to see him stepped down?</p><p>REP. JOE BARTON (R), TEXAS: Well, I'm happy for his family. They'll get to see him a lot more. And that's a good thing. He has teenaged children. I'm sad for the Congress and for the country. Paul Ryan is a good public servant. He has been a good speaker. And he's somebody I consider to be a personal friend. He will be missed.</p><p>JULIA CHATTERLEY, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: He had challenges though with the diversity, let's call it, of the opinions within the GOP. He's also at times had real tensions with the president too. Who do you think is the best person to replace him? And how is that person pull together all sides of the party once obviously Paul Ryan leaves in January?</p><p>BARTON: Well, first of all, Paul Ryan is still speaker. He's going to be speaker the rest of this year. The next Congress will choose a new speaker. Hopefully, it will be a Republican speaker. I'm a Republican. It could be a Democrat. If the Democrats stay for majority, there'll be no lack of candidates. A lot of them, obviously all of them on the Republican side, I know very well. I'm not going to pick a favorite. But, you know, again Paul Ryan has been a very good speaker. And whoever replaces him will have big shoes to fill.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Congressman you said it then, not them. I mean there are a lot of people looking at this and saying this is capitulation by Paul Ryan that he simply doesn't want to be a minority leader after the midterm. Is that what this is?</p><p>BARTON: I do not believe so. I think there's every chance that we'll maintain our majority. We passed this big tax cut bill that's improving people's paychecks. Economic growth is not going to be over 3 percent this year. It's a good thing. A lot of companies are reinvesting in America, which is what President Trump promised when he ran for president. We did pass a health care bill through the House. It didn't make it through the Senate. But we are beginning to dismantle Obamacare.</p><p>We still have six or seven months left to go. And I think there'll still be things that this Congress does. And I think the voters this fall, well, I will not be on the ballot for the first time in 34 years. I think most voters will choose to send the Republican congressman back to Washington.</p><p>JOE WEISENTHAL, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Congressman Barton, obviously, you said, it's -- Paul Ryan is still the speaker, it's going to be a while before the candidates emerge. Regardless of who's specifically it is, what does the next speaker, assuming it's a Republican have to do to unite your caucus?</p><p>BARTON: Well, I think Paul Ryan has done a good job of reuniting the Republican conference here in the House. I'm a member of the Freedom Caucus which is the most conservative group. And we've worked with the speaker on health care and taxes and some of the big issues. The next speaker will have to continue that process. We still have to reform our health care system. We've got to address entitlement reform. We've got to reduce spending and entitlements to bring them into the lower than the rate of growth in the economy. That's probably the number one challenge.</p><p>And then maintain a strong common defense which this Congress has done. And I hope we address immigration issue. If we don't do it in this Congress which is unlikely, I hope we do it in the next. And the new speaker will have that challenge too.</p><p>FU: Congressman, I want to turn now to Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg who testified before your committee this afternoon. And of course, I know you asked about Facebook and centering conservative points of view and also how teens and minors use Facebook. But I wonder whether you get a sense that there's any regulation proposals coming in, if so which ones or what kinds you might support?</p><p>BARTON: Well, as Chairman Walden pointed out. This is the first hearing. It's a fact finding hearing. I'm the cofounder with now Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts, a Democrat of the Congressional Privacy Caucus here on Capitol Hill. I'm still the House co-chairman along with Diana DeGette here in the House.</p><p>I think you could put some, for the lack of better term, soft regulations on the -- on protecting people's privacy on the internet. Currently, you can protect your privacy to some extent. But you've really got to work hard at it and you've got to really redefine print of all these user agreements. It should not be that hard.</p><p>We could certainly clarify what the default position is on most of these servers and internet providers, the ISPs. We could do that in a bipartisan basis. We could certainly, totally protect the privacy of children. That's what I ask some specific question for Mr. Zuckerberg about. I don't think our younger generation really understands that they have a right to privacy. And we need to reestablish that.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: The problem is that, some of the most vocal generations out there, I'm not sure if they necessarily want all that privacy congressman. But I want to ask you because this session was wrapping up. The suggestion was made to other CEOs of this big tech or media however you choose to call them, companies should also come and face Congress. Which CEOs, which companies do you want to be answering similar kind of questions as Facebook because it is a broader question?</p><p>BARTON: That will be the decision that Chairman Walden has to make in conjunction with the ranking minority member Mr. Pallone of New Jersey. I'd like to see Google come before the committee. I'd like to see the big telecommunication companies, AT&amp;Ts, Verizon, Sprint, some of those. I would like to see some of the media companies that provide a lot of options in terms of entertainment.</p><p>You know, it's not automatic in my mind that all of that data out there is there to be dissected, collated, mined, put together and sold. I still think the individual has the right to decide who gets to see it. And make determination of what cookies are allowed on his or her various internet accounts, things like that.</p><p>FU: Congressman Joe Barton, it sounds like it's going to be a busy spring and summer then. Republican of Texas and vice chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, thank you.</p><p>BARTON: Thank you.</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

JOE BARTON (R), TEXAS,  IS INTERVIEWED ON BB TV</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">APRIL 10, 2018</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SPEAKERS: REP. JOE BARTON (R), TEXAS</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JOE WEISENTHAL, BLOOMBERG NEWS</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JULIA CHATTERLEY, BLOOMBERG NEWS</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SCARLET FU, BLOOMBERG NEWS</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[*] SCARLET FU, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  What'd You Miss?  Amid all the attention on  Mark Zuckerberg and Syria, House Speaker Paul Ryan today said he will not  seek reelection in November.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We want to welcome Congressman Joe Barton from Capitol Hill.  He is a  Republican from Texas.  He's also a vice chairman of the House Energy and  Commerce Committee which Zuckerberg just testified before.  Congressman,  thank you so much for joining us this afternoon.  I want to start with of  course Speaker Ryan's announcement that he will retire.  Are you sorry to  see him go or are you glad to see him stepped down?</p><p>REP. JOE BARTON (R), TEXAS:  Well, I'm happy for his family.  They'll get  to see him a lot more.  And that's a good thing.  He has teenaged children.   I'm sad for the Congress and for the country.  Paul Ryan is a good public  servant.  He has been a good speaker.  And he's somebody I consider to be a  personal friend.  He will be missed.</p><p>JULIA CHATTERLEY, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  He had challenges though with the  diversity, let's call it, of the opinions within the GOP.  He's also at  times had real tensions with the president too.  Who do you think is the  best person to replace him?  And how is that person pull together all sides  of the party once obviously Paul Ryan leaves in January?</p><p>BARTON:  Well, first of all, Paul Ryan is still speaker.  He's going to be  speaker the rest of this year.  The next Congress will choose a new  speaker.  Hopefully, it will be a Republican speaker.  I'm a Republican.   It could be a Democrat.  If the Democrats stay for majority, there'll be no  lack of candidates.  A lot of them, obviously all of them on the Republican  side, I know very well.  I'm not going to pick a favorite.  But, you know,  again Paul Ryan has been a very good speaker.  And whoever replaces him  will have big shoes to fill.</p><p>CHATTERLEY:  Congressman you said it then, not them.  I mean there are a  lot of people looking at this and saying this is capitulation by Paul Ryan  that he simply doesn't want to be a minority leader after the midterm.  Is  that what this is?</p><p>BARTON:  I do not believe so.  I think there's every chance that we'll  maintain our majority.  We passed this big tax cut bill that's improving  people's paychecks.  Economic growth is not going to be over 3 percent this  year.  It's a good thing.  A lot of companies are reinvesting in America,  which is what President Trump promised when he ran for president.  We did  pass a health care bill through the House.  It didn't make it through the  Senate.  But we are beginning to dismantle Obamacare.</p><p>We still have six or seven months left to go.  And I think there'll still  be things that this Congress does.  And I think the voters this fall, well,  I will not be on the ballot for the first time in 34 years.  I think most  voters will choose to send the Republican congressman back to Washington.</p><p>JOE WEISENTHAL, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  Congressman Barton, obviously, you said,  it's -- Paul Ryan is still the speaker, it's going to be a while before the  candidates emerge.  Regardless of who's specifically it is, what does the  next speaker, assuming it's a Republican have to do to unite your caucus?</p><p>BARTON:  Well, I think Paul Ryan has done a good job of reuniting the  Republican conference here in the House.  I'm a member of the Freedom  Caucus which is the most conservative group.  And we've worked with the  speaker on health care and taxes and some of the big issues.  The next  speaker will have to continue that process.  We still have to reform our  health care system.  We've got to address entitlement reform.  We've got to  reduce spending and entitlements to bring them into the lower than the rate  of growth in the economy.  That's probably the number one challenge.</p><p>And then maintain a strong common defense which this Congress has done.   And I hope we address immigration issue.  If we don't do it in this  Congress which is unlikely, I hope we do it in the next.  And the new  speaker will have that challenge too.</p><p>FU:  Congressman, I want to turn now to Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg who  testified before your committee this afternoon.  And of course, I know you  asked about Facebook and centering conservative points of view and also how  teens and minors use Facebook.  But I wonder whether you get a sense that  there's any regulation proposals coming in, if so which ones or what kinds  you might support?</p><p>BARTON:  Well, as Chairman Walden pointed out.  This is the first hearing.   It's a fact finding hearing.  I'm the cofounder with now Senator Ed Markey  of Massachusetts, a Democrat of the Congressional Privacy Caucus here on  Capitol Hill.  I'm still the House co-chairman along with Diana DeGette  here in the House.</p><p>I think you could put some, for the lack of better term, soft regulations  on the -- on protecting people's privacy on the internet.  Currently, you  can protect your privacy to some extent.  But you've really got to work  hard at it and you've got to really redefine print of all these user  agreements.  It should not be that hard.</p><p>We could certainly clarify what the default position is on most of these  servers and internet providers, the ISPs.  We could do that in a bipartisan  basis.  We could certainly, totally protect the privacy of children.   That's what I ask some specific question for Mr. Zuckerberg about.  I don't  think our younger generation really understands that they have a right to  privacy.  And we need to reestablish that.</p><p>CHATTERLEY:  The problem is that, some of the most vocal generations out  there, I'm not sure if they necessarily want all that privacy congressman.   But I want to ask you because this session was wrapping up.  The suggestion  was made to other CEOs of this big tech or media however you choose to call  them, companies should also come and face Congress.  Which CEOs, which  companies do you want to be answering similar kind of questions as Facebook  because it is a broader question?</p><p>BARTON:  That will be the decision that Chairman Walden has to make in  conjunction with the ranking minority member Mr. Pallone of New Jersey.   I'd like to see Google come before the committee.  I'd like to see the big  telecommunication companies, AT&amp;Ts, Verizon, Sprint, some of those.

JOE BARTON (R), TEXAS, IS INTERVIEWED ON BB TV</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">APRIL 10, 2018</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SPEAKERS: REP. JOE BARTON (R), TEXAS</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JOE WEISENTHAL, BLOOMBERG NEWS</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JULIA CHATTERLEY, BLOOMBERG NEWS</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SCARLET FU, BLOOMBERG NEWS</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[*] SCARLET FU, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: What'd You Miss? Amid all the attention on Mark Zuckerberg and Syria, House Speaker Paul Ryan today said he will not seek reelection in November.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We want to welcome Congressman Joe Barton from Capitol Hill. He is a Republican from Texas. He's also a vice chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee which Zuckerberg just testified before. Congressman, thank you so much for joining us this afternoon. I want to start with of course Speaker Ryan's announcement that he will retire. Are you sorry to see him go or are you glad to see him stepped down?</p><p>REP. JOE BARTON (R), TEXAS: Well, I'm happy for his family. They'll get to see him a lot more. And that's a good thing. He has teenaged children. I'm sad for the Congress and for the country. Paul Ryan is a good public servant. He has been a good speaker. And he's somebody I consider to be a personal friend. He will be missed.</p><p>JULIA CHATTERLEY, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: He had challenges though with the diversity, let's call it, of the opinions within the GOP. He's also at times had real tensions with the president too. Who do you think is the best person to replace him? And how is that person pull together all sides of the party once obviously Paul Ryan leaves in January?</p><p>BARTON: Well, first of all, Paul Ryan is still speaker. He's going to be speaker the rest of this year. The next Congress will choose a new speaker. Hopefully, it will be a Republican speaker. I'm a Republican. It could be a Democrat. If the Democrats stay for majority, there'll be no lack of candidates. A lot of them, obviously all of them on the Republican side, I know very well. I'm not going to pick a favorite. But, you know, again Paul Ryan has been a very good speaker. And whoever replaces him will have big shoes to fill.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Congressman you said it then, not them. I mean there are a lot of people looking at this and saying this is capitulation by Paul Ryan that he simply doesn't want to be a minority leader after the midterm. Is that what this is?</p><p>BARTON: I do not believe so. I think there's every chance that we'll maintain our majority. We passed this big tax cut bill that's improving people's paychecks. Economic growth is not going to be over 3 percent this year. It's a good thing. A lot of companies are reinvesting in America, which is what President Trump promised when he ran for president. We did pass a health care bill through the House. It didn't make it through the Senate. But we are beginning to dismantle Obamacare.</p><p>We still have six or seven months left to go. And I think there'll still be things that this Congress does. And I think the voters this fall, well, I will not be on the ballot for the first time in 34 years. I think most voters will choose to send the Republican congressman back to Washington.</p><p>JOE WEISENTHAL, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Congressman Barton, obviously, you said, it's -- Paul Ryan is still the speaker, it's going to be a while before the candidates emerge. Regardless of who's specifically it is, what does the next speaker, assuming it's a Republican have to do to unite your caucus?</p><p>BARTON: Well, I think Paul Ryan has done a good job of reuniting the Republican conference here in the House. I'm a member of the Freedom Caucus which is the most conservative group. And we've worked with the speaker on health care and taxes and some of the big issues. The next speaker will have to continue that process. We still have to reform our health care system. We've got to address entitlement reform. We've got to reduce spending and entitlements to bring them into the lower than the rate of growth in the economy. That's probably the number one challenge.</p><p>And then maintain a strong common defense which this Congress has done. And I hope we address immigration issue. If we don't do it in this Congress which is unlikely, I hope we do it in the next. And the new speaker will have that challenge too.</p><p>FU: Congressman, I want to turn now to Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg who testified before your committee this afternoon. And of course, I know you asked about Facebook and centering conservative points of view and also how teens and minors use Facebook. But I wonder whether you get a sense that there's any regulation proposals coming in, if so which ones or what kinds you might support?</p><p>BARTON: Well, as Chairman Walden pointed out. This is the first hearing. It's a fact finding hearing. I'm the cofounder with now Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts, a Democrat of the Congressional Privacy Caucus here on Capitol Hill. I'm still the House co-chairman along with Diana DeGette here in the House.</p><p>I think you could put some, for the lack of better term, soft regulations on the -- on protecting people's privacy on the internet. Currently, you can protect your privacy to some extent. But you've really got to work hard at it and you've got to really redefine print of all these user agreements. It should not be that hard.</p><p>We could certainly clarify what the default position is on most of these servers and internet providers, the ISPs. We could do that in a bipartisan basis. We could certainly, totally protect the privacy of children. That's what I ask some specific question for Mr. Zuckerberg about. I don't think our younger generation really understands that they have a right to privacy. And we need to reestablish that.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: The problem is that, some of the most vocal generations out there, I'm not sure if they necessarily want all that privacy congressman. But I want to ask you because this session was wrapping up. The suggestion was made to other CEOs of this big tech or media however you choose to call them, companies should also come and face Congress. Which CEOs, which companies do you want to be answering similar kind of questions as Facebook because it is a broader question?</p><p>BARTON: That will be the decision that Chairman Walden has to make in conjunction with the ranking minority member Mr. Pallone of New Jersey. I'd like to see Google come before the committee. I'd like to see the big telecommunication companies, AT&amp;Ts, Verizon, Sprint, some of those. I would like to see some of the media companies that provide a lot of options in terms of entertainment.</p><p>You know, it's not automatic in my mind that all of that data out there is there to be dissected, collated, mined, put together and sold. I still think the individual has the right to decide who gets to see it. And make determination of what cookies are allowed on his or her various internet accounts, things like that.</p><p>FU: Congressman Joe Barton, it sounds like it's going to be a busy spring and summer then. Republican of Texas and vice chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, thank you.</p><p>BARTON: Thank you.</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

JOE BARTON (R), TEXAS</nameText></person></p></bodyText></section><section sectionType=\"body\"><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>:  What'd You Miss? Amid all the attention on Mark Zuckerberg and Syria, House Speaker Paul Ryan today said he will not seek reelection in November.  </p><p>      We want to welcome Congressman Joe Barton from Capitol Hill. He is a Republican from Texas. He's also a vice chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee which Zuckerberg just testified before. Congressman, thank you so much for joining us this afternoon. I want to start with of course Speaker Ryan's announcement that he will retire. Are you sorry to see him go or are you glad to see him stepped down?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTON</emphasis>:  Well, I'm happy for his family. They'll get to see him a lot more. And that's a good thing. He has teenaged children. I'm sad for the Congress and for the country. Paul Ryan is a good public servant. He has been a good speaker. And he's somebody I consider to be a personal friend. He will be missed.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>:  He had challenges though with the diversity, let's call it, of the opinions within the GOP. He's also at times had real tensions with the president too. Who do you think is the best person to replace him? And how is that person pull together all sides of the party once obviously Paul Ryan leaves in January?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTON</emphasis>:  Well, first of all, Paul Ryan is still speaker. He's going to be speaker the rest of this year. The next Congress will choose a new speaker. Hopefully, it will be a Republican speaker. I'm a Republican. It could be a Democrat. If the Democrats stay for majority, there'll be no lack of candidates. A lot of them, obviously all of them on the Republican side, I know very well. I'm not going to pick a favorite. But, you know, again Paul Ryan has been a very good speaker. And whoever replaces him will have big shoes to fill.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>:  Congressman you said it then, not them. I mean there are a lot of people looking at this and saying this is capitulation by Paul Ryan that he simply doesn't want to be a minority leader after the midterm. Is that what this is?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTON</emphasis>:  I do not believe so. I think there's every chance that we'll maintain our majority. We passed this big tax cut bill that's improving people's paychecks. Economic growth is not going to be over 3 percent this year. It's a good thing. A lot of companies are reinvesting in America, which is what President Trump promised when he ran for president. We did pass a health care bill through the House. It didn't make it through the Senate. But we are beginning to dismantle Obamacare.  </p><p>      We still have six or seven months left to go. And I think there'll still be things that this Congress does. And I think the voters this fall, well, I will not be on the ballot for the first time in 34 years. I think most voters will choose to send the Republican congressman back to Washington.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEISENTHAL</emphasis>:  Congressman Barton, obviously, you said, it's -- Paul Ryan is still the speaker, it's going to be a while before the candidates emerge. Regardless of who's specifically it is, what does the next speaker, assuming it's a Republican have to do to unite your caucus?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTON</emphasis>:  Well, I think Paul Ryan has done a good job of reuniting the Republican conference here in the House. I'm a member of the Freedom Caucus which is the most conservative group. And we've worked with the speaker on health care and taxes and some of the big issues. The next speaker will have to continue that process. We still have to reform our health care system. We've got to address entitlement reform. We've got to reduce spending and entitlements to bring them into the lower than the rate of growth in the economy. That's probably the number one challenge.  </p><p>      And then maintain a strong common defense which this Congress has done. And I hope we address immigration issue. If we don't do it in this Congress which is unlikely, I hope we do it in the next. And the new speaker will have that challenge too.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>:  Congressman, I want to turn now to Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg who testified before your committee this afternoon. And of course, I know you asked about Facebook and centering conservative points of view and also how teens and minors use Facebook. But I wonder whether you get a sense that there's any regulation proposals coming in, if so which ones or what kinds you might support?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTON</emphasis>:  Well, as Chairman Walden pointed out. This is the first hearing. It's a fact finding hearing. I'm the cofounder with now Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts, a Democrat of the Congressional Privacy Caucus here on Capitol Hill. I'm still the House co-chairman along with Diana DeGette here in the House.  </p><p>      I think you could put some, for the lack of better term, soft regulations on the -- on protecting people's privacy on the internet. Currently, you can protect your privacy to some extent. But you've really got to work hard at it and you've got to really redefine print of all these user agreements. It should not be that hard.  </p><p>      We could certainly clarify what the default position is on most of these servers and internet providers, the ISPs. We could do that in a bipartisan basis. We could certainly, totally protect the privacy of children. That's what I ask some specific question for Mr. Zuckerberg about. I don't think our younger generation really understands that they have a right to privacy. And we need to reestablish that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>:  The problem is that, some of the most vocal generations out there, I'm not sure if they necessarily want all that privacy congressman. But I want to ask you because this session was wrapping up. The suggestion was made to other CEOs of this big tech or media however you choose to call them, companies should also come and face Congress. Which CEOs, which companies do you want to be answering similar kind of questions as Facebook because it is a broader question?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTON</emphasis>:  That will be the decision that Chairman Walden has to make in conjunction with the ranking minority member Mr. Pallone of New Jersey. I'd like to see Google come before the committee. I'd like to see the big telecommunication companies, AT&amp;Ts, Verizon, Sprint, some of those. I would like to see some of the media companies that provide a lot of options in terms of entertainment.  </p><p>      You know, it's not automatic in my mind that all of that data out there is there to be dissected, collated, mined, put together and sold. I still think the individual has the right to decide who gets to see it. And make determination of what cookies are allowed on his or her various internet accounts, things like that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>:  Congressman Joe Barton, it sounds like it's going to be a busy spring and summer then. Republican of Texas and vice chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTON</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p>      END   </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FMRWRE2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S39-P401-F15W-H2J2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">345281</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>Financial Markets Regulatory Wire</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

Buck commented on how Google removed itself from the bidding process to work with the American military,[2] but continued to work with China.He remarked that 'Google's stated reason for removing itself from the bidding process is that the U.S. military's project [JEDI] did not align with Google's corporate values and principles.' By contrast, he explained how U.S. Marine General Joseph Dunford Jr.[3] warned that China was 'directly benefiting from Google's work.'Buck said that this made him 'wonder what values Google and communist red China have in common.' </p><p>He asked himself: 'Is it that the Chinese Communist party imprisons Uighur Muslims in concentration camps,' or 'could it be that China forces slaves to work in sweatshops?'Perhaps more relevant to Big Tech tactics, he asked if Google's views 'align on the design to suppress free speech in Hong Kong,' or the 'CCP's decision to lie to the world about the COVID-19 pandemic.' He then mentioned Google's embarrassing involvement with Project Dragonfly, a search engine that was being developed for the communist Chinese regime 'to spy on its own people and enforce draconian security laws.'Buck used his Twitter page[4] to retweet footage from the hearing and summarized his questions: 'If Google wants to cozy up to Communist China, Mr. Pichai must answer for the atrocities committed by the CCP.'Do they agree with CCP suppression of free speech in Hong Kong?'Or the imprisonment [sic] Uighur Muslims?'What about China's use of slave labor?' Indeed, this comes at a time when the overwhelming majority[5] of Americans from across the political spectrum are skeptical over Big Tech's unchecked power, a Pew Research Center study found. 'Overall, 72% of U.S. adults say social media companies have too much power and influence in politics today, according to the June 16-22 survey,' Pew's FactTank observed[6] July 22. In addition, about half of Americans surveyed also believe the government should do more to regulate Big Tech companies whose power appears to be unchecked.Conservatives are under attack. Give the House Committee on the Judiciary's Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law Subcommittee a call at 202-225-3951 and demand that Big Tech be held accountable.

Buck commented on how Google removed itself from the bidding process to work with the American military,[2] but continued to work with China.He remarked that 'Google's stated reason for removing itself from the bidding process is that the U.S. military's project [JEDI] did not align with Google's corporate values and principles.' By contrast, he explained how U.S. Marine General Joseph Dunford Jr.[3] warned that China was 'directly benefiting from Google's work.'Buck said that this made him 'wonder what values Google and communist red China have in common.' </p><p>He asked himself: 'Is it that the Chinese Communist party imprisons Uighur Muslims in concentration camps,' or 'could it be that China forces slaves to work in sweatshops?'Perhaps more relevant to Big Tech tactics, he asked if Google's views 'align on the design to suppress free speech in Hong Kong,' or the 'CCP's decision to lie to the world about the COVID-19 pandemic.' He then mentioned Google's embarrassing involvement with Project Dragonfly, a search engine that was being developed for the communist Chinese regime 'to spy on its own people and enforce draconian security laws.'Buck used his Twitter page[4] to retweet footage from the hearing and summarized his questions: 'If Google wants to cozy up to Communist China, Mr. Pichai must answer for the atrocities committed by the CCP.'Do they agree with CCP suppression of free speech in Hong Kong?'Or the imprisonment [sic] Uighur Muslims?'What about China's use of slave labor?' Indeed, this comes at a time when the overwhelming majority[5] of Americans from across the political spectrum are skeptical over Big Tech's unchecked power, a Pew Research Center study found. 'Overall, 72% of U.S. adults say social media companies have too much power and influence in politics today, according to the June 16-22 survey,' Pew's FactTank observed[6] July 22. In addition, about half of Americans surveyed also believe the government should do more to regulate Big Tech companies whose power appears to be unchecked.Conservatives are under attack. Give the House Committee on the Judiciary's Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law Subcommittee a call at 202-225-3951 and demand that Big Tech be held accountable.

During a Congressional Antitrust Hearing hearing, Buck brought the hammer down on Google CEO Sundar Pichai for his company\u2019s ties to China. Buck commented on how Google removed itself from the bidding process to work with the American military, but continued to work with China.     He remarked that \u201cGoogle\u2019s stated reason for removing itself from the bidding process is that the U.S. military\u2019s project [JEDI] did not align with Google\u2019s corporate values and principles.\u201d By contrast, he explained how U.S. Marine General Joseph Dunford Jr. warned that China was \u201cdirectly benefiting from Google\u2019s work.\u201d    Buck said that this made him \u201cwonder what values Google and communist red China have in common.\u201d He asked himself: \u201cIs it that the Chinese Communist party imprisons Uighur Muslims in concentration camps,\u201d or \u201ccould it be that China forces slaves to work in sweatshops?\u201d     Perhaps more relevant to Big Tech tactics, he asked if Google\u2019s views \u201calign on the design to suppress free speech in Hong Kong,\u201d or the \u201cCCP\u2019s decision to lie to the world about the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d He then mentioned Google\u2019s embarrassing involvement with Project Dragonfly, a search engine that was being developed for the communist Chinese regime \u201cto spy on its own people and enforce draconian security laws.\u201d    Buck used his Twitter page to retweet footage from the hearing and summarized his questions:     \u201cIf Google wants to cozy up to Communist China, Mr. Pichai must answer for the atrocities committed by the CCP.     \u201cDo they agree with CCP suppression of free speech in Hong Kong?     \u201cOr the imprisonment [sic] Uighur Muslims?     \u201cWhat about China\u2019s use of slave labor?\u201d     Indeed, this comes at a time when the overwhelming majority of Americans from across the political spectrum are skeptical over Big Tech\u2019s unchecked power, a Pew Research Center study found. \u201cOverall, 72% of U.S. adults say social media companies have too much power and influence in politics today, according to the June 16-22 survey,\u201d Pew\u2019s FactTank observed July 22. In addition, about half of Americans surveyed also believe the government should do more to regulate Big Tech companies whose power appears to be unchecked.    Conservatives are under attack. Give the House Committee on the Judiciary\u2019s Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law Subcommittee a call at 202-225-3951 and demand that Big Tech be held accountable.

KEN BUCK (R-CO)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">STUART VARNEY, FBN HOST</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[*]      VARNEY:  Next we have this. What have we got here? OK, there's a car has driven through a crowd of protesters. You can see that. That was in Arura, Colorado, I believe. Another protester was shot. Look, lots of events going on there in Colorado over the weekend.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Congressman Ken Buck, Republican from Colorado, is with us right now.</p><p>Look, sir, this is shaping up as a clash between local Democrat authorities and federal authorities. Those are the two sides here. Seems like impossible to bring them together.</p><p>BUCK:  Well, I think it is very difficult to bring them together. And one thing that I think people have to understand is when -- when folks are protesting peacefully, we've got to respect that distance, we've got to respect their voice. When they commit crimes, it is the job of the police officers, whether they're property crimes or crimes against people, jobs of the police officers to make sure that those folks are arrest and brought to justice.</p><p>VARNEY:  What's going on here, Congressman? I mean we've pitched battles in the streets all across America and no sign that it's going to end.</p><p>BUCK:  Yes, I think it's terribly sad. And what's going on is very simple. People do not understand that this is a country where there is free speech. People can exercise that free speech. And we should allow those people to protest.</p><p>I know that in -- in Colorado, we had a protest in support of the police and they were, the protesters, the conservatives who were trying to support the police were attacked for doing so. That -- that can't happen in -- in this country.</p><p>VARNEY:  I just wonder when it's going to end and what the -- what's the politics of this? I mean middle America is looking at what's going on in the cities. They see pitched battles all over the place. Our cities are in flames. What's the politics of this?</p><p>BUCK:  Well, I think it plays to two sides. On the right, I think people are very frustrated and I think President Trump is gaining quiet support as a result of the anarchists and their tactics. On the left, I think people understand, or appreciate -- wrongfully appreciate the fact that while there are some social issues in this country that need to be addressed, the violence is getting out of hand. And I think while the left appreciates action on important issues, I think they are also frustrated that there is violence.</p><p>VARNEY:  I want to ask you about the leader of the big tech companies who will be virtually appearing on Capitol Hill later this week. I want to ask your opinion. Do you want to break up these big tech companies? Do you want to tax them some more? Do you want to, in some way, regulate them? Do you want to inhibit the activities of what I call the crown jewels of American business or do you want to just leave them alone? What do you want to do with the big tech in America?</p><p>BUCK:  Well, I don't want to do any of the above. None of the things that you described are something that I advocate. Congress' role is to create laws and to update laws that apply to these tech companies and can be used by regulators to make sure that there's no anti-competitive behavior. That's the role of Congress. I don't think Congress can walk into this and say, we want to break up these companies or not. Our job is to make sure that laws that are antiquated, laws that don't apply in this situation, are applicable to where technology has -- has gone.</p><p>VARNEY:  Congressman Ken Buck, Republican, Colorado, thank you for joining us, sir. We appreciate it.</p><p>BUCK:  Thank you.</p><p>VARNEY:  Thank you, sir.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTNW-2427295674</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTNW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60FV-FS11-DY0W-41F8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">319798</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"613\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 CQ Roll Call Jul 27, 2020</copyright><publicationName>Political Transcript Wire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 27, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>Congress</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Colorado</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Buck, Ken</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Freedom of speech</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company-number\"><classificationItem><className>NAICS: 921120</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001932</classCode><className>CRIME, LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp;

OK, there's a car has driven through a crowd of protesters. You can see that. That was in Arura, Colorado, I believe. Another protester was shot. Look, lots of events going on there in Colorado over the weekend.   </p><p>      Congressman Ken Buck, Republican from Colorado, is with us right now.   </p><p>      Look, sir, this is shaping up as a clash between local Democrat authorities and federal authorities. Those are the two sides here. Seems like impossible to bring them together.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUCK</emphasis>:  Well, I think it is very difficult to bring them together. And one thing that I think people have to understand is when -- when folks are protesting peacefully, we've got to respect that distance, we've got to respect their voice. When they commit crimes, it is the job of the police officers, whether they're property crimes or crimes against people, jobs of the police officers to make sure that those folks are arrest and brought to justice.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VARNEY</emphasis>:  What's going on here, Congressman? I mean we've pitched battles in the streets all across America and no sign that it's going to end.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUCK</emphasis>:  Yes, I think it's terribly sad. And what's going on is very simple. People do not understand that this is a country where there is free speech. People can exercise that free speech. And we should allow those people to protest.   </p><p>      I know that in -- in Colorado, we had a protest in support of the police and they were, the protesters, the conservatives who were trying to support the police were attacked for doing so. That -- that can't happen in -- in this country.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VARNEY</emphasis>:  I just wonder when it's going to end and what the -- what's the politics of this? I mean middle America is looking at what's going on in the cities. They see pitched battles all over the place. Our cities are in flames. What's the politics of this?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUCK</emphasis>:  Well, I think it plays to two sides. On the right, I think people are very frustrated and I think President Trump is gaining quiet support as a result of the anarchists and their tactics. On the left, I think people understand, or appreciate -- wrongfully appreciate the fact that while there are some social issues in this country that need to be addressed, the violence is getting out of hand. And I think while the left appreciates action on important issues, I think they are also frustrated that there is violence.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VARNEY</emphasis>:  I want to ask you about the leader of the big tech companies who will be virtually appearing on Capitol Hill later this week. I want to ask your opinion. Do you want to break up these big tech companies? Do you want to tax them some more? Do you want to, in some way, regulate them? Do you want to inhibit the activities of what I call the crown jewels of American business or do you want to just leave them alone? What do you want to do with the big tech in America?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUCK</emphasis>:  Well, I don't want to do any of the above. None of the things that you described are something that I advocate. Congress' role is to create laws and to update laws that apply to these tech companies and can be used by regulators to make sure that there's no anti-competitive behavior. That's the role of Congress. I don't think Congress can walk into this and say, we want to break up these companies or not. Our job is to make sure that laws that are antiquated, laws that don't apply in this situation, are applicable to where technology has -- has gone.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VARNEY</emphasis>:  Congressman Ken Buck, Republican, Colorado, thank you for joining us, sir. We appreciate it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUCK</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VARNEY</emphasis>:  Thank you, sir.   </p><p>      END   </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60FT-8XR1-JDPT-T0R6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

Good Monday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Monday, October 7th. Your top stories right now, 8:00 a.m. on the button on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Markets are lower this morning, some uneasiness ahead of the China-U.S. meeting, happening on Thursday, this week, this is the resumption of trade talks, Dow Industrials now indicated, down 60 points, S&amp;P down 7, and the NASDAQ lower by 22.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This after last week's, well, it was a down week, but Friday was a good day. Stocks rallied Friday following the jobs' report, 135,000 jobs added to the economy. The NASDAQ was higher for the week, but Friday's gains were not enough to bring the Dow and the S&amp;P out of negative territory for the week.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Global markets this morning, are mostly higher, take a look at European indices right now, we did have more signs of a slowdown in Europe this morning, we've got the German factory orders number, declining six-tenths of a percent in the month of August, more than expected. Orders from inside Germany were down 2-1/2 percent, 2.6 percent.</p><p>FT 100 nonetheless, up 18 points, CAC Quarante in Paris up 9 points, DAX Index in Germany, higher by 26. In Asia overnight, markets in China and Hong Kong closed for the Golden Week holidays, 70 years of Communist rule celebration. Meanwhile, the others were fractionally moving.</p><p>The U.S.-China trade tensions are in focus this morning, China, says that it is narrowing the list and the scope of possible issues that it is even willing to discuss, at this week's meeting on Thursday. A look at what could be off the table when both sides meet Thursday in Washington, coming up.</p><p>Then, the NBA is under fire this morning from China, Chinese businesses cutting ties with the Houston Rockets after its manager expressed support for Hong Kong's pro-democracy activists, in a tweet, even the NBA is distancing itself from the remarks, prompting backlash from lawmakers, all this as violent protests continue over the weekend, in 18 straight weekends of protesters in Hong Kong.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Monday morning, but first, our top story this half an hour, whistleblower controversy continues, the attorney representing the Ukraine whistleblower says another person is coming forward with a complaint against the president. Blake Burman is at the White House this morning, covering the story. Blake.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX NEWS SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Maria, good morning to you. That's right. There are now multiple whistleblowers, and one of those whistleblowers is said to have firsthand knowledge of that July 25th phone call between President Trump and the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky.</p><p>Attorney Mark Zaid, tweeting out over the weekend, the following, writing \"news update: I can confirm this report of a second whistleblower being represented by our legal team. They also made a protective disclosure under the law and cannot be retaliated against. This whistleblower has firsthand knowledge.</p><p>The Democratic Congressman Jim Himes, who is the number two Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, contends that these whistleblowers could not sit by idle any longer.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JIM HIMES (D-CT): People around the president, professionals, who are in the Oval Office, who are in the situation room, are watching what is happening, and are finally saying, my God, this cannot happen anymore.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: The White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham shrugged off reports of another whistleblower, saying in a statement, \"It doesn't matter how many people decide to call themselves whistleblowers, about the same telephone call, a call the president already made public, it doesn't change the fact that he has done nothing wrong.</p><p>One of the president's top allies on Capitol Hill, Senator Lindsey Graham, saying on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" that he feels the mounting allegations parallel Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court nomination.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): This is Kavanaugh all over again. It -- does this second whistleblower, if there is one, are they within the intel community? And what is it about the intel community and Trump that is so off base here?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: Meantime, Maria, here at the White House, we await a letter from the president, to Nancy Pelosi, that will challenge her to officially hold a vote on an impeachment inquiry. This could happen at some point this week.</p><p>The thinking here, Maria, over here at the White House, is that the president is not being afforded all of the legal rights that he would have, if there would be an official impeachment inquiry versus kind of the state of limbo, that everything is in, right now. Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Blake, thank you. We will be following that. Blake Burman is at the White House. And joining us right now with more on that is California congressman, House Minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, Leader McCarthy, it's good to see you.</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): Thank you. First time on the new set. It's wonderful.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. And you sent two letters to Speaker Pelosi last week, calling for customary rules and procedures to be established for the impeachment inquiry. I want you to talk about that a bit, because I know that having an inquiry in the intel committee is different than having it in the judiciary committee. Can you explain?</p><p>MCCARTHY: Well, first of all, let's think about all the past Congress in modern history, before they go to any impeachment, they have an impeachment inquiry, why? Because it's such an important fact. You are asking to remove -- which democratically, someone was just elected, so you should not take this lightly.</p><p>And everybody in America lends their voice to 435 people, so everybody should have a voice, and it sets the rules. So, with Clinton, with Nixon, with the judges, a fair process. Right now, the minority does not have the right to subpoena power. The president's counsel can't be in the room. They moved it from the jurisdiction of having it from judiciary to intel.</p><p>So now, they have a hearing, you know who gets to control who gets to come in the room? The Democrats. They tell us how many Republicans are allowed in, how much staff is allowed in. They don't allow us to set witnesses.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, they want to impeach a duly elected president behind closed doors.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Exactly. And if you would release the transcripts of the hearings from last week, I think American public would again say, in this facade, this is all about politics. No, what happens is, they released just one or two texts, something that makes them look good, instead of letting all the facts speak.</p><p>Nowhere in America would somebody go to a trial without able to have a witness, without able to cross-examine without being able to have any fairness, and that is what Nancy Pelosi is doing. She's going against what Speaker Albert did and what Newt Gingrich did, unheard of --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCCARTHY: -- in the process, and it goes to the fact that this is all political.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, we saw that this last week, because Atkinson was in a hearing behind closed doors. Kurt Volker was at a hearing behind closed doors. And these hearings, you know, little things leak out, I guess, and it -- and I'm hearing that -- the testimony, basically put this whole impeachment, you know, idea, it just busted it because of what Kurt Volker said.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But we don't know because it was closed doors.</p><p>MCCARTHY: But very clear when you talk to the members who were in there. There was -- they were very clear about no quid, I mean, stated it, the fact, all of them, and they're good for nine hours. But what we found about the I.G., I think, is very important.</p><p>Here we go, another common denominator, Adam Schiff, the man who started out telling us he had proof beyond circumstantial, and put America --</p><p>BARTIROMO: It was in plain sight. It was in --</p><p>MCCARTHY: Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- plain sight.</p><p>MCCARTHY: He met with the -- his staff met with this whistleblower, the whistleblower then goes to the I.G., the Inspector General, never mentions that he met with Schiff's staff. They are now fact witnesses. If we had subpoena power, we'd call their staff and Adam Schiff, as one of the witnesses.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>MCCARTHY: What did you talk about? What was said? How many times did you speak? They cannot be a prosecutor.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>MCCARTHY: There's nowhere in American judiciary that allows an individual, that is a fact witness, to become the prosecutor.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, do you believe the president will be pushed out of office?</p><p>MCCARTHY: No. Because -- and I read about this second whistleblower, you and I have more knowledge than the first whistleblower, America --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, we have the transcripts.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Exactly. So, what more came out? There's nothing in that phone call that's impeachable, or that he did wrong. Every day, we work with other countries, to solve cases.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCCARTHY: There is an open case about what happened with this Russia coup that they want to try to do in America. The attorney general has an open case about it, the world knows about it. A lot of that started in Ukraine, and they're trying to find the information about it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And that's why, I think, this is really what this is about, the Democrats are going to do anything they can to stop William Barr and John Durham from, you know, uncovering what took place in 2016.</p><p>MCCARTHY: You know, William Barr, I respect the man, greatly. He believes in the rule of law.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCCARTHY: And he's going to follow it. Unfortunately, the Democrats in Congress do not believe in the rule of law. They are trying to discredit democracy. Think about what they are doing, they're going to tear the fabric of America apart. Remove a president? With no basis. If the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, had waited 48 hours, and had that transcript --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCCARTHY: We would not be in this nightmare we are today.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What are you going to do about this, though? I mean, you are the leader of the Republicans, you're trying to get work done, you got USMCA hanging in the balance --</p><p>MCCARTHY: Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- you got a meeting with China on Thursday, trying to do a deal there. You've got immigration, gun legislation, all this, nothing gets done?</p><p>MCCARTHY: The Democrats have the majority, so they could control what comes forward. What they really should be doing, USMCA, United States, Mexico and Canada. Mexico already ratified it, Canada is waiting us on, we've got a meeting with China coming up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCCARTHY: A month and a half ago, Mexico became our number one trader and Canada became number two. We would be stronger in our negotiations with China, but they are more concerned about tearing the president down, than building America up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, let's talk China for a second, because there is real basketball backlash going on this morning. The Houston Rockets' general manager, he's under pressure because he put out a tweet supporting the Hong Kong protesters.</p><p>It's caused a major uproar in China, where the Rockets are extremely popular, by the way, they want that market access. Chinese sponsors, Chinese businesses, all pulling support from the Rockets.</p><p>An NBA spokesperson responded this way, the values of the league support individuals educating themselves and sharing their views of matters important to them. We have great respect for the history and culture of China and hope that sports and the NBA can be used for a unifying force to bridge cultural divide.</p><p>But they rolled over. They rolled over. They basically removed the tweet, and now they're saying, OK, you know, we didn't mean it, because the Chinese government is on the Rockets to stop supporting the protesters.</p><p>MCCARTHY: I have one question for them, do they stand for freedom or do they stand for money? America's more than a country, America is an idea, just like in the 80s, when the shipyard workers rose up in Poland, because they believed in freedom.</p><p>You've got a large percentage of people standing up in Hong Kong, every Saturday, peacefully protesting for the idea of freedom of speech. This is -- this is a defining moment. The Houston Rocket G.M. should be -- should be celebrated because he understands what America means.</p><p>He understands what freedom means. And if these people will fold to China, in an idea that they just want to have a bigger market share, that is concerning to me of what the world will look like in the future.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You know, it's a -- it's a bigger issue for corporate America, right? Because CEOs for a long time, just wanted the access. They want to be able to sell their goods to 1.4 billion people, but in the process, they forgot about protecting the product.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Did they forget Tiananmen Square? Why wouldn't you stand with a man who stood in front of the tank? What about how this country was created? Does that mean, at the end of the day, they will fold over for the freedom and rights of what deems to be an American just because they want to earn a dollar?</p><p>BARTIROMO: What should we be thinking about that whole military parade that we saw in China the other day? I mean, you know, you talk about national security, I know not publicly, but you are, you know, understanding the issues with regard to China and its risk to America and our national security.</p><p>So, last week, they've got this military parade, celebrating, you know, 70 years of Communist rule with a missile that has the range to hit the United States.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Hypersonics, because in the Obama administration, he cut our funding when it came to hypersonics. This is what's so important if why, because we have impeachment, we don't have USMCA. This president is trying to rebuild this military, but we don't have the appropriation bills done, why? Because Congress can't do their work and move forward.</p><p>We need to make that investment to make it safer, because China just celebrate its 70 years, in 2049, when they are at 100 years, they believe there's one world power. That was a clear message to us. And wouldn't be we be stronger in our negotiations with China when it comes to trade, if we had the USMCA done before President Trump has to sit down with Xi Jinping?</p><p>But you are making us weaker in this whole basis, they are making every president in the future, weaker, by having to show a transcript, of a conversation he had with another world leader. The Democrats are just focused on politics, instead of focused on this country.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, what about that? I mean, are we going to now want to see every conversation that the president has with another foreign leader?</p><p>MCCARTHY: We should not want to see -- because what foreign leader is going to be honest? You can't say anything.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Could you talk to your friend if you -- if everything you say is going to be in public transcript?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCCARTHY: You've wanted to be able to have that trust, and right now, the Democrats who put America into an untrustworthy place, because they want to discredit democracy. They want to remove somebody from office, simply from the fact that they did not like the outcome of the 2016 election.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, the president had a huge money raise, $125 million last quarter, how are you feeling going into 2020? Can the House reclaim the majority in 2020?</p><p>MCCARTHY: Yes, we can. I want all your viewers to know this, it takes 19 seats to put the Republicans in the majority, but there are 31 seats that Democrats currently sit in, that President Trump carried, 13 of those are ruby red. He carried by more than 6 points, and you got another 18, and then we're in the seats that he didn't even win, that we're able to play in today.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there. Congressman, we'll be watching.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good to see you. Congressman Kevin McCarthy there. Quick break. Still ahead this morning, we're going to speak with the founder of Anduril Industries, Palmer Luckey is here. Join us for that special interview. Plus, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" weighs in, Stuart Varney, coming up.</p><p>But first, Uber getting an upgrade, Citigroup lifting its rating on a stock to a buy, it's had a tough couple of months there, citing optimism on revenue growth, the stock is up three percent on the news. Then, the future of offshore wind farming, we're taking a closer look at the new threat for the commercial fishing industry. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We are watching shares of Uber this morning. Stock is up on an upgrade from Citigroup. Jackie DeAngelis on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with some details there. Jackie, good morning.</p><p>JACKIE DEANGELIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK FINANCIAL CORRESPONDENT: Good morning to you, Maria. You can see the stock is trading, as you said, up three percent in premarket. This is because Citigroup upgraded the stock to a buy on improving fundamentals. Now, the price target is the same, $45.00, just around its IPO price. And you can see it's still trading well under that, but Citi says the third quarter results could signal renewed revenue growth. Remember, of course, investors want to see top line growth but they want to see bottom line growth as well, profitability. This analyst is also saying that the value of Uber Eats may not properly be reflected in the stock price. And of course, it's been rocky for Uber, as I mentioned.</p><p>Meantime, I want to move on and talk about PayPal as well as Facebook and Libra because PayPal has said that it's actually pulling out of that digital currency project, and it's the first company to do this. Now, it didn't give an explicit reason why, but it did say that it was still supportive of PayPal -- of Libra's goals but that it would focus on its own business model, which is probably a sound thing to do. PayPal shares slightly higher Facebook slightly lower today. Facebook, of course, revealed Project Libra back in June, and it's been scrutinized because regulators are worried about how it will integrate within the larger system. Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Jackie, thank you. We will be watching that. Jackie DeAngelis on Wall Street this morning.</p><p>Coming up, I'll be speaking with the founder of Anduril Industries, Palmer Luckye, one startup disrupting the technology industry. Plus, his take on the Hong Kong crisis as the Houston Rockets' General Manager sparks a major uproar in China. Then this, the future of offshore wind farming. We're taking a look at the new threat for the commercial fishing industry all ahead. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. A federal tax credit set to expire; it could jeopardize the future of offshore wind farming. Fox News Correspondent Todd Piro is here, covering the story with details. Hi, Todd.</p><p>TODD PIRO, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, thanks so much for having me. This is great to be here. That tax credit you mentioned is set to expire at the end of the year, but this summer, the Interior Department announced to hold on offshore wind projects until, quote, accumulative analysis is conducted. The move delaying potential approval of the country's first large-scale offshore wind farm, the Vineyard Wind Project until December 2020. And without that tax credit, the entire future of Vineyard Wind is in doubt. One industry that's actually pleased with this development, fishing. Here's why.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>AARON WILLIAMS, FISHERMAN, CAPTAIN OF THE TRADITION: As a family business, it's a lot of pride. My grandfather was a fisherman, my dad. Hopefully, someday my son would want to do it. But if something doesn't change, I don't even want him coming onto the boat.</p><p>PIRO: The last time we spoke with Connecticut commercial fishing Captain, Aaron Williams, he was worried that government regulations would kill the business that's been in his family for four generations. Now, fishermen like him are facing a new threat, offshore wind farms</p><p>MEGHAN LAPP, FISHING LIAISON, SEA FREEZE LIMITED: If these offshore wind farms that are projected and the areas that they're being leased are actually built, it's over for the commercial fishing industry.</p><p>PIRO: The shift to wind energy is growing. The first wind farm was installed in the U.S. in 1980. And now, there are more than 200 wind farms providing about 6-1/2 percent of the nation's electricity. And more growth is expected, specifically in our nation's oceans. In 2016, the first commercial offshore wind farm began operations with five turbines off Block Island in Rhode Island.</p><p>And according to the American Wind Energy Association, 10 more farms could be up and running as soon as 2024.</p><p>WILLIAMS: All right, this is Block Island --</p><p>PIRO: Aaron drove us to get a better look.</p><p>You may look at this and say it's just five windmills, who cares? But this could be the start of thousands of these up and down the East Coast of the U.S., some of them much larger than what you see in front of you.</p><p>LAPP: The impacts from five is not going to be the same as the impacts from 500 or 5,000. However, there have been impacts.</p><p>PIRO: Where are they seeing the impact? On the fish?</p><p>LAPP: Fish have different habitats. They have certain migratory routes that they repeat year after year after year. So, when you put the wind farms on those places, those fish are definitely most certainly impacted.</p><p>PIRO: On the boats.</p><p>WILLIAMS: We're trying to navigate. Now, we'd have to be avoiding a base to a windmill,</p><p>PIRO: And most concerning the wind farms effect on radar. We watched it happen.</p><p>WILLIAMS: These right here are the five wind turbines. This is what the radar does when you do get close to the wind farm. It looks like there's about 20 here when there's actually only five right here, but it's the interference --</p><p>The costs of the windmills outweigh the benefits of it.</p><p>PIRO: But proponents of the wind farm, say the farms' environment and economical advantages need to be taken into consideration as well. Connecticut is one of 15 states with plans to add wind farms to their shores.</p><p>KATIE DYKES, COMMISSIONER, CONNECTICUT DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY &amp; ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION: Connecticut is excited to be investing in offshore wind. We are directing project developers to ensure that they have adequate funding for surveys and for monitorings. And we know that they're going to be driving investment in manufacturing and construction jobs.</p><p>PIRO: The fishing industry response?</p><p>WILLIAMS: It's easy to -- for a lot of folks to look out to the ocean and think it's an endless -- it's not endless, and we're going to get displaced not only on the fishing grounds, guys, certain boats will go out of business.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PIRO: And if you think it's just the fishermen that are worried about these windmills, think, again, the Coast Guard as well as a team of members from the Departments of Energy, Homeland Security, the FAA, and NOAA are actually looking into the radar interference these ships are experiencing. So, this could actually become a national security issue in addition to a fishing industry and an environmental issue.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow. It's interesting.</p><p>PIRO: You know, I thought to myself, why can't you just go around? What's the big deal? They really do explain why you can't just go around with a boat. There are a lot more factors to play, and I'm not somebody who's anti-windmill. I lived in an area -- Palm Springs, California -- where they had a lot of windmills. But there wasn't a national defense issue. There was no concern that Orange County was going to invade Riverside County at any point while I was out in California. National defense concerns here on the offshore wind farms are concerning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Very important story, Todd, thank you.</p><p>PIRO: No problem. Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We will see you soon, Todd Piro. Coming up, I'll be speaking with the founder of Anduril Industries, Palmer Luckey, one startup disrupting the technology industry. Then, his take on the Hong Kong crisis as the Houston Rockets General Manager sparks a major uproar in China, that's coming up. And then, the streaming wars heating up, Disney banning Netflix advertising from all its networks. We're breaking down the Battle of the media giants later this hour. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Monday morning everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Monday, October 7th. Your top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>There are concerns, this morning, about the U.S. and China trade talks, that, of course, is happening this Thursday. And there is a -- new look at it because China says it will narrow the topics that they are willing to discuss on Thursday -- to trade, and not looking at any industrial part of their economy. Meaning, the intellectual property theft.</p><p>Meanwhile, markets this morning are lower, off of the lows of the morning. Now, Dow Industrials down 49, S&amp;P down six, and the NASDAQ lower by 18. Global markets this morning look like this: European indices are mostly higher. There were more signs of a slowdown in Europe, German factory orders were down six-tenths of a percent in the month of August -- that was worse than expected. Orders from Inside Germany down 2.6 percent. In Asia overnight, markets finished -- fractionally moving markets in China and Hong Kong closed, for the holidays of Golden Week.</p><p>Our top story this half an hour: baseball backlash over the Hong Kong protesters. Houston Rockets general manager under pressure over a tweet supporting the protesters causing a major uproar in China where rockets are extremely popular. Chinese sponsors, businesses pulling support. The NBA responded to the criticism from China: \"The values of the league support individuals educating themselves and sharing their views on matters, important to them.</p><p>We have great respect for the history and culture of China and hope that sports and the NBA can be used as a unifying force to bridge cultural divide.\" According to NBA and its response to China's upset. From the general manager's tweet of the Houston Rockets. Joining me right now is the Founder of Anduril Industries, he's Palmer Luckey. And Palmer, it is great to see you this morning, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>PALMER LUCKEY, FOUNDER, ANDURIL INDUSTRIES: Good to chat with you again, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean, the last time we spoke, I came to Anduril Industries and you were showing me all of this great technology: the drone zone that your company produces. I wanted to get that, but the reason that we began on the Hong Kong protests and what took place with the Houston Rockets, is because you and I had this conversation before about American companies not seeing China as an adversary, but instead focusing all on the business opportunity in China. What's your reaction to this?</p><p>LUCKEY: Well, I mean, we have this big problem where the biggest technology companies in the United States see China as their biggest revenue growth opportunity, and a lot of smaller tech companies see China as a huge investment opportunity -- that China Chinese money is going to flow into their company. And so, they make decisions that are based on this and often they'll say that they're doing things for one reason and behind scenes they're actually being influenced by this desire to work with the Chinese over American interests -- and that's not a good for our country.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, and we talked about this -- the two of us recently earlier last year because your company, Anduril Industries got the project Maven Contract -- I know you worked for government on lots of different projects but Google walked away from that project. Google balked at the company working with the U.S. government, but now Google has an A.I. lab -- an A.I. lab, probably the jewel of all artificial intelligence is at Google and that lab is in Beijing, your reaction?</p><p>LUCKEY: I mean, I think I the big problem -- the big problem here is not just the U.S. companies are going to China; it's that the United States in many ways, is behind. You know, that's why I started my company because I wanted to build a defense company that was unapologetically hiring best people to work on national security problems. So, you know, obviously, I'm really concerned that there's other big tech companies that are, in many ways, working for the other side.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I want to ask you about that. You are the tech genius that sold Oculus back in the day to Facebook, then you created Anduril Industries and you just unveiled your drone smashing interceptor. The small UAV designed to take out drones like consumer quadcopters by colliding them into one another. Given the prominent role drones play in modern warfare, tell me about Anduril and the technology that you are making to take out larger UAVs.</p><p>LUCKEY: Sure. So, the system that you're talking to is called Anvil, it is a drone detection and countering system, so we're able to detect drones over military bases and other critical infrastructure; and we're able to send our own counter drone to go out and knock it out of the sky. And it's really important that the U.S. has this kind of technology -- we can't allow the skies over our military bases, our critical infrastructure to become Wild West.</p><p>And the same goes for a lot of the bases and critical infrastructure of our allies; we need to make sure that we can protect our airspace, from these threats because you're already seeing, attacks in Saudi Arabia, and Afghanistan other things that are not necessarily public yet, and this trend is only going to accelerate. So, until we have control of the skies, we're going to have to be a lot more afraid of drones than we should be.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, tell me about that, the administration says that it was Iran, behind the attack on the Saudi oil facilities but that was done by a drone.</p><p>LUCKEY: Right, I know, and I don't know who did it. That is not my area of expertise. My area of expertise is making sure that attacks like that don't happen; knocking those kinds drones out of the air before they attack your -- their target not afterwards. We can do all investigation we want, but in a perfect world, this attack never would have happened and we never would be talking about it and it wouldn't even be a thing worth discussing because it would have been stopped in its tracks by a system like ours.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Which is why it's so important to -- and it brings me back to China, because China is using artificial intelligence very effectively. We are using A.I., that's why I did one hour special that Anduril and yourself were featured prominently in my A.I. special. But the issue is, is if China can have A.I. that basically tells the Chinese, our troop movements, you know, our weaponry movement this really speaks to the national security that we face as a result of China and its and its goals to get become the largest superpower.</p><p>LUCKEY: Yes. Well, I mean we're not going to be able to beat China by just building faster aircraft, by building better hardware. You know, even if they have equivalent hardware to us, even if we have hardware that's slightly better, if they have better artificial intelligence, if they have a better ability to respond and coordinate effectively using artificial intelligence, we're going to be in a really bad place. So, what we really need to do is make sure that we match and then surpass China.</p><p>And the goal here is not that we get into a huge conflict and that we beat them necessarily, it's to be so strong that they know they can't get into a conflict with us. You know, in the same way that having a strong counter drone system deters people from even trying to attack U.S. drones; having a strong artificial intelligence strategy, counters the abilities of people, to use artificial intelligence, to even contemplate attacking us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you feel that the U.S. does have that, Palmer? What can you tell us about the defense industry today in terms of the wherewithal, the money allocated to our defense, the use of drones versus our adversaries like China?</p><p>LUCKEY: Well, right now U.S. defense companies, the main contractors do not have the technology, or the tools or the talent to build these types of systems. They don't have the best experts in computer vision, autonomy, artificial intelligence, machine-learning computer vision. Those are at these -- the best talent in the world is really at companies like Google, like Facebook, like Snapchat. And so, one of the things my company is trying to do is take people out of those places and putting them to work, on problems that are actually going to be of critical importance for our entire country.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, and you've done it by working with governments not just the U.S., but cross the world. Anduril Industries now valued at more than a billion dollars in a recent fund-raising round. Tell us where the growth comes from Anduril; what you are trying to do here with this company?</p><p>LUCKEY: I'm trying to build a major defense company, a defense products company, not a defense contractor. I want to save taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars, and I want to make tens of millions of dollars, and we do both of those things by building technologies that keep the men and women who keep our country safe and making sure that American interests are protected long into the future no matter what the technology does.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You know, one of the issues in this whole China fight is the fact that we have ethics in this country they don't. So, we have --</p><p>LUCKEY: Yes, we talk about this a lot.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly! You know, we have ethics where, you know, you don't want to make the last decision in terms of the kill decision left to machine, right? So, talk a little about the ethics in terms the U.S. versus China. As we look at Chinese theft, U.S. researchers on front lines of the battle against it, now the Chinese are saying with these upcoming meetings on Thursday, we're going to put, you know, intellectual property theft on side; we don't want that to be one of the topics on Thursday's meetings.</p><p>LUCKEY: Well, Maria, you got right to the heart of the issue, which is that this is not just a problem with the way that artificial intelligence is deployed; it's a problem with the way it's even developed. China's ethics are such that they're willing to steal our technology and our countries' technology and develop themselves. They're then willing to gather tons of training data for their artificial intelligence, by surveilling their entire population; monitoring everything that they do. And at the end, they're willing to deploy systems that countries like the United States would never want to deploy. The U.S. has a really good policy around making sure that a person is always responsible for what autonomous systems are doing.</p><p>And China can afford to play faster and loose, because if you criticize them, you're going to prison or you're going to be disappeared -- or you're going to end up in a camp and that is not a problem that we have here in the United States. Our kind of the strong system of ethics and accountability that we have in the U.S., it's very important for us as a country to maintain who we are, but it does put us at a somewhat strategic disadvantage against a country that can go whatever it wants, whenever it wants with no accountability.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, and I don't know that if corporate America understands that very well, frankly, right now. Because they are more interested getting that market access, getting their products into the market of 1.4 billion people. I mean, just look at facial recognition and how China uses that, right? I mean, right now in Hong Kong, China is trying to get those facial recognition cameras back up and running again. You know, they knocked one; they're all right there so that they can identify exactly who's at protests. They're saying no more masks, they're demanding that the protesters do not wear masks because they know there will be consequences for whoever is seen at those protests.</p><p>LUCKEY: Well, it's not just in Hong Kong, it's all around the world. China is distributing technology, to countries in Asia, to countries in Africa that will allow those countries to build totalitarian police states and their hope is that they make these countries dependent on China. You know, somewhat similar to the way that the Soviet Union deployed technology and weapons to their partners around the world, to try to bring them over to their world view.</p><p>But what China is doing is far more dangerous because it makes these countries, not just dependent on China but also dependent on the Chinese world view that you need to surveil citizens control your citizens, and then remove the elements that you don't really like, and that's something that we don't believe in in America, our allies don't believe it. And so, we need to make sure that we're able to stop this threat.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, Palmer, what's your take on all of this conversation around technology in terms of regulation? You know, there's the privacy aspect of it and then there's the anti-trust and power aspect of it. Because you're looking at these companies more powerful than they ever have been. I'm talking about Facebook, and Google, and others which right now are caught in the middle of the debate on a how much regulation technology companies should face, what is your take on this?</p><p>LUCKEY: I mean, I lean Libertarian. So, I'm generally not fan of having stronger regulations for over private sector companies, but I also think that the government has given a lot of special privileges to these technology companies and we need to re-examine whether it makes sense to give these companies special privileges that no other private sector companies have. Should we be giving them special government advantages, like immunity from certain liabilities that other companies have to deal with, and I think that the answer there a lot less clear.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, I think this is a really important point that you make, and this is the point that Devin Nunes has made. The congressman is suing Twitter, because he calls them a content creator. And in fact, they -- he was victorious in the most recent trial over the weekend, with Twitter, but they say: no, we should be shielded from lawsuits because we are just a platform; we're not a media company.</p><p>LUCKEY: Right, and I think if you exercise -- look, I'm OK with companies censoring all they want on platforms. But if you're going to censor ideas, if you're going to say that certain people and certain ideas are not allowed -- you know, I don't think that the government should necessarily be giving you special liability protection that were meant to preserve free speech and were meant to encourage open debate and discussion. You know, I'm not fan of regulation, I am a fan of the government not giving special advantages to one type of business over another when it isn't accomplishing any good.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, and by the way, the court decision on Friday Devin Nunes' team won on all fronts. The trial will move forward with Twitter. All right, let me switch gears and ask you about border a bit. I know you've done -- your drones have been used at the border and you see, really, the activity there. The president did a partnership with Mexico, did a partnership with Guatemala, have you seen the numbers come down in terms of the apprehensions at the border? What can you tell us about the border right now, Palmer?</p><p>LUCKEY: So, I can't talk about specifics like that. You'd have to ask Customs and Border Protection. But you know, they are one of our customers -- our technology is deployed on the northern and the southern border across hundreds of square miles. I think that what you see is that when you put technology into a place on the border, like typically pattern we see, apprehension goes way up with our technology as soon as you're able to see everything that's going on, and then they plummet to almost nothing as soon as the cartels figure out that they can't get through in that area.</p><p>And I think that what we need to do is take that approach and apply it to the entire border. So, they say, you know what, this -- it's not viable for us to just -- run thousands of pounds of drugs across these remote and unsecured areas. Obviously, they're still coming through other ways; they're going to try to come in to the ports, they're going to try to smuggle it in cargo containers, but at least that allows us to focus our resources on a few key ports of entry rather than thousands of miles of unsecured border. And so, that's one of the things that we've been doing with CBS -- is helping to be a part of that solution.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We were just showing video I took to show to the border it was really stunning what we actually witnessed. Palmer, you are a patriot. It is great to have you on the program. Congrats to you! Thank you so much.</p><p>LUCKEY: Thank you. I'll keep doing my best. See you next time.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We hope you'll come back soon, Palmer. Great to talk with you. Palmer Luckey, is the Founder of Anduril Industries. Coming up, the battle of the media giants. Disney dueling it out with Netflix; banning all Netflix ads from all of the Disney networks. The escalating streaming war is coming up. Plus, stock alert; shares of G.E. getting a boost this morning after announcing it will freeze pension plans for thousands of U.S. employees. The move expected to cut the company's debt, stock is up a quarter percent. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The media is focused on impeachment and whistleblowers, but what about 2020 in the state of Democratic candidates? Joining us now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" Stuart Varney to weigh in. Good morning, Stu.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: I don't know why I'm smiling because, you know, first thing you do when you wake up on a Monday morning, you look at the media, and you look at what they're saying about impeachment and whistleblowers and all that stuff, then you got to ignore it and look below that what's really going on in the 2020 campaign. But to me, the Democrat presidential hopefuls are in a mess, a right royal mess.</p><p>Joe Biden's got an op-ed in The Washington Post in which he says he is going to beat, \"President Trump like a drum.\" He makes no mention whatsoever of Hunter Biden and the problems that he's got with the conflict of interest.</p><p>Then you go on to -- let's see who else we got, Bernie Sanders, God bless him, we wish him well, but he's recovering from a heart attack, and I'm not sure how easily you can fit back into a rigorous campaign. It is true that Elizabeth Warren is gaining ground, she is getting a couple of key states, but we've got newspaper reports this morning that some key donors are balking. They don't want a socialist at the head of the Democrat ticket.</p><p>Kamala Harris, she only gets eight percent support among California Democrats, that's her home state. Eight percent support in her home state.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.</p><p>VARNEY: That's looking like a mess. I'll wrap it up for you, Maria, I don't think they can win and I don't think they're going anymore, and I think impeachment is sucking all the oxygen out of their campaign.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Lindsey Graham on Sunday said to me, it was the most consequential week of the president reelection campaign because of all of the reasons you just mentioned, Stu.</p><p>VARNEY: He's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. I know you'll have more about it in 10 minutes. We will see you then.</p><p>VARNEY: Sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" begins top of the hour right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA. Join Stuart in about 10 minutes' time.</p><p>But first, Disney duals with Netflix, we've got it next. It us banning Netflix ads from all of its networks. We'll break down the battle of the media giants right after this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Well, it is getting tough. The streaming wars are hitting fever pitch now. Disney is reportedly banning all Netflix ads across all of its networks.</p><p>Joining us right now is FOX News Headlines 24/7 morning anchor, Brett Larson. Brett, good to see you.</p><p>BRETT LARSON, FOX NEWS HEADLINES 24/7 ANCHOR: Yes. Good to see you, guys. It is -- this may be the first shot across the bow in the golden age if streaming wars and that's what I'm calling it.</p><p>Over the next of couple months, we're going to have dix to choose from, Disney+, Comcast Peacock, Apple+, HBO, and we already Netflix and Hulu. Netflix is, of course, the 800-pound gorilla. They have over a hundred million subscribers worldwide and they're seen as the largest target for all of these competing services.</p><p>What we've already seen since Disney+ announced that they're going be launching a streaming service, a lot of content is slowly being yanked off of Netflix, a lot of the content that Disney owns. Comcast did the same thing that, you know, everybody's very concerned. The Office is leaving Netflix because it's going to go the, I think Comcast is calling it Peacock, that's their streaming service.</p><p>So this is going to be interesting. And now Disney's saying, \"We're not going to run advertisements for Netflix. Odd because they are running advertising for other streaming services, but as Disney says, Netflix doesn't run any advertising, which his true. Sometimes, the advertising is written into the show so it feels like it's part of the content and it's not like a in-your-face advertisement.</p><p>So this is the first salvo in the -- in the streaming wars and pretty soon --</p><p>BARTIROMO: But these two are the ones to beat, right? I mean where's Amazon on this?</p><p>LARSON: Amazon's also in the picture so I guess that would be seven because Amazon has their prime video, which just won a bunch of awards. It was kind of interesting Emmys that all these streaming platforms and cable networks are winning the awards and not the broadcast networks.</p><p>Plus, you've got -- you've got CBS All Access, you've got FoxFast. I mean there's all kinds of --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>LARSON: There's all these people waiting to take your money every month to provide you with content and it used to be great because Netflix had everything, you pay one fee, that was easy, Brett, you know. Now it's like too easy.</p><p>MARTIN: It's too overwhelming, isn't it?</p><p>BARTIROMO: A lot. A lot of passwords.</p><p>MARTIN: I mean, yes, a lot -- a lot of passwords, a lot of -- a lot of payments and --</p><p>BARTIROMO: A lot of passwords. I hate that.</p><p>MARTIN: Yes.</p><p>LARSON: And how are consumers going to respond with eight or nine options on the table?</p><p>MARTIN: I don't know, man.</p><p>LARSON: Are we going to -- are we going to subscribe to all of them, are you going to subscribe to half and then your sisters are going to subscribe to half and you're going to share passwords, which you shouldn't do?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>LARSON: I mean like that's --</p><p>MARTIN: Oh, wait. Nice idea, wait. Yes, I'll do that at home.</p><p>LARSON: Like that -- what's going to happen here in the -- everybody's going to be fighting for our eyeballs.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. That's true. All right. We will leave it there. Brett, good to see you.</p><p>LARSON: Thank for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you. Brett Larson. Catch Brett every morning on FOX News Headlines 24/7, SiriusXM radio Channel 115. Still ahead, final thoughts from this all-star panel. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Final thoughts right now. Jack Brewer.</p><p>JACK BREWER, CEO, THE BREWER GROUP: I just got back from CHESTER, P.A. We had four killings in the last three weeks. These kids I got to go to school each day, being in the neighborhoods where folks are getting shot. We cover all of these mass shooting for some time we forget about our inner cities that are being ripped up with all this gun violence. And so all I say is just let's focus on Americans, Americans first.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>Jack, you're a real-life super hero, man. Thanks for all you do. Appreciate it. Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Take it away, Maria.</p><p>MARTIN: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, all right. Thank you. (INAUDIBLE) at a time.</p><p>MARTIN: (INAUDIBLE) on Jack. There we go.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's what happens when you have a phenomenal panel.</p><p>BREWER: That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Have a great day, everybody. \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" begins right now. Stu, take it away.</p><p>VARNEY: All right. Good morning, Maria.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2019100703cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X71-0YS1-DXH2-6366-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8037\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 7, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS532282 VIDEO TAPE &amp;

KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA) IS INTERVIEWED ON FOX BUSINESS</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SEPTEMBER 19, 2019</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SPEAKERS:      REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN ANCHOR</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[*]      MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN ANCHOR:  Joining me right now is California congressman, the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Leader McCarthy, it's always a pleasure.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA):  Well, thank you. Thanks for coming to Washington. We appreciate it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BARTIROMO:  Yes, thank you so much. I'm happy to see you again.</p><p>USMCA, what are the chances that she brings to it the floor, Nancy Pelosi?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  I would say today it's 60/40 because it's all up to here. If it came to the floor, it would pass. But what -- what I believe when I say her is Speaker Nancy Pelosi. She has all the power to bring the bill up.</p><p>But what we're talking about is negotiations with China. Just a month ago China is no longer a top trader. Mexico's our number one. Canada is number two. If the USMCA would pass, and Mexico passed it months ago, we're about almost a year since all the three leaders signed the agreement, Canada is waiting us on. If we pass that prior to getting into the negotiations with China, we're only stronger.</p><p>Think about it, our top two traders getting agreement with them, it makes us stronger in negotiations with China. So thinking of the speaker, Nancy Pelosi, she should bring this up to make America stronger.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I just want to point out that we have called Speaker Pelosi, as well as several other Democratic lawmakers to join us to talk about USMCA, and that includes Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, Congressman Clyburn, Hoyer, Durbin, Sanders, Cummings, Baldwin, as well as Tom Perez, the head of the Democratic Party. None of them would agree to join us this morning. We wanted to do an entire show focused just on USMCA to get their side of the story in terms of why it's not being brought to the floor. They declined.</p><p>They want changes. Debbie Dingell was sitting in that seat just a few minutes ago and she said, look, there's not an enforcement that I'm believing in that actually will ensure that U.S. workers are going to make more than $1.50 an hour. She wants to make sure that's in there.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Look, the president makes the protection for America works inside this agreement. You have NAFTA today. What the president saw with NAFTA was jobs were leaving America. Jobs will actually come back to America. This is modernizing NAFTA and giving better protections to American workers.</p><p>The one thing I would tell you, I've been in meetings where -- where the Prime Minister of Canada is sitting there, Trudeau. They raise these same issues. Trudeau will tell you, I raised it too. We got the agreement inside -- inside USMCA.</p><p>So I don't know why we're holding. We should have done this prior to the departure in summer. The real critical time is now because if we're having negotiations with China, if China is going to have their 70th anniversary, then see the president in November, this is the moment in time we should be stronger in those negotiations.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Secretary Purdue said, look, if we can't get this done, it's anybody's guess if we can get anything else done in terms of other trade deals.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  I don't think if this -- if this does not get done by the -- by Thanksgiving, it won't get done. And then the decision will have been made, by the speaker, that it was a political decision, not about the country. It would -- concern about tearing the president down instead of building America up. Because everyone will tell you, at the minimum, 180,000 more jobs. Our GDP goes up. We're stronger. We're stronger in the negotiations.</p><p>So I don't understand who out there is saying no to this. I don't hear speaker saying she's against it. She says she can't to get to a yes. The timing of waiting only makes it harder.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  When you say we want to get to a \"yes,\" I mean, look, we all remember the picture of the president there with the head of Mexico, the head of China (ph), signing on the dotted line.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Almost a year ago.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They already agreed to it. So when -- when you saying we're going to get to this, do -- are you saying that there's a chance that this can be opened up and then they have to agree to it again? I mean they already agreed to what's on paper.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So how are we getting to this?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  And Mexico has already passed it. Canada is waiting. They'll call their session back in to pass it. They're only waiting on America.</p><p>So it's almost like the entire world is waiting for the speaker. The Senate, the House, Mexico, Canada, China. China is probably going to want to negotiating before we get this done.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think this is going to add to economic growth should it pass --</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Here's what I think --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because I've got to tell you, global growth is hitting a dictated low amid the U.S.-China trade war according to the OECD. The global economy set to grow at the slowest pace since the financial crises with business investment and trade hampered by this escalating trade feud with China.</p><p>That doesn't sound like a booming economy.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  It is a booming economy. There's more -- there are more jobs being offered today than people actually looking for jobs. You want a little boost in the economy, pass USMCA because the uncertainty of sitting back, the investment of going, and every economic -- economist will tell you, you'll get more jobs and the -- America will be stronger.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I want to ask you about our cities, because I know this is important to you as well. I mean you've got New York, where Rikers Island is about to close. There's going to be an enormous number of inmates being let out. Crime is increasing in New York. In San Francisco, there's actually a digital poop map. In L.A. there is homelessness.</p><p>And you -- you -- you mentioned to me the other day about medieval diseases coming back in Los Angeles. What --</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Typhus. Typhus, that you have not seen in years, it moves by infected fleas and rats. Now the rats have come back so far in Los Angeles, you know what happened, city workers have contracted typhus. It's horrendous. And this is --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why? Why?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Democratic policy. Prop 47. Prop 57. They decriminalized heroin, cocaine and others. They released people from prison with no training or going on where else (ph), so they've gone on to our streets. Then you have the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals saying you can't remove somebody and give them help unless you have a bed for them. Then they go through and say, you can't even remove them, you've got to give them a three-day notice just because they set up a tent somewhere.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ah. Oh, my gosh.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  This is the Democratic policies coming to roost in California. And what's even worse in California, they made it so unaffordable. They made it so expensive to live that it's causing it was well. These are drugs, mental illness, and they're not getting the help they need.</p><p>And, you know what the governor of California is saying? I'll give free health care to anyone who's illegal wanting to come to America.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow. I got to move on to a few other things because I want to get your take on the Mideast tensions. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo calling the Saudi oil attack an act of war as signs point to Iran being responsible. The president announced that the U.S. will increase sanctions on Iran, says that he has many options.</p><p>What are these options, Congressman?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Well, the president, at any given time like this, he will -- he will look at economic options, military options, he can move military assets into the region, which he has done already, which I think was one of the smartest moves he's done because it's actually caused, when you look at what Iran was trying to do earlier and the threats they were making, put us in a position to stop any of that.</p><p>But, Iran, this isn't a first action. They are the bad actors. This is why you never want them to have a nuclear weapon. This is why President Trump is correct saying you've got to get out of that agreement. And this is why the rest of the world should join with us and put the pressure on Iran to come back to the table.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you feel like we do have allies in the rest of the world against that -- Iran?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Yes, but I feel our European allies are being weak in this -- in this part --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They're still doing business with Iran.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Yes. I would not do business with Iran anymore. They fund the terrorists around the world based upon the money we provided them in that last agreement, which was a mistake by all means. We never got to vote on it. It was not a treaty. And this -- and that -- that agreement allows them to have a nuclear weapon at the end of the agreement in 10 years.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, a couple more issues to got to get to.</p><p>I want to ask you about technology. Mark Zuckerberg in town. But also investigate the investigators. Inspector general, Michael Horowitz, telling a congressional panel yesterday he is willing to look into, quote, irregularities from former FBI Director Jim Comey. He also said that he did refer Comey for criminal prosecution but the DOJ turned it down.</p><p>Are we going to see accountability for what now most people understand took place in 2016, that they tried to frame then candidate Donald Trump and then President Donald Trump?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  What is see coming out of the attorney general, yes, he's being very fair, walking it through. What I'm not seeing in the Judiciary Committee by Chairman Nadler is, no. In a normal Congress, after an inspector general gives a report about the DOJ, you would call them in as members of Congress and both sides of the aisle go through that investigation, ask them what they found, but Nadler will not bring that forward.</p><p>Nadler's not talking about that. He's not working anything on the border. He's not working on tech. All he's doing is having this imaginary impeachment, which the own speaker he's fighting with.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you going to see legislation about border? I mean I know Mexico and Guatemala has helped the U.S. and the numbers are down. But is Congress going to do anything about the loopholes that remain around immigration and the border?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  We have bills introduced. But, again, it comes through the committee of Chairman Nadler. And the only thing he said he wanted to mainly do to become chairman is impeachment. And that's all he's focused on. He's not doing the work that the American public asked him to do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, you're making a lot of comments about the Democrats. Are you going to be able to get the House majority back in 2020?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Oh, yes. We just won two races in North Carolina simply by that increase of where we were. We won the -- we won North Caroline Nine in 2018 by 900 votes. We just won it by 4,100. Just that 2 percent --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about all these retirements, Congressman?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  I'm not worried about the retirements, because the only retirement I worry about is Will Hurd. That's the only person that's sitting in a seat that Hillary carried. There's only two more. These other retirements are Republican seats. You know what it is? It's about as revolution. There's new faces.</p><p>You look at Westley Hunt in Houston, graduate of West Point, flew Apaches for ten years and running. This is an ability to change the face of the Republican Party to look like the rest of America and have the leadership of those who want to join with this president who wants to put America first.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you're going to be calling out all these policies, like you -- like you just did in terms of the cities in our country I guess.</p><p>Let me ask you about big tech on The Hill.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  FaceBook founder CEO Mark Zuckerberg in Washington this week to pitch his vision of moderate Internet regulation. He had a dinner meeting last night with a group of lawmakers to help boost the company's image. Your reaction and what should be done with big tech?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Well, we've got to make sure with big tech that we have protection. Our own privacy. I believe in private property. Why don't we add private property to our privacy. We should know whatever big tech is gaining from us, from our own knowledge, but we should actually -- if they monetize it, we should be actually paid for it. We should be able to move it. We should be able to delete it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Or at least know where this is going. I mean if you're using my profile to get advertising, I want to know about it.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Are they reading my e-mails. Are they using -- you should know it. You should be able to delete it. And you should be able to move it.</p><p>But, you know what committee this comes through, Judiciary Committee. Is Nadler doing anything about it? No. He's only focusing on imaginary impeachment.</p><p>Immigration, tech, our privacy, inspector general with the problems happening at DOJ, none of that is happening in Judiciary Committee. All Nadler is doing -- that's why Nadler -- I've even had Democrats come to me and tell me, they wonder if he should stay chairman. I don't know if he could stay chairman based upon the actions of what he's doing today.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, are you calling for him to step down as chairman of Judiciary?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  If he continues to not act on these issues, why is he in that position? The Democrats did their own poll and asked the American public about impeachment. Only 10 percent said you should worry about it. You know what this poll also said, they could not name one thing that this new Democrat majority has accomplished legislatively, but 54 percent of them could tell you they're only they're doing is investigation. Something the public doesn't -- isn't interested in.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Some people think he's worried about his challenger.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  It's about his primary.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, his primary challenger.</p><p>Congressman, a lot -- a lot discussed today. We sure appreciate your time.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much, Congressman Kevin McCarthy.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTNW-2292890713</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTNW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X39-NYS1-DY0W-402J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">319798</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2345\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 CQ Roll Call Sep 19, 2019</copyright><publicationName>Political Transcript Wire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 19, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>China</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Mexico</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>United States--US</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Canada</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>McCarthy, Kevin</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Pelosi, Nancy</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Private property</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>North American Free Trade Agreement</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Presidents</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Impeachment</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Privacy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Leadership</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Political advertising</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST0008ZF6</classCode><className>INTERVIEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DH0Q</classCode><className>AGREEMENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009TD5</classCode><className>US REPUBLICAN PARTY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000988Z</classCode><className>FREE TRADE TREATIES &amp;

KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA)</nameText></person></p></bodyText></section><section sectionType=\"body\"><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN ANCHOR</emphasis>:  Joining me right now is California congressman, the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy.  </p><p>      Leader McCarthy, it's always a pleasure.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA)</emphasis>:  Well, thank you. Thanks for coming to Washington. We appreciate it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Yes, thank you so much. I'm happy to see you again.  </p><p>      USMCA, what are the chances that she brings to it the floor, Nancy Pelosi?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCARTHY</emphasis>:  I would say today it's 60/40 because it's all up to here. If it came to the floor, it would pass. But what -- what I believe when I say her is Speaker Nancy Pelosi. She has all the power to bring the bill up.  </p><p>      But what we're talking about is negotiations with China. Just a month ago China is no longer a top trader. Mexico's our number one. Canada is number two. If the USMCA would pass, and Mexico passed it months ago, we're about almost a year since all the three leaders signed the agreement, Canada is waiting us on. If we pass that prior to getting into the negotiations with China, we're only stronger.  </p><p>      Think about it, our top two traders getting agreement with them, it makes us stronger in negotiations with China. So thinking of the speaker, Nancy Pelosi, she should bring this up to make America stronger.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  I just want to point out that we have called Speaker Pelosi, as well as several other Democratic lawmakers to join us to talk about USMCA, and that includes Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, Congressman Clyburn, Hoyer, Durbin, Sanders, Cummings, Baldwin, as well as Tom Perez, the head of the Democratic Party. None of them would agree to join us this morning. We wanted to do an entire show focused just on USMCA to get their side of the story in terms of why it's not being brought to the floor. They declined.  </p><p>      They want changes. Debbie Dingell was sitting in that seat just a few minutes ago and she said, look, there's not an enforcement that I'm believing in that actually will ensure that U.S. workers are going to make more than $1.50 an hour. She wants to make sure that's in there.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCARTHY</emphasis>:  Look, the president makes the protection for America works inside this agreement. You have NAFTA today. What the president saw with NAFTA was jobs were leaving America. Jobs will actually come back to America. This is modernizing NAFTA and giving better protections to American workers.  </p><p>      The one thing I would tell you, I've been in meetings where -- where the Prime Minister of Canada is sitting there, Trudeau. They raise these same issues. Trudeau will tell you, I raised it too. We got the agreement inside -- inside USMCA.  </p><p>      So I don't know why we're holding. We should have done this prior to the departure in summer. The real critical time is now because if we're having negotiations with China, if China is going to have their 70th anniversary, then see the president in November, this is the moment in time we should be stronger in those negotiations.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Secretary Purdue said, look, if we can't get this done, it's anybody's guess if we can get anything else done in terms of other trade deals.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCARTHY</emphasis>:  I don't think if this -- if this does not get done by the -- by Thanksgiving, it won't get done. And then the decision will have been made, by the speaker, that it was a political decision, not about the country. It would -- concern about tearing the president down instead of building America up. Because everyone will tell you, at the minimum, 180,000 more jobs. Our GDP goes up. We're stronger. We're stronger in the negotiations.  </p><p>      So I don't understand who out there is saying no to this. I don't hear speaker saying she's against it. She says she can't to get to a yes. The timing of waiting only makes it harder.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  When you say we want to get to a \"yes,\" I mean, look, we all remember the picture of the president there with the head of Mexico, the head of China (ph), signing on the dotted line.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCARTHY</emphasis>:  Almost a year ago.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  They already agreed to it. So when -- when you saying we're going to get to this, do -- are you saying that there's a chance that this can be opened up and then they have to agree to it again? I mean they already agreed to what's on paper.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCARTHY</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  So how are we getting to this?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCARTHY</emphasis>:  And Mexico has already passed it. Canada is waiting. They'll call their session back in to pass it. They're only waiting on America.  </p><p>      So it's almost like the entire world is waiting for the speaker. The Senate, the House, Mexico, Canada, China. China is probably going to want to negotiating before we get this done.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Do you think this is going to add to economic growth should it pass --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCARTHY</emphasis>:  Here's what I think --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Because I've got to tell you, global growth is hitting a dictated low amid the U.S.-China trade war according to the OECD. The global economy set to grow at the slowest pace since the financial crises with business investment and trade hampered by this escalating trade feud with China.  </p><p>      That doesn't sound like a booming economy.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCARTHY</emphasis>:  It is a booming economy. There's more -- there are more jobs being offered today than people actually looking for jobs. You want a little boost in the economy, pass USMCA because the uncertainty of sitting back, the investment of going, and every economic -- economist will tell you, you'll get more jobs and the -- America will be stronger.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  I want to ask you about our cities, because I know this is important to you as well. I mean you've got New York, where Rikers Island is about to close. There's going to be an enormous number of inmates being let out. Crime is increasing in New York. In San Francisco, there's actually a digital poop map. In L.A. there is homelessness.  </p><p>      And you -- you -- you mentioned to me the other day about medieval diseases coming back in Los Angeles. What --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCARTHY</emphasis>:  Typhus. Typhus, that you have not seen in years, it moves by infected fleas and rats. Now the rats have come back so far in Los Angeles, you know what happened, city workers have contracted typhus. It's horrendous. And this is --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Why? Why?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCARTHY</emphasis>:  Democratic policy. Prop 47. Prop 57. They decriminalized heroin, cocaine and others. They released people from prison with no training or going on where else (ph), so they've gone on to our streets. Then you have the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals saying you can't remove somebody and give them help unless you have a bed for them. Then they go through and say, you can't even remove them, you've got to give them a three-day notice just because they set up a tent somewhere.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Ah. Oh, my gosh.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCARTHY</emphasis>:  This is the Democratic policies coming to roost in California. And what's even worse in California, they made it so unaffordable. They made it so expensive to live that it's causing it was well. These are drugs, mental illness, and they're not getting the help they need.  </p><p>      And, you know what the governor of California is saying? I'll give free health care to anyone who's illegal wanting to come to America.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Wow. I got to move on to a few other things because I want to get your take on the Mideast tensions. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo calling the Saudi oil attack an act of war as signs point to Iran being responsible. The president announced that the U.S. will increase sanctions on Iran, says that he has many options.  </p><p>      What are these options, Congressman?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCARTHY</emphasis>:  Well, the president, at any given time like this, he will -- he will look at economic options, military options, he can move military assets into the region, which he has done already, which I think was one of the smartest moves he's done because it's actually caused, when you look at what Iran was trying to do earlier and the threats they were making, put us in a position to stop any of that.  </p><p>      But, Iran, this isn't a first action. They are the bad actors. This is why you never want them to have a nuclear weapon. This is why President Trump is correct saying you've got to get out of that agreement. And this is why the rest of the world should join with us and put the pressure on Iran to come back to the table.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Do you feel like we do have allies in the rest of the world against that -- Iran?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCARTHY</emphasis>:  Yes, but I feel our European allies are being weak in this -- in this part --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  They're still doing business with Iran.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCARTHY</emphasis>:  Yes. I would not do business with Iran anymore. They fund the terrorists around the world based upon the money we provided them in that last agreement, which was a mistake by all means. We never got to vote on it. It was not a treaty. And this -- and that -- that agreement allows them to have a nuclear weapon at the end of the agreement in 10 years.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  All right, a couple more issues to got to get to.  </p><p>      I want to ask you about technology. Mark Zuckerberg in town. But also investigate the investigators. Inspector general, Michael Horowitz, telling a congressional panel yesterday he is willing to look into, quote, irregularities from former FBI Director Jim Comey. He also said that he did refer Comey for criminal prosecution but the DOJ turned it down.  </p><p>      Are we going to see accountability for what now most people understand took place in 2016, that they tried to frame then candidate Donald Trump and then President Donald Trump?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCARTHY</emphasis>:  What is see coming out of the attorney general, yes, he's being very fair, walking it through. What I'm not seeing in the Judiciary Committee by Chairman Nadler is, no. In a normal Congress, after an inspector general gives a report about the DOJ, you would call them in as members of Congress and both sides of the aisle go through that investigation, ask them what they found, but Nadler will not bring that forward.  </p><p>      Nadler's not talking about that. He's not working anything on the border. He's not working on tech. All he's doing is having this imaginary impeachment, which the own speaker he's fighting with.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Are you going to see legislation about border? I mean I know Mexico and Guatemala has helped the U.S. and the numbers are down. But is Congress going to do anything about the loopholes that remain around immigration and the border?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCARTHY</emphasis>:  We have bills introduced. But, again, it comes through the committee of Chairman Nadler. And the only thing he said he wanted to mainly do to become chairman is impeachment. And that's all he's focused on. He's not doing the work that the American public asked him to do.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Oh, you're making a lot of comments about the Democrats. Are you going to be able to get the House majority back in 2020?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCARTHY</emphasis>:  Oh, yes. We just won two races in North Carolina simply by that increase of where we were. We won the -- we won North Caroline Nine in 2018 by 900 votes. We just won it by 4,100. Just that 2 percent --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  What about all these retirements, Congressman?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCARTHY</emphasis>:  I'm not worried about the retirements, because the only retirement I worry about is Will Hurd. That's the only person that's sitting in a seat that Hillary carried. There's only two more. These other retirements are Republican seats. You know what it is? It's about as revolution. There's new faces.  </p><p>      You look at Westley Hunt in Houston, graduate of West Point, flew Apaches for ten years and running. This is an ability to change the face of the Republican Party to look like the rest of America and have the leadership of those who want to join with this president who wants to put America first.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  And you're going to be calling out all these policies, like you -- like you just did in terms of the cities in our country I guess.  </p><p>      Let me ask you about big tech on The Hill.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCARTHY</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  FaceBook founder CEO Mark Zuckerberg in Washington this week to pitch his vision of moderate Internet regulation. He had a dinner meeting last night with a group of lawmakers to help boost the company's image. Your reaction and what should be done with big tech?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCARTHY</emphasis>:  Well, we've got to make sure with big tech that we have protection. Our own privacy. I believe in private property. Why don't we add private property to our privacy. We should know whatever big tech is gaining from us, from our own knowledge, but we should actually -- if they monetize it, we should be actually paid for it. We should be able to move it. We should be able to delete it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Or at least know where this is going. I mean if you're using my profile to get advertising, I want to know about it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCARTHY</emphasis>:  Are they reading my e-mails. Are they using -- you should know it. You should be able to delete it. And you should be able to move it.  </p><p>      But, you know what committee this comes through, Judiciary Committee. Is Nadler doing anything about it? No. He's only focusing on imaginary impeachment.  </p><p>      Immigration, tech, our privacy, inspector general with the problems happening at DOJ, none of that is happening in Judiciary Committee. All Nadler is doing -- that's why Nadler -- I've even had Democrats come to me and tell me, they wonder if he should stay chairman. I don't know if he could stay chairman based upon the actions of what he's doing today.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Well, are you calling for him to step down as chairman of Judiciary?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCARTHY</emphasis>:  If he continues to not act on these issues, why is he in that position? The Democrats did their own poll and asked the American public about impeachment. Only 10 percent said you should worry about it. You know what this poll also said, they could not name one thing that this new Democrat majority has accomplished legislatively, but 54 percent of them could tell you they're only they're doing is investigation. Something the public doesn't -- isn't interested in.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Some people think he's worried about his challenger.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCARTHY</emphasis>:  It's about his primary.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Yes, his primary challenger.  </p><p>      Congressman, a lot -- a lot discussed today. We sure appreciate your time.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCARTHY</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Thank you so much, Congressman Kevin McCarthy.  </p><p>      END   </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X38-CJD1-JDPT-T035-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

I'm Maria Bartiromo and I'm coming to you this morning live from Washington, D.C. It is Thursday, September 19th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now just before 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Back to the negotiating table on China trade. Deputy level talks are getting underway later today here in Washington. This coming as the USMCA bill hangs in the balance. More from my \"First on Fox\" interview with Vice President Mike Pence coming up.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Federal Reserve cut interest rates yesterday by a quarter point. That was not enough for President Trump. He slammed Fed Chair Jay Powell, saying that he has no guts.</p><p>Markets this morning are under pressure. Futures indicating a decline at the start of trading. We are well off of the lows of the morning. The Dow Industrials right now down 43 points, the S&amp;P is down four, and the Nasdaq lower by 19. This after markets finished the day little changed yesterday, although by the close the DowIndustrials were up 36 points. The S&amp;P was up one and the Nasdaq was lower by 8 points.</p><p>Global markets this morning look like this. European indices higher across the board. Take a look. The FT 100's up 45. The CAC quarante in Paris is up 28. And the DAX index in Germany is up 34.</p><p>Last hour, the Bank of England announced it is leaving its interest rate unchanged at three quarters of one point.</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets finished mixed. Take a look. The Bank of Japan also announcing it's holding interest rates steady. It did, however, express concern over the global economy. And, of course, today's report is that the OECD countries are saying global growth is going to hit a decade low amid the U.S.-China trade war.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Thursday morning.</p><p>But, first, our top story this half an hour. This hour, rather, President Trump is pushing lawmakers to bring the USMCA trade deal to the House floor. Democrats delaying the vote. I spoke about it with the vice president, Mike Pence, during my \"First on Fox\" interview yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: When we have Democrats on, they talk about the risk of American workers being compared to Mexican workers who might be making $1.50 an hour.</p><p>What is the guarantee that American workers are going to be making $16 an hour and won't be competing with a lower wage in Mexico?</p><p>MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I watched President Trump drive a hard bargain. And all along the way, whether it was American businesses, manufacturing, automotive, whether it was American agricultural, especially dairy, this president demand that this trade deal really put American workers in the city and on the farm first. And the negotiations that we've been conducting with Democrats, in good faith on Capitol Hill, has been about the implementing legislation that will allow for accountability and enforcement of this trade agreement.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All of this as U.S.-China trade talks are picking up today in Washington.</p><p>Joining me right now is California congressman, the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy.</p><p>Leader McCarthy, it's always a pleasure.</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): Well, thank you. Thanks for coming to Washington. We appreciate it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, thank you so much. I'm happy to see you again.</p><p>USMCA, what are the chances that she brings to it the floor, Nancy Pelosi?</p><p>MCCARTHY: I would say today it's 60/40 because it's all up to here. If it came to the floor, it would pass. But what -- what I believe when I say her is Speaker Nancy Pelosi. She has all the power to bring the bill up.</p><p>But what we're talking about is negotiations with China. Just a month ago China is no longer a top trader. Mexico's our number one. Canada is number two. If the USMCA would pass, and Mexico passed it months ago, we're about almost a year since all the three leaders signed the agreement, Canada is waiting us on. If we pass that prior to getting into the negotiations with China, we're only stronger.</p><p>Think about it, our top two traders getting agreement with them, it makes us stronger in negotiations with China. So thinking of the speaker, Nancy Pelosi, she should bring this up to make America stronger.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I just want to point out that we have called Speaker Pelosi, as well as several other Democratic lawmakers to join us to talk about USMCA, and that includes Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, Congressman Clyburn, Hoyer, Durbin, Sanders, Cummings, Baldwin, as well as Tom Perez, the head of the Democratic Party. None of them would agree to join us this morning. We wanted to do an entire show focused just on USMCA to get their side of the story in terms of why it's not being brought to the floor. They declined.</p><p>They want changes. Debbie Dingell was sitting in that seat just a few minutes ago and she said, look, there's not an enforcement that I'm believing in that actually will ensure that U.S. workers are going to make more than $1.50 an hour. She wants to make sure that's in there.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Look, the president makes the protection for America works inside this agreement. You have NAFTA today. What the president saw with NAFTA was jobs were leaving America. Jobs will actually come back to America. This is modernizing NAFTA and giving better protections to American workers.</p><p>The one thing I would tell you, I've been in meetings where -- where the Prime Minister of Canada is sitting there, Trudeau. They raise these same issues. Trudeau will tell you, I raised it too. We got the agreement inside -- inside USMCA.</p><p>So I don't know why we're holding. We should have done this prior to the departure in summer. The real critical time is now because if we're having negotiations with China, if China is going to have their 70th anniversary, then see the president in November, this is the moment in time we should be stronger in those negotiations.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Secretary Purdue said, look, if we can't get this done, it's anybody's guess if we can get anything else done in terms of other trade deals.</p><p>MCCARTHY: I don't think if this -- if this does not get done by the -- by Thanksgiving, it won't get done. And then the decision will have been made, by the speaker, that it was a political decision, not about the country. It would -- concern about tearing the president down instead of building America up. Because everyone will tell you, at the minimum, 180,000 more jobs. Our GDP goes up. We're stronger. We're stronger in the negotiations.</p><p>So I don't understand who out there is saying no to this. I don't hear speaker saying she's against it. She says she can't to get to a yes. The timing of waiting only makes it harder.</p><p>BARTIROMO: When you say we want to get to a \"yes,\" I mean, look, we all remember the picture of the president there with the head of Mexico, the head of China (ph), signing on the dotted line.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Almost a year ago.</p><p>BARTIROMO: They already agreed to it. So when -- when you saying we're going to get to this, do -- are you saying that there's a chance that this can be opened up and then they have to agree to it again? I mean they already agreed to what's on paper.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So how are we getting to this?</p><p>MCCARTHY: And Mexico has already passed it. Canada is waiting. They'll call their session back in to pass it. They're only waiting on America.</p><p>So it's almost like the entire world is waiting for the speaker. The Senate, the House, Mexico, Canada, China. China is probably going to want to negotiating before we get this done.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you think this is going to add to economic growth should it pass --</p><p>MCCARTHY: Here's what I think --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Because I've got to tell you, global growth is hitting a dictated low amid the U.S.-China trade war according to the OECD. The global economy set to grow at the slowest pace since the financial crises with business investment and trade hampered by this escalating trade feud with China.</p><p>That doesn't sound like a booming economy.</p><p>MCCARTHY: It is a booming economy. There's more -- there are more jobs being offered today than people actually looking for jobs. You want a little boost in the economy, pass USMCA because the uncertainty of sitting back, the investment of going, and every economic -- economist will tell you, you'll get more jobs and the -- America will be stronger.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I want to ask you about our cities, because I know this is important to you as well. I mean you've got New York, where Rikers Island is about to close. There's going to be an enormous number of inmates being let out. Crime is increasing in New York. In San Francisco, there's actually a digital poop map. In L.A. there is homelessness.</p><p>And you -- you -- you mentioned to me the other day about medieval diseases coming back in Los Angeles. What --</p><p>MCCARTHY: Typhus. Typhus, that you have not seen in years, it moves by infected fleas and rats. Now the rats have come back so far in Los Angeles, you know what happened, city workers have contacted typhus. It's horrendous. And this is --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Why? Why?</p><p>MCCARTHY: Democratic policy. Prop 47. Prop 57. They decriminalized heroin, cocaine and others. They released people from prison with no training or going on where else (ph), so they've gone on to our streets. Then you have the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals saying you can't remove somebody and give them help unless you have a bed for them. Then they go through and say, you can't even remove them, you've got to give them a three-day notice just because they set up a tent somewhere.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ah. Oh, my gosh.</p><p>MCCARTHY: This is the Democratic policies coming to roost in California. And what's even worse in California, they made it so unaffordable. They made it so expensive to live that it's causing it was well. These are drugs, mental illness, and they're not getting the help they need.</p><p>And, you know what the governor of California is saying? I'll give free health care to anyone who's illegal wanting to come to America.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow. I got to move on to a few other things because I want to get your take on the Mideast tensions. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo calling the Saudi oil attack an act of war as signs point to Iran being responsible. The president announced that the U.S. will increase sanctions on Iran, says that he has many options.</p><p>What are these options, Congressman?</p><p>MCCARTHY: Well, the president, at any given time like this, he will -- he will look at economic options, military options, he can move military assets into the region, which he has done already, which I think was one of the smartest moves he's done because it's actually caused, when you look at what Iran was trying to do earlier and the threats they were making, put us in a position to stop any of that.</p><p>But, Iran, this isn't a first action. They are the bad actors. This is why you never want them to have a nuclear weapon. This is why President Trump is correct saying you've got to get out of that agreement. And this is why the rest of the world should join with us and put the pressure on Iran to come back to the table.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you feel like we do have allies in the rest of the world against that -- Iran?</p><p>MCCARTHY: Yes, but I feel our European allies are being weak in this -- in this part --</p><p>BARTIROMO: They're still doing business with Iran.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Yes. I would not do business with Iran anymore. They fund the terrorists around the world based upon the money we provided them in that last agreement, which was a mistake by all means. We never got to vote on it. It was not a treaty. And this -- and that -- that agreement allows them to have a nuclear weapon at the end of the agreement in 10 years.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, a couple more issues to got to get to.</p><p>I want to ask you about technology. Mark Zuckerberg in town. But also investigate the investigators. Inspector general, Michael Horowitz, telling a congressional panel yesterday he is willing to look into, quote, irregularities from former FBI Director Jim Comey. He also said that he did refer Comey for criminal prosecution but the DOJ turned it down.</p><p>Are we going to see accountability for what now most people understand took place in 2016, that they tried to frame then candidate Donald Trump and then President Donald Trump?</p><p>MCCARTHY: What is see coming out of the attorney general, yes, he's being very fair, walking it through. What I'm not seeing in the Judiciary Committee by Chairman Nadler is, no. In a normal Congress, after an inspector general gives a report about the DOJ, you would call them in as members of Congress and both sides of the aisle go through that investigation, ask them what they found, but Nadler will not bring that forward.</p><p>Nadler's not talking about that. He's not working anything on the border. He's not working on tech. All he's doing is having this imaginary impeachment, which the own speaker he's fighting with.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Are you going to see legislation about border? I mean I know Mexico and Guatemala has helped the U.S. and the numbers are down. But is Congress going to do anything about the loopholes that remain around immigration and the border?</p><p>MCCARTHY: We have bills introduced. But, again, it comes through the committee of Chairman Nadler. And the only thing he said he wanted to mainly do to become chairman is impeachment. And that's all he's focused on. He's not doing the work that the American public asked him to do.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, you're making a lot of comments about the Democrats. Are you going to be able to get the House majority back in 2020?</p><p>MCCARTHY: Oh, yes. We just won two races in North Carolina simply by that increase of where we were. We won the -- we won North Caroline Nine in 2018 by 900 votes. We just won it by 4,100. Just that 2 percent --</p><p>BARTIROMO: What about all these retirements, Congressman?</p><p>MCCARTHY: I'm not worried about the retirements, because the only retirement I worry about is Will Hurd. That's the only person that's sitting in a seat that Hillary carried. There's only two more. These other retirements are Republican seats. You know what it is? It's about as revolution. There's new faces.</p><p>You look at Westley Hunt in Houston, graduate of West Point, flew Apaches for ten years and running. This is an ability to change the face of the Republican Party to look like the rest of America and have the leadership of those who want to join with this president who wants to put America first.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And you're going to be calling out all these policies, like you -- like you just did in terms of the cities in our country I guess.</p><p>Let me ask you about big tech on The Hill.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: FaceBook founder CEO Mark Zuckerberg in Washington this week to pitch his vision of moderate Internet regulation. He had a dinner meeting last night with a group of lawmakers to help boost the company's image. Your reaction and what should be done with big tech?</p><p>MCCARTHY: Well, we've got to make sure with big tech that we have protection. Our own privacy. I believe in private property. Why don't we add private property to our privacy. We should know whatever big tech is gaining from us, from our own knowledge, but we should actually -- if they monetize it, we should be actually paid for it. We should be able to move it. We should be able to delete it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Or at least know where this is going. I mean if you're using my profile to get advertising, I want to know about it.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Are they reading my e-mails. Are they using -- you should know it. You should be able to delete it. And you should be able to move it.</p><p>But, you know what committee this comes through, Judiciary Committee. Is Nadler doing anything about it? No. He's only focusing on imaginary impeachment.</p><p>Immigration, tech, our privacy, inspector general with the problems happening at DOJ, none of that is happening in Judiciary Committee. All Nadler is doing -- that's why Nadler -- I've even had Democrats come to me and tell me, they wonder if he should stay chairman. I don't know if he could stay chairman based upon the actions of what he's doing today.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, are you calling for him to step down as chairman of Judiciary?</p><p>MCCARTHY: If he continues to not act on these issues, why is he in that position? The Democrats did their own poll and asked the American public about impeachment. Only 10 percent said you should worry about it. You know what this poll also said, they could not name one thing that this new Democrat majority has accomplished legislatively, but 54 percent of them could tell you they're only they're doing is investigation. Something the public doesn't -- isn't interested in.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Some people think he's worried about his challenger.</p><p>MCCARTHY: It's about his primary.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, his primary challenger.</p><p>Congressman, a lot -- a lot discussed today. We sure appreciate your time.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much, Congressman Kevin McCarthy.</p><p>Coming up, President Trump versus California. His response to San Francisco's homelessness crises. The EPA's next move.</p><p>And then Amazon gets political. A unique, new way to donate money to your favorite 2020 candidate using your voice. Yes, we will tell you how, next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>President Trump issuing a warning to San Francisco over its homeless problem.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details now in headlines.</p><p>Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Maria, the president threatened to have the EPA slap sanctions on the city because of environmental violation, saying the drugs are damaging the environment due to used needles, which are ending up in the ocean. The warning happened on the same day that he revoked California's waiver for auto emissions, we should say.</p><p>Well, it's going to be a lot easier to make donations to some of your favorite 2020 candidates, Maria. Amazon says starting today you can make campaign donations through your Alexa device just by saying, Alexa, I want to make a political contribution. Now, one catch here, it's only available for candidates the company deems principled campaign committees, though it's not immediately clear who Amazon thinks is principle and why. So, yes, Maria, using your Alexa device to donate money, what could possibly go wrong?</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I was just going to say -- I was just going to say that. That's amazing. That seems like it would be -- I don't know, potential for accidents there.</p><p>Thanks, Chery.</p><p>CASONE: Yes. You got it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Coming up, the Federal Reserve is in focus. Vice President Mike Pence spoke with me to tell me what he thinks the central bank's move should be next. He called it bold amid a wave of economic slowdowns. More of my \"First on Fox\" interview next with the vice president.</p><p>Then I'll sit down with National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow this morning, get his take on global growth fears amid the simmering trade tensions with China. And the push to pass USMCA. We're back in two minutes' time.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>The Federal Reserve cut interest rates yesterday a quarter point. This comes amid an economy that is slowing down globally and the U.S. China trade relations are still up in the air.</p><p>Joining us right now is Michael Kantrowitz, from Cornerstone Macro, to talk more about the investing backdrop.</p><p>Michael, it's good to see you.</p><p>MICHAEL KANTROWITZ, CORNERSTONE MACRO: Good to see you too, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Your reaction to the cut in rates and where you think this market and economy are headed over the next year.</p><p>KANTROWITZ: Sure.</p><p>I think the cut was no surprise. It was -- it was pretty much expected by the market. The initial reaction of the market was a bit hawkish. But as Powell started talking, he did a good job conveying that the Fed is open and ready and willing to cut more if the global economy deteriorates further. At Cornerstone our policy analyst, Roberto Perli, expects that the Fed will skip October and then cut again, assuming no big improvement, a cut once more back in December.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Dagen, jump in here in terms of your reaction on the -- on the cut and also what's next.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: Mike, I wanted to ask you about the disruption in the short term lending markets and the money markets with the Fed having to, again, the rated on Tuesday shot up to 10 percent. The Fed getting ready to come into the market with $75 billion in liquidity again today.</p><p>What does this mean for the Fed's balance sheet? The balance sheet got too small, right? So will they -- can they actually expand it in the months to come and does that help the overall economy here?</p><p>KANTROWITZ: Sure. You know, there are many signs of -- or some signs of stress in the financial markets. We don't view that this is one of them, that this is not a -- a function of the global economy weakening or really big problems in the banking system. We think this is more technical, that - - showing that the Fed likely has shrunk their balance sheet too much and eventually they will need to increase the size of their balance sheet for the demand of liquidity.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Michael, do you think the Fed should have cut more based on what you're seeing in terms of the slowdown that we're looking at on the global economy?</p><p>KANTROWITZ: That's a good question. I -- you know, we think the Fed has been cutting and will likely continue to cut at least once more. Our view is that the global backdrop and leading indicators will continue deteriorating until we get to the first quarter next year. Usually the Fed does cut past the low in global economic activity. And so I think we're going to see at least one more, maybe a couple more rate cuts.</p><p>Should they have cut 50 basis points or more? I don't think that's necessarily would have been a better idea.</p><p>The easing cycle began all the way back in late '18, not with the first Fed rate cut, but with the beginning of interest rates, mortgage rates, two- year yields falling. So there's been a lot of stimulus already put in the pipeline and the Fed is just helping that out and furthering it, which does indicate that next year we're probably going to have a reacceleration in the global economy.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, SENIOR WRITER, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Michael, Jon Hilsenrath here in Washington.</p><p>I want to hear how you size up how Jerome Powell did yesterday. You know, he's had a number of conferences here where he seemed to fumble in his message, the market sold off in December and back again in June. It seemed like people in the market were a little bit more comfortable with what Powell was saying yesterday. And I just want to hear how you size it up and what he said that put people at ease.</p><p>KANTROWITZ: Sure. Well, I think he correct the market's initial hawkish take. You know, as soon as the announcement came out, the dollar ripped higher, bond yields moved up, stocks fell. And then as Powell began talking in the press conference, he showed up investors that the door was wide open for additional Fed cuts if the backdrop were to deteriorate further. So we think he did a pretty good job this time compared to the past few times.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Do you think he's getting more comfortable in the job? You know, he's under enormous pressure from the president and the markets. Do you think his performance was just at a higher level yesterday, or was it just the right message at the right moment?</p><p>KANTROWITZ: Yes, he -- he had some tough questions to answer regarding the independence of the Fed, the -- how to account for the tariff impact on the U.S. economy, which is very difficult to do. And so I think he was transparent and honest and I think the market liked that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, Byron, real quick.</p><p>BYRON YORK, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": Michael, big picture political question. The background of all of this is the 2020 election. You said next year you expect reacceleration in the global economy. How does that affect the U.S. and the backdrop of the economy to the presidential campaign?</p><p>KANTROWITZ: Sure. Well, we've been in a global slowdown for about 19 months now and the -- most of the time that we see lower rates and now Fed easings, in addition to easing out of China, easing out of many other countries around the world as well and we'll continue to see that we believe and all of that is leading to what we believe to be a reacceleration of leading indicators in profits, in expectations to the global backdrop, which have been falling for, again, 18, 19 months. And so that should bode well for the U.S. economy and should bode well for confidence, for business confidence. We still think that, again, there's a short term air pocket here over the next four months where that stimulus doesn't fully kick in yet, but by the time we get to the first quarter of next year, we should begin to see the benefits of that intimal drop in mortgage rates and how it's helped housing and the -- the rate cuts we've seen from the Fed now. And that should help to extended the recovery.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So you want to stay -- you want to stay on the sidelines on stocks while this settles outs or are you a buyer here, Michael?</p><p>KANTROWITZ: We're cautious here still, again, because we think that earnings expectations haven't yet bottomed and we still think the next --</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>KANTROWITZ: Over the next six months there could be some volatility in the labor market that could spook investors. So (INAUDIBLE) will be clear in Q1 next year.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Michael, it's great to see you this morning.</p><p>KANTROWITZ: Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Q1 next year. We're going to be \\watching that. And we so appreciate your time, thank you. Michael Kantrowitz from Cornerstone Macro.</p><p>Coming up, globe growth fears. I'm sitting down you National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow. He is exclusive coming up. He'll weigh in on the latest rounds of negotiations with China and the push to pass USMCA and its impact. Larry Kudlow coming up next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back, our top story this half an hour, the Federal Reserve in focus. President Trump sounding off on the Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell -- this after the central bank lowered interest rates by a quarter point for the second time this year.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, U.S. PRESIDENT: He raised far too fast, he also did quantitative tightening which was not a good thing to do. But it's all right, and look, we have a great economy and that's not going to make the difference, but it would have given us an edge and instead somebody else has an edge but they're so far behind us they can't catch us.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining me right now, National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow, and Larry, it is always wonderful to see you.</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR: Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. Your reactions to the Fed's move yesterday.</p><p>KUDLOW: Well, look, it's a step in the right direction. I think, you know, regarding the president's remarks, it's no secret, not breaking news, he's a Fed critic. I think he would rather the Fed have been bolder, and I think one example of that was Jim Bullard, the president of the St. Louis Fed, who I think is a real thought leader in the Federal Reserve system, who dissented from yesterday's quarter point cut because he wanted a half a point cut.</p><p>And that's probably the camp that I fall into. And, you know, we want to remove all obstacles to economic growth. Now, you and I will talk some about the European issue and some of the trade issues, but here at home the yield curve in the bond market is still upside down.</p><p>So, short rates are still higher than long rates and I think the Fed should ameliorate that position and I think they probably have more work to do in their policy rates. And I reckon they'll probably get there. They'll probably get there.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But why -- but why is that? I mean, is it indicating that things are slowing down to the extent that the recession is coming?</p><p>KUDLOW: Well no, recession -- gosh, I don't see anything remotely like a recession, but the yield curve point -- the inversion point is you've got a lot of congestion in the markets, and by the way, it doesn't pay for banks to loan, so that's an issue regarding the overall economy.</p><p>Having said all of that -- oh, perhaps one more point, the inflation outlook is very benign and Jay Powell mentioned that yesterday properly. In the bond market, again, the price indicators suggest the inflation rate is maybe one and a quarter, one and a half percent, their target is two. So, they've got plenty of room.</p><p>But, I do want to throw in this, I haven't seen much coverage, in recent days we've had a blowout retail sales number for the U.S. economy. We had terrific -- probably the best number for manufacturing production in five or six months and inside the production number business equipment, i.e. CapEx, went up a full percentage point. It's now about 4.5 percent the last three months.</p><p>And finally yesterday, as you know, I'm sure you report it, housing starts surprised everybody by jumping up. So, there are some very good signs out there, but the trick for us, regarding monetary and all other policies, let's remove any obstacles. I mean, with low taxes and regulations, Maria, the U.S. economy can grow three or four percent if we would just let it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But you just mentioned CapEx, I know that you're still seeing interest and investment in things like software and technology, but in the last month reading on CapEx it was down. So, is the trade uncertainty causing managers of businesses to sit on cash and not invest?</p><p>KUDLOW: Just as a qualifier, in the Industrial Production Report for the month of August, last month, business equipment was up by a full percentage point. That's your CapEx number, so that's a big improvement.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you think business equipment just technology or business equipment across the board? Because I'm wondering if there is technology spending continuing but other CapEx is not.</p><p>KUDLOW: Well, technology -- I don't have the breakdown yet. Technology spending is very important. I think you will see it pick up in equipment too. Do you know what the single biggest fastest growing component of business investment? Intellectual property, IP, which they finally put into these numbers and it's been running about 10 percent per annum growth rate. That's quite remarkable. USA, we are still by far the technology inventor, innovator, and applier. We're the leader in the world by far and it's showing up in those numbers.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW: And you know, lower tax rates -- look, it's not exactly breaking news. I am a supply sider. I believe in free market incentives. If you let them keep more of what they earn, they're going to do it. We believe in the rule of law. We're letting our technologists run. That is the single biggest factor that the U.S. has that nobody else has in the world; nobody else has that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Which is why China wants to steal it.</p><p>KUDLOW: If they're so darn smart, why do they keep stealing our stuff --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly.</p><p>KUDLOW: -- and that's one of the keys to the trade negotiations.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I want to talk to you about the trade negotiations and USMCA, Larry. Let's take a short break. When we come back we're going to focus in on trade. President Trump pushing lawmakers to bring the trade deal to the floor. I'm with Larry Kudlow this morning and we'll be back with the National Economic Council director. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back and I am back with National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow. I want to talk about USMCA, Larry. President Trump is pushing lawmakers to bring this trade deal to the House floor. I spoke with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy earlier about the possibility of it being passed. Here's what he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEVIN MCCARTHY, HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: The real critical time is now because if we're having negotiations with China, if China is going to have their 70th anniversary then see president in November, this is the moment in time we should be stronger in those negotiations.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Secretary Perdue said, look, if we can't get this done, it's anybody's guess if we can get anything else done in terms of other trade deals.</p><p>MCCARTHY: I don't think -- if this does not get done by Thanksgiving, it won't get done.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: And then what, Larry Kudlow?</p><p>KUDLOW: You know, I -- increasingly bullish on this. We had -- I guess I am allowed to say this -- my friend and former TV partner, Jim Cramer, interviewed Speaker Pelosi, I guess two evenings ago, and she was quite optimistic. She suggested they could get to yes. I think Jimmy said well, will you give President Trump a win? And she said, actually, it is not a Republican win, it's not a Democratic win, it would be an American win. I thought that was terrific, terrific stuff.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I was so surprised that she said that and it made me feel like maybe there is a warming to it.</p><p>KUDLOW: Well, that is right, and look. I know her, Bob Lighthizer, Ambassador Lighthizer has been in a terrific relationship with her. She's been very accommodative to us on USMCA. There are some buttons to be buttoned down still but nonetheless the fundamental nature of this deal is so pro-growth.</p><p>I mean look, Canada and Mexico are so important. Our total trade with those two countries is twice what our total trade is with China, for example. China may be a sexier global story but for the American economy various estimates -- half a point of additional GDP per year, maybe 180,000 jobs per year...</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>KUDLOW: ... and maybe a hundred billion dollars of direct investment. And one of the brilliant parts of Bob Lighthizer's negotiation here in what is essentially a nonpartisan deal, old-economy stuff, still very important, would raise domestic content for manufacturers with higher wages governing much of the production, opening up farm and dairy areas with Canada; a tough nut to crack, but we managed to get there.</p><p>New economy stuff, Maria, intellectual property rights and copyright protections, the best anyone has ever seen. This is breakthrough stuff in trade deals, additions to financial services and digital services and even a currency stability aspect to this. It's a powerful deal. The sooner we get it passed, the sooner it's going to act positively on the economy. The job implications are terrific. The blue collar jobs, the farm jobs, the fisherman jobs, and the technology jobs.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But why are they saying, we're getting there? I mean the deal is in place and Mexico already signed off on it. Canada says it wants this deal so when you say getting there, so in other words, there could still be tweaks and changes. Where?</p><p>KUDLOW: Well, I don't want too specific. That's up to my -- my Reagan Cub Scout friend Bob Lighthizer. We served together 40 years ago. There are issues here about enforcement. One area, worker rights, let's take that, which was something of a bone of contention in the House. What we've written in there to protect worker rights was advancing what the Mexican government in the past has not even done for worker rights and union and labor rights. So that's a huge plus.</p><p>So when I say there are a few things left to be buttoned down, I think they're relatively small things and I think the cooperative spirit. Again my hat's off to Speaker Pelosi who I think has been a great help. My other hat is off to my pal Bob Lighthizer who has really negotiated a terrific deal.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Is there any reason to believe that the U.S. worker will have to compete with a Mexican worker making $1.50 an hour? Which is what Debbie Dingell said when she sat in that chair an hour ago.</p><p>KUDLOW: Well look, I think that's really quite unfair and not untrue because of the protections built into this. Now more or less these formulas can be quite complicated but more or less 45 percent of the manufacturing worker or the auto worker has to get a $16 an hour wage --</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's what I said to her because that's what I thought. Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW: -- so that's a great protection. And the domestic content -- the North American domestic content has been raised to 75 percent. And incidentally I would say in our trade talks with other countries around the world, particularly Europe, especially some of our friends who were the German car makers, they are telling us they will accommodate us.</p><p>That they will continue to move towards the U.S., they are willing to abide by these rules. And I think that's a huge plus, and again, Maria, the point is you want the economy growing three, four percent. I think that is our potential. This is a pro-growth deal. It's right in front of us. So, I welcome Speaker Pelosi's remarks and I think if we do get the vote, there's a very good chance the vote will pass.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And then there's China. I sat down --</p><p>KUDLOW: And then there's China.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- with Blackstone Group Chairman and CEO Stephen Schwarzman yesterday talking about China and negotiating this trade versus national security. Here's what he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCHWARZMAN: I think that, you know, on many of these the Chinese are sympathetic to those areas. Imagine, Maria, that you started out with almost no GDP per capita 40 years ago. I don't know whether it was three or four hundred dollars and now it's 10,000. It's the greatest economic miracle.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's unbelievable.</p><p>SCHWARZMAN: Perhaps in world history. When we show up and say, hey why don't you just drop that system and do it the way we do, you could understand that the enthusiasm for that wouldn't be wild.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: And he's making the point that these are two very different cultures. Can we do a deal with such different cultures?</p><p>KUDLOW: Well, look, it's a complicated matter. Steve Schwarzman's an old friend, a good guy, but look, President Trump is the first president in 20 years or more to raise the issues of unfair and frequently illegal and unlawful trading practices.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, he's changed the conversation, Larry.</p><p>KUDLOW: And he deserves enormous credit for that. As you know, in this town of Washington D.C. it's pretty hard to change a narrative; he has done that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Look, I know you want market access and I know you want them to buy more stuff from the U.S.</p><p>KUDLOW: Yes, that's part of it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But can you separate the intellectual property theft and the national security issues from that?</p><p>KUDLOW: Well, in terms of a complete deal, I don't think you can. I mean, sure we want better market access. They have between their standards and regulations and their tariffs and non-tariff barriers, there's a lot of problems there. On the other hand, you and I were just talking about technology. And China does not have a sterling record when it comes to stealing technology.</p><p>So, IP theft's got to be part of the conversation. Ownership, right, you do a joint venture in China, they own the majority share of the company, they can tell you to put your blueprint on the table and that's the forced transfer of technology, which we cannot permit, right? That takes American ingenuity away from us. There are issues about cyber hacking, there are issues about corporate espionage and of course there will always be enforcement issues.</p><p>It's been too long. The last 20 years, and I might add, you know, China's been hurt badly by the Trump tariffs in my judgment. Their numbers are sinking very rapidly, they're in very poor shape. In economic terms by four, five to one, China is paying the burden of the tariffs that we have used.</p><p>Now, President Trump is a negotiator, he's a very tough negotiator, so it's a good thing to have these talks. So, today and tomorrow the Chinese deputies team will be meeting here in Washington with our deputies team.</p><p>A couple weeks after that in mid October, the principals will meet Liu He and his group, Steve Mnuchin and Bob Lighthizer and the rest of us back them up. This is good. And there's a little softening in the air. Unexpectedly last week China removed some ag tariffs on soybeans and pork. They've had a tremendous problem with pork, which is a staple of their diet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's the point I made, they need our pork, they've got swine flu in 250 million pigs.</p><p>KUDLOW: They need -- I mean I think they need our beef, you know. When I was over there, I don't know a year, year and a half ago, my first trip to Beijing we had a couple of dinners and I would have preferred a Chinese takeout in New York City than what they fed me there.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh my goodness.</p><p>KUDLOW: I told Vice Premier Liu He, somewhat jokingly, you know I can't help myself, he really could use our steak because I wasn't sure what this stuff was that they were serving me, yes.</p><p>BARTRIOMO: Oh my god.</p><p>KUDLOW: But I will say this, better to talk than not to talk and the talks are proceeding. And they eased up on some of their requirements on the embargos. And the president also, in a good will gesture, deferred some our tariff expectations.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW: So, you know, let us see --</p><p>BARTIROMO: So you say there's music in the air, you said the other day.</p><p>KUDLOW: Let us see. There's a little music in the air.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW: I never predict --</p><p>BARTIROMO: But wasn't it Leo -- wasn't it Liu He who said, yes, I'm going to go back to China with this deal, we're 90 percent there and then he got to China and the hardline said, no.</p><p>KUDLOW: Yes, that's quite right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, how -- what's going to change with Liu He this time?</p><p>KUDLOW: I don't know. Again, I don't want to predict at all. We thought we were pretty close, they pulled back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right.</p><p>KUDLOW: That was a great disappointment. The president then took some tougher actions and he wasn't -- since then --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW: -- the president has not been satisfied with the progress, but again, as a sharp negotiator, the president keeps saying, we must talk and if a good deal is on the table he would look at it, right, might even take it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW: But it has to be a good deal.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>KUDLOW: On the other hand, Maria, we're growing and they're not.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. Well, we got --</p><p>KUDLOW: And for years, China has moved wrong way.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But, we're slowing --</p><p>KUDLOW: They have reduced --</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- 3.1 percent to 2.1 percent in the second quarter.</p><p>KUDLOW: Well, let's see how the year plays out. It's interesting to me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>KUDLOW: Let's see how this year -- because these new numbers coming in on production and sales and consumers trying -- and jobs, by the by, I think our economy is outperforming expectations and by the by, incentives work.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW: So, if you lower taxes, you lower regulations, you move to lower trade barriers, you open up the oil sector. I mean, look at what Iran's done, Iran deserves huge blame for the Saudi story, right?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW: But had almost no impact except for the first 15 minutes of trading --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Great point.</p><p>KUDLOW: -- because we are producing 12.5 million barrels a day. I mean, wow.</p><p>BARTIROMO: A lot on the line. Larry, it's good to see you. Thank you so much.</p><p>KUDLOW: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Larry Kudlow. Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. AT&amp;T is being pressured to sell DirecTV amid mounting problems for the company. There is an activist investor involved, Gerri Willis is on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with more. Gerri?</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS: Hey Maria, that's right. So we're seeing AT&amp;T shares higher as it considers parting ways with its DirecTV unit. The CEO Randall Stevenson under pressure to change his strategy, to go to streaming media -- that business pressure from investor Elliot Management that owns a $3.2 billion stake in the company.</p><p>The most likely outcome of all this is that DirecTV and Dish would get married, would unite in one company. I want to tell you a little bit about U.S. Steel here for a second, that stock down pretty much 11 percent at my last look -- 12.85 percent on deteriorating market conditions in Europe. They are guiding lower on earnings. Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right Gerri, thank you so much.</p><p>We did have the Philly Fed (ph) and the jobless claims out, we're going to get final thoughts for this -- I'll start panel when we come right back, stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Final thoughts from this all-star panel, Byron York.</p><p>BYRON YORK, WASHINGTON EXAMINER: On trade, if you put together the Kevin McCarthy and the Larry Kudlow interviews talking about the relationship between the China thing and the USMCA.</p><p>First of all, Kudlow had incredibly nice conciliatory things to say about Speaker Pelosi --</p><p>BARTIROMO: I know --</p><p>YORK: Couldn't have been nicer.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I think he was speaking to her.</p><p>YORK: Couldn't have been nicer, and he pointed out total trade with Canada and Mexico is twice what it is with China --</p><p>BARTIROMO: He says $1.4 trillion --</p><p>YORK: Which is -- and Kevin McCarthy said pass this Mexico deal and that'll put pressure on the Chinese.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yeah, good point. John?</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL, SENIOR WRITER: Well first on Larry Kudlow. He's a nice guy, I'm not surprised to hear him say nice things about Nancy Pelosi --</p><p>BARTIROMO: He's a very nice guy.</p><p>HILSENRATH: But you know, I want to talk about stocks and the fed. Stock futures are point up today, and here I think is why. The market got some much needed insight in to how the fed is managing this slowdown. Jay Powell was going to go at his own pace, he might cut rates a little bit more. But he's not going to get pushed in to doing it by either the market or the fed, and I think the market liked that certainty that it got.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yeah, and also maybe it was the Philadelphia Federal Reserve that came out -- the index came out -- it dropped to 12 but it was higher than expected, markets turned around.</p><p>Dagan (ph) -- thank you so much Dagan (ph), Jon and Byron good to see you. Let's get right to David Asman, Varney &amp; Co. begins now, have a great day everybody --</p><p>DAVID ASMAN: Dynamite show, Maria --</p><p>BARTIROMO: David Asman's in for Stuart.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2019091903cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X35-VT21-JB20-G0M9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7650\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 19, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002F2B</classCode><className>BANK OF ENGLAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002BKC</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TIMES GROUP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC000DAH9</classCode><className>BANK OF JAPAN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS521110 MONETARY AUTHORITIES - CENTRAL BANK</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>SIC6011 FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>SIC2711 NEWSPAPERS: PUBLISHING, OR PUBLISHING &amp;

Khanna Dismisses Claims of Silicon Valley Anti-Conservative Bias</nitf:hl1></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p>It's not legitimate to claim Silicon Valley is biased against conservatives, Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., said in an interview on C-SPAN's The Communicators set to have been televised this weekend. President Donald Trump offered anecdotal evidence of social media's anti-conservative bias at a White House summit Thursday (see 1907110066).</p><p>\"It's quite absurd on its face, given that I don't think Donald Trump would be president if it weren't for social media,\" said Khanna, who represents Silicon Valley. The joke there is that Hillary Clinton received 99 percent of the region's donations during the 2016 election, but Trump won the social media battle, Khanna added.</p><p>Basic online privacy protections are needed to avoid another Cambridge Analytica-like breach, Khanna said. He urged support for his internet bill of rights (see 1810050036), which he formulated at the direction of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. Companies should have to secure user consent to collect and transfer data, unless it concerns ordinary business practices needed to fulfill customer needs, Khanna argued, noting that's the model for California's privacy law. Khanna said repeatedly there's room for bipartisan support on tech issues in the House.</p><p>House Judiciary Committee ranking member Doug Collins, R-Ga., this week floated privacy principles (see 1907100031) that would define consumer data rights. It's an attempt to improve Silicon Valley behavior without assuming a big tech breakup is needed, he told us: \"I'm concerned we're getting so fascinated in this town with tearing apart big companies that we're not actually just looking at what they're doing and how we can better make the process that we have.\" The prospective bill is an attempt to look at the current situation and ensure consumers own their data because \"they're monetizing what they know about us,\" Collins said.</p><p>Antitrust enforcement should ensure tech incumbents aren't privileging their own platforms, Khanna told the Communicators, citing the Microsoft case of the late 1990s. Today, for instance, Amazon shouldn't be able to force-feed users with AmazonBasics products on its platform, he said.</p><p>Regulators shouldn't have approved Facebook's purchases of Instagram and WhatsApp, Khanna said. He noted some in his district might disagree, saying the exit plan for many startups is to get bought out by a large incumbent. But the public needs assurance that new platforms will always emerge, he said.</p><p>It would be a mistake to further weaken Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, Khanna said. Members of Congress from both parties are closely scrutinizing the tech industry's liability shield (see 1907090062), which was weakened by a 2018 anti-sex trafficking law. Removing Section 230 protections has unintended consequences, Khanna said, citing a more dangerous environment for sex workers since passage that update.</p><p>Khanna hopes to continue \"constructive\" talks with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., about legislation to better prepare platforms against foreign interference. He complimented McCarthy's tech savviness, but said there's a \"knowledge gap\" for many other members. Social media companies should share information with each other about \"bad actors,\" Khanna argued. He noted banks do this.</p><p>News that Immigration and Customs Enforcement used face scanning technology to mine state driver's license databases, gathering data about millions of Americans without consent, is \"concerning,\" Khanna said. Because the technology is susceptible to racial and gender bias, Congress needs to set clear guidelines for face scanning technology, he said. Khanna believes there's room for bipartisan support with \"thoughtful\" Republicans like Rep. Will Hurd, Texas. Khanna said it's a \"difficult lift\" to get any movement in the Senate from Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and a signature from Trump.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMDLY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMDLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKH-NN71-JC8G-80KX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6944</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"647\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Communications Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 15, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Khanna states that, \"I support Senator Sanders' bill that would be paid for by taxes on corporations that would be less money for those corporations than they are currently paying for premiums and a tax on the 1% millionaires and billionaires.\" Khanna is one of only six members of the House who does not take campaign contributions from PACs or corporations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Two weeks ago he introduced a health care bill to jump start Medicare-For-All in states by helping them set up universal healthcare systems on their own.</p><p>\"What this allows the states to do is take Medicaid and Medicare funding and put it towards a single payer system with the caveat that you have to provide better coverage than what the federal programs are providing and within 5 years you have to get 100% coverage,\" Khanna said. His plan would require states to start out with 95% health coverage.</p><p>Tennessee wouldn't qualify because its health-insured rate is only 83%. One in ten Tennesse-ans, about half a million people, don't have health insurance. Khanna's bill would provide supplemental federal matching funds to cover the insurance gap if the federal Medicaid waiver is not sufficient. But since Tennessee lawmakers rejected the Medicaid waiver in 2015, the state wouldn't get federal matching funds either. The healthcare coverage gap in the Volunteer State is big and getting bigger.</p><p>Silicon Valley has a lot of unaffordable housing. Khanna noted that Apple and Google have put private sector funds into affordable housing as well as first time mortgages but it's not enough. He supports a Housing First policy.</p><p>\"We need far more federal investment in the expansion of the Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC),\" he said. \"We need to have temporary shelters that will have services for those who have drug addiction or mental illness so we can accommodate the increased homelessness.\"</p><p>Khanna noted a pilot program in his district that was helping people with rent and homebuy-ers before they default on their mortgages. \"It has been quite successful,\" he said.</p><p>Khanna has been pushing an Internet Bill of Rights that he hopes will pass before the 2020 Election. He doesn't trust Facebook to remove false political ads that would interfere with the vote as they did in 2016.</p><p>\"I don't think it should be the Facebooks of the world policing speech based on their own preferences. It should be the role of a regulatory agency like the FCC or an independent agency to set clear standards for what blatantly false speech would be,\" he said. He noted false speech does not have First Amendment protection wherever it is. Courts have traditionally made those decisions as well as what constitutes hate speech.</p><p>Khanna said he hoped social media companies would voluntarily take steps to prevent \"bad\" speech from going viral and take down false political ads that could interfere with our elections.</p><p>He said targeting a particular audience is not the real issue. Consumers are targeted with ads all the time in radio, TV, and magazines. But blatantly false ads take on a life of their own once they are posted and Khanna says somebody needs \"to call the balls and strikes\".</p><p>\"The burden of the failings in our democracy can't be laid simply at their footsteps. It is also the case that cable news has led to increasing polarization and it's also the case that the tone of our politics has become far more hostile and uncivil. So social media definitely needs to regulate what they are doing but it's going to require a broader conversation to restore our democracy.\"</p><p>Another part of Khanna's Internet bill has to do with protecting consumers from big tech companies collecting data about them and invading their privacy. The bill would require an individual's consent to have their personal data collected or transferred and it would give people the right to know what is happening with their personal information.</p><p>\"It would make sure data was not being manipulated against their interests,\" Khanna said. While the law would make it a bit harder for tech companies to collect large amounts of data, it would also protect peoples' privacy. \"Unlike in China, where you have mass amounts of data without any concern for personal liberties,\" he said.</p><p>The fate of the Dreamers, children of undocumented parents who have lived in the U.S. since they were children, is now in the hands of the Supreme Court.</p><p>\"I completely oppose any effort to terminate the DACA program. Congress should act so we can put it on a firm statutory basis...it's xenophobia to deny them citizenship,\" Khanna said. He added that it's very sad that the Dreamers are going to have this uncertainty in their lives once again.</p><p>\"It is hurting their sense of belonging in America and that is doing enormous damage as we are trying to stitch this country back together.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNTRIB-2326763313</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TNTRIB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XS3-5931-DY0W-4208-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">316793</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"854\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Tennessee TRIBUNE Nov 21-Nov 27, 2019</copyright><publicationName>Tennessee Tribune, The</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 10675280</issn><volume>Vol. 30</volume><issueNumber>No. 47</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 21, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Ro Khanna, D-California, issued the following news release:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This week, Rep. Ro Khanna, member of the House Oversight Committee and Congressional Representative for Silicon Valley, participated in the 2019 Web Summit in Lisbon, Portugal.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Rep. Khanna joined two of Web Summit's robustly attended panels. The first, \"None left behind: Making tech work for the many\" was a fireside chat in conversation with former Prime Minister Tony Blair. The second, \"Rebuilding trust in tech\" was a conversation with Microsoft CEO Brad Smith. Khanna had several individual conversations with speakers while there, including former Prime Minister Tony Blair, who touted his efforts and innovation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Rep. Khanna has traveled across rural America discussing opportunities to bring technology jobs into communities left behind and mapping out a future for the global economy. Rep. Khanna, in early 2020, will introduce a bill that will establish a grant program to build up tech-related schooling opportunities in the middle America - legislating his vision of transition to innovation-based economies. His plan entails a multibillion-dollar investment inspired by Morrill Act of 1862. Khanna has traveled to several economically distressed cities in Kentucky, West Virginia, Michigan, Ohio, Iowa, North Carolina and South Carolina. There, Rep. Khanna has partnered with local lawmakers to bring Silicon Valley representatives to meet with local businesses and universities to help form partnerships.</p><p>\"The reality is that technology has enriched our lives in so many ways. In enhancing communication, enhancing the promise of medicine, enhancing the possibility of information. And yet that innovation and wealth has been concentrated in a few areas. And people in Silicon Valley are increasingly aware that many have been left out in rural America, in minority communities.... Our country will fall apart if we don't integrate and provide those opportunities to these places that have been left out. Put simply, no child should be forced to leave their hometown to get a good job.</p><p>How are we going to create new jobs given the technology revolution? What are we going to do to make sure there's not geographic inequality? What are we going to do to have thoughtful regulations, so democracy is enhanced, not undermined, based on these new platforms? So, my view is that the central question of governance is how are we going to have thoughtful economic policy, thoughtful regulation, to deal with the technology revolution, and that's sorely missing in Congress.</p><p>Our politics are either about the restoration of the past, or an embrace of the future. At a very simple level, Donald Trump is saying 'let's go back to the past, let's go back to the way life used to be,' and if you believe, as I do, in a multi-cultural democracy... you have to convince people that technology and the future is going to be a force for good in their lives, not a force of disruption. That to me is the central challenge for modern politics,\" said Rep. Khanna.</p><p>\"It's a great pleasure to be with Ro as well, whose work I admire greatly. The people being left behind are the people who don't understand how technology is changing the world, who feel that the force of globalization is passing them by. The big challenge... is how do you get the changemakers and the policymakers together.</p><p>Today, the question of technology should run throughout government. My view is you need to reorder politics around handling this technological revolution.... the problem today is that you've got a real world revolution in this room, and you've got politics in the other room, and the question is how you put that together.</p><p>Technology is more than about Big Tech. It's about all those companies that are being created now, that are doing new things, that are innovating. We need that energy to be in the political room as well . . . a lot of the time these guys want to be as far away from government as possible, I understand that. But it's necessary for the politicians to understand the world in order that they make the right policy. And this dislocation between the revolution that's happening on the ground and the political debate is worrying and it's dangerous,\" said Prime Minister Tony Blair.</p><p>The full panel with Prime Minister Tony Blair can be viewed online here (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3GaiT-8fsk\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3GaiT-8fsk</url>).</p><p>The full panel with Microsoft CEO Brad Smith can be viewed online here (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azv9GLRrrCo\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azv9GLRrrCo</url>).</p><p>* * *</p><p>About the Office</p><p>Congressman Khanna represents the 17th District of California, which covers communities in Silicon Valley.

Ro Khanna:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Lisbon, Portugal This week, Rep. Ro Khanna, member of the House Oversight Committee and Congressional Representative for Silicon Valley, participated in the 2019 Web Summit in Lisbon, Portugal.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Rep. Khanna joined two of Web Summit's robustly attended panels. The first, \"None left behind: Making tech work for the many\" was a fireside chat in conversation with former Prime Minister Tony Blair. The second, \"Rebuilding trust in tech\" was a conversation with Microsoft CEO Brad Smith. Khanna had several individual conversations with speakers while there, including former Prime Minister Tony Blair, who touted his efforts and innovation.</p><p>Rep. Khanna has traveled across rural America discussing opportunities to bring technology jobs into communities left behind and mapping out a future for the global economy. Rep. Khanna, in early 2020, will introduce a bill that will establish a grant program to build up tech-related schooling opportunities in the middle America legislating his vision of transition to innovation-based economies. His plan entails a multibillion-dollar investment inspired by Morrill Act of 1862. Khanna has traveled to several economically distressed cities in Kentucky, West Virginia, Michigan, Ohio, Iowa, North Carolina and South Carolina. There, Rep. Khanna has partnered with local lawmakers to bring Silicon Valley representatives to meet with local businesses and universities to help form partnerships.</p><p>\"The reality is that technology has enriched our lives in so many ways. In enhancing communication, enhancing the promise of medicine, enhancing the possibility of information. And yet that innovation and wealth has been concentrated in a few areas. And people in Silicon Valley are increasingly aware that many have been left out in rural America, in minority communities.... Our country will fall apart if we don't integrate and provide those opportunities to these places that have been left out. Put simply, no child should be forced to leave their hometown to get a good job.</p><p>How are we going to create new jobs given the technology revolution? What are we going to do to make sure there's not geographic inequality? What are we going to do to have thoughtful regulations, so democracy is enhanced, not undermined, based on these new platforms? So, my view is that the central question of governance is how are we going to have thoughtful economic policy, thoughtful regulation, to deal with the technology revolution, and that's sorely missing in Congress.</p><p>Our politics are either about the restoration of the past, or an embrace of the future. At a very simple level, Donald Trump is saying 'let's go back to the past, let's go back to the way life used to be,' and if you believe, as I do, in a multi-cultural democracy... you have to convince people that technology and the future is going to be a force for good in their lives, not a force of disruption. That to me is the central challenge for modern politics,\" said Rep. Khanna.</p><p>\"It's a great pleasure to be with Ro as well, whose work I admire greatly.

Ro Khanna (D-CA) News Release</nitf:hl2></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Lisbon, Portugal - This week, Rep. Ro Khanna, member of the House Oversight Committee and Congressional Representative for Silicon Valley, participated in the 2019 Web Summit in Lisbon, Portugal.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Rep. Khanna joined two of Web Summit's robustly attended panels. The first, \"None left behind: Making tech work for the many\" was a fireside chat in conversation with former Prime Minister Tony Blair. The second, \"Rebuilding trust in tech\" was a conversation with Microsoft CEO Brad Smith. Khanna had several individual conversations with speakers while there, including former Prime Minister Tony Blair, who touted his efforts and innovation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Rep. Khanna has traveled across rural America discussing opportunities to bring technology jobs into communities left behind and mapping out a future for the global economy. Rep. Khanna, in early 2020, will introduce a bill that will establish a grant program to build up tech-related schooling opportunities in the middle America - legislating his vision of transition to innovation-based economies. His plan entails a multibillion-dollar investment inspired by Morrill Act of 1862. Khanna has traveled to several economically distressed cities in Kentucky, West Virginia, Michigan, Ohio, Iowa, North Carolina and South Carolina. There, Rep. Khanna has partnered with local lawmakers to bring Silicon Valley representatives to meet with local businesses and universities to help form partnerships.</p><p>\"The reality is that technology has enriched our lives in so many ways. In enhancing communication, enhancing the promise of medicine, enhancing the possibility of information. And yet that innovation and wealth has been concentrated in a few areas. And people in Silicon Valley are increasingly aware that many have been left out in rural America, in minority communities.... Our country will fall apart if we don't integrate and provide those opportunities to these places that have been left out. Put simply, no child should be forced to leave their hometown to get a good job.</p><p>How are we going to create new jobs given the technology revolution? What are we going to do to make sure there's not geographic inequality? What are we going to do to have thoughtful regulations, so democracy is enhanced, not undermined, based on these new platforms? So, my view is that the central question of governance is how are we going to have thoughtful economic policy, thoughtful regulation, to deal with the technology revolution, and that's sorely missing in Congress.</p><p>Our politics are either about the restoration of the past, or an embrace of the future. At a very simple level, Donald Trump is saying 'let's go back to the past, let's go back to the way life used to be,' and if you believe, as I do, in a multi-cultural democracy... you have to convince people that technology and the future is going to be a force for good in their lives, not a force of disruption. That to me is the central challenge for modern politics,\" said Rep. Khanna.</p><p>\"It's a great pleasure to be with Ro as well, whose work I admire greatly. The people being left behind are the people who don't understand how technology is changing the world, who feel that the force of globalization is passing them by. The big challenge... is how do you get the changemakers and the policymakers together.</p><p>Today, the question of technology should run throughout government. My view is you need to reorder politics around handling this technological revolution.... the problem today is that you've got a real world revolution in this room, and you've got politics in the other room, and the question is how you put that together.</p><p>Technology is more than about Big Tech. It's about all those companies that are being created now, that are doing new things, that are innovating. We need that energy to be in the political room as well . . . a lot of the time these guys want to be as far away from government as possible, I understand that. But it's necessary for the politicians to understand the world in order that they make the right policy. And this dislocation between the revolution that's happening on the ground and the political debate is worrying and it's dangerous,\" said Prime Minister Tony Blair.</p><p>The full panel with Prime Minister Tony Blair can be viewed online here <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3GaiT-8fsk\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3GaiT-8fsk</url>.</p><p>The full panel with Microsoft CEO Brad Smith can be viewed online here <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azv9GLRrrCo\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azv9GLRrrCo</url>.</p><p>Read this original document at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://khanna.house.gov/media/press-releases/release-rep-khanna-talks-tech-jobs-across-america-prime-minister-tony-blair\">https://khanna.house.gov/media/press-releases/release-rep-khanna-talks-tech-jobs-across-america-prime-minister-tony-blair</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GOVPUB-COSHMB07922V3</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XFS-XN21-JCCP-03TW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"763\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Congressional Documents and Publications</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 7, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Report</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Statistics</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009ZKA</classCode><className>BRITISH PRIME MINISTERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp;

The DMCA provides no effective relief when a rogue Web site is foreign-based and foreign-operated, like the Pirate Bay, the 89th most-visited site in the U.S.</p><p>      It doesn't protect trademark owners and consumers from counterfeit and unsafe products like fake prescription medicines and misbranded drugs that are often presented to the public by unlicensed online pharmacies.  Nor does the law assist copyright owners when rogue Web sites contribute to the theft of intellectual property on a massive scale.</p><p>      And finally, it does nothing to address the use of certain intermediaries, such as payment processors and Internet advertising services that are used by criminals to fund illegal activities. That's where the stop ...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK) </p><p>      WATT:  Mr. Chairman, I'm having trouble hearing your statement. Can you ...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK) </p><p>      SMITH:  I wouldn't want anyone to miss my statement, so I'll make sure that the sound system is working and that I'm close enough to the mic.</p><p>      WATT:  Turn his mic way up.</p><p>      SMITH:  OK.  That's where the Stop Online Piracy Act comes in. This bill focuses not on technology, but on preventing those who engage in criminal behavior from reaching directly into the U.S. market to harm American consumers.  We cannot continue a system that allows criminals to disregard our laws and import counterfeit and pirated goods across our physical borders.</p><p>      Nor can we fail to take effective and meaningful action when criminals misuse the Internet.  The problem of rogue Web sites is real, immediate and widespread, it harms all sectors of the economy, and it's scope is staggering.  One recent survey found that nearly one-quarter -- one-quarter of global Internet traffic infringes on copyrights.  </p><p>      A second study found that 43 sits classified as digital piracy generated 53 billion visits per year.  And that 26 sites selling just counterfeit prescription drugs generated 51 million hits annually. Since the United States produces the most intellectual property, our country has the most to lose if we fail to address the problem of these rogue Web sites.</p><p>      Responsible companies and public officials have taken note of the corrosive and damaging effects to rogue Web sites.  One of our witnesses today represents Mastercard Worldwide, a company that takes seriously its obligation to reduce the amount of stolen intellectual property on the Internet.  Mastercard deserves thanks for its commitment to support legislation that addresses the problems of online piracy.</p><p>      In contrast, another one of the companies represented here today has sought to obstruct the committee's consideration of bipartisan legislation.  Perhaps this should come as no surprise, given that Google just settled a federal criminal investigation into the company's active promotion of rogue Web sites that pushed illegal prescription and counterfeit drugs on American consumers.</p><p>      In announcing a half-billion dollar forfeiture of illegal profits, the Peter Neronha, who led the investigation, stated, quote, \"Suffice it to say that this is not two or three rogue employees at the consumer service level doing this.  This was a corporate decision to engage in this conduct,\" end quote.  Over several years, Google ignored repeated warnings from the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy and the National Center on Addiction And Substance Abuse at Colombia University that the company was violating federal law.</p><p>      The company also disregarded requests to block advertisements from rogue pharmacies, screen such sites from searches, and provide warnings about buying drugs over the Internet.  The Wall Street Journal reports Mr. Neronha characterized Google's efforts to appear to control unlawful advertisements as window dressing, since, quote, \"It allowed Google to continue earning revenues from the allegedly illicit ad sales, even as it professed to be taking action against them,\" end quote.</p><p>      Given Google's record, their objection to authorizing a court to order a search engine to not steer consumers to foreign rogue sites is easily understood.  Unfortunately, the theft of America's intellectual property costs the United States economy more than $110 billion annually, and results in the loss of thousands of American jobs.  </p><p>      Under current law, rogue sites that profit from selling pirated goods are often out of the reach of U.S. law enforcement agencies, and operate without consequences.  The Stop Online Piracy Act helps stop the flow of revenue to rogue Web sites, and ensures the profits from American innovations go to American innovators.  Protecting America's intellectual property will help our economy, create jobs, and discourage illegal Web sites.</p><p>      That concludes my opening statement, and the gentleman from Michigan, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, is recognized for his opening statement.</p><p>      CONYERS:  Thank you, Chairman Smith, and good morning to my fellow colleagues on the committee.  This is a very important hearing, and I want to commend you on your statement because you raised some issues that I think we will have to go into quite carefully.  </p><p>      Now, there have been attempts to deal with the problem that's before us today.  But H.R. 3261, Stop Online Piracy Act, represents a great deal of work and some experience from our attempts to deal with this subject before.  I am very pleased that this is a bipartisan bill, and that I think that's very important.</p><p>      Now, there've been a number of attempts to stop online intellectual property theft and fraud.  Some of the leading Internet service providers and right holders and the best practices standards that are being developed within the advertising network and payment processing companies, and particularly Mastercard, all come to my attention.  I commend them.  </p><p>      But this private cooperation is not sufficient.  Our studies have shown that upwards of one-quarter of all Internet traffic is copyright-infringing.  And to those who say that -- that a bill to stop online theft will break the Internet, I -- I'd like to point out that -- that it's not likely to happen.  Users connect to the Internet through service providers like AT&amp;T and Verizon.  </p><p>      But by most accounts -- and I have to bring up Google's name again in the beginning of this discussion -- Google's search engine connects users to Internet content more often than any other, and places the most advertisements.  As users surf the Web, their computers connect with the main name servers to resolve the site name that they type into their browser and its location on the Web.</p><p>      Now, we're getting a number of reactions from this proposal. Some right holders have said that the market-based process outlined in section 103 of the bill doesn't go far enough and immunizes too many players who profit from piracy.  But on the other hand, there's some in the technology section that have said this bill will break the Internet, and strangle startups and Silicon Valley giants alike.  </p><p>      And so I reluctantly ask to put this into the record -- The Attack of the Internet Killers.  Now, this is ...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK) </p><p>      SMITH:  Without objection, that'll be made a part ...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK) </p><p>      CONYERS:  \"This is very serious business.  Don't walk, run.  Tell Congress there's a better way.  Threatens global Internet security, kills cloud computer, and an American jog-crushing monster.  That's our bill H.R. 3261.\"</p><p>      SMITH:  Isn't that a comic?      CONYERS:  No, this is serious.  It's a -- it's a terrible thing. And that we -- we ought to know better.  Now, on -- on a more serious note, we have, from our friends in the American Civil Liberties Union a -- a -- a caution that I have to take more seriously.  Because they have some questions that they -- I -- I don't think -- I think needs to be examined here.  </p><p>      And that is, the first is that there's an attorney general section of the bill that only the Justice Department, in its wisdom, can ask a court to filter or block Web content.  What the American Civil Liberties Union is telling us is that we will, with this legislation, inadvertently involve non-fringing (sic) operators, and that this with a -- would violate their constitutional rights.</p><p>      Now, against that I'm going to ask to put in the eminent First Amendment scholar, Floyd Abrams', recommendation that says that the notion that this bill threatens freedom of expression is insupportable.  It protects creative free speech, as Congress has done, and the Judiciary Committee especially has been particularly sensitive to protecting.  </p><p>      And so I ask unanimous consent to put in the statement of attorney Floyd Abrams, and I yield back the balance of my time.  Thank you.</p><p>      SMITH:  Without objection.  Thank you, Mr. Conyers.</p><p>      The gentleman from Virginia, Mr. Goodlatte, the chairman of the Intellectual Properties Subcommittee, is recognized.</p><p>      GOODLATTE:  Mr. Chairman, thank you for holding this hearing and thank you for your leadership on this issue.</p><p>      For more than two centuries, America's economic strength has been built on a firm foundation.  The rule of law, respect for individuals and private property, and the promotion of industry through policies that reward creativity and innovation are essential virtues that helped a fledging nation encourage the initiative of its citizens and, in time, emerges the most advanced and prosperous on Earth.  </p><p>      These virtues are not universal.  In an increasingly connected world, threats that emanate from areas where these principles are not shared are jeopardizing our ability to sustain the incentives needed to foster growth and development, and advance human progress.  These threats create challenges for us in both the physical world and the virtual world, where the systematic and willful violation of intellectual property rights now poses a clear, present and growing danger to American creators and innovators, U.S. consumers, and our collective confidence in the Internet ecosystem.</p><p>      In order to continue to incentivize artists, authors and inventors we need to ensure that these creators have the ability to earn a return on their investments.  Increasingly, foreign piracy is stripping creators of that ability.  Within the Internet ecosystem today, there are legitimate commercial sites that offer consumers authorized goods and services.  Indeed, many exciting new technologies and Web sites help content owners distribute music, movies, books, games, software and other copyrighted works in ways that were not even imaginable 10 years ago.</p><p>      However, there are also rogue sites that steal the intellectual property of others and traffic in counterfeit and pirated goods.  In recent years, these Web sites have grown and evolved.  They have become increasingly sophisticated, and rival legitimate sites in appearance, operation, and indicia (ph) of reliability.  U.S. consumers are frequently led to these sites by search engines that list them among the top search results.</p><p>      After clicking on a site, they are immediately reassured by the logos of U.S. payment processors and the presence of major corporate advertising supporting the site.  These sites sell infringing copyrighted works, but they are not limited to those.  Increasingly, these sites also offer counterfeit goods, such as counterfeit automobile parts, medicines, baby formula, and other products that can pose serious threats to the health and safety of American citizens.</p><p>      What's worse, these rogue sites often list the real customer service contact information for the legitimate companies, which deteriorates the reputation of the legitimate maker of these goods. For all these reasons, I have joined Chairman Smith in introducing the Stop Online Piracy Act, which creates new tools for law enforcement to combat these growing threats.</p><p>      Specifically, this legislation gives law enforcement the authority to bring an action in a federal court to declare a Web site in violation of the law, and allow the court to issue a court order to intermediaries to block transactions and access to those sites found to be infringing.  The bill also provides content owners with a limited liability to request the court to declare a Web site as violating the law.  </p><p>      However, the content owners must first attempt to work directly with financial services and advertising intermediaries to solve the problem.  Only if those parties cannot reach agreement are content owners allowed to seek a court declaration against an infringing Web site.  It is my hope that this provision will allow content owners and intermediaries to work together to root out infringing sites quickly.</p><p>      It should be noted that there has been criticism from many in the online community about the scope of this bill, its effect on the functioning of the Internet, and that it could entangle legitimate Web sites.  It's my -- it is not my intention to do so, and I stand ready to work with the tech community to address any legitimate concerns they have.</p><p>       I have requested detailed comments from the tech community about their concerns, and look forward to continuing to work with them and Chairman Smith and other members of the Judiciary Committee to ensure that this legislation punishes lawbreakers while protecting content owners as well as legitimate online innovators and startups.</p><p>      Mr. Chairman, this is a good bill.  But a number of issues raised about it need to be carefully addressed.  I look forward to working with you on those issues as we move forward to protect content owners online, and I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today.</p><p>      SMITH:  Thank you, Mr. Goodlatte.</p><p>      The gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. Watt, the ranking member of the Intellectual Properties Subcommittee, is recognized.</p><p>      WATT:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Mr. Chairman, in my experience there's usually only one thing at stake when we have long lines outside a  hearing, as we do today.  And when giant companies like those opposing this bill, and their supporters, start throwing around rhetoric like this is -- this bill will kill the Internet, or it's an attempt to build the great firewall of America -- and that one thing is usually money.</p><p>      While I appreciate that the stakeholders of Internet companies that have market caps in the billions of dollars care, as we all do, about the First Amendment and other precious rights, it seems clear to me that the obstinate opposition we have seen in the days since introduction of the Stop Online Piracy Act is really about the bottom line.  Piracy and counterfeiting make money, and lots of it.</p><p>      This is not speculative.  Sites that specialize in stolen goods attract a lot of eyeballs which, in turn, attracts a lot of advertising, which in turn means, well, you got it -- lots of money. To be fair, many of the copyright and trademark owners who want this bill to help enforce their rights are also businesses and are also motivated by money.  But in my mind, stopping theft of your work or products is an appropriate incentive to secure profits.</p><p>      But doing nothing, or next to nothing, to prevent theft through the use of tools a company creates or controls is not an appropriate incentive to secure profits.  So as policymakers, our goal must be to confront the criminal enterprises that are flourishing on the Internet, stealing from the rights holders, and visiting untold harms on consumers.  Doing nothing is not an option.</p><p>      Not only are online piracy and counterfeiting drains on our economy, they expose unwary consumers to fraud, identity theft, confusion and, at worst, physical harm.  The penetration of hazardous products and good into the American marketplace, including our military supply chain, poses an unacceptable risk of serious bodily injury or death to our citizens.</p><p>      Tolerance of online theft of music, movies and software reinforces a culture of entitlement, stifles creativity, injures artists, and undermines jobs, stability and growth.  While I have never been a big advocate of current seizure laws, why would we not -- as this bill does -- give the attorney general, at a minimum, the same power to block foreign thieves from access to the U.S. markets as the attorney general has for domestic markets.  </p><p>      Given the limits of government resources, why should we not establish a framework to enable rights holders to engage specific intermediaries within the Internet ecosystem to meet the challenges of online piracy and counterfeiting.  I think one of the big problems here is that, to date, the economic incentives for the big Internet companies to work against online piracy are just not there.  To be sure, there are many intermediaries that are inadvertently involved with pirate sites, and have come to the table with construction suggestions for crafting a balanced bill that will work.</p><p>      I commend the ISPs, payment processors like Mastercard who share today, and Visa, GoDaddy, who is the largest registrar of domain names, and a number of software companies who have raised reasonable concerns and are willing to work together to address them. But again, when I hear overblown claims like this bill is a, quote, \"giveaway to greedy trial lawyers or a killer of innovation and entrepreneurs, that the co-sponsors of this bill are the Internet killers,\" I become suspicious of the message as well as the messengers.</p><p>      And as one who cares deeply about the constitutional guarantees of free speech and due process, it is beyond troubling to hear hyperbolic charges that this bill will open the floodgates to government censorship.  That's simply not the world we live in.  And to guess that by establishing a means to combat theft of Internet property online we will somehow devolve into a repressive regime belittles the circumstances under which true victims of tyrannical government actually live.</p><p>      I urge everyone to set aside all the hyperbole and accusations. I'm the first to admit that I don't like or love everything about this bill.  But its very strong -- it's a very strong, solid effort to begin the process of responsibly providing the attorney general and rights holders with necessary tools to keep pace with, and ultimately to outpace, the high-tech bandits roving the Internet.  </p><p>      I believe there are still some things we can do in the legislation to avoid unintended consequences, maintain the integrity of the Internet, and preserve certain freedoms, including many of the specific suggestions made by the ranking member.  Our staffs have worked closely together to identify ways to improve this bill, and we will continue to do so.</p><p>      And I appreciate the fact that crafting a bill governing online -- the online environment  requires attention to technological details.  But I start from the premise that Internet freedom does not and cannot mean Internet lawlessness.  And that the goals of freedom and lawfulness are no more incompatible in the Internet space than they are in the physical world.</p><p>      Mr. Chairman, there's an African proverb that says when elephants fight it's the grass that suffers.  Perhaps if we refocus this debate on the ills that may befall innocent consumers who fall prey to the perils of piracy and counterfeited goods, rather than on the balance sheets of all the big companies, we can reach a worthy compromise.  I look forward to hearing from the witnesses, and engaging in ongoing dialogue as we move the bill forward.  The stakes for America and American consumers are too high to get engaged in too much hyperbole.</p><p>      Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.</p><p>      SMITH:  Thank you, Mr. Watt.  Without objection, other members' opening statements will be made a part of the record.  We welcome our distinguished panelists today, and I will now introduce them.</p><p>      Our first witness is Maria Pallante, the register of copyrights. Ms. Pallante was appointed by the librarian of Congress, Dr. James Billington, as the 12th register on June 1 of this year.  Immediately prior to that appointment, Ms. Pallante served as the acting register. As register, Ms. Pallante continues the tradition of serving as the principle advisor to Congress on matters of copyright policy.  </p><p>      Ms. Pallante has spent much of her career in the office where she previously served as the associate register for policy and international affairs, deputy general counsel, and policy advisor.  In addition, Ms. Pallante spent nearly a decade as intellectual property counsel and director of licensing for the Guggenheim Museums in New York.  She earned her law degree from George Washington University, and her bachelor's degree from Misericordia University, where she was also awarded an honorary degree of humane letters.</p><p>      Our second witness is John P. Clark, the vice president of global security and chief security officer for Pfizer.  Since joining Pfizer in 2008, Mr. Clark has been recognized as a leading authority on the threat that counterfeit medicines pose to patient health and safety. Prior to joining Pfizer, Mr. Clark served as deputy assistant secretary of U.S. Immigration and Custom Enforcement.  In that capacity, he was responsible for overall management and coordination of the agency's operation, and he served as the assistant security's principle representative to the Department of Homeland Security and to the law enforcement and intelligence communities.</p><p>      Starting as a U.S. Border Patrol agent in 1980, Mr. Clark spent more than 25 years as a law enforcement professional before retiring from public service.  A New York native, Mr. Clark received his bachelor of science degree in history from the State University of New York at Binghamton, and a master of science degree from National Louis University.  </p><p>      Before joining DOJ ...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK) </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  (OFF-MIC).</p><p>      SMITH:  Excuse me.  Our third witness is Michael O'Leary, the senior executive vice president for global policy and external affairs at the Motion Picture Association of America.  In that position, Mr. O'Leary supervises all international, federal and state affairs operations around the world for the association.  Before moving to MPAA, Mr. O'Leary served more than a dozen years at the Department of Justice, where he worked on legislative intellectual property and enforcement issues.</p><p>      During his tenure at the DOJ, he served as the deputy chief of the computer crime and intellectual property section, where he prosecuted and supervised some of the most significant domestic and international criminal and IP cases undertaken by the department. Before joining DOJ, Mr. O'Leary spent five years serving as counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee.  He grew up in Montana, is a graduate of Arizona State University and the University of Arizona school of law.</p><p>      Our fourth witness is Ms. Linda Kirkpatrick, who serves as the group head of customer performance integrity at Mastercard worldwide. In this role, Ms. Kirkpatrick is responsible for driving the strategy, development and execution of global customer compliance programs, data integrity, and dispute resolution and management.  Ms. Kirkpatrick has been with Mastercard since 1997.  She earned her bachelor of arts degree in economics, with a concentration in finance, from Manhattanville College in Purchase, New York.</p><p>      Our fifth witness is Katherine Oyama, a policy counsel for Google, where she focuses on copyright and trademark law and policy. In 2009 to early 2011, she worked in the office of the vice president as associate counsel and deputy counsel to Vice President Joseph R. Biden.  Prior to her government service, Ms. Oyama was a litigation associate with Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr, where she worked on intellectual property cases, government regulatory litigation, and pro bono matters.</p><p>      She previously worked in the media entertainment practice of a New York-based strategy consulting firm, for the Silicon Valley-based Internet startup LoudCloud, Inc., and for the Texas-based company Electronic Data Systems.  Ms. Oyama is a graduate of Smith College, where she graduated with honors in government, and the University of Cal at Berkeley school of law, where she served as senior articles editor of the Berkeley Technology Law Journal.</p><p>      Our final witness is Paul Almeida, the president of the Department of Professional Employees of the AFL-CIO.  Mr. Almeida has served as president of the DPE since February 2001.  Prior to his tenure with DPE, Mr. Almeida served as president of the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers for seven years. Mr. Almeida earned his degree in engineering from Franklin Institute in Boston, and he resides in Arlington, Massachusetts.</p><p>      We welcome you all.  Every member of the panel will have five minutes to give their testimony.  And we have a light on the table to indicate when that time is about to expire and has expired.  Again, we welcome you.</p><p>      And Ms. Pallante, we'll begin with you.</p><p>      PALLANTE:  Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to appear today.  And I would also like to thank you, Ranking Member Conyers, Chairman Goodlatte, Ranking Member Watt of the subcommittee, and all of the members of the committee for your continued leadership on copyright policy.</p><p>Congress has updated the Copyright Act many times in the past 200 years, including the enforcement provisions.  But as we all know, this work is never finished.  Infringers today are sophisticated and they are bold.  They blatantly stream and disseminate books, music, films and software through Web sites using the services of trusted search engines, advertising networks, and credit card companies.</p><p>      This is not a problem that we can accept.  In my view, it is about the rule of law on the Internet.  Much of the bill employs a strategy of follow the money.  I testified in support of this approach in March, and I still agree that it is an important part of the equation.  Many sites make money by selling illegal access to copyrighted works or by offering related advertising.</p><p>      But the approach does have some limitations.  Many of the worst sites do not sell infringing content.  They offer it for free.  And they do not run ads.  I would like to offer an example involving Google, but I would first like to say that I have a great deal of respect for Google and I cannot imagine the Internet without it. However, if you conduct a search for the phrase \"download movies,\" Google search engine will supply the words for free.</p><p>      And it will return a list of sites that offer illegal copies or streams at no charge and with no advertising.  These cases require a different kind of strategy than follow the money.  The same is true when damage is imminent, for example when a site is streaming live sporting events or selling movies before they have been released to the public.</p><p>      In the context of foreign infringing sites, the bill addresses this problem by giving the Department of Justice the power to require search engines to dismantle direct hyperlinks and to require service providers to block the access of subscribers within the United States. These actions require court approval, and incorporate the existing legal standards of seizure and civil forfeiture law.  These are the same standards that ICE has used effectively for Operation In Our Sights.</p><p>      Mr. Chairman, I do not want to suggest that blocking Web sites is a small step.  It is not.  And the public interest groups that oppose this part of the bill are right to be concerned about unintended consequences.  However, it may ultimately come down to a question of philosophy for Congress.  If the attorney general is chasing 21st century infringers, what kinds of tools does Congress want to provide, how broad, and how flexible?</p><p>      The bill also gives copyright owners some tools, but these do not involve search engines or ISPs, and I think that this is the right calibration.  Put another way, the bill reflects the fact that many industries contribute to the success of the Internet, and it properly distinguishes between the actions that law enforcement and private citizens can bring.</p><p>      One of the more interesting aspects of the bill is that before authors or other copyright owners can seek court orders it requires them to alert payment processors and ad networks about infringing content, and requests that they sever financial ties.  This approach creative, and it provides incentives for the parties to cooperate.  It also allows for counter-notification.</p><p>      However, whether the notification system is ultimately effective will largely depend upon whether it can be implemented in a manner that is clear and fair for all involved.  The intermediaries at issue are running businesses in good faith, and the Web sites at issue are entitled to due process.  The bill does incorporate due process where court orders are involved.  The notification system would operate outside the purview of a court, and therefore it may benefit from further due process review.  </p><p>      Finally, I do not believe it is the intent of the bill to negate the safe harbors of the DMCA, and I do read it that way.  Nothing subjects ISPs to liability for their acts or their failures to act. No monetary relief can be obtained.  And the injunctive relief permitted by the bill appears to be consistent with what the DMCA already permits.</p><p>      This said, the bill has many moving parts.  And I note that a number of stakeholders with differing perspectives have offered productive suggestions.  As the committee works to refine the bill, I would encourage you to fully consider these suggestions.  However, in closing, I would also like to state that I believe that Congress has a responsibility to protect the exclusive rights of copyright owners. And I hope that you will advance the bill with this in mind.</p><p>      Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>SMITH:  Thank you, Ms. Pallante.</p><p>      Mr. Clark?</p><p>      CLARK:  Chairman Smith, Ranking Member Conyers, distinguished members of the committee ...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK) </p><p>      WATT:  Can you pull the mic a little bit closer, please, or cut it on?</p><p>      CLARK:  It's a pleasure to appear before you today to discuss the threat that counterfeits (sic) medicines pose to the health and safety of patients in the United States and around the world.  It's a global issue.</p><p>      As vice president of global security for Pfizer, I work to mitigate the threat that counterfeit medicines pose to the health and safety of patients who rely on Pfizer medicines to live healthier and longer lives.  I commend the chairman, the ranking member, and the committee for co-sponsoring the Stop Online Piracy Act for their legislative effort.  It's a positive step forward in our fight against counterfeit medicines.  </p><p>      Counterfeit medicines pose a threat because of the conditions under which they are manufactured, in unlicensed, unregulated sites, frequently under unsanitary conditions.  In many instances, they contain none of the active pharmaceutical ingredients found in authentic medicine or in incorrect dosages, depriving patients of the therapeutic benefits of the incorrect -- of the medicine prescribed by their physicians.</p><p>      In others, they may contain toxic ingredients, such as heavy metals, arsenic, pesticides, rat poison, brick dust, floor wax, leaded highway paint, and even sheet rock or wallboard.  Counterfeit medicines are a global problem, and I'm pleased to share our experience in combating them and how the Stop Online Piracy Act aims to strengthen the U.S. arsenal.</p><p>      Pfizer has implemented an aggressive anti-counterfeiting that attacks counterfeits at their source.  Since 2004, we've prevented more than 138 million dosages of counterfeit Pfizer medicines alone, more than 68 million finished dosages, and enough active pharmaceutical ingredient to manufacture another 70 million from reaching global patients.</p><p>      Additional raids by law enforcement, based on evidence we have provided, have also resulted in seizures of millions of dosages of counterfeits marketed by other major pharmaceutical companies.  In the United States, we work closely with ICE, the FBI and FDA on their investigations, and with customs and border protection to improve their ability to prevent counterfeit Pfizer medicines from reaching U.S. patients.</p><p>      While the true scope of the counterfeit problems is hard to estimate, we have confirmed that counterfeit Pfizer medicines have been found and seized in at least 101 countries, and have reached the supply chains in 53 countries.  Technology has created a new front in this battle.  Today, the major threat to patients in the U.S. are the many professional-looking Web sites that promise safe, FDA-approved, branded medicines from Canada or the U.K.</p><p>      And for that reason, we appreciate the chairman and ranking member's focus on the threat in Title 1 of the bill, giving the attorney general new tools and incentivizing private stakeholders to act against rogue Web sites.  With immunity in place for every stakeholder's  action, it would be an important step forward. Patients don't realize that many of the Web sites don't disclose the true source of the products they dispense, or even where their -- the alleged dispensing online pharmacy is located.</p><p>      In such instances, the World Health Organization has estimated that patients have more than a 50 percent chance of receiving a counterfeit medicine.  I happen to believe that -- that's a very low estimate.  I'd like to share two short case studies.  The first is RX North (ph).  Patients who visited RX North's Web site thought they were ordering from a Canadian pharmacy, and would receive authentic FDA-approved medicines.</p><p>      In reality, the medicines dispensed from RX North (ph) were traced from China, where they were manufactured, through Hong Kong, on to Dubai, into the U.K., where they were intercepted.  Among the medicines seized by U.K. customs were Lipitor, found to contain only 82 percent to 86 percent of the active pharmaceutical ingredient, which is an incredibly high number for most counterfeits -- as well as counterfeit versions of medicines from four other companies, including one found to contain trace -- traces of metal.</p><p>      Second is the case of Kevin Xu, convicted of misbranding drugs and trafficking in counterfeit goods.  It demonstrates how attractive a target the U.S. supply chain is for those who counterfeit our medicines, and how weak our current penalties for counterfeiting medicine are.  During meetings with our undercover consultant, Xu boasted of the global scope of his criminal enterprise.</p><p>      He offered a list of branded counterfeit medicines that he could provide, including five Pfizer medicines.  The evidence we gathered was shared with an ICE investigation of Xu.  An order placed by an ICE undercover agent was filled with only -- with a counterfeit.  When the tablets were tested, they were found to contain an insignificant levels of the active pharmaceutical ingredient found in the authentic medicine.</p><p>      Xu was sentenced to just 78 months in federal prison without parole, the maximum sentence under the applicable U.S. sentencing guideline range.  This punishment does not reflect the seriousness of the crime.  The Stop Online Piracy Act takes a positive step toward making these penalties even tougher.</p><p>      Pharmaceutical counterfeiting is a low-risk, high-profit criminal activity that has attracted drug traffickers, firearms smugglers and terrorists.  One of the principle players in the 2003 Lipitor breach here in the U.S. was a convicted cocaine trafficker.  In 2006, the U.S. attorney for the eastern district of Michigan announced the indictment of 19 people who gave a portion of their profits from the sale of counterfeit Viagra to Hezbollah.</p><p>      Those who counterfeit medicines are confident that even if caught they'll get just a slap on the wrist.  Even here in the U.S., the maximum sentence imposed under the Food and Drug Cosmetics Act is just three years.  Recognizing the inherent risks that any counterfeit medicine poses to patients, we must enhance the penalties for pharmaceutical counterfeiting to provide a greater deterrent.  </p><p>      Expedited procedures must be in place to shut down rogue Web sites dispensing counterfeit medicines to the U.S.   The Stop Online Piracy Act is a significant step forward in those efforts, and I thank the chairman and ranking member for introducing this important piece of legislation.  I'd like to work with you so that our laws recognize the grave health and safety risks posed by counterfeit medicines, and serve as a deterrent.</p><p>      I work with foreign government representatives in the global fight against counterfeiting.  It's hypocritical for us to speak with foreign government representatives, as I often do, about their lack of effective legislation when U.S. law is still lacking.  This bill, if enacted with strong penalties and mechanisms to shut down rogue Web sites, will be highly effective in our global argument for all governments to fully appreciate the serious health and safety aspects of this problem, and encourage similar efforts around the world.</p><p>      Thank you again for this opportunity to express my views.  For Pfizer, pharmaceutical counterfeiting is first and foremost an issue of patient health and safety.  We look forward to working with you on the global fight against counterfeit medicines.  Thank you.</p><p>SMITH:  Thank you, Mr. Clark.</p><p>      Mr. O'Leary?      O'LEARY:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Conyers, Chairman Goodlatte, and Ranking Member Watt, distinguished members of the committee.  I'm  honored to be here, and thank you for holding this important hearing.  I also want to thank you for introducing this legislation, which will help protect American creativity and American jobs from thieves who hide overseas and seek to profit off the hard work of people in this country.</p><p>      I also want to acknowledge my fellow panelists.  I'm pleased to be here with all of them today, and look forward to working with them throughout this process.  I want to particularly acknowledge the contributions of Ms. Kirkpatrick and Mastercard.  As the chairman alluded to earlier,  they are truly a fine example of a corporation trying to make the Internet a safe marketplace for people all over the world.  And frankly, their example is one to be followed.</p><p>      Critics would have you, as Mr. Watt alluded to, believe that this is a battle between two giant corporations.  And there's certainly a lot of truth to that.  But I'm also very proud to be part of a wide- ranging coalition that includes the AFL-CIO, who we'll hear from shortly. Members of the Chamber of Commerce, big business, small business, individual creators, and entrepreneurs.  So I think critics would have you believe that this bill is really about supporting Hollywood and -- and things like that.</p><p>      But the truth of the matter, when you look behind the rhetoric and the hyperbole, is that it goes -- intellectual property is something which affects every facet of the American economy.  And it affects people all over the country.  In cases of the industry that I represent, the American Motion Picture and Television industry, we believe that these jobs are worth protecting.  They're more fully detailed in my written testimony, but I would just mention a few.</p><p>      There are people like Dan Lemieux, who's a stunt coordinator from Michigan.  He's worked on numerous films, television shows like Nip Tuck, The Shield.  The industry includes over 95,000 small businesses. They employ 10 people or less.  Businesses like Fletcher Camera, which is in Chicago.  They have 25 employees in that small business, and they provide movie equipment for productions that occur all over the -- all over the Midwest.</p><p>      There are hundreds of thousands of businesses that provide services to productions.  There's a small paint and decorating firm in Baltimore, Maryland.  It's a fifth-generation, family-run operation and it has supplied paint for virtually every major production which has occurred in the mid-Atlantic region over the past few years.</p><p>      I want to be very clear with this committee that hard work, innovation and creativity are not solely the province of people who live in northern California.  There are people all over this country who contribute to the economy every day, who contribute to our culture, who contribute to what we make creatively.  And their jobs are just as important and just as worth protecting as anyone else's.</p><p>      And that's why we think this bill is so important.  Because it's a positive step in that direction.  In this economic climate, we simply cannot afford to turn our back on any industry which is coming forward and producing things that are -- that we can take all over the world and be successful with.  Our industry competes.</p><p>      When we are given an opportunity to compete globally, we succeed. Where we have trouble, frankly, Mr. Chairman, is where we don't have an opportunity to compete fairly.  And one of the problems we have is competing with people who are trying to steal our stuff.  We're not before the Congress looking for a handout or a bailout.  We're simply asking for an opportunity to stop from stealing the products that we make.</p><p>      In recent weeks, you've heard a lot of spurious arguments about this legislation.  They've been chronicled in a number of the opening remarks.  That it violates the First Amendment, that it undermines existing (inaudible) and protection law, that it somehow stifles innovation, and it will, yes, break the Internet.  I irony, of course, of that argument is that I believe it was first heard -- it was first raised by those opposing the DMCA many years ago, as the chairman will recall.</p><p>      and I believe some of those same people are here today opposing this bill because they think it will undermine the DMCA.  So there's a bit of irony there which seems to be lost inside the Beltway.  But I suspect that outside the Beltway, people see it for what it is.  These -- these allegations that you're hearing are simply taken from the playbook of those people who have consistently opposed every effort that the Congress has come forward with in the last few years to protect intellectual property.</p><p>      The good news is, is that every time Congress protects intellectual property the Internet flourishes.  Every time the United States stands up for legitimacy over illegitimacy the Internet gets bigger and stronger.  More things are available to consumers, more products are available to consumers, we make more movies, they see more television.  </p><p>      Protecting legitimacy is a positive thing for the economy and for innovation, and people that tell you otherwise are wrong.  They've been wrong when they've been raising these -- these arguments for the past two decades, and they're wrong in the context of this bill.  What you understand so clearly, Mr. Chairman, is that the Stop Online Piracy -- and the Stop Online Piracy Act reflects this -- is that there is a very great difference between legitimate marketplace and the illicit sites and services that we are talking about.</p><p>      The legitimate market is protected against the threat -- when the legitimate market is protected against the threat of online theft, the only people who lose are those that do not work, take no risk, make no investment.  And said, those are the people that simply try to profit off the hard work of others.</p><p>      We've also heard arguments that Congress should limit its approach to the threat of rogue sites to, quote, \"following the money.\"  It's worth noting that whoever usually makes that argument is really saying you should follow someone else's money.  If we are, in fact, going to follow the money -- which is something we should do -- we should follow all of the money, not just some of it.</p><p>      Piracy is a complex problem that can't be fixed in piecemeal solutions, but this bill is an important first step in trying to deal with what is a very real and growing threat.  This is fundamentally about jobs and about protecting the jobs that Americans have creating products that are enjoyed all over the world.</p><p>      Ultimately, someone once said that to lead is to choose.  And the bill, Mr. Chairman, that you put before the Congress in this debate is one which provides a number of choices.  It's a choice between illegal and legitimate.  It's a choice between a safe, vibrant Internet for everyone in a black market Internet.  It's a -- it's a choice between protecting American creativity and jobs, or protecting thieves.</p><p>      These are simple choices, from our perspective, and with the leadership that's been provided by this committee we look forward to this process of debating this bill and putting something on the president's desk that both Republicans and Democrats can support. And, at the end of the day, will allow these hardworking Americans to keep their job and keep creating the products that the world enjoys. Thank you.</p><p>SMITH:  Thank you, Mr. O'Leary.  </p><p>      Ms. Kirkpatrick?</p><p>      KIRKPATRICK:  Thank you.  Good morning, Chairman Smith, Ranking Member Conyers, and members of the committee.  My name is Linda Kirkpatrick and I am group head, franchise development, customer performance integrity at Mastercard wide -- worldwide, in Purchase, New York.  </p><p>      Mastercard commends the committee on its attention to the issue of Internet-based infringement, including the work that went into H.R. 3261, the Stop Online Piracy Act.  We greatly appreciate the opportunity to be here today, and look forward to working with you to combat this critical issue.  </p><p>      Mastercard's rules and requirements prohibit the use of its system for any illegal purposes, including for the sale of products or services that infringe on intellectual property rights.  Mastercard recognizes the important role it plays in combating this issue, and has taken a number of steps that demonstrate its commitment to this important cause.</p><p>      These efforts which are discussed in my written testimony, including publishing the Mastercard antipiracy policy, which sets out the specific process by which Mastercard and rights holders can work together to identify and prevent the sale of infringing products or services, working with the White House's Office of U.S. Intellectual Property Enforcement coordinator in the development of industry best practices to address online infringement, and the implementation and maintenance of Mastercard's business risk assessment and mitigation program, otherwise known as our brand program.</p><p>      By way of background, Mastercard operates a global payment system that connects over 1 billion cardholders and millions of merchants worldwide to complete Mastercard-branded payment transactions. Mastercard neither issues payment cards to cardholders, nor does it contract with merchants to accept payment cards.  Rather, Mastercard's financial institution customers issue payment cards to cardholders and/or contract with merchants to accept the cards.</p><p>      The card-issuing customers are known as \"issuer.\"  Those customers that contract with merchants for card acceptance are commonly called \"acquirers.\"  Each cardholder's account relationship is with the issuer that issued the card to the cardholder, and each merchant's acceptance relationship is with its acquirer.  </p><p>      Mastercard has a long history of working with law enforcement, private stakeholders, its customers and others to address illegal or otherwise brand-damaging activities that may involve the Mastercard payment system or the unauthorized use of our widely-recognized family of payment brands.  Our commitment to working with rights holders to prevent the Mastercard system from being used to facilitate online infringement is evidenced by our industry-leading antipiracy policy, which is publicly available on our Internet site.</p><p>      In accordance with that policy, Mastercard has established procedures that apply when a law enforcement entity or rights holder brings to Mastercard's attention evidence of alleged infringement.  We have a established an e-mail address for the submission of such requests and a set of information requirements for such requests which are largely similar to the information required of rights holders in H.R. 3261.</p><p>      The process we have implemented was developed collaboratively through strong working relationships with rights holders and their trade associations, and has led to the investigation of thousands of Internet sites and the termination of hundreds of rogue merchants. Mastercard has also worked closely with the White House's Office of the U.S. Intellectual Property Enforcement coordinator in the development of a best practices document to address online infringement. </p><p>      Development of the best practices document involved input from a wide variety of stakeholders, including numerous representatives from the rights holder community, payment networks, and other parties involved in online commerce.  The best practices are designed to assist rights holders in protecting their intellectual property through a voluntary system, and in no way diminished the ability of rights holders to take independent action to enforce their intellectual property rights.</p><p>      Our business risk assessment and mitigation program, or brand program, is another key component of Mastercard's corporate efforts to preserve the integrity of Mastercard payment system and protect against illegal and brand-damaging transactions.  More specifically, the brand program serves to restrict access to the Mastercard system by merchants whose products and services may pose significant fraud, regulatory, or legal risks.</p><p>      The brand program was created to enforce Mastercard rules prohibiting acquirers from engaging in, or supporting, any merchant activity that is illegal or that may damage the goodwill of Mastercard or reflect negatively on the Mastercard brand.  Merchant activities that infringe upon the intellectual property rights of another are expressly covered on the -- under the protocols of the brand program.</p><p>      Mastercard is fully committed to continuing to address this important issue.  As the committee moves forward with legislation, Mastercard believes it is essential to ensure that any obligations imposed on payment systems are capable of being readily implemented through reasonable policies and procedures, and that payment systems be shielded from litigation and liability when acting in accordance with the bill's requirements.</p><p>      In my written testimony, we have offered a few general comments on the bill along those lines that we believe are consistent with the committee's objectives,  I look forward to answering any questions that you may have.  Thank you..</p><p>SMITH:  Thank you, Ms. Kirkpatrick.</p><p>      And Ms. Oyama?</p><p>      OYAMA:  Thank you.  Chairman Smith, Ranking Member Conyers, members of the committee, thank you so much for the opportunity to testify today, not just on behalf of Google, but also on behalf of the Consumer Electronics Association, CCIA, Net Coalition, TechNet, TechAmerica, which together represent thousands of companies.</p><p>      Google takes the problem of online piracy and counterfeiting very seriously.  We devote our best engineering talent, and tens of millions of dollars every year, to fight it.  In the last year alone, we have spent more than $60 million to weed out bad actors from our ad services.  We have shut down nearly 150,000 AdWords accounts, mostly based on our own detection efforts.  And so far this year, we've processed 5 million DMCA take-down requests, targeting nearly 5 million items.  </p><p>      We are as motivated as anyone to get this right, but the Stop Online Piracy Act is not the right approach.  SOPA would undermine the legal, commercial and cultural architecture that has propelled the extraordinary growth of Internet commerce over the past decade, a sector that has grown to $2 trillion in annual U.S. GDP, including $300 billion from online advertising.</p><p>      Virtually every major Internet company, from Twitter to Facebook, Yahoo! and eBay, as well as a diverse array of other groups, from venture capitalists to librarians to musicians have expressed serious concerns about this bill.  Unfortunately, this legislation is overbroad.  It undermines the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which has for more than a decade struck a balance.</p><p>      The DMCA provides copyright owners with immediate recourse when they discover infringement online, while also giving service providers the certainty that they need to invest in the products on which millions of Americans rely.  The bill sweeps in innocent Web sites that have violated no law.  It imposes harsh and arbitrary sanctions without due process.</p><p>      The following example shows how the bill, as currently written, would work.  Imagine a Web site, let's call it Dave's Online Emporium, which enables small businesses to sell clothing and accessories.  More than 99 percent of the sellers on Dave's Emporium are entirely legitimate.  But, unbeknownst to Dave, one seller has started selling counterfeit bags and T-shirts that -- that parody a copyrighted design. </p><p>      Dave's Emporium takes great care to comply with copyright laws, including take-down procedures, including repeat infringement provisions of the DMCA.  But under the Stop Online Piracy Act the entire site could be deemed, quote, \"dedicated to theft\" based on the violations of this single seller, and the whole business effectively shut down.  Just about any private party, a corporation, a copyright troll, someone with an axe to grind could send a notice to payment and advertising companies to terminate services to the site without first involving law enforcement or triggering any judicial process.</p><p>      The complaining party has no duty to contact Dave's Emporium directly to resolve the issue before going straight to ads and payment services to terminate his service.  If the Emporium fails to respond with a counter-notice within five days Dave's site could effectively be put out of business.  </p><p>      Facing these potential risks, Dave might think twice about establishing his Online Emporium in the first place.  Countless Web sites of all kinds -- commercial, social, personal -- could be shuttered or put out of business based on allegations that may or may not be valid.  And the resulting cloud of legal uncertainty would threaten new investment, entrepreneurship and innovation.</p><p>      In a new study of venture capitalists released today, more than 80 percent said that the Safe Harbor provisions of digital copyright laws are essential. Weakening those Safe Harbor provisions would have a recession-like impact on new investment.  And at the same time, this proposed law imposes new and unclear obligations on Internet service providers to take, quote, \"technically feasible and reasonable measures to block access to sites to remove them from search results,\" turning these providers into de facto Web censors.</p><p>      This won't work.  As long as there's money to be made pushing pirated and counterfeit products, tech-savvy criminals around the world will find ways to sell these products online.  And ordering ISPs and search engines to disappear Web sites from the Internet will not change this fundamental reality.  We urge you instead to target the problem at the source.  Shut down illegal foreign sites by cutting off their revenue.</p><p>      We support legislation that builds on the DMCA.  Our proposal would empower the Justice Department to target foreign sites that violate current law.  And a court could then order advertisers and payment services, in which our services would be included, to cut off ads and payments to those sites.  Google has been working with the committee on such a solution for over six months, and we will continue to do so.      When all is said and done, we must address online piracy effectively in ways that continue to allow the Internet to drive this economy and this country forward.  Thank you.</p><p>SMITH:  Thank you, Ms. Oyama.</p><p>      Mr. Almeida?</p><p>      ALMEIDA:  Good morning, Chairman Smith, Ranking Member Conyers, and distinguished members of the committee.  My name is Paul Almeida. I'm the president of the Department for Professional Employees, a coalition of 22 national unions affiliated with the AFL-CIO.  I am honored to speak today on behalf of the 4 million professional and technical people whom are affiliated unions represent.  </p><p>      Those people include creators, performers and craftspeople in arts, entertainment and media, professional and technical people in education, health care and public administration, in aerospace and other manufacturing, in pharmaceuticals, science, engineering, information technology and in professional sports.</p><p>      The people I represent work in a wide range of occupations and industries.  They share a wide range of interests as workers and consumers, as well as ardent defenders of the First Amendment.  On their behalf, permit me to commend you and thank you.  Their unions unanimously support the Stop Online Piracy Act, as does the entire AFL-CIO.</p><p>      My message is simple.  It has three parts.  First, strengthening protections for U.S. intellectual property helps American workers, jobs, incomes and benefits.  Second, counterfeit goods endanger workers, both as workers and consumers.  Third, there is no inconsistency between protecting free speech and an open Internet and safeguarding intellectual property.</p><p>      If the United States allows the tax on intellectual property to go unanswered it puts good livelihoods at risk.  Online access continues to accelerate and expand.  It increasingly displaces tradition models for distributing content, and thus heightens the potential for digital theft.  Estimates of the number of jobs lost to digital theft in arts, entertainment, and the media sector alone run in the hundreds of thousands.  </p><p>      Losses of income arise because entertainment professionals depend on compensation at two points.  First, when the professionals do the work, and later when the reuse of the intellectual property. Royalties and residuals from downstream revenues enable entertainment professionals to survive between projects.  In manufacturing, the estimates of losses from counterfeits also run in the billions. Again, the victims include workers who face lost jobs and income.</p><p>      We should not allow rogue Web sites to facilitate the distribution of counterfeit goods.  My second point, counterfeits endanger workers as workers and as consumers.  Only last week, the Senate Committee on Armed Services heard about an astonishing extent of counterfeit electronic parts in the military supply chain. Counterfeits kill.</p><p>      When protective vests are fake, soldiers and police officers can die.  When prescription drugs are fake patients can die.  And when smoke detectors are fake homeowners and firefighters can die.  In may, the Atlanta, Georgia fire and rescue department recalled roughly 18,500 smoke detectors that it distributed for a free Atlanta smoke alarm program.  The smoke detectors were counterfeit, and so were the Underwriter Laboratory seals.  </p><p>      An alert from the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission noted the unreliable counterfeit alarms pose a life-safety hazard to the occupants in the event of a fire.  Counterfeit smoke detectors pose a life-safety hazard not just to homeowners, but to firefighters. Harold Schaitberger, general president of the International Association of Firefighters, another union affiliated with DPE, wrote to Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Conyers to support the Stop Online Piracy Act.</p><p>      President Schaitberger noted that \"the preparedness and safety of our members depends on reliable equipment.\"  A blog called Techdirt.com posted a defamatory response.  \"Who does the MPAA actually think it's fooling.  Is Congress so stupid that it can't figure out for itself that firefighters have no clue what the debate is about?\"  The blog accused firefighters of supporting censorship. It implied the only reason the firefighters spoke up was because the MPAA was paying off  the union.  Firefighters know the consequences of counterfeit equipment. </p><p>      My third point, freedom of speech is not the same as lawlessness on the Internet.  Protecting intellectual property is not the same as censorship.  The First Amendment does not protect stealing goods off trucks.  I mentioned earlier that the people whom I represent today include ardent defenders of the First Amendment.  Newspaper and broadcast journalists, radio broadcasters, newswriters, scriptwriters, and many others in the arts and entertainment and media, when they oppose wage theft there is no inconsistency with the First Amendment.</p><p>      Digital theft and rogue Web sites diminishes incentives to invest, and leads to a downward spiral for U.S. workers in our economy.  That's the bad news.  The good news is that you are taking action.  The professional and technical workers and their unions, whom I represent, look forward to your passing the Stop Online Piracy Act. Thank you.</p><p>SMITH:  Thank you, Mr. Almeida.</p><p>      I'll recognize myself for questions.  And Ms. Pallante, let me direct a couple questions to you.  In your prepared written statement, you said, quote, \"If Congress does nothing to provide serious responses to online piracy, the U.S. copyright system will ultimately fail,\" end quote.  Now what did you mean by that?</p><p>      PALLANTE:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Yes, I don't think that's an overstatement.  The system that we have for copyright, and have had since 1790, is based on a system of exclusive rights which authors can license and which publishers and producers can invest.  And then distribute and otherwise bring to life for consumers not only here, but through reciprocal agreements with foreign countries.</p><p>      If those exclusive rights cannot be meaningfully enforced and can be usurped in a lawless environment, they will become meaningless. And if Congress does not update the piracy laws, as it has done consistently for many, many years, many decades, hundreds of years ...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK) </p><p>SMITH:  I -- I think you just anticipated my next question, which was going to be do you think the legal system has all the tools it needs now to combat the infringing Web sites?</p><p>      PALLANTE:  I don't.  I think that this is a timely hearing.  I think Congress has done and excellent job of intervening when technology outpaces the law.  It did that in the NET Act, it did that in the ART Act, and I think that this is similar legislation.  We're looking at a situation where very sophisticated and very smart and very blatant infringers will leap to offshore locations so that they can direct infringing goods, which often belong to our companies, back to American consumers.  </p><p>      They're outside the jurisdiction of our courts.  We're not suggesting that we would intervene in domestic courts in foreign countries.  What we are saying is that we should have some response to allowing them to do that with impunity.</p><p>SMITH:  OK.  Thank you, Ms. Pallante.</p><p>      Ms. Oyama, let me direct a couple questions to you.  And first, let me say that you spoke a lot of the right words today.  We've heard those words before.  And I only hope that your company and other simpler -- other similar companies will practice what you preached. And that, we will wait to see. </p><p>      Let me ask you a couple questions.  You do acknowledge that there is a severe problem, I gather, with the theft of intellectual property by foreign criminals.</p><p>      OYAMA:  That's a problem that we take extremely seriously.  We have hundreds of employees that work on it.</p><p>SMITH:  And I believe you agree that if we cut off access to American consumers and U.S. dollars that that will decrease the amount of intellectual property theft, as well.</p><p>      OYAMA:  We think cutting off the money is a very effective solution.  The sites are in business because they profit.</p><p>SMITH:  OK.  Now, in -- particularly in regard to Google, do you think Google should stop returning search results for foreign sites that are breaking U.S. law?</p><p>      OYAMA:  Under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, a rights holder could come directly to Google, would not need to go to court. And they could alert us of the foreign infringement.</p><p>SMITH:  Well, a ...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK) </p><p>      OYAMA:  And we would remove that.</p><p>SMITH:  A lot of people don't think the DMCA is sufficient, including the registrar of copyrights.  Do you think we should go beyond that to try to stop returning the search results for foreign sites?</p><p>      OYAMA:  Thank you for the question.  I think there's a lot of misperception about what it and what isn't ...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK) </p><p>SMITH:  No, no.  I was asking a specific question here.  Should Google stop returning search results for foreign sites that are breaking U.S. law?</p><p>      OYAMA:  We do, when notified by rights holder.  We've done that more than 5 million times.</p><p>SMITH:  So the -- the answer is yes, then.</p><p>      OYAMA:  Yes</p><p>SMITH:  OK, thank you.  Another question is this.  Should Google stop placing ads on illegal sites that are stealing American intellectual property?</p><p>      OYAMA:  Our policies prohibit that.  We've proactively ejected more than 12,000 sites this year.</p><p>SMITH:  OK.  And so you would agree not to either facilitate nor place ads on illegal sites that are stealing U.S. property.</p><p>      OYAMA:  If a site is violating the law we would eject them for our system, and we do that.</p><p>SMITH:  OK.  Again, I hope you can practice what you preach today.  That would be a major -- a major breakthrough.  It seems to me -- and let me just conclude in this way -- that Google and other companies really have a decision to make.  And I hope they will make the right decision.  I hope they will decide to help other American companies.  It's not necessarily going to benefit Google or some of your allies, but I hope you will decide to help American companies protect their intellectual property from being infringed by foreign criminals.</p><p>      And that is, I know, a decision that you all are having to make and weigh.  I acknowledge, and regret to a large extent, that if you make the right decision that is going to mean you're going to have to give up some of the revenue you might get from some of those ads that are actually on the infringing Web sites themselves.  That's a decision for you all to make, but I think you can make the right one there.        I simply hope that you, and others, will decide to do what's good for American -- for other American companies, do what's good for American jobs, and do what's good for  American economy, as well.  But thank you for your testimony.</p><p>      The gentleman from -- the gentleman from California, Mr. Berman, is recognized for 5 minutes.</p><p>      BERMAN:  Well, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and Ranking Member Conyers.  And I'd like to thank the chairman for responding to my letter inviting Google to testify.  I think it's important to under -- understand what legitimate issues the opposition may have so they can be addressed.  </p><p>      I haven't heard concrete changes they would recommend.  I haven't received a Google proposal or suggested proposal on -- focusing on foreign rogue Web sites, and would love to see it's apparently been discussed with the committee.  </p><p>      Opponents of the legislation say, \"We support the bill's stated goals, and ask that sponsors consider more targeted ways to combat foreign rogue Web sites.  That's the response to every idea put forward to stop theft.  Why isn't this the time for the tech community to put forward concrete and specific proposals that will efficiently combat the theft that takes place on the Internet.  </p><p>      The rhetoric around this bill is over the top.  None of the sponsors of this bill are against the First Amendment, none of the sponsors of this bill want to shut down the Internet, and none of the sponsors want to stymie technology.  Perhaps the first example that I'll focus on is opponents claiming that the legislation will undermine U.S. foreign policy and encourage repression by foreign governments.  </p><p>      I wrote Secretary Clinton and asked her opinion.  She clearly, forcefully -- she clearly and forcefully said there is no contradiction between intellectual property rights protection and enforcement ensuring freedom of expression on the Internet.  In other words, we can adopt legislation like H.R. 3261 to better protect U.S. intellectual property online, at the same time demand that foreign governments respect Internet freedom.</p><p>      And I'd like to submit those records -- those letters for the record.  </p><p>SMITH:  No, so objection.</p><p>      BERMAN:  I'm going to -- based on your answers to Mr. Smith's question, I'd like to -- to follow up.  I thought I heard you say, in response to the chairman's question, that Google does not link to pirate Web sites.</p><p>      OYAMA:  Under the DMCA procedures that Congress set out, a rights holder can notify Google about foreign infringement and we would remove it.      BERMAN:  All right.  Well, explain to me this one.  The Pirate Bay is a notorious pirate site, a fact that its founders proudly proclaim in the name of the site itself.  In fact, the site's operators have been criminally convicted in European.  One has apparently fled to Cambodia.  It is being blocked by court order in at least Italy, Denmark, Belgium, Ireland and Finland.  </p><p>      And yet Google continues to send U.S. customers, or at least I don't know what you're doing this morning, but -- but before this morning 'cause maybe you can read my mind -- U.S. Google continues to send U.S. consumers to the site by linking to the site in your search results.  Why do you do this?  Requiring copyright owners to send thousands upon thousands of notice -- of notices for individual torrent links to the Pirate Bay, only to have those same files reappear on the system when Google calls the Pirate Bay again?</p><p>      We all know that this is a notoriously egregious pirate site. Why does Google refuse to deindex the site in your search results?</p><p>      OYAMA:  Copyright infringement, counterfeiting, these are issues that we take incredibly seriously.  We invest tens of millions of dollars into the problem.  We have hundreds of people around the world that work on it.  When it comes to copyright ...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK) </p><p>      BERMAN:  Why does Google refuse to deindex the site in your search results?</p><p>      OYAMA:  We will immediately -- if we're notified by a rights holder, we would remove the link from our search results to the Pirate Bay.  We've done that over 5 million times this year.  When it's a copyright ...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK) </p><p>      BERMAN:  You -- you -- you remove the link to a particular item.</p><p>      OYAMA:  Exactly.</p><p>      BERMAN:  Why don't you refuse to deindex the site in your search results?</p><p>      OYAMA:  The procedures that Congress set out under the DMCA ensure that today, with ...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK) </p><p>      BERMAN:  Would it make sense to have a law that allowed you to -- if that's -- if the DMCA doesn't go far enough, a law that essentially told you that's what you should do in response to dealing with a clearly established rogue Web site that -- that flaunts it in every possible way?</p><p>      OYAMA:  So we have no idea of knowing if a given search result is infringing or is authorized.  We do need the cooperation of the rights holder to let us know.  And today, we are removing links.  We think, in terms of a legislative approach, something that goes after the real incentive for those sites to be in business makes sense..  So enhancing the DMCA and going after advertising which is our -- services and payment providers we think makes sense.  We think the DMCA ...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK) </p><p>      BERMAN:  Could -- could you -- could you draft some proposals that reflect that position so we could look at them?  I mean, I would love it if you and the Consumer Electronics Association and public knowledge in these groups would give us something specific.  You think this is -- it goes too far, it's too excessive.</p><p>      Give us something specific.  Infuse yourself with the notion of you want to stop digital theft.  What works?  And use your brilliant minds that you have in your organizations to give us some specifics because the DMCA is not going the job.  That's so obvious.</p><p>      OYAMA:  We are -- we are very interested in working with your staff, with the chairman and other members of the committee.  I do believe through Net Coalition we have provided that language, and we'd be happy to -- to follow up.  We do think -- in terms of searches that Congress got it right under the DMCA.  It leaves up legitimate content, it takes down infringing content.</p><p>      We want to make sure that when we're dealing with speech that we use a scalpel.</p><p>      BERMAN:  Well, I -- my time has expired.  But you cannot look at what is going on since the passage of the DMCA and say Congress got it just right.</p><p>      (CROSSTALK) </p><p>      OYAMA:  We agree ...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK) </p><p>      BERMAN:  ...maintain the status quo.</p><p>      OYAMA:  We (inaudible) would be useful.</p><p>SMITH:  The gentleman's time has expired.  Thank you, Mr. Berman.</p><p>      The gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. Coble, is recognized.</p><p>      COBLE:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Good to have you all with us. I've had to miss some of the hearing, Mr. Chairman, because of other meetings, but it's good to be here.  I was going to examine Ms. Pallante, but the chairman beat me to it.  I was going to examine Ms. Oyama, but Mr. Berman beat me to it.  But I'll -- I'll still try to recover.</p><p>      Ms. Obama, let me ask you this -- Ms. Oyama.  What relief does the DMCA offer to a trademark owner who is trying to prevent counterfeiters from selling things?</p><p>      OYAMA:  So for counterfeit it's dealt with a little bit differently.  For counterfeit, at Google, we will act -- do our -- for our advertising we've adjusted.  So, for example, for AdWords we've ejected over 100,000 accounts in the last year.  There is a very kind of stark difference between copyright and trademark.</p><p>Congress, so far, has not enacted a DMCA for trademark. Copyright laws are exclusive, right?  Trademarks, it depends on what geography you're in, right?  What product you can use.  Given name- specific can be used on lots of different products, and so I know there's been kind of a long-standing conversation about -- about that issue.</p><p>      Certainly, if we ever were to receive a court order about counterfeit related to search, well of course we would comply with that court order.</p><p>      COBLE:  I thank you.</p><p>      Mr. Clark -- Mr. Clark, how involved are organized criminal networks in the -- the manufacturer and distribution of counterfeit medicines?</p><p>      CLARK:  From my estimation and experience, it's -- it's a problem that's growing.  I don't think we've reached the level yet where we -- we are seeing global cartels, per se, as we do in narcotics.  But as the notoriety of the crime gets around, the profit margins are so phenomenal and the penalties on a global scale are so low, that it's a no-brainer for -- for organized crime to -- to look at this as a -- a -- a way to go.</p><p>      So it is growing.  We've seen instances of it.  Not systemic instances, but we have seen, as I just cited, the Detroit instance where money was going to Hezbollah.  We have seen drug traffickers. But I think it's -- it's growing in that capacity.</p><p>      COBLE:  Mr. Clark, what aspects of SOPA do you believe are particularly important to combating the problem of counterfeiting medicines?</p><p>      CLARK:  I apologize, Congressman.  I -- I missed the first part of that.  </p><p>      COBLE:  What aspects of SOPA, the bill before us, do you believe are particularly important to combating the problem of counterfeiting medicines?</p><p>      CLARK:  I think all aspects.  My biggest worry, Congressman, is that counterfeit medicines are still not perceived by the public, by law enforcement, by the judiciary -- our judges and prosecutors -- as a serious crime yet.  When you see somebody like Kevin Xu, who has a -- a global reputation for supplying counterfeits, it was my understanding during his undercover discussions he offered a list of counterfeit medicines.  And yet, he said if anything is on that list -- anything else off that list that you want, I can have it for you. Give me two weeks.</p><p>      We're talking cancer medicines, we're talking blood pressure medicines, we're talking Alzheimer's medicines.  And I think when we see a few tablets here or there we have a tendency not to think of the consequences those tablets bring.  A lot of people in the United States, I think, look at it and say there's no bodies in the street, nobody seems to be dying from counterfeit so it -- it can't be that serious of a crime.</p><p>      COBLE:  I got you.</p><p>      CLARK:  But when you look at people, if, at best -- if they're getting 20 percent of the active pharmaceutical ingredient in the medicines that they're taking, such as this Alzheimer's medicine that was manufactured in Turkey, manufactured in facilities such as this, where there are no conditions that -- in terms of licensing, regulatory, environmental are applied, even with just 20 percent of the -- the active ingredient, what's the other 80 percent?  </p><p>      And if there's nothing but benign chemicals in that 80 percent, they're still not going to get relieve (sic) of their disease, and they eventually die.  So my biggest worry, Congressman, is that people are dying from these counterfeits.  We just haven't figured out a way to correlate the deaths from counterfeits with -- with the problem yet.</p><p>      COBLE:  I -- thank you.  I want to beat -- I want to beat that red light that will illuminate imminently, and say to Ms. Kirkpatrick I am advised that Mastercard has been instrumental in -- in combating piracy.  And, Mr. Chairman, I think it should be noted for those who have combated particularly flagrant piracy that should be noted.</p><p>      And I thank you all for being with us, and I yield back, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>SMITH:  Thank you, Mr. Coble. </p><p>      The gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. Watt's recognized.</p><p>      WATT:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  And let me start by thanking all of the witnesses for being here today.  This is a difficult issue. This legislation raises some interesting new challenges, but circumstances are raising difficult new challenges.  Ms. Oyama, let me -- let me start with you because I want to be sure I understood your testimony. </p><p>      I got the impression that you do not object strenuously to the provisions of section 102 because they require a court order.  That your primary objections are with respect to the provisions in 103, where -- private market-based system to protect customers are involved because they don't get -- it doesn't require giving notice to the site owner, or whoever's put up the site.  Am I misstating where you are on that?</p><p>      OYAMA:  We would certainly agree the concerns about 103 are the greatest.  One, because of the scope of what ...      (CROSSTALK) </p><p>      WATT:  Well, let me -- let me -- let me separate the question. Do you have concerns with section 102?</p><p>      OYAMA:  We would be -- the legislation we support ...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK) </p><p>      WATT:  The question is, do you have concerns with section ...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK) </p><p>      OYAMA:  With some of the remedies, yes.  The ...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK) </p><p>      WATT:  Some of the remedies.  OK, and you'll -- and you'll give us that in writing so that we can evaluate those concerns.</p><p>      OYAMA:  Yes.  The ...'</p><p>      (CROSSTALK) </p><p>      WATT:  But your primary concerns are with section 103.  Is that -- am I misstating it?</p><p>      OYAMA:  I think if we got -- if we got the remedies right in 102, focused on ads and payments, the way that these sites are making money.</p><p>      WATT:  I didn't -- I'm -- I'm not trying to get you to resolve that issue about 102 today.  I -- I'm -- I'm -- I'd rather have that in writing.</p><p>      OYAMA:  Much more workable, yes.</p><p>      WATT:  Right.  But your concerns about 103 have to do with the lack of notice to the -- to the site owner, right?</p><p>      OYAMA:  Yeah, in part.  I think the ...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK) </p><p>      WATT:  OK.  So do -- is there some effective way that we could give notice to the site owner that you are aware of?  And if you could give me those suggestions in writing.  Because I have those concerns, too.  The problem is, we don't -- we don't currently have any effective way -- access to those -- to that information to give them notice, and you do I think in your system because you put up the -- you put up the site.  OK.</p><p>      Now, if you can help me with those two things we'll be far down the road.  I'm not adverse to -- to addressing your concerns.  I've indicated to that -- you -- to you, both in private and -- and I'm saying it publicly today.  Let me talk about this constitutional standard that -- and make sure that I understand where you are on that.  Because you appear to be advocating a constitutional standard that would prohibit the enforcement of any laws online.</p><p>      In your written testimony, you disagree with Professor Abrams' conclusion that it is constitutional to block access to a Web site that is primarily infringing, even though such blocking may incidentally impact protected speech.  Your written testimony won't concede that blocking a Web site that is almost entirely infringing would be -- would be constitutional. </p><p>      And you've confirmed that in what you've just said verbally here. Does that mean that you consider it unconstitutional for law enforcement to seize a child pornography site if the site also contains one copy of the King James Bible?</p><p>      OYAMA:  So the speech concerns that have been raised ...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK) </p><p>      WATT:  I -- just answer that question for me, and then I'll -- I'll go forward from there.  </p><p>      OYAMA:  There are certainly legitimate ...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK) </p><p>      WATT:  What -- what about if it contains 20 copies of the King James Bible, but it's still 90 percent child pornography?  Are you saying First Amendment rights won't allow us to do that?</p><p>      OYAMA:  I think we agree with Floyd Abrams that you need to look at the whole site.  You need to make sure that it's really dedicated to infringement.  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK) </p><p>      WATT:  OK.  Well, and -- and ...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK) </p><p>      OYAMA:  ...legitimate speech ...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK) </p><p>      WATT:  And probable cause would -- would require the attorney general's office to do that.  I mean, he's not going to go and -- and cite you unless -- or stop this process unless he's gone through that analysis.  The question is, do you think that there's something unconstitutional about taking down a site that is overwhelmingly, primarily devoted to -- to -- to stolen products?  </p><p>      And -- and I -- you know, if -- if that's -- if that's your position I think we're going to have a real problem with it.  </p><p>      OYAMA:  No, I think if -- if there was a site out there that was 100 percent terrible that's a separate issue.  The definition ...      (CROSSTALK) </p><p>      WATT:  No, I'm saying 90 percent terrible.  I'm saying 98 percent terrible.  Is it -- is 2 percent going to save this site from being taken down?</p><p>      OYAMA:  I don't think there's an exact number.  I think when you are sweeping in vast majorities of legitimate speech without notice, that raises significant questions.</p><p>      WATT:  Is that 51 percent, or is it 60 percent, or -- I mean, how -- how are we going to do this?  You're telling me I can't violate somebody's constitutional rights if it incidentally adversely impacts their -- their protected rights.  That's what you're saying.</p><p>      OYAMA:  No, I think if a site was primarily dedicated to infringement there's a lot of tools that ...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK) </p><p>      WATT:  OK, well, that's what the bill says, isn't it?</p><p>      OYAMA:  Well, we would not agree that the scope of the definition captures totally infringing sites.  We have a lot of concerns that it sweeps in legitimate ...'</p><p>      (CROSSTALK) </p><p>      WATT:  No, I didn't say totally infringing.  That --That's not what you said, either.  That's not what you said.  You said primarily infringing.  And -- and then all of a sudden you shifted over to totally infringing.  Is this a question about whether something is totally infringing or primarily infringing, or do you -- you think that both of them -- that one should be protected and one should not be protected?</p><p>      OYAMA:  I think a definition that was narrowly drawn, that has something like primarily, would be helpful.</p><p>      WATT:  OK.  So you're going to give us some language on that? My time is up.</p><p>      OYAMA:  We have a definitional ...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK) </p><p>SMITH:  The gentleman's time has expired.  Thank you, Mr. Watt.</p><p>      The gentleman from Virginia, Mr. Goodlatte, is recognized.</p><p>      GOODLATTE:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Ms. Oyama, I want to pursue that line of questioning.</p><p>      Years ago, a former chairman, Henry Hyde, put me in a room with about 30 government representatives from the content industry, from the online industry, Internet service providers, and a few that had a foot in both camps.  And we worked for months in a -- in a hot room, and came to agreement on the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and, in particular, the notice and takedown provisions which you have spoken highly of.</p><p>      And I -- I agree with you that those provisions still have a - a role in protecting online copyright.  But the Internet has changed dramatically since then.  The speeds have accelerated.  The technology is more sophisticated, search engines are more sophisticated, and the criminals who use all of that to rip off legitimate businesses of all kind are more sophisticated.   </p><p>      So as you know, and as I've said, I'm interested in making sure that this legislation gives effective tools to combat lawbreakers. But to also ensure it does not entangle legitimate online businesses or the ability of entrepreneurs to continue to bring exciting new products and services to the Internet.  Can you tell the committee the top concerns the tech community has about the bill, and your specific recommendations on how to fix those concerns within the bill?</p><p>      OYAMA:  Sure, thank you.  I think when the conversation started the idea was to target foreign rogue sites, sites that were clearly breaking the law.  And to introduce -- build on the DMCA, introduce new, harsh remedies.  That is definitely approach that we could get behind, that we would support.</p><p>      I think when the tech community now is looking at this language, there's serious concerns that the definition of a site that's dedicated to the theft of U.S. property, you know, probably purely unintentionally, it sweeps in a great amount of lawful Web sites.  So, for example, the unit of analysis for what -- what -- what the site is, there's some language in there that says an Internet site or a portion thereof.</p><p>      So there's some concern about whether we're looking at the whole site, are we just looking at one blog, one Tweet, one comment, one page on a site.  So -- so getting the definition right would be really important.  There's other words within the definition that seem to introduce notions like facilitate.  That's one of reasons why the Consumer Electronics Association, who I mentioned, they have serious concerns.</p><p>      Because they manufacture so many different devices. somebody could say that the Internet itself facilitates infringement.  So we need to make sure that we're really -- we're really staying within the existing confines of copyright law.  I would also mention in the definition there's some language -- you can be dedicated to theft if you have -- no one understands, sir, what this means -- if you have taken deliberate actions to avoid confirming a high probability of the use of your site for infringement.</p><p>      Right now, small business owners, when they're starting a Web site, they know if they comply with the DMCA, they are lawful companies, they can see investment, they can go forward.  If they have to somehow subscribe to that kind of definition, the folks that we're hearing from, they just have no idea how they would even possibly build their site to fit that definition.      So I think getting -- getting the scope of what is a site dedicated to infringement would be critical.  And from there, we're certainly more than happy to work on remedies.  The two that we think are really smart -- if you look at Wikileaks, I think this is a good example of -- of the fact that this is a strong remedy.  Is choking these sites off at the revenue source.</p><p>      They are in business because they can either sell advertising or because they can profit from subscribers.  If you could get the entire industry together and you could choke off advertising, and you could choke off payments to those sites, you would be incredibly effective to introducing the collateral damage that we had discussed to free speech or to Internet architecture, things like that.</p><p>      So ensuring that we had the right remedies and the right scope, I think there's plenty of opportunity for all -- all players for a cross-section of industry to come together.</p><p>      GOODLATTE:  Let me -- let me just follow up on that.  The more detailed information you give us, the better our ability to address legitimate concerns.  So will you commit to working with me to identify the specific problems that the tech community has with the bill, and working to address those specific problems to improve the bill as we move forward?</p><p>      OYAMA:  Absolutely.</p><p>      GOODLATTE:  And some have argued that this legislation would break the Internet.  As the co-chair of the Congressional Internet Caucus, that's the last thing I want to do.  Can you explain exactly how this legislation would impact the functioning of the Internet?</p><p>      OYAMA:  So I think -- I think the major concerns that have been raised, really, kind of in the cyber security field -- so there's a white paper by a group of engineers who designed DNSSEC.  There's some other leading cyber security folks who have spoken out about it.  I think -- I think Stewart Baker has been on record.  He's a former senior official at DHS and the former general counsel of the NSA.</p><p>      One of the provisions in the bill would require ISPs to perform DNS blocking.  There's kind of a two-fold concern there.  One is that -- that the -- the methods proposed here are not compatible with a more than 10-year long effort in the cyber security field to implement DNSSEC in a way that would prevent cyber security attacks.  </p><p>      So I am not the cyber security expert.  The -- but the folks that -- that wrote that code are saying that this will really harm the U.S. and the global effort to make DNS more secure.  I think the second piece is, we know that users, unfortunately, are seeking this material.  We can predict that there are going to be circumvention efforts.</p><p>      And so there's a big concern that if we place certain obligations on U.S. DNS providers that users are going to reroute their traffic to offshore rogue providers.  And the vulnerabilities that an offshore rogue provider could introduce into the network, not -- not just for the kid that's looking for the movie or for some bad actor, but for anyone who's network that they're on, is really significant.  It could introduce spyware, malware, privacy concerns.</p><p>      I know this is, you know, something that, really, the folks who are the experts in this field have raised.  But, you know, that's been kind of a critical concern about ...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK) </p><p>      GOODLATTE:  (Inaudible), I hate to interrupt.  I -- I do believe that Mr. Clark, if the chairman will permit -- Mr. Clark, from his past experience with the Department of Justice, might also be able to comment on this issue ...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK) </p><p>      GOODLATTE:  Mr. Clark, could you give a very brief response?</p><p>      CLARK:  Very briefly.  I -- I -- unfortunately, I don't have the cyber experience.  It wasn't one of the areas I -- I actually worked myself.  We -- I've managed it.  I don't know the intricacies about it, though, in all honesty.  So I apologize for not having an answer for that.</p><p>      GOODLATTE:  I apologize, Mr. Chairman.  I thought -- thought there was an opportunity there, but perhaps not.  Ms. Oyama, thank you.  We look forward to working with you.</p><p>SMITH:  Thank you, Mr. Goodlatte.</p><p>      The gentlewoman from California, Ms. Lofgren, is recognized.</p><p>      LOFGREN:  Before my questions, I would like to ask unanimous consent to introduce a number of items into the record -- opposition to the provisions of the bill.  </p><p>      The letters are from to Consumer Union and other consumer groups -- TechNet, TechAmerica, the American Library Association, the Competitive Enterprise Institute, Human Rights Watch, other public interest groups, dozens of human rights groups around the world, a written statement from the ACLU, a paper from the Brookings Institute (sic) explaining how the bill would undermine security and stability of the Internet, a white paper by five leading DNS engineers and Internet security experts, a letter from the Anti-Phishing Working Group, an article from Stewart Baker, the former general counsel of the NSA and policy chief DHS under the Bush administration entitled Copyright Bills Could Kill Hopes for Secure 'Net, a letter signed by AOL, eBay, Facebook, Twitter, Yahoo!, LinkedIn, Google, Mozilla and Ziinga, and a Harvard Business Review article entitled Great Firewall of America.</p><p>SMITH:  Without objection.</p><p>      LOFGREN:  You know, I think some today have sort of written off, I think, serious criticisms of this bill's hyperbole.  And that the only objection is about money and hyperbole.  And I just don't think that's the case.  The big tech companies weren't the ones who said this bill would cause the U.S. to lose its position as a global leader in supporting a free and open Internet.  That's from dozens of human rights groups around the world.  The big tech companies want the ones who wrote that the bill has the potential to do consumers more harm than good.  That's from the Consumers Union and other nonprofit consumer groups.  The big tech companies didn't write the bill is in conflict with the First Amendment.  That's from the ACLU and over 100 law professors.  </p><p>      It wasn't the big tech companies who said the bill kill our best hope for securing the Internet.  No, that's from Stewart Baker, the former assistant secretary for DHS and the former general counsel of the national security agency.  Dozens of venture capitalists, not big tech companies, wrote that the bill will stifle investment in Internet services, throttle innovation and hurt American competitiveness, and it hasn't generally been the policy of this committee to dismiss the views of those in industries that we're going to regulate.  And these are just a few of the examples.</p><p>      Now, I understand why cosponsors of the legislation are not happy about widespread criticism of the bill.  But I think impugning the motives of the critics rather than engaging in the substance is a mistake.  I have a number of questions, and I know that, you know, we've got six witnesses here; five are in favor and only one is against.  And that troubles me.  I'll just say that.  You know, I don't think it's a balanced effort, and I'm sorry that we don't have any technical expertise on this panel in terms of engineering talent, because I think that is an important issue as to the DNS blocking portions of the bill.</p><p>      So let me ask a question of Mr. O'Leary:  Do you believe that software program should be illegal if they allow a user to circumvent Internet filtering ordered by the government?</p><p>      O'LEARY:  I don't believe that software program should be per se illegal.  I think if people misuse them, then they should be -- if they misuse any product in violation of the law, they should...</p><p>      LOFGREN:  So the ability to just simply circumvent the takedown order as a software add-on to a browser should continue to be illegal...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK)</p><p>      O'LEARY:  Well, no.  If you're saying you're building something in specifically to avoid an order of the court not to do something, I do have a problem with that.</p><p>      LOFGREN:  So you think that software ought to be illegal?</p><p>      O'LEARY:  Well, that's not what I said, no.</p><p>      LOFGREN:  Well, it's one or the other.  Either you should be able to do that or you should be able to do it.  Which is it?</p><p>      O'LEARY:  Does the software have a legitimate purpose, or is it simply to circumvent the court order?</p><p>      LOFGREN:  Well, circumventing software can be a multiplicity of use.  We -- for example...</p><p>      O'LEARY:  Right.  But in your question, you said the software would -- would be created to allow circumventing.</p><p>      LOFGREN:  There is a -- there is an add-on to Firefox that will allow a...</p><p>      O'LEARY:  I think that most legitimate companies in the United States, including Firefox, should abide by court orders and follow the law.</p><p>      LOFGREN:  So -- well, you're not really answering the question. I will take from you, you will you think that that ought to be regulated at least.</p><p>      O'LEARY:  Regulated in much the same way that we regulate people driving drunk and stealing things, yes.  I think that -- I know that the word regulation has...</p><p>      LOFGREN:  Let me -- let me ask you this, because I don't have a long time, and I assume that you are directing your comments at people that Northern California people didn't care about jobs and the rest of America, either to myself or Mr. Lungren, since we're the only members of the committee from Northern California.  I will say I do care about jobs all over America.  And in fact eBay, which is headquartered in San Jose, has enabled thousands of Americans all over the country to form small businesses and to use the Internet to sell products.</p><p>      A guy to know your concept of -- you think that this is a big problem, and I think it's a problem.  I think it's that Internet piracy is something that is troubling, it's illegal, and I think we need to do something about it.  So let me just put that out there. How many sites do you think need to be shut down in order to say we've succeeded in the fight against Internet privacy?  Is that it doesn't, is it hundreds, that thousands?  Do you have any idea of the scope of the number of sites that need to be...</p><p>      O'LEARY:  Well, first of all, you mischaracterized my comment about Northern -- Northern California, and I'd like to correct the record on that.  I was in place...</p><p>      LOFGREN:  Well, do it later, because I don't have that much time. Answer my question.</p><p>SMITH:  Actually, the gentlewoman's time has expired, but you're free to answer the question.</p><p>      O'LEARY:  Thank you.  The comment about Northern California was, in the context of this debate, the perception has been created by opponents of this bill that all of the innovation in all of the creative thinking comes out of -- out of Silicon Valley.  I was not taking umbrage with anyone in Silicon Valley.  We have great relationships with a lot of people in Silicon Valley.  Pixar, which makes wonderful movies, is in Silicon Valley.  Apple, which is a legitimate online retailer, is in Silicon Valley.</p><p>      LOFGREN:  But -- but...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK)</p><p>      O'LEARY:  I was also making the simple point, Congresswoman, that there are people all over this country in places like Detroit, Baltimore, Texas, North Carolina...</p><p>      LOFGREN:  Mr. Chairman, I wonder, since...</p><p>      O'LEARY:  I'm happy to answer your question...</p><p>      LOFGREN:  May I have an additional 30 seconds?</p><p>SMITH:  Will the gentleman answer the question very briefly?</p><p>      LOFGREN:  How many sites?</p><p>      O'LEARY:  Well, I know for a fact that we can start with Pirate Bay, which was mentioned earlier.  I do not know how many...</p><p>      LOFGREN:  So is it just Pirate Bay, do you think, or is it a dozen, is it 1,000?  What you think?</p><p>      O'LEARY:  It would be easier to answer the question if I was allowed to.  There are multiple sites out there.  This is a legitimate problem.  We have been very clear, and we will continue to be clear that there is no silver bullet.  The problem is evolving and changing. I cannot sit here right now and tell you in good faith that I know what that number is.  But what I do know is that there are literally hundreds of sites out there that are engaging in this activity...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK) </p><p>      LOFGREN:  Do you think it's in the neighborhood of...</p><p>SMITH:  The Gentlewoman's time is...</p><p>      O'LEARY:  ...know that is to go to Google and type in J.  Edgar, and you will get a list of...</p><p>      LOFGREN:  Or Baidu or Bing or any of them...</p><p>      O'LEARY:  ...sites that are engaging in this illegal activity...</p><p>      LOFGREN:  So it's hundreds of thousands?</p><p>SMITH:  The gentlewoman's time is expired.  But let me remind members that their welcome to submit written questions to any of the panelists, and will try to get those answers to the members as quickly as we can.</p><p>      The gentleman from California, Mr. Issa, is recognized.</p><p>      ISSA:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and suggests a lady from the North, while I am deep in the Confederacy of California, went through quite a litany of good opponents of the bill.  I'd like to add to that a unanimous consent that following:  A joint letter by 160 entrepreneurs, founders and CEOs and executives, a letter expressing concern about SOPA from the Digital media Association, statement by the Consumer Electronics Association, Electronics Association, which was denied an opportunity to be here as a witness, letter signed by 53 venture capitalists expressing concern regarding the protect act, and a transcript of recent remarks made by VP Joe Biden that he gave in -- at the London Cyber Security Conference germane to hear his concerns about this bill.</p><p>SMITH:  Without objection.</p><p>      ISSA:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>      I've been the victim of piracy.  So you're not going to have a problem with me agreeing with the problem.  Hardware, software, got it all.  But Mr. Clark, I'm going to hope that you can stretch for this part of it, even though it's not in your title.  You're familiar with ITC, aren't you?</p><p>      CLARK:  Yes, I am.</p><p>      ISSA:  Pfizer regularly for patent infringement on imported products will go to the IDC and get relatively quick justice using administrative law judges available to them and injunctive relief against a patent violator, correct?</p><p>      CLARK:  Outside of my field, but I would believe that is the case.</p><p>      ISSA:  So when we deal with rogue elements outside the jurisdiction of the United States that a recording in the United States, we have a history of an organization that is quick, administration and can have continued jurisdiction against non-U.S. entities who are, in fact, trying to take what they have stolen then sell it into America.  Is that correct, correct to your understanding?</p><p>      CLARK:  Generally speaking, yes.</p><p>      ISSA:  OK.  Have any of the other of you -- just raise your hands -- were to the ITC in your background or familiar with them?  One another.  Well, let me just run through quickly because time will be very limited and questions seem to be - the answer seemed to be long. We have a court of jurisdiction.  Now, they do not specifically have the mandate to follow the money and provide injunctive relief against Google, eBay or anybody else after they find it offshore and French are and seek remedies.  But they have their own consults, they have administrative law judges.  They have a procedure.</p><p>      Mr. Chairman, I object to this bill in its current form, mostly because I believe it fails to use tools that are generally better than the tools that we have at our disposal in this bill, and I believe that if the real remedies sold is, in fact, a quart of continued jurisdiction, specializing in intellectual property and designed to, in fact, reach a quick solution to a question of whether there is wrongdoing and then follow the money through injunction, not to fines, and, obviously, criminal referral.  My intention is to offer legislation on a bipartisan basis that will, in fact, look at the legitimate concerns, take a great deal of these 80 pages.  </p><p>      However, and this is where it's tough, Mr. Chairman and ranking member, suggests that it jurisdiction not within this committee get a substantial portion of this bill, because I believe that that is as appropriate as it is for the federal courts to consider domestic entities who are violating it.</p><p>      And so with that, Miss Oyama?  Am I pronouncing it right?</p><p>      OYAMA:  Yes.</p><p>      ISSA:  Has-- in your experience, has Google worked with the ITC or any other administrative law judges in executing on other people's judgments?</p><p>      OYAMA:  I would imagine in the patent context, yes.  It's not my field, so I can't speak to it.</p><p>      ISSA:  OK.  I too agree that having a quarter continued jurisdiction that, in fact, can work for injunctive relief as technologies available is generally something that Google and the other search engines would see as reasonable once there is a judgment entered against an offender somewhere?</p><p>      OYAMA:  Yes, I think would be happy to work on that type of solution.</p><p>      ISSA:  And I'm going to get to the others.  But Mr. Clark, if you had that and you had a judgment against party A, who had an Internet site, and then 25 other similar party show up from the same country didn't have all the identities that tell you it's basically the same group you already have a judgment against, wouldn't you benefit from having a court that we specifically gave jurisdiction to to determine quickly that those are alter ego's and execute upon them so that you would go through this wack-a-mole (ph) again and again trying to prove to somebody that it's basically the same people doing it again?</p><p>      CLARK:  My working relationship with the ITC has been very, very limited.  I'm not quite certain what their capabilities are.  If you say you're going to empower them to do certain work like that, it would make some sense.</p><p>      ISSA:  Currently, they are the -- and the others will probably know this -- that's a place that plaintiffs go to if there's any importation and they have a patent because they can administer a decision faster than the fastest rocket -- fastest rocket docket, and unlike eBay decision, they have injunctive relief not only as a tool but as the one and only tool, and he used it without his question because, in fact, that is the mandate of Congress.</p><p>      CLARK:  But you were still talking about referral process.  I think the DOJ that for criminal follow-up and for asset...      ISSA:  Right.  And I recognize at some point the administrative law judges look and say we have a domestic entity that is not complying with our injunctions or a site that is just as rogue in the U.S.  So I'm very aware that there are elements here that, if you are cooperating or facilitating with a foreign entity, that there would have to be a referral.  That's not going to be Yahoo or Google or eBay.  It's going to be, as you know, the rogue sites you fight every day.</p><p>      CLARK:  Right.  And I would just be worried about the bifurcation of activity and in the referral process in the elongation of the end result is something like that were arranged.</p><p>      ISSA:  So I look forward to showing both are witnesses in the committee that, in fact, the ITC's time to judgment and their execution is actually much shorter than our federal courts and less discretionary than the Justice Department generally.  </p><p>      I think the gentleman -- the chairman for his indulgence and yield back.</p><p>SMITH:  Thank you, Mr. Issa.</p><p>      The gentlewoman from Texas, Ms. Jackson Lee, is recognized.</p><p>      JACKSON LEE:  Let me thank the gentleman -- chairman very much in the ranking member.  And let me call the world and -- for the record and say I want the U.S. Library of Congress, I want Pfizer, the Motion Picture Association of America, MasterCard, Google and are good friends at the technical aspect of our moviemaking business and all supporters to be made whole.  I think we have a consensus that online piracy is a both devastating and destructive element of the nation's economy.  In fact I have said I think I believe often that it steals the genius of this country.  </p><p>      We are very proud of the motion picture industry, and I am, if you will, cup runeth over.  I may be your physical armor when I see the massive thievery that goes on, and certainly in some of our international friends.</p><p>      So I start off with that, and I want to find a common ground. And as I have looked at the legislation, I hope the chairman and ranking member will give us the time to really study the legislation. Several things come to mind.  One, this legislation has no referral. I'm a member of the Homeland Security Committee, and our committee spent years helping to build the switch to the DNS SEC, and if this bill would pass, we would have a challenge with that format.  And the question is, would everyone who needs to make changes to the DNS SEC would instead be on the phone to the lawyers asking whether they will be sued for adopting security technology that will make the mandated login redirect system even more difficult.</p><p>      We have to look at all of these issues.  So I want to ask the Library of Congress first if he has any comments regarding that conflict that we're supposed to be collaborative.  You're the only government witness.  I'm not sure if you've thought of that, but let me give you a second question quickly, since our time is going quickly.  I am concerned about how this bill will -- what effect it will have on small businesses, particularly those that couldn't afford to go to court should a rights holder come forward and demand that their access revenue be shut off.  If a rights holder accuses a small- business Web site of being -- facilitating -- excuse me, a facilitating infringement and a payment process that shuts off payments to that business isn't payment process immune from suit under section 104, and what rights do they have?</p><p>      So first, is there any collaboration or recognition about the system that the DHS has formulated?</p><p>      PALLANTE:  I'm sorry, I don't -- I don't know the...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK)</p><p>      JACKSON LEE:  Don't know have that question.  Mr. Chairman, I think we have to have that answer from whatever resources we can get.</p><p>      Next, if you can have any insight on how it impacts small businesses, this particular legislation.</p><p>      PALLANTE:  Yes.  That section of the bill, I believe, was actually invented to make it easier and quicker to avoid the court process and the cost.  That's the goal.  There is no liability for the intermediaries under that section.  There's an obligation if it goes to the next stage and is a court order.  There's an obligation...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK)</p><p>      JACKSON LEE:  Right.  So there's still a process that a small business might have to be engaged in.</p><p>      PALLANTE:  But...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK)</p><p>      JACKSON LEE:  There's still a process.  This makes it easier...</p><p>      PALLANTE:  There is, and their good-faith intermediaries, and they have not themselves broken the law, and the bill tries to take that into account.  If we can refine that, we should.</p><p>      JACKSON LEE:  Yes, because they still have an obstacle to climb, if you might.</p><p>      Let me go to Ms. Oyama -- excuse me.  Forgive us from not reading the name correctly.  I don't have it in front of me.  But let me quickly give you a series of questions.  Ms. Oyama, is that correct?</p><p>      OYAMA:  Yes.</p><p>      JACKSON LEE:  All right.  Thank you.  One of the -- one of the kind of groups that I've been engaged in over the last couple of months is the generation of youth that are excited about startups. They're everywhere.  They are job creators, and I see them as the new nucleus of job creation in America.  They are -- they are obviously functioning now.  They're all trying to emulate all the stars of social network.  We know that won't be the case, but they are trying to create jobs.</p><p>      So let me raise these concerns with you.  I think immediately what comes to mind is that this legislation may be overly broad, that it too easily circumvents Internet users, and it is inherently incompatible with the way, Internet actually works.  Would you comment on the overbroad -- the circumventing Internet users and incompatible with the way the Internet works?  Can you do that quickly for me, and then I'd like to go back to Miss -- if you could be listening to this question about the, Ms. Pallante, if you have any idea about the problematic aspect of this first small -- again, a small, a minority of businesses.</p><p>      But Ms. Oyama?</p><p>      OYAMA:  Sure.  On the overbreadth concern...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK) </p><p>      JACKSON LEE:  Overbroad.</p><p>      OYAMA:  Overbroad, a huge concern is the scope of the definition of what the site dedicated to that.  So that's a concern that's been raised among small businesses, larger tech companies is.  If we're going to go after rogue sites, we have to make sure that they're rogue sites and that they're breaking the law.  There's a lot of concern that right now the definition would cover new ground.  It would cover site that today are complying with the DMCA.  So they're taking down infringement when there notified by (inaudible) holders.  It would be sites that today, under existing law, if they were hauled to court, they would be found not guilty under existing copyright law.  So I think there's scope concern there.</p><p>      JACKSON LEE:  Circumvented by Internet users.  It can be too easily circumvents it by Internet users.</p><p>      OYAMA:  Yes.  So one of the concerns is that, on the -- the notice to terminate provision, that piece does not go through court, and so somebody could just notify a service provider.  You could go away for Thanksgiving if your Web site owner.  Your (inaudible) team providing services under the bill could be shut off than five days. So there's a lot of concern that, you know, that doesn't really provide adequate due process in terms of the way current businesses work.</p><p>      I would say, in terms of the incompatibility with the Internet, in the Internet here, Internet traffic is going to route around blockages.  It's a kind of working with the grain of the Internet we think is really smart, it's really effective.  It's why we support the legislation we discussed before about cutting off the funding sources. It's worked in going after sites like Wikileaks, which is incredibly sophisticated site.  Much of international law enforcement was going after Wikileaks, and if you go to Wikileaks' homepage, it says that they're going down because payment provider shut them off.      SMITH:  The gentlewoman's time has expired.</p><p>      The gentleman from Florida, Mr. Ross, is recognized.</p><p>      ROSS:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>      Ms. Oyama, you feel that this bill is an infringement of First Amendment right of free speech?</p><p>      OYAMA:  You know, I think short of their constitutionality, it certainly raises free-speech concerns.</p><p>      ROSS:  Is it -- is it censorship that you're concerned about?  Is that...</p><p>      OYAMA:  Yes, so the U.S. has had a good platform globally to speak out for free expression, and I think a lot like this which would, for the first time, empower the government...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK)</p><p>      ROSS:  And that would empower the government to require you to do something that you don't want to do, which would be to set that aside. Is that correct?</p><p>      OYAMA:  We're happy to disable links, and we're notified by rights holders.  We think that going...</p><p>      ROSS:  And as long as you do without a third party such as the government, it's not an infringement of First Amendment rights of free speech, nor is it a -- as censorship, is it?</p><p>      OYAMA:  We don't do full site blockages.  We do page by page...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK)</p><p>      ROSS:  Would you do take downs?</p><p>      OYAMA:  Under the MPAEI (ph)?</p><p>      ROSS:  Yes.  Which is the same thing.  I'm just having a hard time distinguishing when you do it it's OK, but when you have a third- party such as the federal government requiring you to do it, then it becomes censorship and an infringement on First Amendment rights...</p><p>      OYAMA:  I see.</p><p>      ROSS:  But let me ask a further...</p><p>      OYAMA:  ...government approach it's much broader in this bill.</p><p>      ROSS:  Let me go a little bit further here because I want to go to your example of Dave's Emporium, which I think is a great example for people such as me, who think simply to understand the small business.  But I want to look at it from a consumer's rights perspective.  Let's say that Dave's Emporium, because that 1 percent vendor that uses on the Internet that's found through your -- your Google search, results and the purchase of a product that causes death or personal injury.  </p><p>      Now, in that chain of commerce, Google would be brought into action, especially where there's joint and several liability as a deep pocket, to defend that suit and probably pay damages.  All of that could've been prevented had there been an investigation, had there been the appropriate execution under this act.  In fact, not only would it have been prevented, but also, under this bill, is there not an affirmative defense that Dave's Emporium could've asserted in the sense that I don't have the -- the resources to hire a lawyer that would mitigate my responsibility to now have to defend the order to take down?</p><p>      So what I'm getting at is, is that, even further, you have immunities under this act that would prevent a third-party suit against you if you shut it down.  But you don't have immunity if, in fact, you allow for the sale and purchase of products that are not only counterfeit, but they also result in death or personal injury.</p><p>      OYAMA:  So on counterfeit, is definitely something that we agree with you.  Counterfeit is a big problem.  It's something that we invest tons of engineering hours, millions of dollars into going after.  For example, for ad work, we adjusted 95 percent...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK) </p><p>      ROSS:  But it would seem to me that you would -- you would want to have the immunities.  You would want to have some protection, some safe harbors to prevent lawsuits against you in the execution of your -- of your -- of your business.</p><p>      OYAMA:  I think if a court is instructing intermediaries to take action, there's probably some place for immunities.  But the concern here is that Dave could be shut off for five days not pursuant to its terms of service.  Certainly no one has the absolute...</p><p>      ROSS:  But he could be put out of business being sued because of a harmful product that could've been prevented had Google investigated the site.</p><p>      OYAMA:  So certainly no one has an absolute right to ads or payment services.  We think that they're...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK)</p><p>      ROSS:  Well, Dave's in that situation either way, and I think that he needs to have some protections.  And I think that this bill will offer some of that.  </p><p>      But let me -- let me shift to another thing, let me tell you I appreciate what Google has done with regard to child pornography.  I mean you guys have stepped up to the plate tremendously.  And I think that's a wonderful example.  You need to be congratulated for that. You do it because it's the right thing to do, and it would seem to me that following the letter of the law, you could do the same thing in this regard in an effort to hold down, or at least eliminate, the use of pirated sites by way of the search engine and Google.</p><p>      OYAMA:  So child pornography is certainly a huge, you know, problem.  It's something we take very seriously.  Technically, going after child pornography on a search engine is completely different from copyright because the machine can detect child pornography.  A machine can look for flesh tones.  A human, if you look at it, would know what it is that good adjusted.  And with...</p><p>      ROSS:  But it's still the right thing to do.</p><p>      OYAMA:  ...the copyright, you can't just look at the video and tell whether it's infringing our license, right?  It needs to be a collaboration with the rights owner.</p><p>      ROSS:  Real quickly, Ms. Kirkpatrick, not a question; just a thank you, on behalf of MasterCard, for what you're doing because you're cutting off the source of the problem.  And that's very important.</p><p>      Mr. Almeida, I had a chance to meet a couple of days ago with one of your members, gentleman who, a lifelong songwriter.  He's in this room.  And he met with me, and he said, \"You know, the problem isn't that it's a fight over between the movie houses than the producers; it's the small people, the people will follow their passion, the people who have the artistic ability to do something they've always wanted to do that now, after 30 years of being a songwriter, has to look at whether he can keep his house, what is future's can hold.\" And I wish you would do for me and explain to the members up here is how this adversely impacts not the giants in Hollywood not the Giants in Nashville, but those that participate, those whose creativity and innovation will be stifled unless there's some protections.</p><p>      ALMEIDA:  Well, I think there does need to be protections, and I think that's what this bill hopes to do.  The -- and this isn't to protect the big -- the big dogs in Hollywood.</p><p>      ROSS:  Right.</p><p>      ALMEIDA:  Our members who were behind the scenes, who were stagehand...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK) </p><p>      ROSS:  The foundation.</p><p>      ALMEIDA:  ...who -- the people who built the sets, the backend payments for those workers support their health and petrified, that's being cut off.  They're adversely being impacted by these rogue sites and by the piracy of their videos.  A video being released today will be available by the weekend on the Web.  And so we're hoping that this legislation will help to take a step forward in that area.</p><p>      ROSS:  Thank you.  Obviously, my time's expired.  I yield back.</p><p>SMITH:  And thank you, Mr. Ross.</p><p>      The gentlewoman from California, Ms. Waters, will be recognized.</p><p>      WATERS:  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>      Let me just say that I find the discussion on H.R.3261 extremely interesting and engaging, and I think Mr. Ross frame this issue somewhat in its opening statement, when he talked about the giants and competition and the -- the profits and the money that's involved being at the basis of all of it.  And let me just say that I view any proposed changes in IP and copyright laws as an opportunity to examine whether changes will expand opportunities for women and minority entrepreneurs, both in Hollywood and Silicon Valley.  And I come to this discussion just having witnessed a CNN presentation called Black in America about Soledad O'Brien this past weekend, which I found very, very interesting.  </p><p>      Having said that, I'd like to direct my first question to Maria Pallante, U.S. copyright registrar.  User generated content Web sites like Facebook and YouTube are enormously popular.  Individuals and groups use these platforms to share videos that range from fraternity and sorority step shows and high school talent shows to videos of kids performing a new dancer imitating a new music video.  Many up-and- coming artists who don't have record deals also use UGC sites to showcase their talents, covering popular songs.</p><p>      Now, to the extent many uploaded video clips feature the use of copyrighted music and other types of content that is not for profit or commercial gain, do you think that this bill would include a Safe Harbor fair use exception or other explicit provision that would ensure we aren't trying to subject parity and leisurely activities to felony penalties?  Are you at all concerned that some of the section's broader language could have unintended consequences that may chill the use of UGC sites and digital platforms that have served an important social utility?</p><p>      PALLANTE:  Thank you for the question.  I'm not concerned as it's written.  The -- we're talking about two different levels of activity. This bill would go after sites dedicated to infringement.  I think what is on the table in this room is a position that one can be compliant with the DMCA through notice and takedown of very specific sites when notified, and therefore, not have the obligation to participate in a solution that is about broad, willful, criminal, egregious, dedicated activity.  Two different -- they -- these two things will operate at the same time, and the notice and takedown system will remain intact.</p><p>      WATERS:  Also, I would like to ask about another issue that I'm very concerned with, and I would like to direct this to Ms. Katherine Oyama to Google.  I'm very concerned about the voluntary authority and legal immunity the bill gives Internet service providers to block access to sites they reasonably believe are infringing sites.  This provision would seem to run counter to the FCC's recently issued open Internet net neutrality rules.  I can foresee cases in which an Internet service provider that holds all my content may use the section as a pretext to unfairly block access to a competing Web site that is not really dedicated to infringement.      This section does not require credible claims, merely a reasonable belief that doesn't exclude commercial disputes or anticompetitive conduct.  It is my understanding that the Senate doesn't have ISPs voluntary blocking authority in its bill.  Can you foresee any unintended consequences with the voluntary blocking provisions?  Is there a way that this bill could be refined to ensure that voluntary actions are based on credible evidence in certain thresholds?</p><p>      OYAMA:  Sure.  Thank you.</p><p>      So we do see today the Internet used by countless small businesses to facilitate communication to facilitate e-commerce.  It is truly people's daily livelihood.  And so we do think that there should be due process built-in if something essential to your site like your services is going to be taken away.  I think the provision you were mentioning is section 104 the bill.  I think the broader technology community shares those concerns.  You know, one, if you look at the scope of sites that could be captured by a service provider's reasonable belief that they were dedicated to theft within bill, that's a very broad.  </p><p>      And then two, the number of service providers have received complete immunity for terminating service without going to court, without going through a due process, is not just the providers that are required to take action under this bill; it's much broader.  So it would include -- it would include advertisers, search engines, payment providers, but also domain name registers, ISPs, much broader, you know, a much broader group of folks.  If you were to lose your domain name and your small independent business, that -- that is everything. And so making sure that you are at least protected by the terms of service when you sign up for a contract would, you know, probably make sense to us.</p><p>      WATERS:  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.  I yield back the balance of my...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK)</p><p>SMITH:  And thank you, Ms. Waters.</p><p>      The gentleman from Iowa, Mr. King, is recognized.</p><p>      KING:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I appreciate being recognized, and I appreciate the testimony of the witnesses.</p><p>      I want to just take a bit of a different tack here, if I could, and looking at the fraudulent Internet sites and the piece of this that's the direct focus of this hearing, and I'm just looking through some of the -- some of the background material, the problem of illegal pirating of copyrighted intellectual property.  And I would think that, you know, it's all trademarks and copyrights of patents altogether that I think about, not just Web sites and things that we can look at.</p><p>      And so the -- there's a pattern across this country, or across the world, of certain countries that are pretty effective at this, and I'd just ask you if there's anybody on the panel, just raise your hand or answer, if you have a list of countries that are the most egregious violators of intellectual property rights from an American perspective?</p><p>      Yes, sir?  I can't read your names.  I'm sorry, so...</p><p>      O'LEARY:  Thank you, Congressman.  It's Michael O'Leary.  I -- the -- sorry.  The content industry has contributed share to something through the state department.  There's a number of different ways. There's a notorious markets filing, which chronicles the areas of the world where this is the most problematic, and then there's the special 301 process, whereby the United States puts forward a list and kind of characterizes where countries fall in terms of their protection of intellectual property.  </p><p>      And the reason for that, frankly, very simply, is that intellectual property is not just an American problem; it's a global problem, and what you're seeing around the world is that other countries are starting to recognize the benefit of not just protecting American intellectual property, but protecting their own.  I would note, for example, that there are at least 16 countries in the world that engage in site blocking now, which has been the focus of some of the debate here.  The Internet seems to be working fine in those countries.  It seems to be having an impact in terms of taking sites like the Pirate Bay, which is blocked in many countries, but not in the United States off-line.</p><p>      So in many ways, the United States has historically been a world leader, but the truth of the matter, Congressman, from our perspective is if we don't step up and deal with the problems we have today, we're going to see background and we're not going to be the world leader. And that's -- that's unfortunate for country because we do lead the world in the production of intellectual property, and we ought to be leading the world in protecting it.</p><p>      KING:  Mr. O'Leary, do you have an opinion and then, as you've given me a couple of sources that might look at.  Can -- do you have a recollection on from which countries originate the greatest theft of intellectual property?</p><p>      O'LEARY:  Off the top of my head, I would hesitate to list them in any type of specific order.  I mean there are different problems in different parts of the world.  There are hard goods problems, which is kind of the more traditional disk type piracy that occurs in places like Russia.  There are problems with online, country like Spain has a significant online piracy problem.  There are other places in Europe. We would be happy to provide you with the committee with a complete list.  I'm hesitant to speculate because I don't trust my memory well enough to get them in the right order.</p><p>      KING:  Is China on your list?</p><p>      O'LEARY:  China's on the list, yes.</p><p>      KING:  And...      (CROSSTALK)</p><p>      O'LEARY:  There's definitely a piracy problem in China, yes.</p><p>      KING:  Do you have any recollection of what the loss might be to American property rights holders from China?</p><p>      O'LEARY:  I don't off the top of my head.  It would be -- I'm not sure, frankly, that there's a way to measure it given the realities of China.</p><p>      KING:  Would anyone in the panel be aware of any studies out of that U.S. trade representative?  It seems that three or four years ago, at least U.S. trade representative has a -- has a study done that calculates that loss of -- loss to U.S. intellectual property rights holders to different nations?  China, Russia comes to mind.  Anyone care to answer that?  I thought not on the underlying to...</p><p>      PALLANTE:  Well, yes, Maria Pallante from the Copyright Office. I don't -- I don't have the dollar amount for you, but I would just echo what Michael said, which is that special 301 process identifies problematic standards in our trading partners when it comes IP as well as notorious markets and Web sites.</p><p>      KING:  Does anyone have a more of a comprehensive solution? We're talking about shutting down some Web sites, but it's billions in theft of intellectual property rights globally.  And here we are, the United States of America, with the strongest -- some of the strongest laws and the strongest traditions of respect for intellectual property, and I don't see a broader comprehensive solution to this. It seems to me that they can move faster than we can -- we can adjust to them and that we're dealing with a component rather than the big picture.</p><p>      Yes, sir, Mr. O'Leary?  And then...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK)</p><p>      O'LEARY:  Congressman, I would argue that you're correct in the sense that this is a global problem.  It's multifaceted.  There's not a single approach that fits, but it's critically important to United States to maintain the high ground of the leadership in this because if we do not do it, other countries will not.  I would also note that the problem you're highlighting about the criminals moving faster, that's true regardless of what the crime is.  You ask anyone in law enforcement, that that's they'll tell you; you catch the ones who keep doing the same thing, and the people who would adapt and change you have to keep changing...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK)</p><p>      KING:  Are you aware of any state-sponsored intellectual property rights theft?</p><p>      O'LEARY:  Are we worried about it?</p><p>      KING:  Are you aware of state sponsored...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK)</p><p>      O'LEARY:  We believe that that occurs, yes.</p><p>      KING:  And I'm going to say I believe that happens from China as probably the lead globally to do that.  Does anyone disagree with that in the panel?  I didn't hear any disagreement.  I think I've gone far enough with this since my red light came on, but I do appreciate your -- all of your testimony, and I hope we can bring some piece of solution to this, and I hope at some point we can bring a whole solution to it.</p><p>      Thank you very much, and I yield back the balance of my time.</p><p>SMITH:  Thank you, Mr. King.</p><p>      The gentleman from Tennessee, Mr. Cohen, is recognized.</p><p>      COHEN:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>      This is indeed an important issue for us to work out, and the theft of intellectual property is of grave concern.  But it nevertheless, First Amendment issues are important too.  And my first thought is that it doesn't seem like you need -- there should be that much difference from what the Google folks in the techie folks are wanting and what the MPAA and the RIA and the other AAs want.</p><p>      Have -- let me ask maybe the gentleman from motion pictures, who's apparently got a Rick Perry problem with not being able to count to something, Mr. O'Leary.  Have y'all not gotten together and try to work this out in some way and fine-tune this to where there aren't these issues of people being penalized that are not guilty and sites being, you know, shut down, whether it's just a small infringement but not a total infringement?</p><p>      O'LEARY:  Well, we do believe that this legislation will result in either of those things happening, but we work with -- our studios work with Google on a regular basis in terms of trying to get stuff taken down off the Internet.  There are ongoing relationships on this piece of legislation.  There have not, to my knowledge, been specific discussions about this.  But I want to be very clear; we have said from the beginning that if people are willing to come forward with constructive suggestions on how to do things that are not a pretext for maintaining the status quo, that we would listen to those things.</p><p>      COHEN:  Wonderful.</p><p>      Ms. Oyama, do you have some positive, you know, not under pretense type -- pretext type of discussions that you like to come forth with?</p><p>      OYAMA:  Yes.  So I think just in the broader context of figuring out how to go after piracy, it's really important to keep in mind the number one most effective tool for going after piracy would be to increase the amount of legitimate lawful services that are available on the Internet, right?  So if we can cut off the funding, we would decrease the supply of these pirate sites.  If we could have more legitimate services for music and movies and everything else, which I know that studios are working very hard to do, that would also decrease the consumer demand for this type of...</p><p>      COHEN:  Without necessarily itemizing each of them out, have you had the opportunity to post these to the team?</p><p>      OYAMA:  Yes, so though we're here in DC today, I would assure you that all of our business partners, you know, on the West Coast are working very collaboratively, very, you know, much together to get the solutions, and we're always more than happy to continue to work with Mr. O'Leary and others.</p><p>      COHEN:  So we say -- you're all working now trying to come up with some language that would maybe -- that the chairman might put in the manager's amendment that would make all people happy?</p><p>      OYAMA:  You know, there's been some conversations that I think there would need to be a lot more...</p><p>      COHEN:  I would hope there would be a lot more, and I think that's something that should take place.</p><p>      Let me ask you a question, since I got you -- situate the microphone.  There are a couple of search engines in China and Russia, and Yandex (ph) I think it's one of them and Baidu, and some consider these rogue sites.  And whether they are not, I don't know.  They could be.  If they were considered such they were blocked because they had some pirate type folks among their constituency, how do you think the Chinese and Russians would respond toward -- towards your company and towards United States companies?</p><p>      OYAMA:  That's an excellent question.  So I think we should realize that even though we would do something for really good reason here, it could potentially have international ramifications.  If the U.S.  Government is ordering U.S. companies to disappear for an search engines from our results, it -- it should be expected that there's going to be some form of retaliation internationally.</p><p>      COHEN:  And those sites of the leading Chinese and Russian search engines.  Is that correct?</p><p>      OYAMA:  The sites that you mentioned?</p><p>      COHEN:  Yes, ma'am.</p><p>      OYAMA:  Yes.</p><p>      COHEN:  Yes.  So if we -- is it possible under this legislation they'd be totally cut off entirely?  They'd be...</p><p>      OYAMA:  If they were deemed rogue sites...</p><p>      COHEN:  Right.      OYAMA:  ...under section 102, they could -- search engines could receive an order to disappear the whole site.  It's really tough in a searcher out engine because although you could remove the direct link from a search, you know, as long as rogue site exists, people are still going to talk about it.  They're still going to blog about it. They're still going to post about it.  And so it's really not possible to remove all of worldwide discussion of the link.  And that's why we support the follow-the-money type legislation because that's really going after the source of the problem by choking off their financial reason to...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK)</p><p>      COHEN:  Let me ask you another question, or maybe to the panel. I have the (inaudible) constituent services.  We do great constituent services in Tennessee nine.  In this way, on 1114, Ryan Turner (ph) wrote me an e-mail, and he says, \"I'm writing as your constituent.  As a constituent, I opposed this stop on mine I received.  I'm a student studying management of information systems.  Should this pass, I believe my future IT would be crippled.  Having the government handed DNS servers scares me, especially with the government suing Web site owners with one PRNI (ph)\" what I think is a misprint, \"the links as a content.  </p><p>      As a college student who owns over 30 domain names, most of these places for third parties to post text responses, should one of those include a link to material that infringe copyrights now -- now I would be held responsible.  I have no funding available to handle these claims, and I'm lucky enough to be trained on how to handle lawsuits with many -- many other entrepreneurs without formal training who have no idea how to handle it.\"</p><p>      Would -- if he had this, and there was one text that came back that was maybe link to any illegal site, would he be cut off, and would he have to then go to hire at a lawyer and possibly go to court?</p><p>      OYAMA:  I think so.  I think there's two ways that could happen. So one of the concerns, you know, that not just Google but the other technology companies will endorse the testimony the other trade associations are concerned about is that the definition in 103 of what is a site dedicated to theft is very broad.  There's some language in there that also refers to a site or a portion of the site.  </p><p>      So people have a lot of serious questions about what does that mean.  Are we looking at a full site or are we looking at -- you know, and today's Internet, the way most Web sites work, there's real-time communication, and so you have lots of real-time comments, you have lots of real-time posts.  If one comment or post is infringing, does that, you know, impugn the entire site, or we looking at it is statistically?  There's some other words in the definition they get people concerned that -- that it's overbroad.</p><p>      So either been swept in it that way or enter the very broad immunities that are being given to service providers.  Pretty much anyone who qualifies under the definition of qualifying plaintiff, which is very broad, they could go to a payment or advertising service provider.  They could allege that the person that you mentioned is dedicated to a theft, and then those providers have complete immunity to shut them off.  So there's kind of -- there's a concern that there's a strong incentive in the bill, that if you wanted to immunize yourself, the easy thing to do would be to comply with the notice and shut them off.  And then...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK)</p><p>SMITH:  The chairman's time is expired, and I don't mean to cut you off, but you could frame your answer to a quick conclusion.  Or have you finished?</p><p>      OYAMA:  I think that's good, thanks.</p><p>SMITH:  OK.  Thanks.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I think you should go over.</p><p>SMITH:  The gentleman from Arizona, Mr. Quayle, is recognized.</p><p>      QUAYLE:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I want to thank the witnesses for being here.</p><p>      Ms. Oyama, I want to go back to what you were just talking about earlier about how long-term we can address the piracy issues via more legitimate websites that provide legitimate content on the Internet. And I want to go to your testimony that you indicated that the only long-term way to beat piracy online is to offer consumers more compelling legitimate alternatives, and you cited YouTube's free ad- based model for monetizing content.</p><p>      You know, there could be some disagreement.  I don't know what's the best way to monetize content, whether it's a fee-based or free ad- based.  And if you look over the course of history, except for broadcast, it seems like most quality content has not been given away for free.  So one thing that I want to ask you is, would you agree that the piracy issues that we're dealing with and a pirate Web sites that we're dealing with actually makes it more difficult for a company to start a fee-based site that offers legitimate content, and thus, it forces content providers to look for ways that are going toward Web in ad-based -- I mean ad-based content to give it away for free?</p><p>      OYAMA:  I think there's so many different models and ecosystem right now.  Certainly the problem of piracy is -- is of tremendous importance and great concern to any content provider, right?  You want to have control over the distribution of your content.  Some people choose to release it for free because they want to participate with their fans in that way.  Others want to license it, and others want to have an advertising model.  I think the kind of beauty of all the new services that we're seeing is there's no one-size-fits-all.</p><p>      I do think we would approach you to is a really great example of how kind of technology and copyright can work together.  There's a tool on YouTube called content ID.  Because YouTube has a hosted platform, we host all the content so it's on our servers.  So through content ID, we're able immediately, a rights holder would give us their file.  If a user uploads a piece of content, we would immediately scan 6 million reference files.  And we could capture, if their song or their movie was being uploaded, and then the rights holder would have control of whether to monetize it or not.</p><p>      QUAYLE:  But I think my more direct question is that if we don't -- aren't able to crack down and have the tools and the ability to crack down on the pirate Web sites, then you are actually forcing content providers into a narrow avenue of that based, providing only content via ad-based and free markets and -- not free markets, but free content.</p><p>      OYAMA:  So both -- both would be tremendously important, right? Increasing...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK)</p><p>      QUAYLE:  Exactly.  But I mean it kind of goes -- when you're -- when you're looking at that and how we need to crack down on piracy, ad based, which is the model that Google uses, and it seems to be why -- one of the reasons you would be pushing for that because that is the way that Google makes their money, right?</p><p>      OYAMA:  There's different ways, but that's...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK)</p><p>      QUAYLE:  That's primary way.</p><p>      OYAMA:  ...primary way for sure, yes.</p><p>      QUAYLE:  And I think that that's just my biggest concern is that if you're looking at just ad-based, you're cutting down one significant avenue for people to provide content, and if we don't shut down these pirate Web sites, that we're going to actually lose out on different types of business models, different types of content providing, and that was -- that was the point I wanted to make.</p><p>      Ms. Pallante, I wanted to go to you.  Earlier, you stated in your opening testimony that you do not believe in the Safe Harbors under the DMCA are actually weakened by SOPA.  Could you expand on that a little bit?</p><p>      PALLANTE:  Yes.  First of all, the bill says that, and secondly -- as a savings clause -- and secondly, there's no monetary relief. The injunctions that are allowed are already permitted under the DMCA. There are, contrary to popular belief, ways to get them to enjoin certain action for search engines and ISPs.  And there really does -- this bill is really designed to sit next to the DMCA.  The DMCA is related to particular files on a Web site, and does not require the participation of those who are really in a good position to help stem the tide of piracy.  </p><p>      So I would object to -- I'm I object to a couple of things that I have just heard from eyewitness, my fellow witness is, one is that I'm pretty sure that Google just said that it's the fault of content owners that we have rogue Web sites.  That just can't be the truth. Secondly, although follow the money could be effective, it does not bring in everybody in the Web -- in the ecosystem.  It doesn't bring in ISPs, it doesn't bring in search engines.  It doesn't account for the vast number of Web sites that offer content purposely for free, and it doesn't really address the broader role of law issue that we have on the Internet right now.</p><p>      QUAYLE:  And under the DMCR, there are actually instances where service provider can take down all content on a Webpage or on a Web site if there's infringing content on that Web site.</p><p>      PALLANTE:  Yes, the only way I see that happening is if every single rights holder comes together at the same time it approaches the Web site and - and every file was actually infringing.  So...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK) </p><p>      QUAYLE:  So it could be -- it could be possible under the DMCA.</p><p>      PALLANTE:  It's highly unlikely.</p><p>      QUAYLE:  OK.  But the one thing I wanted to just get your final thoughts on, because opponents -- opponents of the bill actually say that it's going to endanger the security and the integrity of the Internet.  One of the things that the Internet has been very good at is in commerce, and wouldn't it also be fair to say that without shutting out these pirate Web sites, then we are also endangering the security and integrity of the Internet because they are putting out also -- often counterfeit goods and also infringe copyright material?</p><p>      PALLANTE:  Right.  So there are three underlying purposes.  One is to protect content owners about their own property.  The second is to allow those who want to invest a place where there's sunshine and oxygen and a good environment for that.  And the third is to protect consumers, absolutely.</p><p>      QUAYLE:  Thank you.  I yield back.</p><p>      OYAMA:  Can I just clarify one point?  I just wanted to make sure that nothing was mischaracterized, because I do not think that it's the fault of the rights holders.  Certainly, rights holders have the right to protect their content; however, they want, and we are completely committed to going after piracy.  My only point was that the success of the consumer appetite for services like Netflix and iTunes shows that there's a lot of different licensing models out there.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Can I follow-up on that, on one point, which I think is a practical point, which is being missed in Mr. Quayle's question. There are legitimate services out there now.  There are more of them, and there have been before, there will be more than tomorrow.  The problem is that when you go to Google and you punch in the name of the movie, those legitimate sites are buried on page 8 of the search results.  There is a better than average chance that Pirate Bay is going to end up ahead of Netflix.  That's a fundamental problem, no matter how many legitimate sites are out there, that we can't over, we can't do anything about.        If we could get Google to re-index those sites it away that favor legitimacy, to your question, Congressman Quayle, the consumers would be getting to those first.  But when Netflix is buried way down in the search results, it doesn't matter how good Netflix is -- is going to be.  And this is a practical problem that could be addressed today.</p><p>SMITH:  OK.  And thank you, Mr. Quayle.</p><p>      The gentlewoman from California, Ms. Chu, is recognized.</p><p>      CHU:  Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p><p>      I would like ask about the savings clause, and I'd like to ask both Ms. Oyama and Mr. O'Leary about your opinion on this.  I'm aware that concerns have been raised by Internet companies, and many other sets of language of the bill may have unintended consequences.  And even though everybody agrees that the problem of foreign rogue sites is critical that we need to cut revenue to these sites, there may be disagreement on the language is drafted.  And I think it's really important that we try to recent common ground, that we work through language that is balanced and effective and make sure that we don't have unintended consequences.</p><p>      One of the areas of disagreement on this online piracy act is an this question of -- of the savings clause and whether there is the community that is provided under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act for search engines and Internet service providers.  And so I would like to have your different opinions because there -- I -- some have represented to me that the Senate bill has a savings clause that seems to address this, but SOPA does not, and is that -- isn't that true?  I like to have your different opinions on this, Ms. Oyama and Mr. O'Leary.</p><p>      OYAMA:  Sure.  So this is actually -- it sounds technical.  It's the savings clause, but it is of critical importance to the technology industry.  Businesses today really build their business models under the Safe Harbors that they know that they have on the DMCA.  So for technology company receives notice of infringement, they are required to expeditiously remove that infringement.  But they don't have kind of general monitoring obligation.</p><p>      So the balance that we try to strike in any legislation would be if there are intermediaries who are required to do new things under this bill, that the bill would be really clear, advertisers shut off your services payment, shut off your services, and that would be clear, we take those obligations.  We want to make sure that this bill that's going after rogue sites doesn't strip us of those important Safe Harbors and kind of unrelated litigation or, you know, open the possibility that the status of orders could be used to establish red flag knowledge.  </p><p>      And so there's some language that we propose that would kind of alleviate that concern and keep this bill is effective as it needs to be to go after rogue sites.  But a -- but a savings clause to make sure that we're not open ourselves up to liability in a way that we would somehow need to proactively monitor all user generated content in real-time is really important to us.</p><p>      CHU:  Mr. O'Leary?</p><p>      O'LEARY:  Congresswoman, I would just associate myself with the comments and testimony provided by the registrar of copyrights.</p><p>      This legislation should as a complement to the DMCA.  It doesn't impugn those rights or the Safe Harbor in any shape -- way, shape or form.  The DMCA deals with good actors, legitimate services that are trying to take steps to get infringing stuff off of their sites. Rogue sites deal with a group of people that, under no definition, would fit underneath the DMCA.  They are bad actors.  They are dedicated to infringement.  These actually fit together.  To complement each other.  In no sense does this undermine the DMCA.</p><p>      CHU:  And...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK)</p><p>      OYAMA:  I think if that's the case, the one sentence clarifying that in any legislation would be tremendously helpful.</p><p>      CHU:  Ms. Pallante, what -- what is your opinion on this, on the savings clause and whether there are enough protections and the DMCA is not...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK)</p><p>      PALLANTE:  Right.  So again, the -- thank you for the question. The question, again, is just -- just -- well, the problem is just because somebody may be compliant under the DMCA does not mean that they shouldn't take action if the attorney general finds that there's a foreign infringing site run by criminals who are engaged in piracy. That is a -- just an unfair comparison, and this bill, if that is the argument, this bill does allow for that, and it's my view that it should.</p><p>      CHU:  Well, I'd like to ask a different question, and that is about jobs creation.  There are some that are saying SOPA would stifle innovation and job growth in that -- with a brokster (ph) opinion that -- which was a finding by the U.S. Supreme Court that it contributed to the infringement, that venture capital would dry up.</p><p>      But Mr. Almeida, in your testimony, you noted that he represents over 4 million U.S. workers, and on their behalf support the -- that you actually support the Stop Online Piracy Act as an important jobs bill.  How do you respond to these claims that this legislation would stifle innovation and job growth?</p><p>      ALMEIDA:  I think innovation is alive and well in the U.S., and I don't see this as stifling it in the least.  Our members work in the United States.  They're taxpayers.  They go to work.  They make products that we view as entertainment.  That is what we see this online piracy infringing on.  And you can't hit a price point when someone's giving it away for free to make a business model to compete with free.      It also has to do with constructive innovation, and we believe in constructive innovation like Netflix as opposed to TVshack.bz, which is an infringing site that should be taken down.</p><p>      CHU:  Thank you.  I yield back.</p><p>SMITH:  Did she -- did she yield back?  Did you yield back? Thank you.</p><p>      CHU:  Yes, I yield back.</p><p>SMITH:  Thank you, Ms. Chair.</p><p>      The gentleman from Texas, Mr. Poe, is recognized.</p><p>      POE:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I think all of you for being here. This panel or this committee is made up of former prosecutors, defense lawyers, and their even two former judges here.  And back in my experience on the bench down at the courthouse, or the Palace of Perjury, so referred to it in those days, saw a lot of thieves.  And it's, you know, stealing is stealing, and thieves are people we had to deal with.  </p><p>      I disagree with you, Mr. O'Leary.  They're not battle actors, they're thieves.  And this legislation is trying to get a grip on this.  We've got three -- really three groups say here.  We had the credit card companies, we had the search engine folks and the content providers.  If I had my way, I would lock all three of you in a room and don't - say, \"Don't come out until you all agree,\" and that we can solve it, I would -- I would think.</p><p>      If you pull up, as I did, you pull up on Google search engine the Grinch Who Stole Christmas or Harry Potter, free Harry Potter movies for free the Grinch That Stole Christmas, you get a lot of free sites on there.  And as -- as a consumer, I can't tell who's a thief and who's not a thief.  And I know Google is doing a lot, millions of sites and all of that.  I've heard the testimony.  But at the point we are now, what can -- can Google offer to this bill that Google would sign on to the bill, specifically?</p><p>      OYAMA:  Sure.  To -- to your point about the search results, one of the major commitments that we made this year was to improve the tools to make sure that when rights holders notify us, those search results will be disabled in the search.  And so the commitment that we had made at the beginning of the year was to reduce the turnaround time to under 24 hours.  And so we're happy to say right now it's -- it's six hours or less is the average turnaround.  In terms of what we could do affirmatively...</p><p>      POE:  Yes.  But this day forward.  You pull up the Grinch Who Stole Christmas and you keep going page after page for three Grinches. </p><p>      OYAMA:  So long as those sites are there they are going to show up on the Internet.  And so we think that legislation that would target the source of those sites is necessary.  What we would do is we would support legislation that would go through the Department of Justice.  </p><p>      You would have a law enforcement aspect.  You would have a court determine that a site is dedicated to infringement.  And you could serve those orders on U.S. based payment providers and advertising. We have Google Checkout for payment.  </p><p>      We have AdSense, AdWords, a lot of advertising products that would directly regulate and impact our business.  But we think that if we can break the financial ties for those sites then that is really smart, targeted and effective and would avoid some of the collateral damage that we discussed earlier this morning. </p><p>      POE:  So, your answer is go after the finances. </p><p>      OYAMA:  Cut off the finance. </p><p>      POE:  Yes.  Cut off the money.  So, if there was something that we added to the bill that would cut off the money then Google may support it? </p><p>      OYAMA:  Those are certainly concepts in the bill that reflect that.  We think if you look at WikiLeaks that is how they've been taken out is by cutting off the money.  </p><p>      It's an approach that U.S. law enforcement uses for many different international problem, you know narcotics, terrorism.  I mean, it's been a proven way.  If you cut off someone's financial incentive, they're not going to want to pay for the servers and the bandwidth and the infrastructure to run these Web sites. </p><p>      POE:  OK.  Let me be a little more specific.  What can Google do? Not what the financial providers can do.  What can Google do to move this legislation forward?</p><p>      OYAMA:  So, there's a lot we're doing in the private sector.  But in terms of the legislation, we would publicly support legislation like what I described, follow the money approach.  We would be happy to do that.  We would be happy to work with your staff on legislation in that way.  If it can avoid the collateral damage we discussed, and if we got a good definition of what the rogue site that didn't (inaudible) legitimate U.S. businesses. </p><p>      POE:  But you can't tell you when you pull it up, the Grinch Who Stole Christmas, who's the real Grinch and who's not.  You get all these page after page of free Grinches.  </p><p>      OYAMA:  That's why court adjudication or cooperation with Red Shoulders (ph) is real important.  There's lots of legitimate free movies.  There's lots of content that just the middle man wouldn't really know if that was licensed or infringing. </p><p>      POE:  You want to weigh in on that, Mr. O'Leary?</p><p>      O'LEARY:  I think to use the example of The Grinch, there's a movie right now as I mentioned earlier called J. Edgar.  The only lawful place you can see that movie in a theater.  If you go back to your office and put J. Edgar into Google, you're going to get the same list of eight pages of sites where it's free.  That movie's not available for free anywhere.  If you want to see it you have to go to a theater right now.  </p><p>      So, I understand the complexity.  You're talking about something that is perhaps not in the theater.  But this is actually in the theater right now.  And there's no reason for it to be online in any fashion frankly. </p><p>      I also think that what is being proposed, what was being suggested is -- as I said earlier, we should follow everybody's money. And isolating one or two things, that doesn't solve the search engine problem that we've been talking about.  And we think that should be a part of the discussion too.  </p><p>      We think it requires all of the people that are involved in this to work together to get it done.  Kind of to your theory of throw everybody in a room and sort it out.  If everybody doesn't go in the room at the beginning, you're not going to sort it out. </p><p>      POE:  Well, maybe we need a court order to get you all three in a room. </p><p>      Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I yield back. </p><p>SMITH:  Thank you.  Maybe get the FBI to help you in that, J. Edgar Hoover style. </p><p>      Mr. Deutch, you're recognized for the next five minutes. </p><p>      DEUTCH:  Thank you, Mr. Chair. </p><p>      First of all, it's not just J. Edgar.  I -- I have teenage daughters who are awfully excited about the new Breaking Dawn movie, which is coming out.  You can watch that right now online for free. </p><p>      What I -- what troubles me about this whole exchange quite frankly is on the one hand there's this great technology, Ms. Oyama, that you're so proud to trumpet, understandably, about -- from YouTube and what YouTube does in order to prevent illegal content from being posted.  Yet when you enter -- \"watch Breaking Dawn for free\" and you can do it online now, there you throw your arms up in the air, there's nothing we can do.  </p><p>      OYAMA:  Right.  I can understand how that would feel frustrating. Technologically there's a distinction.  So, on YouTube the content that is posted on YouTube is hosted on our servers.  So, we're able to match files.  If someone tries to upload something on YouTube we have a reference file we can match against.  We don't control the World Wide Web. </p><p>      DEUTCH:  I understand that's a technology issue.  We can talk more about that. </p><p>      I have another question for you.  There is -- this has been a fruitful exchange.  Different than I might've expected from the way a number of us have referenced already.  The way this debate is played out in the local press in particular, I don't know whether -- I don't know whether Google shares the position publicly that this bill will kill the Internet and all of the advertisements that have resulted and all of the phone calls we received in our office.  </p><p>      But I do wonder whether there is any base level here that you would agree needs to be tackled.  And so if we -- if the issue is the language that says a portion thereof, let's assume that he bill didn't have that language in there.  </p><p>      So, you can't argue that Twitter would have to be taken down. Which, by the way, is an argument that is -- there's no basis for that argument under this bill.  You can't argue under this bill that Facebook would have to be taken down.  There's no basis for that under this proposed bill.  And I think -- I think that you understand that, notwithstanding the reference to individual tweets that might lead a whole site to be taken down. </p><p>      My question is, if that language weren't in there, are there any of these Web sites that -- that you believe should be taken down, and that Google ought to play a role in helping us accomplish that? </p><p>      OYAMA:  Yes.  We would be happy to work with the chairman, with your office on a follow the money legislation. </p><p>      DEUTCH:  OK.  Well, let me -- I understand -- so you don't like the way it's -- the bill is written.  Let me ask you about that because you referred -- you made many references today to following the money.  Yesterday your chairman recommended regulations based on tracing payments, banning Web sites offering illegal materials as a replacement for this bill consistent with what you've said today. </p><p>      Many of the offshore sites clearly engaging in theft are driven by -- as you point out, are driven by ad revenue, not just credit card transactions.  As we follow -- if we want to follow the money we can't just focus on the credit cards obviously.  We have to focus on the ads.  Google, at least from the statistics I've been told retains over 75 percent of all search advertising revenue in the U.S.  Therefore following the money leads us to you.</p><p>      So, tell me what -- tell me the steps that Google's taken already, understanding that you're concerned about these -- this intellectual property theft, understanding the impact that it's going to have that has every day on our economy.  Tell me the steps that Google has taken to combat it under -- using the follow the money approach that you favor. </p><p>      OYAMA:  OK.  So, just to confirm a legislation that would go after ads is a big part of our business...</p><p>      DEUTCH:  I understand.  I understand.  But given...</p><p>      OYAMA:  We're happy to support that. </p><p>      DEUTCH:  I understand that.  But tell me what you've done...</p><p>      OYAMA:  OK. </p><p>      DEUTCH:  ... now in the absence -- because we all acknowledge this is an important issue.  And if...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK)</p><p>      OYAMA:  And one shouldn't prevent the other, right. </p><p>      DEUTCH:  Right.  You can play a significant role today.  So, if you can just speak to what you've done.</p><p>      OYAMA:  OK.  So, there were some major commitments that our general counsel Kent Walker made at the beginning of the year.  I'll just try to tick off the major ones, but we should try to follow up with your office on more specifics.  </p><p>      For DMCA we've removed more than five million infringing files this year, as one rights holder notified us.  One of the concerns we'd heard is that there was some grit in the system and that there was frustration that it was taking too long.  So, we invested significant engineering hours and money to improve this role. </p><p>      DEUTCH:  Ms. Oyama, I hate to cut you off.  I don't have a lot of time here.  But I would -- I'd ask that you follow up.  I know -- I remember Mr. Walker's testimony.  I followed up with a letter after that hearing requesting all sorts of information.  That letter's still not -- I've not received a response.  So, I hope that -- I hope that a response will be forthcoming to that letter and to the request that I made here today.  </p><p>      I just -- I'd like to finish with this.  This notion that we're going to break the Internet, that somehow we're going to stifle innovation, the fact that the kid serving me coffee at Starbucks told me, hey, I hear you're taking up legislation that's going to make it impossible for me to download music.  </p><p>      The fact is what we're worried about is -- the reason this legislation -- the reason we're having this discussion, what we're worried about is not stifling that innovation in the future.  That's a concern that we all have.  I don't believe that the legislation does that.  </p><p>      But we know right now if we do nothing that the film industry and those young directors who are starting out aren't going to be able to do their craft.  And we're not going to have the next Adele, and we're not going to have the next Drake because they're not going to be compensated for their work.  </p><p>      And I hope that as we go forward and as you provide those answers that we can have an honest discussion about what's really at stake here and -- and let's move past these -- these -- these attacks on those of us who believe this and suggest that somehow we're going to mean an end to the Internet.  </p><p>      It's not -- it's not accurate.  I think -- I think you understand that it's not accurate.  And it doesn't do the American economy any -- any great service at all.  </p><p>      And with that I yield back. </p><p>SMITH:  Gentleman yields back.  And the gentleman from Texas -- the other gentleman from Texas, Mr. Gohmert, is recognized for five minutes.  </p><p>      GOHMERT:  Mr. Chairman -- there we go.  </p><p>      Again, also appreciate your being here.  It is a tough subject. And we're dealing with intellectual property here.  And I, like my friend Judge Poe, who was a district judge and also a chief justice. And we dealt with -- it wasn't called bad actors.  You dealt with theft.  And that's really what we're talking about here.  </p><p>      It's a crime.  It's a theft.  We don't want thieves working their way through an honest, legitimate, wonderful means of in this case the Internet.  </p><p>      Now, in the past some have used the analogy of the pawn shop, that you know the pawn shop can't intentionally and knowingly assist in theft.  And so there were laws made, most states have them, where people -- the law enforcement can go in and get information.  </p><p>      Now, I know, and I've been resistant to some of the pushes to force Internet providers and search engines into doing things that we don't even require pawn shops to.  And I thought some were going overboard in trying to make demands on search engines that we don't even demand at pawn shops. </p><p>      But on the other hand, there is this aspect of our criminal law. And every state has it; the federal government has it.  Anyone who aids, abets, encourages, in any way assists someone in committing a crime, the law is very clear in every state and the federal code. You're just as guilty as if you committed the crime yourself.  The question is do you intentionally or knowingly aid?  </p><p>      Well, it's been brought up often enough.  There are thieves using the Internet.  And I keep hearing from people who say look, if it were illegal for me to use that free Web site, then how come I get access so easily?  They're expecting us to do something.  And I think most of us were hoping that there would be something worked out between the interests here.  </p><p>      But I can give you an example.  I know what the law is.  And I was -- I was -- I had an 8-track, A Warm Shade of Ivory, Henry Mancini, back in college.  And it got me through some all-nighters, that and Jonathan Livingston Seagull soundtrack.  </p><p>      And so anyway, Sleepless in Seattle has the song In the Wee Small Hours of the Morning, and I wanted to get that.  I wanted to download it.  I paid two bucks for it, not just $0.99.  Nobody has it except some free Web sites.  I knew not to go use those and download it free because it's illegal.  Most people don't.  </p><p>      So, when we talk about follow the money, we're talking about something terribly difficult in going to China, going to Russia and trying to follow the money over there.  We're not getting help from those folks.  Archer Blackford (ph) and I met with their folks in China that handled this stuff.  And it seemed pretty clear to me we weren't going to get a whole lot of help out of them.  </p><p>      So, what should we do to keep from hurting the innovation of the Internet and Google and Bing and these folks that come up with great ideas?  But at the same time balance the interests in this being a law-abiding society?  And I'm gratified to hear people on both sides of the aisle have similar concerns.  </p><p>      So, it just doesn't seem to me to be that onerous to say if someone goes to court for heaven sakes and proves with probable cause standards that somebody's committing a crime of theft, and then that is presented to an Internet provider, a search engine, these people are committing a crime, there's probable cause to believe that's justification for a warrant, why that's too onerous to say don't make them accessible.  </p><p>      And I'm still having trouble understanding that.  And I would welcome comments in that regard from whoever wishes to.  Thank you.  </p><p>      OYAMA:  Thank you.  I think we completely agree about the importance of having a federal judge play the role of an arbiter so that folks' services aren't being terminated just by a five-day notice to their provider without the ability to appear to defend themselves. I think to your point about what we can do is probably three things.  </p><p>      So, one would be building on the DMCA.  Under the DMCA today search results can be line edited out.  If a rights holder tells a search engine to remove a piece of content, we have worked incredibly hard over the last year to improve our tools.  The average turnaround time today is six hours if we get received notice.  </p><p>      So, we're working really hard on improving that.  It's not perfect.  It's not done.  It's something we'll need to work on. </p><p>      The second piece, though, would be to build on that and to come together and support legislation that would impose new obligation on other providers.  So, we are also an advertising provider, largely an advertising provider, a payment provider.  A judicial process where a court determined that a site was dedicated to infringement and then instructed U.S. based intermediaries to shut off financial ties to that Web Site, that's the most important and effective thing we could do.  </p><p>      If we can knock them off at their knees and we can cut off their financial ties, they won't have a reason to be in business anymore. They won't be making money.  That's the effective way to go.  </p><p>      And then the third piece would be to get rid of the ineffective and harmful pieces.  So, I realize reasonable people can disagree about this.  But there is a tremendous concern in the technology industry about some of the remedies that are being proposed and some of the unintended consequences that would have you know potentially very severe repercussions for the Internet network, for people's security and free speech concerns.  </p><p>      So, getting the balance right is something we can support.  And we certainly think that there is a way forward and a way that we could all agree on going after these sites. </p><p>      GOHMERT:  OK.  </p><p>      LOFGREN (?):  Would the gentleman yield?</p><p>      GOHMERT:  Well, I'd ask unanimous consent to allow others to finish answering because there's a couple of hands.  And I'd certainly...</p><p>SMITH:  Gentleman is extended another minute. </p><p>      GOHMERT:  You had requested to comment. </p><p>      CLARK (?):  I'd just add that in regard to your comments about thievery and Congressman Poe's, from our industry's perspective, it's more than thievery.  It's murder.  We do feel -- I particularly feel -- I have 28 years of federal law enforcement.  I know crime when I see it.  And I see counterfeit medicines as actually attempted murder. </p><p>      I mean, it's not quick.  It's not immediate.  But when you're only giving a patient 20 percent of the medicine they need to cure their cancer or their heart problems or their high blood pressure, you're in fact killing them slowly.  But that's the issue here...</p><p>      GOHMERT:  Well, as a prosecutor you know that might not be murder.  It may be negligent homicide or other -- some other type of homicide. </p><p>      CLARK (?):  Along those lines.  And it's frustrating if we are not immediately making progress in cutting that down.</p><p>      I've worked with CBP in pilot programs and I'm seeing those counterfeits flooding in because of the purchases over the Internet over the rogue Web sites that are selling counterfeit medicines.  And it's incredulous to me how much is coming into the United States. </p><p>      So, I would say, you know this bill is going forward with demonstrating that we need to change the status quo.  We can't accept what's existing right now.  And I agree very much that we have to demonstrate to people that there are consequences and this is a serious crime.  </p><p>      When you look at six months, four months, three years, that's the cost of doing business.  It can't be that bad if that's all they're going to get.  So, I also see the Title II (ph) in this that is very, very significant as well.  </p><p>      GOHMERT:  Was there anybody else wanted to comment?  Thank you. </p><p>      LOFGREN (?):  Would the gentleman yield?</p><p>      GOHMERT:  Yes.  Sure.       LOFGREN (?):  I just wanted to briefly -- one of the -- I think it was Mr. O'Leary suggested that if you type in \"J. Edgar movie\" you get all these infringing sites.  I just did that.  And what you get is the show times in Washington, a review, the Wikipedia article, the trailer from Warner Brothers, several reviews of the movie, the iTunes trailer.  There's not a single infringing site that comes up.  So, I...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK)</p><p>      MARINO (?):  (Inaudible)...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK)</p><p>SMITH (?):  Would the gentle woman -- would the gentleman yield?</p><p>      (CROSSTALK)      MARINO (?):  ... you use the word \"free\" in there.  That's where those things come up.  Yes, I'll yield. </p><p>SMITH (?):  Would you yield?  Well, I just did the same thing and on...</p><p>      LOFGREN (?):  Google? </p><p>SMITH (?):  Google...</p><p>      LOFGREN (?):  Google or Bing?</p><p>SMITH (?):  Google'd it, \"watch J. Edgar Hoover free online on YouTube full version\".  Shows you how to download it at no cost right here. </p><p>      LOFGREN (?):  Well, I did a different search engine.  But the point I'm trying to make...</p><p>      GOHMERT:  Would the gentleman...</p><p>      MARINO (?):  ... going back...</p><p>      GOHMERT:  ... reclaiming my time, I...</p><p>SMITH:  The gentleman's time has expired. </p><p>      GOHMERT:  OK.  </p><p>      LOFGREN (?):  I would ask could the gentleman be granted 15 seconds and so I might say just an answer to.  The point is the search engines are not capable of actually censoring the entire World Wide Web.  </p><p> That's the problem.  You can't do that.  And so we need to go after the people who are committing crimes in a way that's going to work.  I think that we can do that, but this bill is not it...</p><p>      MARINO (?):  Well, with all due respect, I wanted to show the...      GOHMERT:  Well, reclaiming my time...</p><p>SMITH:  The gentleman's time...</p><p>      GOHMERT:  ... I agree, but...</p><p>SMITH:  ... is expired.</p><p>      GOHMERT:  ... we also need to cut off the getaway car.  And with that -- and I'm not sure what the gentle lady has against Google, but I respect her using Bing.  And yield back the time.  </p><p>SMITH:  The gentleman yields back time he does not have.  I'm going to accuse you of being a liberal here in a minute. </p><p>      Mr. Johnson is recognized for five minutes. </p><p>      JOHNSON:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>      Mr. O'Leary, SOPA requires payment networks like MasterCard to suspend payment transactions between a U.S. customer and an online merchant within five days.  According to Ms. Kirkpatrick's testimony, there are very legitimate challenges that payment networks have in meeting such a short deadline, especially considering the multiple players involved in an online transaction. </p><p>      The Senate version requires payment networks to take actions as expeditiously as reasonable.  Earlier this year the White House negotiated a best practices document with the payment industry that has a reasonable period of time standard.  </p><p>      Which of these standards is acceptable to you, the within five days under SOPA, the expeditiously as reasonable under the Senate version, and a reasonable period of time as negotiated between the White House and the payment industry?</p><p>      O'LEARY:  Yes, sir.  I think it's a legitimate question and one that we believe can be resolved favorably to everyone. </p><p>      JOHNSON:  Which one do you think is most acceptable to you?</p><p>      O'LEARY:  As I sit here right now I'm not prepared to pick between the three, quite honestly.  I certainly understand the point that was made by our colleagues at MasterCard.  If it's not possible you delve in five days.  We certainly don't want to create a time limit which forces them into an impossible situation. </p><p>      At the same time we would like the legislation to recognize that if someone's trying to...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK)</p><p>      JOHNSON:  (Inaudible)...</p><p>      O'LEARY:  ... they don't do that.       JOHNSON:  If I give you -- if I open up the tent for you to stick your nose in, boy are you going to get all the way up in there.  I'm just appreciating your gift of gab. </p><p>      But if I might ask Mr. Clark the same question. </p><p>      CLARK:  I feel the same way. </p><p>      JOHNSON:  OK.  All right. </p><p>      CLARK:  Sorry.  I feel the same way. </p><p>      JOHNSON:  All right.  </p><p>      Ms. Pallante, section 506 of the Copyright Act establishes criminal liability for the willful infringement of a copyright. Recently there has been confusion as to the definition of that term, willful.  Do you think that willfulness is the same as intentional? Or does the act -- tell me about the difference between those two standards. </p><p>      PALLANTE:  Right.  So, that's a great question.  And the point of SOPA is to capture those that knowingly engage in a known legal duty. And that is the standard that most courts have accepted.  There are some exceptions to that.  I think that's something that can be clarified in the bill and legislative history perhaps. </p><p>      JOHNSON:  All right.  </p><p>      Ms. Oyama, the DMCA and Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act represent the legal underpinnings of the view that intermediaries need not monitor or supervise the communications of users.  It is a view that we have long touted and pushed across the world through various diplomatic channels.  We have harshly criticized governments who use such virtual walls to prevent citizen access to the Internet. China's a great example.  </p><p>      With that in mind, would this legislation allow companies to demand that search engines located inside the U.S. censor where American consumers are able to go on the Internet?  And how would this legislation likely be viewed by China and other -- and Iran and other countries that put these roadblocks up in terms of content to their citizens on the Internet?  And how would that affect our diplomacy?</p><p>      OYAMA:  Thanks.  So, for the DMCA piece that you mentioned I think we would certainly agree.  The DMCA has proved to be a foundation for American innovation and has struck a balance.  So, if you're a new company or starting up you know what the laws are.  You have certainty.  </p><p>      And it also helps rights holders.  If a rights holder is aware that there is infringing content on the service provider, they just need to let us know.  Web posting companies, search engines, we will remove access to that content.  It strikes the right balance.  </p><p>      It does -- it takes care of infringing speech.  It leaves up legitimate speech.  And it reflects a careful balance.  It also -- because of the way Web services are used today, we see all over the place when there's real time events it's important that a Web platform enables that type of real-time communication or real-time ecommerce.  </p><p>      If you didn't have the DMCA and an intermediary platform was required or potentially liable for what its users were posting in real time, you would have to implement some type of proactive monitoring system.  It could really change the dynamics of the Web today.  </p><p>      I think the second...</p><p>      JOHNSON:  It would stifle the small entrepreneur that's just getting started more than it would hamper the larger providers of content...</p><p>      OYAMA:  I think it's both, but...</p><p>      JOHNSON:  It would be a burden on both. </p><p>      OYAMA:  Yes.  If you're a new company starting up, you'll have less money to invest in that type of monitoring.  So, certainly it would have an impact on small businesses.  </p><p>      To your question about you know kind of the speech aspect, you know if we impose a law here which would have court orders requiring a domestic search engine to make entire full Web sites disappear, and especially if there's some type of over broad definition, which would capture the legitimate speech, you know unfortunately what we do here would have other ramifications.  And we may think that this is a good reason.        We do think it's a good reason here.  But we feel the time for Google if DMCA requests competitors try to take each other down.  Pro- Democracy speech tries to be quelled.  We've seen in Libya in the recent activities there different politicians trying to take each other's YouTube channels out because they disagree with their views.  </p><p>      We see copyright used all the time as an excuse to quell speech. If we mandate this type of approach there, we really need to think carefully about what types of international ramifications that will have on free expression.  </p><p>SMITH:  Gentleman's time is expired. </p><p>      JOHNSON:  If I might get just one more question. </p><p>SMITH:  All right.  The gentleman's already had extra time, but so has everybody else.  So, go ahead. </p><p>      JOHNSON:  Thank you. </p><p>      The Justice Department has responsibilities under the -- under the SOPA Act.  While at the same time we've been talking about downsizing government.  And in fact, the Justice Department has lost about 30 percent of their attorneys.  </p><p>      How does this affect the effort to criminally go after these pirates and also from a civil standpoint? I'll ask that to Mr. O'Leary. </p><p>      O'LEARY:  Well, I think that you know this bill is actually -- speaks directly to that point.  That's part of the reason there's the ability for individual plaintiffs to move so that the burden does not fall solely on the Justice Department.  </p><p>      The content industry, Pfizer...</p><p>      JOHNSON:  What about the criminal part though?  Because we get people...</p><p>      O'LEARY:  Well, these are...</p><p>      JOHNSON:  ... prosecuted for shoplifting and stealing little small petty items.  But this is multibillion dollar white collar fraud, which only the Justice Department has or should have the -- really has the resources and the breadth of law enforcement ability to address.  How does the downsizing of the Justice Department impact criminal prosecution? </p><p>      O'LEARY:  Well, I think as a general premise when you downsize the Justice Department obviously it has an impact.  But let's be very clear.  The Justice Department does pursue criminal cases internationally...</p><p>      JOHNSON:  How can it do so...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK)</p><p>      O'LEARY:  ... (inaudible)...</p><p>SMITH:  Gentleman's time is expired. </p><p>      JOHNSON:  Thank you.</p><p>SMITH:  Some time ago. </p><p>      Recognize myself for five minutes. </p><p>      JOHNSON:  Well, I am a liberal. </p><p>SMITH:  All right.  I would not accuse you of being anything else.  </p><p>      JOHNSON:  Well, I bear that...</p><p>SMITH:  My friend. </p><p>      JOHNSON:  I bear that stain with great honor.  </p><p>SMITH:  This is sort of reverse of the old story that I went to a fight and a hockey game broke out.  I came here and as one who has not made up his mind on this bill, hoping to receive information on this. And I think everybody on this panel is committed to fighting piracy. </p><p>      I mean, maybe I'm the only member of this committee who's got a gold record.  I got it from the recording industry for my work on counterfeiting when I was the attorney general of California.  So, I very much believe that it's an important role for us to play, law enforcement and civil law in this regard. </p><p>      But my concern is something that was brought to my attention as the chairman of the Cyber Security Subcommittee on Homeland Security. And that is the existence of a system that has been ongoing for some years called DNS Security, DNS SEC.  And I have heard from those -- some of the engineers that have been working on this in the Internet area that if we applied this law in this way it would undo what we've been doing to try and secure the Internet by way of DNS SEC or DNS Security.  </p><p>      So, I'd like to ask the panelists if any of you feel you can speak to this point because it's one that was raised with me.  I'm not a technical expert on this.  But was some real alarm by Internet engineers I would call them who really don't have a dog in this fight. But our concern -- in terms of the speech between the various special interests here, and I mean that in the proper way, special interests. </p><p>      And so what I'd ask Mr. Clark, for instance.  Are you aware of this criticism?  And does this legislation, would it dis-incentivize Internet service providers from using the DNS Security extensions because it mandates the redirection of customers to another Web site?</p><p>      CLARK:  No.  I'm afraid I'm not familiar with that and not a cyber...</p><p>SMITH:  OK.  </p><p>      Mr. O'Leary?</p><p>      O'LEARY:  Well, I'm certainly aware of the argument.  And the people that we've talked to it's a concern which is frankly overstated, as I mentioned earlier in response to another question. There are numerous countries around the world that engage in this type of activity.  The Internet has worked without a problem in regard to that.  </p><p>      I think also you know they're overlooking and looking at this debate.  There's an existing security problem with the current state of play.  And that is these rogue sites taking private information from consumers and spreading malware and spyware and things like that. </p><p>      The final thing I would say is that in regard to other things like dealing with malware, dealing with spyware, dealing with child pornography, this type of activity occurs all the time and the Internet seems to function just fine.  I tend to agree with the comments of Mr. Deutch that if the Internet is going to be all things to all people, it should also be in terms of trying to help us stop people from stealing our stuff.  </p><p>      The problem, frankly is, is that the Internet seems to...</p><p>SMITH:  That's not my point.  My point is whether or not you can respond to specific question raised by Stuart Baker, former DHS assistant secretary of policy and former NSA general counsel to the effect that if this approach to respond to a legitimate problem were put into effect it would undercut an effort that's been going on for nearly a decade to secure the Internet by way of this program that I referred to. </p><p>      O'LEARY:  We disagree with that position. </p><p>SMITH:  OK.  Can you submit in writing for us specifically how you disagree...</p><p>      O'LEARY:  Sure. </p><p>SMITH:  ... with that?</p><p>      O'LEARY:  Happy to. </p><p>SMITH:  Ms. Kirkpatrick?</p><p>      KIRKPATRICK:  I'm unfamiliar with that element.  I'm not aware of it.  I don't have the technical expertise to comment on it. </p><p>SMITH:  Does anybody with your organization have this expertise? </p><p>      KIRKPATRICK:  I certainly can follow up and get back to you. </p><p>SMITH:  Please respond to that specific question because to me it's an underlying question that's extremely important.  And I've worked on the problem of cyber security.  If what we're doing here has the unintended consequence of upsetting what is, at least in the opinion of a number of experts -- and they may be wrong.  I'm trying to ferret this out.  Undercut a real effort that would practically help us secure the Internet.  That is bothersome. </p><p>      Ms. Oyama?</p><p>      OYAMA:  Sure.  So, I think the concerns that you mentioned are the ones that we've heard as well from many cyber security experts.  I know Stuart Baker has written about this.  The designers of DNS SEC themselves have published a white paper.  </p><p>      I am not -- I am not...</p><p>SMITH:  Does your -- have your people...</p><p>      OYAMA:  Yes. </p><p>SMITH:  Do you have anybody that has expertise with your association that could respond to that specifically?  Because...</p><p>      OYAMA:  I think...</p><p>SMITH:  This is not part of this hearing.  And I'm very concerned that evidently this bill is not being referred to my subcommittee. And we have -- and I'm not parochial about this, but if we're going to do it we ought to at least talk about it and to have people come here and say our organization, either we don't take a position or we're not experts on this is upsetting. </p><p>      OYAMA:  I think that there is great concern within our company...</p><p>SMITH:  Well, could you please respond in writing on that? </p><p>      OYAMA:  Sure, happy to.  Yes. </p><p>SMITH:  And Mr. Almeida?</p><p>      ALMEIDA:  No.  No expertise. </p><p>SMITH:  OK. </p><p>      Ms. Pallante, do you have any?</p><p>      PALLANTE:  I think that Congress should absolutely consult objective technical experts.  But what I'll add is that ICE, through operation on our sites, has been using the existing seizure and civil forfeiture laws to essentially disappear Web sites in the United States.  So, this bill would take that criminal standard and apply it to foreign sites. </p><p>SMITH:  Thank you very much.  </p><p>      Let's see, who's next?  Mr. Marino is next.  For five minutes. </p><p>      MARINO:  Thank you. Chairman. </p><p>      Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for being here.  </p><p>      And I want to -- I think my colleague and friend Ms. Lofgren and I pointed out a very good example of how easy this is on some sites and not others.  I think Zoe went to Bing and got the trailers.  And I went to Google, typing in \"free\" who sent me to YouTube for the free movie.  So, you know it's -- there's a lot of work to be done here.  </p><p>      Ms. Oyama, I want to compliment you on your decorum and your professionalism and your loyalty to your company for being here and answering the tough questions that you have been answering -- you have been answering.  You're certainly an asset to your corporation. </p><p>      OYAMA:  Thank you. </p><p>      MARINO:  Nevertheless, I think it's reprehensible that the chairman, that the CEO, the president, the counsel, none of them thought it was responsible enough for them to be here.  And they sent you into the lion's den.  And you certainly deserve a large portion of their bonus at the end of the year.  </p><p>      OYAMA:  Can I just add one thing?  Our general counsel, he was here in the spring.  He cares very much about this problem...</p><p>      MARINO:  Good. </p><p>      OYAMA:  ... and doing it the right way.  He, I think, sent a letter saying any other day -- he had a longstanding personal commitment for today.  Any other day he would be here and he looks forward to (inaudible)...</p><p>      MARINO:  All right.  I give that to him.  And I remove his name from that list.  And he can keep his bonus.  All right.</p><p>      Let me ask you a question here.  I want to thank Google for what it did for child pornography getting off the Web site.  I was a prosecutor for 18 years and I find it commendable and I put those people away.  </p><p>      So, if you can do that with child pornography, why can you not do it with these rogue Web sites?  And let me follow that up with, why not hire some whiz kids out of college to come in and monitor this and get -- and work for the company to take these off?</p><p>      My daughter who is 16 and my son is 12.  We love to get on the Internet.  And we download music.  And we pay for it.  </p><p>      And I get to a site, and I say this is a new one, this is good, we can get some music here.  My daughter says dad, don't go near that one.  That's illegal.  It's free, and given the fact that you're on Judiciary I don't think you should be doing that.</p><p>      So, it's pretty -- maybe we need to hire her.  But why not?  </p><p>      OYAMA:  So, the two problems are similar in that they're both very serious problems.  They're both things that we all should be working to fight against.  But they're very different in how you go about combating it.  </p><p>      So, for child porn, we are able to design a machine that can detect child porn.  You can detect certain colors that would show up in pornography.  You can detect flesh tones.  You can have a manual reviewer or someone look at the content and they would say this is child porn and it shouldn't appear. </p><p>      We can't do that for copyright just on our own because any video, any clip of content it's going to appear to the user to be the same thing.  And so you need to know from the rights holder, the owner of the right, have you licensed it?  Have you authorized it?  Or is this infringement?</p><p>      MARINO:  I only have a limited amount of time here, and I appreciate your answer.  But we had the technology.  Google has the technology.  We have the brain power in this country.  We certainly can figure it out. </p><p>      Let me move on here.  First of all, Mr. Clark and Mr. O'Leary, I want to thank you for your dedication to law enforcement.  I've been down there for 18 years and thank you so much. </p><p>      And Mr. Almeida, my father was a fireman for 30 years, so I know exactly what you're talking about. </p><p>      So, I want to pose this question to anyone.  It's my understanding that taking down a portion of the site is much more difficult than taking down the entire site, so I'm hearing from the testimony here.  So, is there a more balanced approach that we can assist you in taking, but you take the lead on it, in diffusing this problem and stopping this infringement on this material, this illegal stealing of our materials that is costing us jobs and is costing this country a lot of money?  </p><p>      Do you understand my question?  Please jump in, anyone.  I don't think anyone understands my question.  </p><p>      Ms. Pallante?</p><p>      PALLANTE:  No.  Well, I appreciate the question.  I don't know the answer.</p><p>      Certainly when law enforcement goes before a judge and tries to get a court order that would allow it to seek relief from the Web site and then engage the search engines, the ISPs, the payment processors, et cetera to help, they -- they -- they would like to stop the infringing material and not the non-infringing material.  I don't know if it's a technical solution or if it's just a question of each Web site having different pages where they can easily find the infringing content.  </p><p>      MARINO:  Do any of you agree with me that we do have the brain power and the technology available to figure this out if we want to spend the money?  All right.  </p><p>      Thank you and I yield back my time. </p><p>SMITH:  Great.  Gentleman's time's up. </p><p>      Mr. Almeida, you're recognized for the last five minutes of this hearing.  </p><p>      ALMEIDA:  Thank you for that strategic timing of my recognition, Mr. Chairman.  I appreciate that.  So, in honor of your discretion I will not use the whole time. </p><p>      I would like to first of all associate myself with the comments of my colleague from California at the end of the diocese, Mr. Deutch. I think he's hit the nail on the head.  When you're the last guy you don't want to try to see if you can prolong things any more than usual. </p><p>      I would like to ask the Chair, however, since there's written responses to this security thing, and I tried to write the guy's name down.  I'm new; I don't know.  Maybe it was Stuart Baker.  Maybe we could have Stuart Baker's concerns written so we can have something to compare those with.  And if that's out of order then I'll shut up on that and move right along...</p><p>SMITH:  Mr. Baker's article was asked by unanimous consent to be part of the record from the gentle lady -- the gentle lady from California's giving it to me right now. </p><p>      ALMEIDA:  OK.  Good.  Thank you. </p><p>SMITH:  And if I were a chair I would have him here.  But I'm only temporary chair. </p><p>      ALMEIDA:  Thank you for your compassion for someone who's been here for 61 days. </p><p>      Finally, so that I have something to yield back, I appreciate the concerns and all.  This strikes me as one of those deals where the pursuit of the perfect is going to get in the way of the good.  </p><p>      One thing -- and I apologize for missing the part that I missed, but there was an opportunity to talk with some folks in anther committee that was kind of important.  But I didn't hear anything that said no, this is not an issue.  No, this is not taking place.  No, those jobs of this gentleman on the end are not being threatened.  No, it's not real-time impacts when Mr. Marino can dial it in and be watching it right now. </p><p>      Quite frankly, I think there's an issue -- I don't know how you address it because nobody should leave the room thinking I'm technically savvy.  But -- I don't have anything to type on as a matter of fact.  They even took my iPhone away today.  So. </p><p>      But I'll tell you this.  The impacts are instantaneous.  Once it's downloaded, it's gone.  That horse is out of the barn and it's never coming back.  And when you have a broken leg you need to go to the hospital.  </p><p>      And like it or not -- and I -- and I agree with Mr. Marino's comments.  Way to go.  Whatever they're paying you, it's not enough. And so if those pansies want to come by some day and say hi, tell them they're welcome. </p><p>      So, anyhow, when your leg's broken you got to go to the hospital. And unfortunately you're in the medical business on this stuff.  </p><p>      And so I can just say that my concern is this.  You're a major operational piece of this.  The criminal activities are uncontroverted that are happening.  And to do nothing is wrong.  Nothing happens quick in this -- in this process I believe from my vast amount of experience.  And so it's time to try something. </p><p>       And so while I appreciate the concerns, when I hear a recurring theme of follow the money, there's plenty money around to follow, and that's a good thing.  I'm a Republican.  It's a good thing to make money.</p><p>      So, I will just tell you from my perspective, it's time to move. And while there're other concerns, and we want -- if there was a perfect bill that ever came out of here it would sure be neat for me to be here while it happens.  But I'm guessing it's not going to happen when I do.  </p><p>      So, I would appreciate best recommendations so that we can get moving on in terms of stopping something that's taken several years just to get to this point.  I am not picking on you.  </p><p>      And so with that, Mr. Chairman, I see the light is where it is. I yield back the most time that anybody's yielded back today. </p><p>SMITH:  Very good.  The gentleman will be commended.  </p><p>      I'd like to thank our witnesses for the testimonies today.  And without objection, all members will have five legislative days to submit additional written questions for the witnesses or additional materials for the record.  We thank you all.  We appreciate your testimony on a very difficult subject.  </p><p>      This hearing is adjourned.  </p><p>      END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

The Judiciary Committee will come to order.  Without objection, the chair is authorized to declare recesses of the committee at any time.  I'm going to recognize myself for an opening statement, then the ranking member, and then the chairman and the ranking member of the appropriate subcommittee.    </p><p>      Today's hearing is on legislation that will help protect one of the most productive sectors of the American economy.  While the Digital Millennium Copyright Act does provide some relief to copyright owners whose works are infringed, it only helps in limited circumstances.  The DMCA provides no effective relief when a rogue Web site is foreign-based and foreign-operated, like the Pirate Bay, the 89th most-visited site in the U.S.</p><p>      It doesn't protect trademark owners and consumers from counterfeit and unsafe products like fake prescription medicines and misbranded drugs that are often presented to the public by unlicensed online pharmacies.  Nor does the law assist copyright owners when rogue Web sites contribute to the theft of intellectual property on a massive scale.  </p><p>      And finally, it does nothing to address the use of certain intermediaries, such as payment processors and Internet advertising services that are used by criminals to fund illegal activities. That's where the stop ...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WATT</emphasis>:  Mr. Chairman, I'm having trouble hearing your statement. Can you ...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  I wouldn't want anyone to miss my statement, so I'll make sure that the sound system is working and that I'm close enough to the mic.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WATT</emphasis>:  Turn his mic way up.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  OK.  That's where the Stop Online Piracy Act comes in. This bill focuses not on technology, but on preventing those who engage in criminal behavior from reaching directly into the U.S. market to harm American consumers.  We cannot continue a system that allows criminals to disregard our laws and import counterfeit and pirated goods across our physical borders.  </p><p>      Nor can we fail to take effective and meaningful action when criminals misuse the Internet.  The problem of rogue Web sites is real, immediate and widespread, it harms all sectors of the economy, and it's scope is staggering.  One recent survey found that nearly one-quarter -- one-quarter of global Internet traffic infringes on copyrights.    </p><p>      A second study found that 43 sits classified as digital piracy generated 53 billion visits per year.  And that 26 sites selling just counterfeit prescription drugs generated 51 million hits annually. Since the United States produces the most intellectual property, our country has the most to lose if we fail to address the problem of these rogue Web sites.  </p><p>      Responsible companies and public officials have taken note of the corrosive and damaging effects to rogue Web sites.  One of our witnesses today represents Mastercard Worldwide, a company that takes seriously its obligation to reduce the amount of stolen intellectual property on the Internet.  Mastercard deserves thanks for its commitment to support legislation that addresses the problems of online piracy.  </p><p>      In contrast, another one of the companies represented here today has sought to obstruct the committee's consideration of bipartisan legislation.  Perhaps this should come as no surprise, given that Google just settled a federal criminal investigation into the company's active promotion of rogue Web sites that pushed illegal prescription and counterfeit drugs on American consumers.  </p><p>      In announcing a half-billion dollar forfeiture of illegal profits, the Peter Neronha, who led the investigation, stated, quote, \"Suffice it to say that this is not two or three rogue employees at the consumer service level doing this.  This was a corporate decision to engage in this conduct,\" end quote.  Over several years, Google ignored repeated warnings from the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy and the National Center on Addiction And Substance Abuse at Colombia University that the company was violating federal law.  </p><p>      The company also disregarded requests to block advertisements from rogue pharmacies, screen such sites from searches, and provide warnings about buying drugs over the Internet.  The Wall Street Journal reports Mr. Neronha characterized Google's efforts to appear to control unlawful advertisements as window dressing, since, quote, \"It allowed Google to continue earning revenues from the allegedly illicit ad sales, even as it professed to be taking action against them,\" end quote.  </p><p>      Given Google's record, their objection to authorizing a court to order a search engine to not steer consumers to foreign rogue sites is easily understood.  Unfortunately, the theft of America's intellectual property costs the United States economy more than $110 billion annually, and results in the loss of thousands of American jobs.    </p><p>      Under current law, rogue sites that profit from selling pirated goods are often out of the reach of U.S. law enforcement agencies, and operate without consequences.  The Stop Online Piracy Act helps stop the flow of revenue to rogue Web sites, and ensures the profits from American innovations go to American innovators.  Protecting America's intellectual property will help our economy, create jobs, and discourage illegal Web sites.  </p><p>      That concludes my opening statement, and the gentleman from Michigan, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, is recognized for his opening statement.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CONYERS</emphasis>:  Thank you, Chairman Smith, and good morning to my fellow colleagues on the committee.  This is a very important hearing, and I want to commend you on your statement because you raised some issues that I think we will have to go into quite carefully.    </p><p>      Now, there have been attempts to deal with the problem that's before us today.  But H.R. 3261, Stop Online Piracy Act, represents a great deal of work and some experience from our attempts to deal with this subject before.  I am very pleased that this is a bipartisan bill, and that I think that's very important.  </p><p>      Now, there've been a number of attempts to stop online intellectual property theft and fraud.  Some of the leading Internet service providers and right holders and the best practices standards that are being developed within the advertising network and payment processing companies, and particularly Mastercard, all come to my attention.  I commend them.    </p><p>      But this private cooperation is not sufficient.  Our studies have shown that upwards of one-quarter of all Internet traffic is copyright-infringing.  And to those who say that -- that a bill to stop online theft will break the Internet, I -- I'd like to point out that -- that it's not likely to happen.  Users connect to the Internet through service providers like AT&amp;T and Verizon.    </p><p>      But by most accounts -- and I have to bring up Google's name again in the beginning of this discussion -- Google's search engine connects users to Internet content more often than any other, and places the most advertisements.  As users surf the Web, their computers connect with the main name servers to resolve the site name that they type into their browser and its location on the Web.  </p><p>      Now, we're getting a number of reactions from this proposal. Some right holders have said that the market-based process outlined in section 103 of the bill doesn't go far enough and immunizes too many players who profit from piracy.  But on the other hand, there's some in the technology section that have said this bill will break the Internet, and strangle startups and Silicon Valley giants alike.    </p><p>      And so I reluctantly ask to put this into the record -- The Attack of the Internet Killers.  Now, this is ...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  Without objection, that'll be made a part ...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CONYERS</emphasis>:  \"This is very serious business.  Don't walk, run.  Tell Congress there's a better way.  Threatens global Internet security, kills cloud computer, and an American jog-crushing monster.  That's our bill H.R. 3261.\"  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  Isn't that a comic? </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CONYERS</emphasis>:  No, this is serious.  It's a -- it's a terrible thing. And that we -- we ought to know better.  Now, on -- on a more serious note, we have, from our friends in the American Civil Liberties Union a -- a -- a caution that I have to take more seriously.  Because they have some questions that they -- I -- I don't think -- I think needs to be examined here.    </p><p>      And that is, the first is that there's an attorney general section of the bill that only the Justice Department, in its wisdom, can ask a court to filter or block Web content.  What the American Civil Liberties Union is telling us is that we will, with this legislation, inadvertently involve non-fringing (sic) operators, and that this with a -- would violate their constitutional rights.  </p><p>      Now, against that I'm going to ask to put in the eminent First Amendment scholar, Floyd Abrams', recommendation that says that the notion that this bill threatens freedom of expression is insupportable.  It protects creative free speech, as Congress has done, and the Judiciary Committee especially has been particularly sensitive to protecting.    </p><p>      And so I ask unanimous consent to put in the statement of attorney Floyd Abrams, and I yield back the balance of my time.  Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  Without objection.  Thank you, Mr. Conyers.  </p><p>      The gentleman from Virginia, Mr. Goodlatte, the chairman of the Intellectual Properties Subcommittee, is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOODLATTE</emphasis>:  Mr. Chairman, thank you for holding this hearing and thank you for your leadership on this issue.  </p><p>      For more than two centuries, America's economic strength has been built on a firm foundation.  The rule of law, respect for individuals and private property, and the promotion of industry through policies that reward creativity and innovation are essential virtues that helped a fledging nation encourage the initiative of its citizens and, in time, emerges the most advanced and prosperous on Earth.    </p><p>      These virtues are not universal.  In an increasingly connected world, threats that emanate from areas where these principles are not shared are jeopardizing our ability to sustain the incentives needed to foster growth and development, and advance human progress.  These threats create challenges for us in both the physical world and the virtual world, where the systematic and willful violation of intellectual property rights now poses a clear, present and growing danger to American creators and innovators, U.S. consumers, and our collective confidence in the Internet ecosystem.  </p><p>      In order to continue to incentivize artists, authors and inventors we need to ensure that these creators have the ability to earn a return on their investments.  Increasingly, foreign piracy is stripping creators of that ability.  Within the Internet ecosystem today, there are legitimate commercial sites that offer consumers authorized goods and services.  Indeed, many exciting new technologies and Web sites help content owners distribute music, movies, books, games, software and other copyrighted works in ways that were not even imaginable 10 years ago.  </p><p>      However, there are also rogue sites that steal the intellectual property of others and traffic in counterfeit and pirated goods.  In recent years, these Web sites have grown and evolved.  They have become increasingly sophisticated, and rival legitimate sites in appearance, operation, and indicia (ph) of reliability.  U.S. consumers are frequently led to these sites by search engines that list them among the top search results.  </p><p>      After clicking on a site, they are immediately reassured by the logos of U.S. payment processors and the presence of major corporate advertising supporting the site.  These sites sell infringing copyrighted works, but they are not limited to those.  Increasingly, these sites also offer counterfeit goods, such as counterfeit automobile parts, medicines, baby formula, and other products that can pose serious threats to the health and safety of American citizens.  </p><p>      What's worse, these rogue sites often list the real customer service contact information for the legitimate companies, which deteriorates the reputation of the legitimate maker of these goods. For all these reasons, I have joined Chairman Smith in introducing the Stop Online Piracy Act, which creates new tools for law enforcement to combat these growing threats.  </p><p>      Specifically, this legislation gives law enforcement the authority to bring an action in a federal court to declare a Web site in violation of the law, and allow the court to issue a court order to intermediaries to block transactions and access to those sites found to be infringing.  The bill also provides content owners with a limited liability to request the court to declare a Web site as violating the law.    </p><p>      However, the content owners must first attempt to work directly with financial services and advertising intermediaries to solve the problem.  Only if those parties cannot reach agreement are content owners allowed to seek a court declaration against an infringing Web site.  It is my hope that this provision will allow content owners and intermediaries to work together to root out infringing sites quickly.  </p><p>      It should be noted that there has been criticism from many in the online community about the scope of this bill, its effect on the functioning of the Internet, and that it could entangle legitimate Web sites.  It's my -- it is not my intention to do so, and I stand ready to work with the tech community to address any legitimate concerns they have.  </p><p>       I have requested detailed comments from the tech community about their concerns, and look forward to continuing to work with them and Chairman Smith and other members of the Judiciary Committee to ensure that this legislation punishes lawbreakers while protecting content owners as well as legitimate online innovators and startups.  </p><p>      Mr. Chairman, this is a good bill.  But a number of issues raised about it need to be carefully addressed.  I look forward to working with you on those issues as we move forward to protect content owners online, and I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Goodlatte.  </p><p>      The gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. Watt, the ranking member of the Intellectual Properties Subcommittee, is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WATT</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Mr. Chairman, in my experience there's usually only one thing at stake when we have long lines outside a  hearing, as we do today.  And when giant companies like those opposing this bill, and their supporters, start throwing around rhetoric like this is -- this bill will kill the Internet, or it's an attempt to build the great firewall of America -- and that one thing is usually money.  </p><p>      While I appreciate that the stakeholders of Internet companies that have market caps in the billions of dollars care, as we all do, about the First Amendment and other precious rights, it seems clear to me that the obstinate opposition we have seen in the days since introduction of the Stop Online Piracy Act is really about the bottom line.  Piracy and counterfeiting make money, and lots of it.  </p><p>      This is not speculative.  Sites that specialize in stolen goods attract a lot of eyeballs which, in turn, attracts a lot of advertising, which in turn means, well, you got it -- lots of money. To be fair, many of the copyright and trademark owners who want this bill to help enforce their rights are also businesses and are also motivated by money.  But in my mind, stopping theft of your work or products is an appropriate incentive to secure profits.  </p><p>      But doing nothing, or next to nothing, to prevent theft through the use of tools a company creates or controls is not an appropriate incentive to secure profits.  So as policymakers, our goal must be to confront the criminal enterprises that are flourishing on the Internet, stealing from the rights holders, and visiting untold harms on consumers.  Doing nothing is not an option.  </p><p>      Not only are online piracy and counterfeiting drains on our economy, they expose unwary consumers to fraud, identity theft, confusion and, at worst, physical harm.  The penetration of hazardous products and good into the American marketplace, including our military supply chain, poses an unacceptable risk of serious bodily injury or death to our citizens.  </p><p>      Tolerance of online theft of music, movies and software reinforces a culture of entitlement, stifles creativity, injures artists, and undermines jobs, stability and growth.  While I have never been a big advocate of current seizure laws, why would we not -- as this bill does -- give the attorney general, at a minimum, the same power to block foreign thieves from access to the U.S. markets as the attorney general has for domestic markets.    </p><p>      Given the limits of government resources, why should we not establish a framework to enable rights holders to engage specific intermediaries within the Internet ecosystem to meet the challenges of online piracy and counterfeiting.  I think one of the big problems here is that, to date, the economic incentives for the big Internet companies to work against online piracy are just not there.  To be sure, there are many intermediaries that are inadvertently involved with pirate sites, and have come to the table with construction suggestions for crafting a balanced bill that will work.  </p><p>      I commend the ISPs, payment processors like Mastercard who share today, and Visa, GoDaddy, who is the largest registrar of domain names, and a number of software companies who have raised reasonable concerns and are willing to work together to address them. But again, when I hear overblown claims like this bill is a, quote, \"giveaway to greedy trial lawyers or a killer of innovation and entrepreneurs, that the co-sponsors of this bill are the Internet killers,\" I become suspicious of the message as well as the messengers.  </p><p>      And as one who cares deeply about the constitutional guarantees of free speech and due process, it is beyond troubling to hear hyperbolic charges that this bill will open the floodgates to government censorship.  That's simply not the world we live in.  And to guess that by establishing a means to combat theft of Internet property online we will somehow devolve into a repressive regime belittles the circumstances under which true victims of tyrannical government actually live.  </p><p>      I urge everyone to set aside all the hyperbole and accusations. I'm the first to admit that I don't like or love everything about this bill.  But its very strong -- it's a very strong, solid effort to begin the process of responsibly providing the attorney general and rights holders with necessary tools to keep pace with, and ultimately to outpace, the high-tech bandits roving the Internet.    </p><p>      I believe there are still some things we can do in the legislation to avoid unintended consequences, maintain the integrity of the Internet, and preserve certain freedoms, including many of the specific suggestions made by the ranking member.  Our staffs have worked closely together to identify ways to improve this bill, and we will continue to do so.  </p><p>      And I appreciate the fact that crafting a bill governing online -- the online environment  requires attention to technological details.  But I start from the premise that Internet freedom does not and cannot mean Internet lawlessness.  And that the goals of freedom and lawfulness are no more incompatible in the Internet space than they are in the physical world.  </p><p>      Mr. Chairman, there's an African proverb that says when elephants fight it's the grass that suffers.  Perhaps if we refocus this debate on the ills that may befall innocent consumers who fall prey to the perils of piracy and counterfeited goods, rather than on the balance sheets of all the big companies, we can reach a worthy compromise.  I look forward to hearing from the witnesses, and engaging in ongoing dialogue as we move the bill forward.  The stakes for America and American consumers are too high to get engaged in too much hyperbole.  </p><p>      Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Watt.  Without objection, other members' opening statements will be made a part of the record.  We welcome our distinguished panelists today, and I will now introduce them.  </p><p>      Our first witness is Maria Pallante, the register of copyrights. Ms. Pallante was appointed by the librarian of Congress, Dr. James Billington, as the 12th register on June 1 of this year.  Immediately prior to that appointment, Ms. Pallante served as the acting register. As register, Ms. Pallante continues the tradition of serving as the principle advisor to Congress on matters of copyright policy.    </p><p>      Ms. Pallante has spent much of her career in the office where she previously served as the associate register for policy and international affairs, deputy general counsel, and policy advisor.  In addition, Ms. Pallante spent nearly a decade as intellectual property counsel and director of licensing for the Guggenheim Museums in New York.  She earned her law degree from George Washington University, and her bachelor's degree from Misericordia University, where she was also awarded an honorary degree of humane letters.  </p><p>      Our second witness is John P. Clark, the vice president of global security and chief security officer for Pfizer.  Since joining Pfizer in 2008, Mr. Clark has been recognized as a leading authority on the threat that counterfeit medicines pose to patient health and safety. Prior to joining Pfizer, Mr. Clark served as deputy assistant secretary of U.S. Immigration and Custom Enforcement.  In that capacity, he was responsible for overall management and coordination of the agency's operation, and he served as the assistant security's principle representative to the Department of Homeland Security and to the law enforcement and intelligence communities.  </p><p>      Starting as a U.S. Border Patrol agent in 1980, Mr. Clark spent more than 25 years as a law enforcement professional before retiring from public service.  A New York native, Mr. Clark received his bachelor of science degree in history from the State University of New York at Binghamton, and a master of science degree from National Louis University.    </p><p>      Before joining DOJ ...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)   </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  (OFF-MIC).  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  Excuse me.  Our third witness is Michael O'Leary, the senior executive vice president for global policy and external affairs at the Motion Picture Association of America.  In that position, Mr. O'Leary supervises all international, federal and state affairs operations around the world for the association.  Before moving to MPAA, Mr. O'Leary served more than a dozen years at the Department of Justice, where he worked on legislative intellectual property and enforcement issues.  </p><p>      During his tenure at the DOJ, he served as the deputy chief of the computer crime and intellectual property section, where he prosecuted and supervised some of the most significant domestic and international criminal and IP cases undertaken by the department. Before joining DOJ, Mr. O'Leary spent five years serving as counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee.  He grew up in Montana, is a graduate of Arizona State University and the University of Arizona school of law.  </p><p>      Our fourth witness is Ms. Linda Kirkpatrick, who serves as the group head of customer performance integrity at Mastercard worldwide. In this role, Ms. Kirkpatrick is responsible for driving the strategy, development and execution of global customer compliance programs, data integrity, and dispute resolution and management.  Ms. Kirkpatrick has been with Mastercard since 1997.  She earned her bachelor of arts degree in economics, with a concentration in finance, from Manhattanville College in Purchase, New York.  </p><p>      Our fifth witness is Katherine Oyama, a policy counsel for Google, where she focuses on copyright and trademark law and policy. In 2009 to early 2011, she worked in the office of the vice president as associate counsel and deputy counsel to Vice President Joseph R. Biden.  Prior to her government service, Ms. Oyama was a litigation associate with Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr, where she worked on intellectual property cases, government regulatory litigation, and pro bono matters.  </p><p>      She previously worked in the media entertainment practice of a New York-based strategy consulting firm, for the Silicon Valley-based Internet startup LoudCloud, Inc., and for the Texas-based company Electronic Data Systems.  Ms. Oyama is a graduate of Smith College, where she graduated with honors in government, and the University of Cal at Berkeley school of law, where she served as senior articles editor of the Berkeley Technology Law Journal.  </p><p>      Our final witness is Paul Almeida, the president of the Department of Professional Employees of the AFL-CIO.  Mr. Almeida has served as president of the DPE since February 2001.  Prior to his tenure with DPE, Mr. Almeida served as president of the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers for seven years. Mr. Almeida earned his degree in engineering from Franklin Institute in Boston, and he resides in Arlington, Massachusetts.  </p><p>      We welcome you all.  Every member of the panel will have five minutes to give their testimony.  And we have a light on the table to indicate when that time is about to expire and has expired.  Again, we welcome you.  </p><p>      And Ms. Pallante, we'll begin with you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PALLANTE</emphasis>:  Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to appear today.  And I would also like to thank you, Ranking Member Conyers, Chairman Goodlatte, Ranking Member Watt of the subcommittee, and all of the members of the committee for your continued leadership on copyright policy.  </p><p>Congress has updated the Copyright Act many times in the past 200 years, including the enforcement provisions.  But as we all know, this work is never finished.  Infringers today are sophisticated and they are bold.  They blatantly stream and disseminate books, music, films and software through Web sites using the services of trusted search engines, advertising networks, and credit card companies.  </p><p>      This is not a problem that we can accept.  In my view, it is about the rule of law on the Internet.  Much of the bill employs a strategy of follow the money.  I testified in support of this approach in March, and I still agree that it is an important part of the equation.  Many sites make money by selling illegal access to copyrighted works or by offering related advertising.  </p><p>      But the approach does have some limitations.  Many of the worst sites do not sell infringing content.  They offer it for free.  And they do not run ads.  I would like to offer an example involving Google, but I would first like to say that I have a great deal of respect for Google and I cannot imagine the Internet without it. However, if you conduct a search for the phrase \"download movies,\" Google search engine will supply the words for free.  </p><p>      And it will return a list of sites that offer illegal copies or streams at no charge and with no advertising.  These cases require a different kind of strategy than follow the money.  The same is true when damage is imminent, for example when a site is streaming live sporting events or selling movies before they have been released to the public.  </p><p>      In the context of foreign infringing sites, the bill addresses this problem by giving the Department of Justice the power to require search engines to dismantle direct hyperlinks and to require service providers to block the access of subscribers within the United States. These actions require court approval, and incorporate the existing legal standards of seizure and civil forfeiture law.  These are the same standards that ICE has used effectively for Operation In Our Sights.  </p><p>      Mr. Chairman, I do not want to suggest that blocking Web sites is a small step.  It is not.  And the public interest groups that oppose this part of the bill are right to be concerned about unintended consequences.  However, it may ultimately come down to a question of philosophy for Congress.  If the attorney general is chasing 21st century infringers, what kinds of tools does Congress want to provide, how broad, and how flexible?  </p><p>      The bill also gives copyright owners some tools, but these do not involve search engines or ISPs, and I think that this is the right calibration.  Put another way, the bill reflects the fact that many industries contribute to the success of the Internet, and it properly distinguishes between the actions that law enforcement and private citizens can bring.  </p><p>      One of the more interesting aspects of the bill is that before authors or other copyright owners can seek court orders it requires them to alert payment processors and ad networks about infringing content, and requests that they sever financial ties.  This approach creative, and it provides incentives for the parties to cooperate.  It also allows for counter-notification.  </p><p>      However, whether the notification system is ultimately effective will largely depend upon whether it can be implemented in a manner that is clear and fair for all involved.  The intermediaries at issue are running businesses in good faith, and the Web sites at issue are entitled to due process.  The bill does incorporate due process where court orders are involved.  The notification system would operate outside the purview of a court, and therefore it may benefit from further due process review.    </p><p>      Finally, I do not believe it is the intent of the bill to negate the safe harbors of the DMCA, and I do read it that way.  Nothing subjects ISPs to liability for their acts or their failures to act. No monetary relief can be obtained.  And the injunctive relief permitted by the bill appears to be consistent with what the DMCA already permits.  </p><p>      This said, the bill has many moving parts.  And I note that a number of stakeholders with differing perspectives have offered productive suggestions.  As the committee works to refine the bill, I would encourage you to fully consider these suggestions.  However, in closing, I would also like to state that I believe that Congress has a responsibility to protect the exclusive rights of copyright owners. And I hope that you will advance the bill with this in mind.  </p><p>      Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  Thank you, Ms. Pallante.  </p><p>      Mr. Clark?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLARK</emphasis>:  Chairman Smith, Ranking Member Conyers, distinguished members of the committee ...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WATT</emphasis>:  Can you pull the mic a little bit closer, please, or cut it on?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLARK</emphasis>:  It's a pleasure to appear before you today to discuss the threat that counterfeits (sic) medicines pose to the health and safety of patients in the United States and around the world.  It's a global issue.  </p><p>      As vice president of global security for Pfizer, I work to mitigate the threat that counterfeit medicines pose to the health and safety of patients who rely on Pfizer medicines to live healthier and longer lives.  I commend the chairman, the ranking member, and the committee for co-sponsoring the Stop Online Piracy Act for their legislative effort.  It's a positive step forward in our fight against counterfeit medicines.    </p><p>      Counterfeit medicines pose a threat because of the conditions under which they are manufactured, in unlicensed, unregulated sites, frequently under unsanitary conditions.  In many instances, they contain none of the active pharmaceutical ingredients found in authentic medicine or in incorrect dosages, depriving patients of the therapeutic benefits of the incorrect -- of the medicine prescribed by their physicians.  </p><p>      In others, they may contain toxic ingredients, such as heavy metals, arsenic, pesticides, rat poison, brick dust, floor wax, leaded highway paint, and even sheet rock or wallboard.  Counterfeit medicines are a global problem, and I'm pleased to share our experience in combating them and how the Stop Online Piracy Act aims to strengthen the U.S. arsenal.  </p><p>      Pfizer has implemented an aggressive anti-counterfeiting that attacks counterfeits at their source.  Since 2004, we've prevented more than 138 million dosages of counterfeit Pfizer medicines alone, more than 68 million finished dosages, and enough active pharmaceutical ingredient to manufacture another 70 million from reaching global patients.  </p><p>      Additional raids by law enforcement, based on evidence we have provided, have also resulted in seizures of millions of dosages of counterfeits marketed by other major pharmaceutical companies.  In the United States, we work closely with ICE, the FBI and FDA on their investigations, and with customs and border protection to improve their ability to prevent counterfeit Pfizer medicines from reaching U.S. patients.  </p><p>      While the true scope of the counterfeit problems is hard to estimate, we have confirmed that counterfeit Pfizer medicines have been found and seized in at least 101 countries, and have reached the supply chains in 53 countries.  Technology has created a new front in this battle.  Today, the major threat to patients in the U.S. are the many professional-looking Web sites that promise safe, FDA-approved, branded medicines from Canada or the U.K.  </p><p>      And for that reason, we appreciate the chairman and ranking member's focus on the threat in Title 1 of the bill, giving the attorney general new tools and incentivizing private stakeholders to act against rogue Web sites.  With immunity in place for every stakeholder's  action, it would be an important step forward. Patients don't realize that many of the Web sites don't disclose the true source of the products they dispense, or even where their -- the alleged dispensing online pharmacy is located.  </p><p>      In such instances, the World Health Organization has estimated that patients have more than a 50 percent chance of receiving a counterfeit medicine.  I happen to believe that -- that's a very low estimate.  I'd like to share two short case studies.  The first is RX North (ph).  Patients who visited RX North's Web site thought they were ordering from a Canadian pharmacy, and would receive authentic FDA-approved medicines.  </p><p>      In reality, the medicines dispensed from RX North (ph) were traced from China, where they were manufactured, through Hong Kong, on to Dubai, into the U.K., where they were intercepted.  Among the medicines seized by U.K. customs were Lipitor, found to contain only 82 percent to 86 percent of the active pharmaceutical ingredient, which is an incredibly high number for most counterfeits -- as well as counterfeit versions of medicines from four other companies, including one found to contain trace -- traces of metal.  </p><p>      Second is the case of Kevin Xu, convicted of misbranding drugs and trafficking in counterfeit goods.  It demonstrates how attractive a target the U.S. supply chain is for those who counterfeit our medicines, and how weak our current penalties for counterfeiting medicine are.  During meetings with our undercover consultant, Xu boasted of the global scope of his criminal enterprise.  </p><p>      He offered a list of branded counterfeit medicines that he could provide, including five Pfizer medicines.  The evidence we gathered was shared with an ICE investigation of Xu.  An order placed by an ICE undercover agent was filled with only -- with a counterfeit.  When the tablets were tested, they were found to contain an insignificant levels of the active pharmaceutical ingredient found in the authentic medicine.  </p><p>      Xu was sentenced to just 78 months in federal prison without parole, the maximum sentence under the applicable U.S. sentencing guideline range.  This punishment does not reflect the seriousness of the crime.  The Stop Online Piracy Act takes a positive step toward making these penalties even tougher.  </p><p>      Pharmaceutical counterfeiting is a low-risk, high-profit criminal activity that has attracted drug traffickers, firearms smugglers and terrorists.  One of the principle players in the 2003 Lipitor breach here in the U.S. was a convicted cocaine trafficker.  In 2006, the U.S. attorney for the eastern district of Michigan announced the indictment of 19 people who gave a portion of their profits from the sale of counterfeit Viagra to Hezbollah.  </p><p>      Those who counterfeit medicines are confident that even if caught they'll get just a slap on the wrist.  Even here in the U.S., the maximum sentence imposed under the Food and Drug Cosmetics Act is just three years.  Recognizing the inherent risks that any counterfeit medicine poses to patients, we must enhance the penalties for pharmaceutical counterfeiting to provide a greater deterrent.    </p><p>      Expedited procedures must be in place to shut down rogue Web sites dispensing counterfeit medicines to the U.S.   The Stop Online Piracy Act is a significant step forward in those efforts, and I thank the chairman and ranking member for introducing this important piece of legislation.  I'd like to work with you so that our laws recognize the grave health and safety risks posed by counterfeit medicines, and serve as a deterrent.  </p><p>      I work with foreign government representatives in the global fight against counterfeiting.  It's hypocritical for us to speak with foreign government representatives, as I often do, about their lack of effective legislation when U.S. law is still lacking.  This bill, if enacted with strong penalties and mechanisms to shut down rogue Web sites, will be highly effective in our global argument for all governments to fully appreciate the serious health and safety aspects of this problem, and encourage similar efforts around the world.  </p><p>      Thank you again for this opportunity to express my views.  For Pfizer, pharmaceutical counterfeiting is first and foremost an issue of patient health and safety.  We look forward to working with you on the global fight against counterfeit medicines.  Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Clark.  </p><p>      Mr. O'Leary? </p><p>      O'LEARY:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Conyers, Chairman Goodlatte, and Ranking Member Watt, distinguished members of the committee.  I'm  honored to be here, and thank you for holding this important hearing.  I also want to thank you for introducing this legislation, which will help protect American creativity and American jobs from thieves who hide overseas and seek to profit off the hard work of people in this country.  </p><p>      I also want to acknowledge my fellow panelists.  I'm pleased to be here with all of them today, and look forward to working with them throughout this process.  I want to particularly acknowledge the contributions of Ms. Kirkpatrick and Mastercard.  As the chairman alluded to earlier,  they are truly a fine example of a corporation trying to make the Internet a safe marketplace for people all over the world.  And frankly, their example is one to be followed.  </p><p>      Critics would have you, as Mr. Watt alluded to, believe that this is a battle between two giant corporations.  And there's certainly a lot of truth to that.  But I'm also very proud to be part of a wide- ranging coalition that includes the AFL-CIO, who we'll hear from shortly. Members of the Chamber of Commerce, big business, small business, individual creators, and entrepreneurs.  So I think critics would have you believe that this bill is really about supporting Hollywood and -- and things like that.  </p><p>      But the truth of the matter, when you look behind the rhetoric and the hyperbole, is that it goes -- intellectual property is something which affects every facet of the American economy.  And it affects people all over the country.  In cases of the industry that I represent, the American Motion Picture and Television industry, we believe that these jobs are worth protecting.  They're more fully detailed in my written testimony, but I would just mention a few.  </p><p>      There are people like Dan Lemieux, who's a stunt coordinator from Michigan.  He's worked on numerous films, television shows like Nip Tuck, The Shield.  The industry includes over 95,000 small businesses. They employ 10 people or less.  Businesses like Fletcher Camera, which is in Chicago.  They have 25 employees in that small business, and they provide movie equipment for productions that occur all over the -- all over the Midwest.  </p><p>      There are hundreds of thousands of businesses that provide services to productions.  There's a small paint and decorating firm in Baltimore, Maryland.  It's a fifth-generation, family-run operation and it has supplied paint for virtually every major production which has occurred in the mid-Atlantic region over the past few years.  </p><p>      I want to be very clear with this committee that hard work, innovation and creativity are not solely the province of people who live in northern California.  There are people all over this country who contribute to the economy every day, who contribute to our culture, who contribute to what we make creatively.  And their jobs are just as important and just as worth protecting as anyone else's.  </p><p>      And that's why we think this bill is so important.  Because it's a positive step in that direction.  In this economic climate, we simply cannot afford to turn our back on any industry which is coming forward and producing things that are -- that we can take all over the world and be successful with.  Our industry competes.  </p><p>      When we are given an opportunity to compete globally, we succeed. Where we have trouble, frankly, Mr. Chairman, is where we don't have an opportunity to compete fairly.  And one of the problems we have is competing with people who are trying to steal our stuff.  We're not before the Congress looking for a handout or a bailout.  We're simply asking for an opportunity to stop from stealing the products that we make.  </p><p>      In recent weeks, you've heard a lot of spurious arguments about this legislation.  They've been chronicled in a number of the opening remarks.  That it violates the First Amendment, that it undermines existing (inaudible) and protection law, that it somehow stifles innovation, and it will, yes, break the Internet.  I irony, of course, of that argument is that I believe it was first heard -- it was first raised by those opposing the DMCA many years ago, as the chairman will recall.  </p><p>      and I believe some of those same people are here today opposing this bill because they think it will undermine the DMCA.  So there's a bit of irony there which seems to be lost inside the Beltway.  But I suspect that outside the Beltway, people see it for what it is.  These -- these allegations that you're hearing are simply taken from the playbook of those people who have consistently opposed every effort that the Congress has come forward with in the last few years to protect intellectual property.  </p><p>      The good news is, is that every time Congress protects intellectual property the Internet flourishes.  Every time the United States stands up for legitimacy over illegitimacy the Internet gets bigger and stronger.  More things are available to consumers, more products are available to consumers, we make more movies, they see more television.    </p><p>      Protecting legitimacy is a positive thing for the economy and for innovation, and people that tell you otherwise are wrong.  They've been wrong when they've been raising these -- these arguments for the past two decades, and they're wrong in the context of this bill.  What you understand so clearly, Mr. Chairman, is that the Stop Online Piracy -- and the Stop Online Piracy Act reflects this -- is that there is a very great difference between legitimate marketplace and the illicit sites and services that we are talking about.  </p><p>      The legitimate market is protected against the threat -- when the legitimate market is protected against the threat of online theft, the only people who lose are those that do not work, take no risk, make no investment.  And said, those are the people that simply try to profit off the hard work of others.  </p><p>      We've also heard arguments that Congress should limit its approach to the threat of rogue sites to, quote, \"following the money.\"  It's worth noting that whoever usually makes that argument is really saying you should follow someone else's money.  If we are, in fact, going to follow the money -- which is something we should do -- we should follow all of the money, not just some of it.  </p><p>      Piracy is a complex problem that can't be fixed in piecemeal solutions, but this bill is an important first step in trying to deal with what is a very real and growing threat.  This is fundamentally about jobs and about protecting the jobs that Americans have creating products that are enjoyed all over the world.  </p><p>      Ultimately, someone once said that to lead is to choose.  And the bill, Mr. Chairman, that you put before the Congress in this debate is one which provides a number of choices.  It's a choice between illegal and legitimate.  It's a choice between a safe, vibrant Internet for everyone in a black market Internet.  It's a -- it's a choice between protecting American creativity and jobs, or protecting thieves.  </p><p>      These are simple choices, from our perspective, and with the leadership that's been provided by this committee we look forward to this process of debating this bill and putting something on the president's desk that both Republicans and Democrats can support. And, at the end of the day, will allow these hardworking Americans to keep their job and keep creating the products that the world enjoys. Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. O'Leary.    </p><p>      Ms. Kirkpatrick?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KIRKPATRICK</emphasis>:  Thank you.  Good morning, Chairman Smith, Ranking Member Conyers, and members of the committee.  My name is Linda Kirkpatrick and I am group head, franchise development, customer performance integrity at Mastercard wide -- worldwide, in Purchase, New York.    </p><p>      Mastercard commends the committee on its attention to the issue of Internet-based infringement, including the work that went into H.R. 3261, the Stop Online Piracy Act.  We greatly appreciate the opportunity to be here today, and look forward to working with you to combat this critical issue.    </p><p>      Mastercard's rules and requirements prohibit the use of its system for any illegal purposes, including for the sale of products or services that infringe on intellectual property rights.  Mastercard recognizes the important role it plays in combating this issue, and has taken a number of steps that demonstrate its commitment to this important cause.  </p><p>      These efforts which are discussed in my written testimony, including publishing the Mastercard antipiracy policy, which sets out the specific process by which Mastercard and rights holders can work together to identify and prevent the sale of infringing products or services, working with the White House's Office of U.S. Intellectual Property Enforcement coordinator in the development of industry best practices to address online infringement, and the implementation and maintenance of Mastercard's business risk assessment and mitigation program, otherwise known as our brand program.  </p><p>      By way of background, Mastercard operates a global payment system that connects over 1 billion cardholders and millions of merchants worldwide to complete Mastercard-branded payment transactions. Mastercard neither issues payment cards to cardholders, nor does it contract with merchants to accept payment cards.  Rather, Mastercard's financial institution customers issue payment cards to cardholders and/or contract with merchants to accept the cards.  </p><p>      The card-issuing customers are known as \"issuer.\"  Those customers that contract with merchants for card acceptance are commonly called \"acquirers.\"  Each cardholder's account relationship is with the issuer that issued the card to the cardholder, and each merchant's acceptance relationship is with its acquirer.    </p><p>      Mastercard has a long history of working with law enforcement, private stakeholders, its customers and others to address illegal or otherwise brand-damaging activities that may involve the Mastercard payment system or the unauthorized use of our widely-recognized family of payment brands.  Our commitment to working with rights holders to prevent the Mastercard system from being used to facilitate online infringement is evidenced by our industry-leading antipiracy policy, which is publicly available on our Internet site.  </p><p>      In accordance with that policy, Mastercard has established procedures that apply when a law enforcement entity or rights holder brings to Mastercard's attention evidence of alleged infringement.  We have a established an e-mail address for the submission of such requests and a set of information requirements for such requests which are largely similar to the information required of rights holders in H.R. 3261.  </p><p>      The process we have implemented was developed collaboratively through strong working relationships with rights holders and their trade associations, and has led to the investigation of thousands of Internet sites and the termination of hundreds of rogue merchants. Mastercard has also worked closely with the White House's Office of the U.S. Intellectual Property Enforcement coordinator in the development of a best practices document to address online infringement.   </p><p>      Development of the best practices document involved input from a wide variety of stakeholders, including numerous representatives from the rights holder community, payment networks, and other parties involved in online commerce.  The best practices are designed to assist rights holders in protecting their intellectual property through a voluntary system, and in no way diminished the ability of rights holders to take independent action to enforce their intellectual property rights.  </p><p>      Our business risk assessment and mitigation program, or brand program, is another key component of Mastercard's corporate efforts to preserve the integrity of Mastercard payment system and protect against illegal and brand-damaging transactions.  More specifically, the brand program serves to restrict access to the Mastercard system by merchants whose products and services may pose significant fraud, regulatory, or legal risks.  </p><p>      The brand program was created to enforce Mastercard rules prohibiting acquirers from engaging in, or supporting, any merchant activity that is illegal or that may damage the goodwill of Mastercard or reflect negatively on the Mastercard brand.  Merchant activities that infringe upon the intellectual property rights of another are expressly covered on the -- under the protocols of the brand program.  </p><p>      Mastercard is fully committed to continuing to address this important issue.  As the committee moves forward with legislation, Mastercard believes it is essential to ensure that any obligations imposed on payment systems are capable of being readily implemented through reasonable policies and procedures, and that payment systems be shielded from litigation and liability when acting in accordance with the bill's requirements.  </p><p>      In my written testimony, we have offered a few general comments on the bill along those lines that we believe are consistent with the committee's objectives,  I look forward to answering any questions that you may have.  Thank you..  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  Thank you, Ms. Kirkpatrick.  </p><p>      And Ms. Oyama?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  Thank you.  Chairman Smith, Ranking Member Conyers, members of the committee, thank you so much for the opportunity to testify today, not just on behalf of Google, but also on behalf of the Consumer Electronics Association, CCIA, Net Coalition, TechNet, TechAmerica, which together represent thousands of companies.  </p><p>      Google takes the problem of online piracy and counterfeiting very seriously.  We devote our best engineering talent, and tens of millions of dollars every year, to fight it.  In the last year alone, we have spent more than $60 million to weed out bad actors from our ad services.  We have shut down nearly 150,000 AdWords accounts, mostly based on our own detection efforts.  And so far this year, we've processed 5 million DMCA take-down requests, targeting nearly 5 million items.    </p><p>      We are as motivated as anyone to get this right, but the Stop Online Piracy Act is not the right approach.  SOPA would undermine the legal, commercial and cultural architecture that has propelled the extraordinary growth of Internet commerce over the past decade, a sector that has grown to $2 trillion in annual U.S. GDP, including $300 billion from online advertising.  </p><p>      Virtually every major Internet company, from Twitter to Facebook, Yahoo! and eBay, as well as a diverse array of other groups, from venture capitalists to librarians to musicians have expressed serious concerns about this bill.  Unfortunately, this legislation is overbroad.  It undermines the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which has for more than a decade struck a balance.  </p><p>      The DMCA provides copyright owners with immediate recourse when they discover infringement online, while also giving service providers the certainty that they need to invest in the products on which millions of Americans rely.  The bill sweeps in innocent Web sites that have violated no law.  It imposes harsh and arbitrary sanctions without due process.  </p><p>      The following example shows how the bill, as currently written, would work.  Imagine a Web site, let's call it Dave's Online Emporium, which enables small businesses to sell clothing and accessories.  More than 99 percent of the sellers on Dave's Emporium are entirely legitimate.  But, unbeknownst to Dave, one seller has started selling counterfeit bags and T-shirts that -- that parody a copyrighted design.   </p><p>      Dave's Emporium takes great care to comply with copyright laws, including take-down procedures, including repeat infringement provisions of the DMCA.  But under the Stop Online Piracy Act the entire site could be deemed, quote, \"dedicated to theft\" based on the violations of this single seller, and the whole business effectively shut down.  Just about any private party, a corporation, a copyright troll, someone with an axe to grind could send a notice to payment and advertising companies to terminate services to the site without first involving law enforcement or triggering any judicial process.  </p><p>      The complaining party has no duty to contact Dave's Emporium directly to resolve the issue before going straight to ads and payment services to terminate his service.  If the Emporium fails to respond with a counter-notice within five days Dave's site could effectively be put out of business.    </p><p>      Facing these potential risks, Dave might think twice about establishing his Online Emporium in the first place.  Countless Web sites of all kinds -- commercial, social, personal -- could be shuttered or put out of business based on allegations that may or may not be valid.  And the resulting cloud of legal uncertainty would threaten new investment, entrepreneurship and innovation.  </p><p>      In a new study of venture capitalists released today, more than 80 percent said that the Safe Harbor provisions of digital copyright laws are essential. Weakening those Safe Harbor provisions would have a recession-like impact on new investment.  And at the same time, this proposed law imposes new and unclear obligations on Internet service providers to take, quote, \"technically feasible and reasonable measures to block access to sites to remove them from search results,\" turning these providers into de facto Web censors.  </p><p>      This won't work.  As long as there's money to be made pushing pirated and counterfeit products, tech-savvy criminals around the world will find ways to sell these products online.  And ordering ISPs and search engines to disappear Web sites from the Internet will not change this fundamental reality.  We urge you instead to target the problem at the source.  Shut down illegal foreign sites by cutting off their revenue.  </p><p>      We support legislation that builds on the DMCA.  Our proposal would empower the Justice Department to target foreign sites that violate current law.  And a court could then order advertisers and payment services, in which our services would be included, to cut off ads and payments to those sites.  Google has been working with the committee on such a solution for over six months, and we will continue to do so. </p><p>      When all is said and done, we must address online piracy effectively in ways that continue to allow the Internet to drive this economy and this country forward.  Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  Thank you, Ms. Oyama.  </p><p>      Mr. Almeida?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ALMEIDA</emphasis>:  Good morning, Chairman Smith, Ranking Member Conyers, and distinguished members of the committee.  My name is Paul Almeida. I'm the president of the Department for Professional Employees, a coalition of 22 national unions affiliated with the AFL-CIO.  I am honored to speak today on behalf of the 4 million professional and technical people whom are affiliated unions represent.    </p><p>      Those people include creators, performers and craftspeople in arts, entertainment and media, professional and technical people in education, health care and public administration, in aerospace and other manufacturing, in pharmaceuticals, science, engineering, information technology and in professional sports.  </p><p>      The people I represent work in a wide range of occupations and industries.  They share a wide range of interests as workers and consumers, as well as ardent defenders of the First Amendment.  On their behalf, permit me to commend you and thank you.  Their unions unanimously support the Stop Online Piracy Act, as does the entire AFL-CIO.  </p><p>      My message is simple.  It has three parts.  First, strengthening protections for U.S. intellectual property helps American workers, jobs, incomes and benefits.  Second, counterfeit goods endanger workers, both as workers and consumers.  Third, there is no inconsistency between protecting free speech and an open Internet and safeguarding intellectual property.  </p><p>      If the United States allows the tax on intellectual property to go unanswered it puts good livelihoods at risk.  Online access continues to accelerate and expand.  It increasingly displaces tradition models for distributing content, and thus heightens the potential for digital theft.  Estimates of the number of jobs lost to digital theft in arts, entertainment, and the media sector alone run in the hundreds of thousands.    </p><p>      Losses of income arise because entertainment professionals depend on compensation at two points.  First, when the professionals do the work, and later when the reuse of the intellectual property. Royalties and residuals from downstream revenues enable entertainment professionals to survive between projects.  In manufacturing, the estimates of losses from counterfeits also run in the billions. Again, the victims include workers who face lost jobs and income.  </p><p>      We should not allow rogue Web sites to facilitate the distribution of counterfeit goods.  My second point, counterfeits endanger workers as workers and as consumers.  Only last week, the Senate Committee on Armed Services heard about an astonishing extent of counterfeit electronic parts in the military supply chain. Counterfeits kill.  </p><p>      When protective vests are fake, soldiers and police officers can die.  When prescription drugs are fake patients can die.  And when smoke detectors are fake homeowners and firefighters can die.  In may, the Atlanta, Georgia fire and rescue department recalled roughly 18,500 smoke detectors that it distributed for a free Atlanta smoke alarm program.  The smoke detectors were counterfeit, and so were the Underwriter Laboratory seals.    </p><p>      An alert from the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission noted the unreliable counterfeit alarms pose a life-safety hazard to the occupants in the event of a fire.  Counterfeit smoke detectors pose a life-safety hazard not just to homeowners, but to firefighters. Harold Schaitberger, general president of the International Association of Firefighters, another union affiliated with DPE, wrote to Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Conyers to support the Stop Online Piracy Act.  </p><p>      President Schaitberger noted that \"the preparedness and safety of our members depends on reliable equipment.\"  A blog called Techdirt.com posted a defamatory response.  \"Who does the MPAA actually think it's fooling.  Is Congress so stupid that it can't figure out for itself that firefighters have no clue what the debate is about?\"  The blog accused firefighters of supporting censorship. It implied the only reason the firefighters spoke up was because the MPAA was paying off  the union.  Firefighters know the consequences of counterfeit equipment.   </p><p>      My third point, freedom of speech is not the same as lawlessness on the Internet.  Protecting intellectual property is not the same as censorship.  The First Amendment does not protect stealing goods off trucks.  I mentioned earlier that the people whom I represent today include ardent defenders of the First Amendment.  Newspaper and broadcast journalists, radio broadcasters, newswriters, scriptwriters, and many others in the arts and entertainment and media, when they oppose wage theft there is no inconsistency with the First Amendment.  </p><p>      Digital theft and rogue Web sites diminishes incentives to invest, and leads to a downward spiral for U.S. workers in our economy.  That's the bad news.  The good news is that you are taking action.  The professional and technical workers and their unions, whom I represent, look forward to your passing the Stop Online Piracy Act. Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Almeida.  </p><p>      I'll recognize myself for questions.  And Ms. Pallante, let me direct a couple questions to you.  In your prepared written statement, you said, quote, \"If Congress does nothing to provide serious responses to online piracy, the U.S. copyright system will ultimately fail,\" end quote.  Now what did you mean by that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PALLANTE</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Yes, I don't think that's an overstatement.  The system that we have for copyright, and have had since 1790, is based on a system of exclusive rights which authors can license and which publishers and producers can invest.  And then distribute and otherwise bring to life for consumers not only here, but through reciprocal agreements with foreign countries.  </p><p>      If those exclusive rights cannot be meaningfully enforced and can be usurped in a lawless environment, they will become meaningless. And if Congress does not update the piracy laws, as it has done consistently for many, many years, many decades, hundreds of years ...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  I -- I think you just anticipated my next question, which was going to be do you think the legal system has all the tools it needs now to combat the infringing Web sites?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PALLANTE</emphasis>:  I don't.  I think that this is a timely hearing.  I think Congress has done and excellent job of intervening when technology outpaces the law.  It did that in the NET Act, it did that in the ART Act, and I think that this is similar legislation.  We're looking at a situation where very sophisticated and very smart and very blatant infringers will leap to offshore locations so that they can direct infringing goods, which often belong to our companies, back to American consumers.    </p><p>      They're outside the jurisdiction of our courts.  We're not suggesting that we would intervene in domestic courts in foreign countries.  What we are saying is that we should have some response to allowing them to do that with impunity.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  OK.  Thank you, Ms. Pallante.  </p><p>      Ms. Oyama, let me direct a couple questions to you.  And first, let me say that you spoke a lot of the right words today.  We've heard those words before.  And I only hope that your company and other simpler -- other similar companies will practice what you preached. And that, we will wait to see.   </p><p>      Let me ask you a couple questions.  You do acknowledge that there is a severe problem, I gather, with the theft of intellectual property by foreign criminals.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  That's a problem that we take extremely seriously.  We have hundreds of employees that work on it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  And I believe you agree that if we cut off access to American consumers and U.S. dollars that that will decrease the amount of intellectual property theft, as well.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  We think cutting off the money is a very effective solution.  The sites are in business because they profit.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  OK.  Now, in -- particularly in regard to Google, do you think Google should stop returning search results for foreign sites that are breaking U.S. law?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  Under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, a rights holder could come directly to Google, would not need to go to court. And they could alert us of the foreign infringement.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  Well, a ...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  And we would remove that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  A lot of people don't think the DMCA is sufficient, including the registrar of copyrights.  Do you think we should go beyond that to try to stop returning the search results for foreign sites?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  Thank you for the question.  I think there's a lot of misperception about what it and what isn't ...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  No, no.  I was asking a specific question here.  Should Google stop returning search results for foreign sites that are breaking U.S. law?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  We do, when notified by rights holder.  We've done that more than 5 million times.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  So the -- the answer is yes, then.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  Yes  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  OK, thank you.  Another question is this.  Should Google stop placing ads on illegal sites that are stealing American intellectual property?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  Our policies prohibit that.  We've proactively ejected more than 12,000 sites this year.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  OK.  And so you would agree not to either facilitate nor place ads on illegal sites that are stealing U.S. property.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  If a site is violating the law we would eject them for our system, and we do that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  OK.  Again, I hope you can practice what you preach today.  That would be a major -- a major breakthrough.  It seems to me -- and let me just conclude in this way -- that Google and other companies really have a decision to make.  And I hope they will make the right decision.  I hope they will decide to help other American companies.  It's not necessarily going to benefit Google or some of your allies, but I hope you will decide to help American companies protect their intellectual property from being infringed by foreign criminals.  </p><p>      And that is, I know, a decision that you all are having to make and weigh.  I acknowledge, and regret to a large extent, that if you make the right decision that is going to mean you're going to have to give up some of the revenue you might get from some of those ads that are actually on the infringing Web sites themselves.  That's a decision for you all to make, but I think you can make the right one there.   </p><p>      I simply hope that you, and others, will decide to do what's good for American -- for other American companies, do what's good for American jobs, and do what's good for  American economy, as well.  But thank you for your testimony.  </p><p>      The gentleman from -- the gentleman from California, Mr. Berman, is recognized for 5 minutes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BERMAN</emphasis>:  Well, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and Ranking Member Conyers.  And I'd like to thank the chairman for responding to my letter inviting Google to testify.  I think it's important to under -- understand what legitimate issues the opposition may have so they can be addressed.    </p><p>      I haven't heard concrete changes they would recommend.  I haven't received a Google proposal or suggested proposal on -- focusing on foreign rogue Web sites, and would love to see it's apparently been discussed with the committee.    </p><p>      Opponents of the legislation say, \"We support the bill's stated goals, and ask that sponsors consider more targeted ways to combat foreign rogue Web sites.  That's the response to every idea put forward to stop theft.  Why isn't this the time for the tech community to put forward concrete and specific proposals that will efficiently combat the theft that takes place on the Internet.    </p><p>      The rhetoric around this bill is over the top.  None of the sponsors of this bill are against the First Amendment, none of the sponsors of this bill want to shut down the Internet, and none of the sponsors want to stymie technology.  Perhaps the first example that I'll focus on is opponents claiming that the legislation will undermine U.S. foreign policy and encourage repression by foreign governments.    </p><p>      I wrote Secretary Clinton and asked her opinion.  She clearly, forcefully -- she clearly and forcefully said there is no contradiction between intellectual property rights protection and enforcement ensuring freedom of expression on the Internet.  In other words, we can adopt legislation like H.R. 3261 to better protect U.S. intellectual property online, at the same time demand that foreign governments respect Internet freedom.  </p><p>      And I'd like to submit those records -- those letters for the record.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  No, so objection.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BERMAN</emphasis>:  I'm going to -- based on your answers to Mr. Smith's question, I'd like to -- to follow up.  I thought I heard you say, in response to the chairman's question, that Google does not link to pirate Web sites.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  Under the DMCA procedures that Congress set out, a rights holder can notify Google about foreign infringement and we would remove it. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BERMAN</emphasis>:  All right.  Well, explain to me this one.  The Pirate Bay is a notorious pirate site, a fact that its founders proudly proclaim in the name of the site itself.  In fact, the site's operators have been criminally convicted in European.  One has apparently fled to Cambodia.  It is being blocked by court order in at least Italy, Denmark, Belgium, Ireland and Finland.    </p><p>      And yet Google continues to send U.S. customers, or at least I don't know what you're doing this morning, but -- but before this morning 'cause maybe you can read my mind -- U.S. Google continues to send U.S. consumers to the site by linking to the site in your search results.  Why do you do this?  Requiring copyright owners to send thousands upon thousands of notice -- of notices for individual torrent links to the Pirate Bay, only to have those same files reappear on the system when Google calls the Pirate Bay again?  </p><p>      We all know that this is a notoriously egregious pirate site. Why does Google refuse to deindex the site in your search results?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  Copyright infringement, counterfeiting, these are issues that we take incredibly seriously.  We invest tens of millions of dollars into the problem.  We have hundreds of people around the world that work on it.  When it comes to copyright ...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BERMAN</emphasis>:  Why does Google refuse to deindex the site in your search results?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  We will immediately -- if we're notified by a rights holder, we would remove the link from our search results to the Pirate Bay.  We've done that over 5 million times this year.  When it's a copyright ...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BERMAN</emphasis>:  You -- you -- you remove the link to a particular item.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  Exactly.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BERMAN</emphasis>:  Why don't you refuse to deindex the site in your search results?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  The procedures that Congress set out under the DMCA ensure that today, with ...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BERMAN</emphasis>:  Would it make sense to have a law that allowed you to -- if that's -- if the DMCA doesn't go far enough, a law that essentially told you that's what you should do in response to dealing with a clearly established rogue Web site that -- that flaunts it in every possible way?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  So we have no idea of knowing if a given search result is infringing or is authorized.  We do need the cooperation of the rights holder to let us know.  And today, we are removing links.  We think, in terms of a legislative approach, something that goes after the real incentive for those sites to be in business makes sense..  So enhancing the DMCA and going after advertising which is our -- services and payment providers we think makes sense.  We think the DMCA ...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BERMAN</emphasis>:  Could -- could you -- could you draft some proposals that reflect that position so we could look at them?  I mean, I would love it if you and the Consumer Electronics Association and public knowledge in these groups would give us something specific.  You think this is -- it goes too far, it's too excessive.  </p><p>      Give us something specific.  Infuse yourself with the notion of you want to stop digital theft.  What works?  And use your brilliant minds that you have in your organizations to give us some specifics because the DMCA is not going the job.  That's so obvious.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  We are -- we are very interested in working with your staff, with the chairman and other members of the committee.  I do believe through Net Coalition we have provided that language, and we'd be happy to -- to follow up.  We do think -- in terms of searches that Congress got it right under the DMCA.  It leaves up legitimate content, it takes down infringing content.  </p><p>      We want to make sure that when we're dealing with speech that we use a scalpel.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BERMAN</emphasis>:  Well, I -- my time has expired.  But you cannot look at what is going on since the passage of the DMCA and say Congress got it just right.  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  We agree ...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BERMAN</emphasis>:  ...maintain the status quo.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  We (inaudible) would be useful.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  The gentleman's time has expired.  Thank you, Mr. Berman.  </p><p>      The gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. Coble, is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COBLE</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Good to have you all with us. I've had to miss some of the hearing, Mr. Chairman, because of other meetings, but it's good to be here.  I was going to examine Ms. Pallante, but the chairman beat me to it.  I was going to examine Ms. Oyama, but Mr. Berman beat me to it.  But I'll -- I'll still try to recover.  </p><p>      Ms. Obama, let me ask you this -- Ms. Oyama.  What relief does the DMCA offer to a trademark owner who is trying to prevent counterfeiters from selling things?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  So for counterfeit it's dealt with a little bit differently.  For counterfeit, at Google, we will act -- do our -- for our advertising we've adjusted.  So, for example, for AdWords we've ejected over 100,000 accounts in the last year.  There is a very kind of stark difference between copyright and trademark.  </p><p>Congress, so far, has not enacted a DMCA for trademark. Copyright laws are exclusive, right?  Trademarks, it depends on what geography you're in, right?  What product you can use.  Given name- specific can be used on lots of different products, and so I know there's been kind of a long-standing conversation about -- about that issue.  </p><p>      Certainly, if we ever were to receive a court order about counterfeit related to search, well of course we would comply with that court order.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COBLE</emphasis>:  I thank you.  </p><p>      Mr. Clark -- Mr. Clark, how involved are organized criminal networks in the -- the manufacturer and distribution of counterfeit medicines?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLARK</emphasis>:  From my estimation and experience, it's -- it's a problem that's growing.  I don't think we've reached the level yet where we -- we are seeing global cartels, per se, as we do in narcotics.  But as the notoriety of the crime gets around, the profit margins are so phenomenal and the penalties on a global scale are so low, that it's a no-brainer for -- for organized crime to -- to look at this as a -- a -- a way to go.  </p><p>      So it is growing.  We've seen instances of it.  Not systemic instances, but we have seen, as I just cited, the Detroit instance where money was going to Hezbollah.  We have seen drug traffickers. But I think it's -- it's growing in that capacity.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COBLE</emphasis>:  Mr. Clark, what aspects of SOPA do you believe are particularly important to combating the problem of counterfeiting medicines?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLARK</emphasis>:  I apologize, Congressman.  I -- I missed the first part of that.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COBLE</emphasis>:  What aspects of SOPA, the bill before us, do you believe are particularly important to combating the problem of counterfeiting medicines?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLARK</emphasis>:  I think all aspects.  My biggest worry, Congressman, is that counterfeit medicines are still not perceived by the public, by law enforcement, by the judiciary -- our judges and prosecutors -- as a serious crime yet.  When you see somebody like Kevin Xu, who has a -- a global reputation for supplying counterfeits, it was my understanding during his undercover discussions he offered a list of counterfeit medicines.  And yet, he said if anything is on that list -- anything else off that list that you want, I can have it for you. Give me two weeks.  </p><p>      We're talking cancer medicines, we're talking blood pressure medicines, we're talking Alzheimer's medicines.  And I think when we see a few tablets here or there we have a tendency not to think of the consequences those tablets bring.  A lot of people in the United States, I think, look at it and say there's no bodies in the street, nobody seems to be dying from counterfeit so it -- it can't be that serious of a crime.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COBLE</emphasis>:  I got you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLARK</emphasis>:  But when you look at people, if, at best -- if they're getting 20 percent of the active pharmaceutical ingredient in the medicines that they're taking, such as this Alzheimer's medicine that was manufactured in Turkey, manufactured in facilities such as this, where there are no conditions that -- in terms of licensing, regulatory, environmental are applied, even with just 20 percent of the -- the active ingredient, what's the other 80 percent?    </p><p>      And if there's nothing but benign chemicals in that 80 percent, they're still not going to get relieve (sic) of their disease, and they eventually die.  So my biggest worry, Congressman, is that people are dying from these counterfeits.  We just haven't figured out a way to correlate the deaths from counterfeits with -- with the problem yet.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COBLE</emphasis>:  I -- thank you.  I want to beat -- I want to beat that red light that will illuminate imminently, and say to Ms. Kirkpatrick I am advised that Mastercard has been instrumental in -- in combating piracy.  And, Mr. Chairman, I think it should be noted for those who have combated particularly flagrant piracy that should be noted.  </p><p>      And I thank you all for being with us, and I yield back, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Coble.   </p><p>      The gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. Watt's recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WATT</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  And let me start by thanking all of the witnesses for being here today.  This is a difficult issue. This legislation raises some interesting new challenges, but circumstances are raising difficult new challenges.  Ms. Oyama, let me -- let me start with you because I want to be sure I understood your testimony.   </p><p>      I got the impression that you do not object strenuously to the provisions of section 102 because they require a court order.  That your primary objections are with respect to the provisions in 103, where -- private market-based system to protect customers are involved because they don't get -- it doesn't require giving notice to the site owner, or whoever's put up the site.  Am I misstating where you are on that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  We would certainly agree the concerns about 103 are the greatest.  One, because of the scope of what ... </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WATT</emphasis>:  Well, let me -- let me -- let me separate the question. Do you have concerns with section 102?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  We would be -- the legislation we support ...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WATT</emphasis>:  The question is, do you have concerns with section ...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  With some of the remedies, yes.  The ...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WATT</emphasis>:  Some of the remedies.  OK, and you'll -- and you'll give us that in writing so that we can evaluate those concerns.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  Yes.  The ...'  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WATT</emphasis>:  But your primary concerns are with section 103.  Is that -- am I misstating it?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  I think if we got -- if we got the remedies right in 102, focused on ads and payments, the way that these sites are making money.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WATT</emphasis>:  I didn't -- I'm -- I'm not trying to get you to resolve that issue about 102 today.  I -- I'm -- I'm -- I'd rather have that in writing.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  Much more workable, yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WATT</emphasis>:  Right.  But your concerns about 103 have to do with the lack of notice to the -- to the site owner, right?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  Yeah, in part.  I think the ...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WATT</emphasis>:  OK.  So do -- is there some effective way that we could give notice to the site owner that you are aware of?  And if you could give me those suggestions in writing.  Because I have those concerns, too.  The problem is, we don't -- we don't currently have any effective way -- access to those -- to that information to give them notice, and you do I think in your system because you put up the -- you put up the site.  OK.  </p><p>      Now, if you can help me with those two things we'll be far down the road.  I'm not adverse to -- to addressing your concerns.  I've indicated to that -- you -- to you, both in private and -- and I'm saying it publicly today.  Let me talk about this constitutional standard that -- and make sure that I understand where you are on that.  Because you appear to be advocating a constitutional standard that would prohibit the enforcement of any laws online.  </p><p>      In your written testimony, you disagree with Professor Abrams' conclusion that it is constitutional to block access to a Web site that is primarily infringing, even though such blocking may incidentally impact protected speech.  Your written testimony won't concede that blocking a Web site that is almost entirely infringing would be -- would be constitutional.   </p><p>      And you've confirmed that in what you've just said verbally here. Does that mean that you consider it unconstitutional for law enforcement to seize a child pornography site if the site also contains one copy of the King James Bible?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  So the speech concerns that have been raised ...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WATT</emphasis>:  I -- just answer that question for me, and then I'll -- I'll go forward from there.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  There are certainly legitimate ...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WATT</emphasis>:  What -- what about if it contains 20 copies of the King James Bible, but it's still 90 percent child pornography?  Are you saying First Amendment rights won't allow us to do that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  I think we agree with Floyd Abrams that you need to look at the whole site.  You need to make sure that it's really dedicated to infringement.    </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WATT</emphasis>:  OK.  Well, and -- and ...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  ...legitimate speech ...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WATT</emphasis>:  And probable cause would -- would require the attorney general's office to do that.  I mean, he's not going to go and -- and cite you unless -- or stop this process unless he's gone through that analysis.  The question is, do you think that there's something unconstitutional about taking down a site that is overwhelmingly, primarily devoted to -- to -- to stolen products?    </p><p>      And -- and I -- you know, if -- if that's -- if that's your position I think we're going to have a real problem with it.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  No, I think if -- if there was a site out there that was 100 percent terrible that's a separate issue.  The definition ... </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WATT</emphasis>:  No, I'm saying 90 percent terrible.  I'm saying 98 percent terrible.  Is it -- is 2 percent going to save this site from being taken down?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  I don't think there's an exact number.  I think when you are sweeping in vast majorities of legitimate speech without notice, that raises significant questions.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WATT</emphasis>:  Is that 51 percent, or is it 60 percent, or -- I mean, how -- how are we going to do this?  You're telling me I can't violate somebody's constitutional rights if it incidentally adversely impacts their -- their protected rights.  That's what you're saying.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  No, I think if a site was primarily dedicated to infringement there's a lot of tools that ...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WATT</emphasis>:  OK, well, that's what the bill says, isn't it?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  Well, we would not agree that the scope of the definition captures totally infringing sites.  We have a lot of concerns that it sweeps in legitimate ...'  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WATT</emphasis>:  No, I didn't say totally infringing.  That --That's not what you said, either.  That's not what you said.  You said primarily infringing.  And -- and then all of a sudden you shifted over to totally infringing.  Is this a question about whether something is totally infringing or primarily infringing, or do you -- you think that both of them -- that one should be protected and one should not be protected?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  I think a definition that was narrowly drawn, that has something like primarily, would be helpful.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WATT</emphasis>:  OK.  So you're going to give us some language on that? My time is up.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  We have a definitional ...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  The gentleman's time has expired.  Thank you, Mr. Watt.  </p><p>      The gentleman from Virginia, Mr. Goodlatte, is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOODLATTE</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Ms. Oyama, I want to pursue that line of questioning.  </p><p>      Years ago, a former chairman, Henry Hyde, put me in a room with about 30 government representatives from the content industry, from the online industry, Internet service providers, and a few that had a foot in both camps.  And we worked for months in a -- in a hot room, and came to agreement on the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and, in particular, the notice and takedown provisions which you have spoken highly of.  </p><p>      And I -- I agree with you that those provisions still have a - a role in protecting online copyright.  But the Internet has changed dramatically since then.  The speeds have accelerated.  The technology is more sophisticated, search engines are more sophisticated, and the criminals who use all of that to rip off legitimate businesses of all kind are more sophisticated.     </p><p>      So as you know, and as I've said, I'm interested in making sure that this legislation gives effective tools to combat lawbreakers. But to also ensure it does not entangle legitimate online businesses or the ability of entrepreneurs to continue to bring exciting new products and services to the Internet.  Can you tell the committee the top concerns the tech community has about the bill, and your specific recommendations on how to fix those concerns within the bill?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  Sure, thank you.  I think when the conversation started the idea was to target foreign rogue sites, sites that were clearly breaking the law.  And to introduce -- build on the DMCA, introduce new, harsh remedies.  That is definitely approach that we could get behind, that we would support.  </p><p>      I think when the tech community now is looking at this language, there's serious concerns that the definition of a site that's dedicated to the theft of U.S. property, you know, probably purely unintentionally, it sweeps in a great amount of lawful Web sites.  So, for example, the unit of analysis for what -- what -- what the site is, there's some language in there that says an Internet site or a portion thereof.  </p><p>      So there's some concern about whether we're looking at the whole site, are we just looking at one blog, one Tweet, one comment, one page on a site.  So -- so getting the definition right would be really important.  There's other words within the definition that seem to introduce notions like facilitate.  That's one of reasons why the Consumer Electronics Association, who I mentioned, they have serious concerns.  </p><p>      Because they manufacture so many different devices. somebody could say that the Internet itself facilitates infringement.  So we need to make sure that we're really -- we're really staying within the existing confines of copyright law.  I would also mention in the definition there's some language -- you can be dedicated to theft if you have -- no one understands, sir, what this means -- if you have taken deliberate actions to avoid confirming a high probability of the use of your site for infringement.  </p><p>      Right now, small business owners, when they're starting a Web site, they know if they comply with the DMCA, they are lawful companies, they can see investment, they can go forward.  If they have to somehow subscribe to that kind of definition, the folks that we're hearing from, they just have no idea how they would even possibly build their site to fit that definition. </p><p>      So I think getting -- getting the scope of what is a site dedicated to infringement would be critical.  And from there, we're certainly more than happy to work on remedies.  The two that we think are really smart -- if you look at Wikileaks, I think this is a good example of -- of the fact that this is a strong remedy.  Is choking these sites off at the revenue source.  </p><p>      They are in business because they can either sell advertising or because they can profit from subscribers.  If you could get the entire industry together and you could choke off advertising, and you could choke off payments to those sites, you would be incredibly effective to introducing the collateral damage that we had discussed to free speech or to Internet architecture, things like that.  </p><p>      So ensuring that we had the right remedies and the right scope, I think there's plenty of opportunity for all -- all players for a cross-section of industry to come together.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOODLATTE</emphasis>:  Let me -- let me just follow up on that.  The more detailed information you give us, the better our ability to address legitimate concerns.  So will you commit to working with me to identify the specific problems that the tech community has with the bill, and working to address those specific problems to improve the bill as we move forward?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  Absolutely.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOODLATTE</emphasis>:  And some have argued that this legislation would break the Internet.  As the co-chair of the Congressional Internet Caucus, that's the last thing I want to do.  Can you explain exactly how this legislation would impact the functioning of the Internet?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  So I think -- I think the major concerns that have been raised, really, kind of in the cyber security field -- so there's a white paper by a group of engineers who designed DNSSEC.  There's some other leading cyber security folks who have spoken out about it.  I think -- I think Stewart Baker has been on record.  He's a former senior official at DHS and the former general counsel of the NSA.  </p><p>      One of the provisions in the bill would require ISPs to perform DNS blocking.  There's kind of a two-fold concern there.  One is that -- that the -- the methods proposed here are not compatible with a more than 10-year long effort in the cyber security field to implement DNSSEC in a way that would prevent cyber security attacks.    </p><p>      So I am not the cyber security expert.  The -- but the folks that -- that wrote that code are saying that this will really harm the U.S. and the global effort to make DNS more secure.  I think the second piece is, we know that users, unfortunately, are seeking this material.  We can predict that there are going to be circumvention efforts.  </p><p>      And so there's a big concern that if we place certain obligations on U.S. DNS providers that users are going to reroute their traffic to offshore rogue providers.  And the vulnerabilities that an offshore rogue provider could introduce into the network, not -- not just for the kid that's looking for the movie or for some bad actor, but for anyone who's network that they're on, is really significant.  It could introduce spyware, malware, privacy concerns.  </p><p>      I know this is, you know, something that, really, the folks who are the experts in this field have raised.  But, you know, that's been kind of a critical concern about ...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOODLATTE</emphasis>:  (Inaudible), I hate to interrupt.  I -- I do believe that Mr. Clark, if the chairman will permit -- Mr. Clark, from his past experience with the Department of Justice, might also be able to comment on this issue ...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOODLATTE</emphasis>:  Mr. Clark, could you give a very brief response?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLARK</emphasis>:  Very briefly.  I -- I -- unfortunately, I don't have the cyber experience.  It wasn't one of the areas I -- I actually worked myself.  We -- I've managed it.  I don't know the intricacies about it, though, in all honesty.  So I apologize for not having an answer for that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOODLATTE</emphasis>:  I apologize, Mr. Chairman.  I thought -- thought there was an opportunity there, but perhaps not.  Ms. Oyama, thank you.  We look forward to working with you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Goodlatte.  </p><p>      The gentlewoman from California, Ms. Lofgren, is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LOFGREN</emphasis>:  Before my questions, I would like to ask unanimous consent to introduce a number of items into the record -- opposition to the provisions of the bill.    </p><p>      The letters are from to Consumer Union and other consumer groups -- TechNet, TechAmerica, the American Library Association, the Competitive Enterprise Institute, Human Rights Watch, other public interest groups, dozens of human rights groups around the world, a written statement from the ACLU, a paper from the Brookings Institute (sic) explaining how the bill would undermine security and stability of the Internet, a white paper by five leading DNS engineers and Internet security experts, a letter from the Anti-Phishing Working Group, an article from Stewart Baker, the former general counsel of the NSA and policy chief DHS under the Bush administration entitled Copyright Bills Could Kill Hopes for Secure 'Net, a letter signed by AOL, eBay, Facebook, Twitter, Yahoo!, LinkedIn, Google, Mozilla and Ziinga, and a Harvard Business Review article entitled Great Firewall of America.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  Without objection.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LOFGREN</emphasis>:  You know, I think some today have sort of written off, I think, serious criticisms of this bill's hyperbole.  And that the only objection is about money and hyperbole.  And I just don't think that's the case.  The big tech companies weren't the ones who said this bill would cause the U.S. to lose its position as a global leader in supporting a free and open Internet.  That's from dozens of human rights groups around the world.  The big tech companies want the ones who wrote that the bill has the potential to do consumers more harm than good.  That's from the Consumers Union and other nonprofit consumer groups.  The big tech companies didn't write the bill is in conflict with the First Amendment.  That's from the ACLU and over 100 law professors.    </p><p>      It wasn't the big tech companies who said the bill kill our best hope for securing the Internet.  No, that's from Stewart Baker, the former assistant secretary for DHS and the former general counsel of the national security agency.  Dozens of venture capitalists, not big tech companies, wrote that the bill will stifle investment in Internet services, throttle innovation and hurt American competitiveness, and it hasn't generally been the policy of this committee to dismiss the views of those in industries that we're going to regulate.  And these are just a few of the examples.  </p><p>      Now, I understand why cosponsors of the legislation are not happy about widespread criticism of the bill.  But I think impugning the motives of the critics rather than engaging in the substance is a mistake.  I have a number of questions, and I know that, you know, we've got six witnesses here; five are in favor and only one is against.  And that troubles me.  I'll just say that.  You know, I don't think it's a balanced effort, and I'm sorry that we don't have any technical expertise on this panel in terms of engineering talent, because I think that is an important issue as to the DNS blocking portions of the bill.  </p><p>      So let me ask a question of Mr. O'Leary:  Do you believe that software program should be illegal if they allow a user to circumvent Internet filtering ordered by the government?  </p><p>      O'LEARY:  I don't believe that software program should be per se illegal.  I think if people misuse them, then they should be -- if they misuse any product in violation of the law, they should...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LOFGREN</emphasis>:  So the ability to just simply circumvent the takedown order as a software add-on to a browser should continue to be illegal...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p>      O'LEARY:  Well, no.  If you're saying you're building something in specifically to avoid an order of the court not to do something, I do have a problem with that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LOFGREN</emphasis>:  So you think that software ought to be illegal?  </p><p>      O'LEARY:  Well, that's not what I said, no.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LOFGREN</emphasis>:  Well, it's one or the other.  Either you should be able to do that or you should be able to do it.  Which is it?  </p><p>      O'LEARY:  Does the software have a legitimate purpose, or is it simply to circumvent the court order?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LOFGREN</emphasis>:  Well, circumventing software can be a multiplicity of use.  We -- for example...  </p><p>      O'LEARY:  Right.  But in your question, you said the software would -- would be created to allow circumventing.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LOFGREN</emphasis>:  There is a -- there is an add-on to Firefox that will allow a...  </p><p>      O'LEARY:  I think that most legitimate companies in the United States, including Firefox, should abide by court orders and follow the law.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LOFGREN</emphasis>:  So -- well, you're not really answering the question. I will take from you, you will you think that that ought to be regulated at least.  </p><p>      O'LEARY:  Regulated in much the same way that we regulate people driving drunk and stealing things, yes.  I think that -- I know that the word regulation has...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LOFGREN</emphasis>:  Let me -- let me ask you this, because I don't have a long time, and I assume that you are directing your comments at people that Northern California people didn't care about jobs and the rest of America, either to myself or Mr. Lungren, since we're the only members of the committee from Northern California.  I will say I do care about jobs all over America.  And in fact eBay, which is headquartered in San Jose, has enabled thousands of Americans all over the country to form small businesses and to use the Internet to sell products.  </p><p>      A guy to know your concept of -- you think that this is a big problem, and I think it's a problem.  I think it's that Internet piracy is something that is troubling, it's illegal, and I think we need to do something about it.  So let me just put that out there. How many sites do you think need to be shut down in order to say we've succeeded in the fight against Internet privacy?  Is that it doesn't, is it hundreds, that thousands?  Do you have any idea of the scope of the number of sites that need to be...  </p><p>      O'LEARY:  Well, first of all, you mischaracterized my comment about Northern -- Northern California, and I'd like to correct the record on that.  I was in place...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LOFGREN</emphasis>:  Well, do it later, because I don't have that much time. Answer my question.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  Actually, the gentlewoman's time has expired, but you're free to answer the question.  </p><p>      O'LEARY:  Thank you.  The comment about Northern California was, in the context of this debate, the perception has been created by opponents of this bill that all of the innovation in all of the creative thinking comes out of -- out of Silicon Valley.  I was not taking umbrage with anyone in Silicon Valley.  We have great relationships with a lot of people in Silicon Valley.  Pixar, which makes wonderful movies, is in Silicon Valley.  Apple, which is a legitimate online retailer, is in Silicon Valley.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LOFGREN</emphasis>:  But -- but...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p>      O'LEARY:  I was also making the simple point, Congresswoman, that there are people all over this country in places like Detroit, Baltimore, Texas, North Carolina...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LOFGREN</emphasis>:  Mr. Chairman, I wonder, since...  </p><p>      O'LEARY:  I'm happy to answer your question...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LOFGREN</emphasis>:  May I have an additional 30 seconds?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  Will the gentleman answer the question very briefly?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LOFGREN</emphasis>:  How many sites?  </p><p>      O'LEARY:  Well, I know for a fact that we can start with Pirate Bay, which was mentioned earlier.  I do not know how many...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LOFGREN</emphasis>:  So is it just Pirate Bay, do you think, or is it a dozen, is it 1,000?  What you think?  </p><p>      O'LEARY:  It would be easier to answer the question if I was allowed to.  There are multiple sites out there.  This is a legitimate problem.  We have been very clear, and we will continue to be clear that there is no silver bullet.  The problem is evolving and changing. I cannot sit here right now and tell you in good faith that I know what that number is.  But what I do know is that there are literally hundreds of sites out there that are engaging in this activity...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LOFGREN</emphasis>:  Do you think it's in the neighborhood of...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  The Gentlewoman's time is...  </p><p>      O'LEARY:  ...know that is to go to Google and type in J.  Edgar, and you will get a list of...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LOFGREN</emphasis>:  Or Baidu or Bing or any of them...  </p><p>      O'LEARY:  ...sites that are engaging in this illegal activity...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LOFGREN</emphasis>:  So it's hundreds of thousands?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  The gentlewoman's time is expired.  But let me remind members that their welcome to submit written questions to any of the panelists, and will try to get those answers to the members as quickly as we can.  </p><p>      The gentleman from California, Mr. Issa, is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ISSA</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and suggests a lady from the North, while I am deep in the Confederacy of California, went through quite a litany of good opponents of the bill.  I'd like to add to that a unanimous consent that following:  A joint letter by 160 entrepreneurs, founders and CEOs and executives, a letter expressing concern about SOPA from the Digital media Association, statement by the Consumer Electronics Association, Electronics Association, which was denied an opportunity to be here as a witness, letter signed by 53 venture capitalists expressing concern regarding the protect act, and a transcript of recent remarks made by VP Joe Biden that he gave in -- at the London Cyber Security Conference germane to hear his concerns about this bill.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  Without objection.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ISSA</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>      I've been the victim of piracy.  So you're not going to have a problem with me agreeing with the problem.  Hardware, software, got it all.  But Mr. Clark, I'm going to hope that you can stretch for this part of it, even though it's not in your title.  You're familiar with ITC, aren't you?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLARK</emphasis>:  Yes, I am.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ISSA</emphasis>:  Pfizer regularly for patent infringement on imported products will go to the IDC and get relatively quick justice using administrative law judges available to them and injunctive relief against a patent violator, correct?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLARK</emphasis>:  Outside of my field, but I would believe that is the case.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ISSA</emphasis>:  So when we deal with rogue elements outside the jurisdiction of the United States that a recording in the United States, we have a history of an organization that is quick, administration and can have continued jurisdiction against non-U.S. entities who are, in fact, trying to take what they have stolen then sell it into America.  Is that correct, correct to your understanding?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLARK</emphasis>:  Generally speaking, yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ISSA</emphasis>:  OK.  Have any of the other of you -- just raise your hands -- were to the ITC in your background or familiar with them?  One another.  Well, let me just run through quickly because time will be very limited and questions seem to be - the answer seemed to be long. We have a court of jurisdiction.  Now, they do not specifically have the mandate to follow the money and provide injunctive relief against Google, eBay or anybody else after they find it offshore and French are and seek remedies.  But they have their own consults, they have administrative law judges.  They have a procedure.  </p><p>      Mr. Chairman, I object to this bill in its current form, mostly because I believe it fails to use tools that are generally better than the tools that we have at our disposal in this bill, and I believe that if the real remedies sold is, in fact, a quart of continued jurisdiction, specializing in intellectual property and designed to, in fact, reach a quick solution to a question of whether there is wrongdoing and then follow the money through injunction, not to fines, and, obviously, criminal referral.  My intention is to offer legislation on a bipartisan basis that will, in fact, look at the legitimate concerns, take a great deal of these 80 pages.    </p><p>      However, and this is where it's tough, Mr. Chairman and ranking member, suggests that it jurisdiction not within this committee get a substantial portion of this bill, because I believe that that is as appropriate as it is for the federal courts to consider domestic entities who are violating it.  </p><p>      And so with that, Miss Oyama?  Am I pronouncing it right?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ISSA</emphasis>:  Has-- in your experience, has Google worked with the ITC or any other administrative law judges in executing on other people's judgments?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  I would imagine in the patent context, yes.  It's not my field, so I can't speak to it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ISSA</emphasis>:  OK.  I too agree that having a quarter continued jurisdiction that, in fact, can work for injunctive relief as technologies available is generally something that Google and the other search engines would see as reasonable once there is a judgment entered against an offender somewhere?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  Yes, I think would be happy to work on that type of solution.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ISSA</emphasis>:  And I'm going to get to the others.  But Mr. Clark, if you had that and you had a judgment against party A, who had an Internet site, and then 25 other similar party show up from the same country didn't have all the identities that tell you it's basically the same group you already have a judgment against, wouldn't you benefit from having a court that we specifically gave jurisdiction to to determine quickly that those are alter ego's and execute upon them so that you would go through this wack-a-mole (ph) again and again trying to prove to somebody that it's basically the same people doing it again?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLARK</emphasis>:  My working relationship with the ITC has been very, very limited.  I'm not quite certain what their capabilities are.  If you say you're going to empower them to do certain work like that, it would make some sense.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ISSA</emphasis>:  Currently, they are the -- and the others will probably know this -- that's a place that plaintiffs go to if there's any importation and they have a patent because they can administer a decision faster than the fastest rocket -- fastest rocket docket, and unlike eBay decision, they have injunctive relief not only as a tool but as the one and only tool, and he used it without his question because, in fact, that is the mandate of Congress.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLARK</emphasis>:  But you were still talking about referral process.  I think the DOJ that for criminal follow-up and for asset... </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ISSA</emphasis>:  Right.  And I recognize at some point the administrative law judges look and say we have a domestic entity that is not complying with our injunctions or a site that is just as rogue in the U.S.  So I'm very aware that there are elements here that, if you are cooperating or facilitating with a foreign entity, that there would have to be a referral.  That's not going to be Yahoo or Google or eBay.  It's going to be, as you know, the rogue sites you fight every day.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLARK</emphasis>:  Right.  And I would just be worried about the bifurcation of activity and in the referral process in the elongation of the end result is something like that were arranged.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ISSA</emphasis>:  So I look forward to showing both are witnesses in the committee that, in fact, the ITC's time to judgment and their execution is actually much shorter than our federal courts and less discretionary than the Justice Department generally.    </p><p>      I think the gentleman -- the chairman for his indulgence and yield back.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Issa.  </p><p>      The gentlewoman from Texas, Ms. Jackson Lee, is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JACKSON LEE</emphasis>:  Let me thank the gentleman -- chairman very much in the ranking member.  And let me call the world and -- for the record and say I want the U.S. Library of Congress, I want Pfizer, the Motion Picture Association of America, MasterCard, Google and are good friends at the technical aspect of our moviemaking business and all supporters to be made whole.  I think we have a consensus that online piracy is a both devastating and destructive element of the nation's economy.  In fact I have said I think I believe often that it steals the genius of this country.    </p><p>      We are very proud of the motion picture industry, and I am, if you will, cup runeth over.  I may be your physical armor when I see the massive thievery that goes on, and certainly in some of our international friends.  </p><p>      So I start off with that, and I want to find a common ground. And as I have looked at the legislation, I hope the chairman and ranking member will give us the time to really study the legislation. Several things come to mind.  One, this legislation has no referral. I'm a member of the Homeland Security Committee, and our committee spent years helping to build the switch to the DNS SEC, and if this bill would pass, we would have a challenge with that format.  And the question is, would everyone who needs to make changes to the DNS SEC would instead be on the phone to the lawyers asking whether they will be sued for adopting security technology that will make the mandated login redirect system even more difficult.  </p><p>      We have to look at all of these issues.  So I want to ask the Library of Congress first if he has any comments regarding that conflict that we're supposed to be collaborative.  You're the only government witness.  I'm not sure if you've thought of that, but let me give you a second question quickly, since our time is going quickly.  I am concerned about how this bill will -- what effect it will have on small businesses, particularly those that couldn't afford to go to court should a rights holder come forward and demand that their access revenue be shut off.  If a rights holder accuses a small- business Web site of being -- facilitating -- excuse me, a facilitating infringement and a payment process that shuts off payments to that business isn't payment process immune from suit under section 104, and what rights do they have?  </p><p>      So first, is there any collaboration or recognition about the system that the DHS has formulated?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PALLANTE</emphasis>:  I'm sorry, I don't -- I don't know the...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JACKSON LEE</emphasis>:  Don't know have that question.  Mr. Chairman, I think we have to have that answer from whatever resources we can get.  </p><p>      Next, if you can have any insight on how it impacts small businesses, this particular legislation.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PALLANTE</emphasis>:  Yes.  That section of the bill, I believe, was actually invented to make it easier and quicker to avoid the court process and the cost.  That's the goal.  There is no liability for the intermediaries under that section.  There's an obligation if it goes to the next stage and is a court order.  There's an obligation...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JACKSON LEE</emphasis>:  Right.  So there's still a process that a small business might have to be engaged in.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PALLANTE</emphasis>:  But...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JACKSON LEE</emphasis>:  There's still a process.  This makes it easier...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PALLANTE</emphasis>:  There is, and their good-faith intermediaries, and they have not themselves broken the law, and the bill tries to take that into account.  If we can refine that, we should.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JACKSON LEE</emphasis>:  Yes, because they still have an obstacle to climb, if you might.  </p><p>      Let me go to Ms. Oyama -- excuse me.  Forgive us from not reading the name correctly.  I don't have it in front of me.  But let me quickly give you a series of questions.  Ms. Oyama, is that correct?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JACKSON LEE</emphasis>:  All right.  Thank you.  One of the -- one of the kind of groups that I've been engaged in over the last couple of months is the generation of youth that are excited about startups. They're everywhere.  They are job creators, and I see them as the new nucleus of job creation in America.  They are -- they are obviously functioning now.  They're all trying to emulate all the stars of social network.  We know that won't be the case, but they are trying to create jobs.  </p><p>      So let me raise these concerns with you.  I think immediately what comes to mind is that this legislation may be overly broad, that it too easily circumvents Internet users, and it is inherently incompatible with the way, Internet actually works.  Would you comment on the overbroad -- the circumventing Internet users and incompatible with the way the Internet works?  Can you do that quickly for me, and then I'd like to go back to Miss -- if you could be listening to this question about the, Ms. Pallante, if you have any idea about the problematic aspect of this first small -- again, a small, a minority of businesses.  </p><p>      But Ms. Oyama?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  Sure.  On the overbreadth concern...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JACKSON LEE</emphasis>:  Overbroad.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  Overbroad, a huge concern is the scope of the definition of what the site dedicated to that.  So that's a concern that's been raised among small businesses, larger tech companies is.  If we're going to go after rogue sites, we have to make sure that they're rogue sites and that they're breaking the law.  There's a lot of concern that right now the definition would cover new ground.  It would cover site that today are complying with the DMCA.  So they're taking down infringement when there notified by (inaudible) holders.  It would be sites that today, under existing law, if they were hauled to court, they would be found not guilty under existing copyright law.  So I think there's scope concern there.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JACKSON LEE</emphasis>:  Circumvented by Internet users.  It can be too easily circumvents it by Internet users.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  Yes.  So one of the concerns is that, on the -- the notice to terminate provision, that piece does not go through court, and so somebody could just notify a service provider.  You could go away for Thanksgiving if your Web site owner.  Your (inaudible) team providing services under the bill could be shut off than five days. So there's a lot of concern that, you know, that doesn't really provide adequate due process in terms of the way current businesses work.  </p><p>      I would say, in terms of the incompatibility with the Internet, in the Internet here, Internet traffic is going to route around blockages.  It's a kind of working with the grain of the Internet we think is really smart, it's really effective.  It's why we support the legislation we discussed before about cutting off the funding sources. It's worked in going after sites like Wikileaks, which is incredibly sophisticated site.  Much of international law enforcement was going after Wikileaks, and if you go to Wikileaks' homepage, it says that they're going down because payment provider shut them off. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  The gentlewoman's time has expired.  </p><p>      The gentleman from Florida, Mr. Ross, is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROSS</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>      Ms. Oyama, you feel that this bill is an infringement of First Amendment right of free speech?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  You know, I think short of their constitutionality, it certainly raises free-speech concerns.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROSS</emphasis>:  Is it -- is it censorship that you're concerned about?  Is that...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  Yes, so the U.S. has had a good platform globally to speak out for free expression, and I think a lot like this which would, for the first time, empower the government...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROSS</emphasis>:  And that would empower the government to require you to do something that you don't want to do, which would be to set that aside. Is that correct?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  We're happy to disable links, and we're notified by rights holders.  We think that going...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROSS</emphasis>:  And as long as you do without a third party such as the government, it's not an infringement of First Amendment rights of free speech, nor is it a -- as censorship, is it?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  We don't do full site blockages.  We do page by page...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROSS</emphasis>:  Would you do take downs?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  Under the MPAEI (ph)?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROSS</emphasis>:  Yes.  Which is the same thing.  I'm just having a hard time distinguishing when you do it it's OK, but when you have a third- party such as the federal government requiring you to do it, then it becomes censorship and an infringement on First Amendment rights...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  I see.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROSS</emphasis>:  But let me ask a further...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  ...government approach it's much broader in this bill.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROSS</emphasis>:  Let me go a little bit further here because I want to go to your example of Dave's Emporium, which I think is a great example for people such as me, who think simply to understand the small business.  But I want to look at it from a consumer's rights perspective.  Let's say that Dave's Emporium, because that 1 percent vendor that uses on the Internet that's found through your -- your Google search, results and the purchase of a product that causes death or personal injury.    </p><p>      Now, in that chain of commerce, Google would be brought into action, especially where there's joint and several liability as a deep pocket, to defend that suit and probably pay damages.  All of that could've been prevented had there been an investigation, had there been the appropriate execution under this act.  In fact, not only would it have been prevented, but also, under this bill, is there not an affirmative defense that Dave's Emporium could've asserted in the sense that I don't have the -- the resources to hire a lawyer that would mitigate my responsibility to now have to defend the order to take down?  </p><p>      So what I'm getting at is, is that, even further, you have immunities under this act that would prevent a third-party suit against you if you shut it down.  But you don't have immunity if, in fact, you allow for the sale and purchase of products that are not only counterfeit, but they also result in death or personal injury.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  So on counterfeit, is definitely something that we agree with you.  Counterfeit is a big problem.  It's something that we invest tons of engineering hours, millions of dollars into going after.  For example, for ad work, we adjusted 95 percent...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROSS</emphasis>:  But it would seem to me that you would -- you would want to have the immunities.  You would want to have some protection, some safe harbors to prevent lawsuits against you in the execution of your -- of your -- of your business.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  I think if a court is instructing intermediaries to take action, there's probably some place for immunities.  But the concern here is that Dave could be shut off for five days not pursuant to its terms of service.  Certainly no one has the absolute...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROSS</emphasis>:  But he could be put out of business being sued because of a harmful product that could've been prevented had Google investigated the site.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  So certainly no one has an absolute right to ads or payment services.  We think that they're...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROSS</emphasis>:  Well, Dave's in that situation either way, and I think that he needs to have some protections.  And I think that this bill will offer some of that.    </p><p>      But let me -- let me shift to another thing, let me tell you I appreciate what Google has done with regard to child pornography.  I mean you guys have stepped up to the plate tremendously.  And I think that's a wonderful example.  You need to be congratulated for that. You do it because it's the right thing to do, and it would seem to me that following the letter of the law, you could do the same thing in this regard in an effort to hold down, or at least eliminate, the use of pirated sites by way of the search engine and Google.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  So child pornography is certainly a huge, you know, problem.  It's something we take very seriously.  Technically, going after child pornography on a search engine is completely different from copyright because the machine can detect child pornography.  A machine can look for flesh tones.  A human, if you look at it, would know what it is that good adjusted.  And with...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROSS</emphasis>:  But it's still the right thing to do.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  ...the copyright, you can't just look at the video and tell whether it's infringing our license, right?  It needs to be a collaboration with the rights owner.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROSS</emphasis>:  Real quickly, Ms. Kirkpatrick, not a question; just a thank you, on behalf of MasterCard, for what you're doing because you're cutting off the source of the problem.  And that's very important.  </p><p>      Mr. Almeida, I had a chance to meet a couple of days ago with one of your members, gentleman who, a lifelong songwriter.  He's in this room.  And he met with me, and he said, \"You know, the problem isn't that it's a fight over between the movie houses than the producers; it's the small people, the people will follow their passion, the people who have the artistic ability to do something they've always wanted to do that now, after 30 years of being a songwriter, has to look at whether he can keep his house, what is future's can hold.\" And I wish you would do for me and explain to the members up here is how this adversely impacts not the giants in Hollywood not the Giants in Nashville, but those that participate, those whose creativity and innovation will be stifled unless there's some protections.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ALMEIDA</emphasis>:  Well, I think there does need to be protections, and I think that's what this bill hopes to do.  The -- and this isn't to protect the big -- the big dogs in Hollywood.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROSS</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ALMEIDA</emphasis>:  Our members who were behind the scenes, who were stagehand...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROSS</emphasis>:  The foundation.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ALMEIDA</emphasis>:  ...who -- the people who built the sets, the backend payments for those workers support their health and petrified, that's being cut off.  They're adversely being impacted by these rogue sites and by the piracy of their videos.  A video being released today will be available by the weekend on the Web.  And so we're hoping that this legislation will help to take a step forward in that area.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROSS</emphasis>:  Thank you.  Obviously, my time's expired.  I yield back.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  And thank you, Mr. Ross.  </p><p>      The gentlewoman from California, Ms. Waters, will be recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WATERS</emphasis>:  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>      Let me just say that I find the discussion on H.R.3261 extremely interesting and engaging, and I think Mr. Ross frame this issue somewhat in its opening statement, when he talked about the giants and competition and the -- the profits and the money that's involved being at the basis of all of it.  And let me just say that I view any proposed changes in IP and copyright laws as an opportunity to examine whether changes will expand opportunities for women and minority entrepreneurs, both in Hollywood and Silicon Valley.  And I come to this discussion just having witnessed a CNN presentation called Black in America about Soledad O'Brien this past weekend, which I found very, very interesting.    </p><p>      Having said that, I'd like to direct my first question to Maria Pallante, U.S. copyright registrar.  User generated content Web sites like Facebook and YouTube are enormously popular.  Individuals and groups use these platforms to share videos that range from fraternity and sorority step shows and high school talent shows to videos of kids performing a new dancer imitating a new music video.  Many up-and- coming artists who don't have record deals also use UGC sites to showcase their talents, covering popular songs.  </p><p>      Now, to the extent many uploaded video clips feature the use of copyrighted music and other types of content that is not for profit or commercial gain, do you think that this bill would include a Safe Harbor fair use exception or other explicit provision that would ensure we aren't trying to subject parity and leisurely activities to felony penalties?  Are you at all concerned that some of the section's broader language could have unintended consequences that may chill the use of UGC sites and digital platforms that have served an important social utility?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PALLANTE</emphasis>:  Thank you for the question.  I'm not concerned as it's written.  The -- we're talking about two different levels of activity. This bill would go after sites dedicated to infringement.  I think what is on the table in this room is a position that one can be compliant with the DMCA through notice and takedown of very specific sites when notified, and therefore, not have the obligation to participate in a solution that is about broad, willful, criminal, egregious, dedicated activity.  Two different -- they -- these two things will operate at the same time, and the notice and takedown system will remain intact.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WATERS</emphasis>:  Also, I would like to ask about another issue that I'm very concerned with, and I would like to direct this to Ms. Katherine Oyama to Google.  I'm very concerned about the voluntary authority and legal immunity the bill gives Internet service providers to block access to sites they reasonably believe are infringing sites.  This provision would seem to run counter to the FCC's recently issued open Internet net neutrality rules.  I can foresee cases in which an Internet service provider that holds all my content may use the section as a pretext to unfairly block access to a competing Web site that is not really dedicated to infringement. </p><p>      This section does not require credible claims, merely a reasonable belief that doesn't exclude commercial disputes or anticompetitive conduct.  It is my understanding that the Senate doesn't have ISPs voluntary blocking authority in its bill.  Can you foresee any unintended consequences with the voluntary blocking provisions?  Is there a way that this bill could be refined to ensure that voluntary actions are based on credible evidence in certain thresholds?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  Sure.  Thank you.  </p><p>      So we do see today the Internet used by countless small businesses to facilitate communication to facilitate e-commerce.  It is truly people's daily livelihood.  And so we do think that there should be due process built-in if something essential to your site like your services is going to be taken away.  I think the provision you were mentioning is section 104 the bill.  I think the broader technology community shares those concerns.  You know, one, if you look at the scope of sites that could be captured by a service provider's reasonable belief that they were dedicated to theft within bill, that's a very broad.    </p><p>      And then two, the number of service providers have received complete immunity for terminating service without going to court, without going through a due process, is not just the providers that are required to take action under this bill; it's much broader.  So it would include -- it would include advertisers, search engines, payment providers, but also domain name registers, ISPs, much broader, you know, a much broader group of folks.  If you were to lose your domain name and your small independent business, that -- that is everything. And so making sure that you are at least protected by the terms of service when you sign up for a contract would, you know, probably make sense to us.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WATERS</emphasis>:  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.  I yield back the balance of my...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  And thank you, Ms. Waters.  </p><p>      The gentleman from Iowa, Mr. King, is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KING</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I appreciate being recognized, and I appreciate the testimony of the witnesses.  </p><p>      I want to just take a bit of a different tack here, if I could, and looking at the fraudulent Internet sites and the piece of this that's the direct focus of this hearing, and I'm just looking through some of the -- some of the background material, the problem of illegal pirating of copyrighted intellectual property.  And I would think that, you know, it's all trademarks and copyrights of patents altogether that I think about, not just Web sites and things that we can look at.  </p><p>      And so the -- there's a pattern across this country, or across the world, of certain countries that are pretty effective at this, and I'd just ask you if there's anybody on the panel, just raise your hand or answer, if you have a list of countries that are the most egregious violators of intellectual property rights from an American perspective?  </p><p>      Yes, sir?  I can't read your names.  I'm sorry, so...  </p><p>      O'LEARY:  Thank you, Congressman.  It's Michael O'Leary.  I -- the -- sorry.  The content industry has contributed share to something through the state department.  There's a number of different ways. There's a notorious markets filing, which chronicles the areas of the world where this is the most problematic, and then there's the special 301 process, whereby the United States puts forward a list and kind of characterizes where countries fall in terms of their protection of intellectual property.    </p><p>      And the reason for that, frankly, very simply, is that intellectual property is not just an American problem; it's a global problem, and what you're seeing around the world is that other countries are starting to recognize the benefit of not just protecting American intellectual property, but protecting their own.  I would note, for example, that there are at least 16 countries in the world that engage in site blocking now, which has been the focus of some of the debate here.  The Internet seems to be working fine in those countries.  It seems to be having an impact in terms of taking sites like the Pirate Bay, which is blocked in many countries, but not in the United States off-line.  </p><p>      So in many ways, the United States has historically been a world leader, but the truth of the matter, Congressman, from our perspective is if we don't step up and deal with the problems we have today, we're going to see background and we're not going to be the world leader. And that's -- that's unfortunate for country because we do lead the world in the production of intellectual property, and we ought to be leading the world in protecting it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KING</emphasis>:  Mr. O'Leary, do you have an opinion and then, as you've given me a couple of sources that might look at.  Can -- do you have a recollection on from which countries originate the greatest theft of intellectual property?  </p><p>      O'LEARY:  Off the top of my head, I would hesitate to list them in any type of specific order.  I mean there are different problems in different parts of the world.  There are hard goods problems, which is kind of the more traditional disk type piracy that occurs in places like Russia.  There are problems with online, country like Spain has a significant online piracy problem.  There are other places in Europe. We would be happy to provide you with the committee with a complete list.  I'm hesitant to speculate because I don't trust my memory well enough to get them in the right order.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KING</emphasis>:  Is China on your list?  </p><p>      O'LEARY:  China's on the list, yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KING</emphasis>:  And... </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p>      O'LEARY:  There's definitely a piracy problem in China, yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KING</emphasis>:  Do you have any recollection of what the loss might be to American property rights holders from China?  </p><p>      O'LEARY:  I don't off the top of my head.  It would be -- I'm not sure, frankly, that there's a way to measure it given the realities of China.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KING</emphasis>:  Would anyone in the panel be aware of any studies out of that U.S. trade representative?  It seems that three or four years ago, at least U.S. trade representative has a -- has a study done that calculates that loss of -- loss to U.S. intellectual property rights holders to different nations?  China, Russia comes to mind.  Anyone care to answer that?  I thought not on the underlying to...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PALLANTE</emphasis>:  Well, yes, Maria Pallante from the Copyright Office. I don't -- I don't have the dollar amount for you, but I would just echo what Michael said, which is that special 301 process identifies problematic standards in our trading partners when it comes IP as well as notorious markets and Web sites.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KING</emphasis>:  Does anyone have a more of a comprehensive solution? We're talking about shutting down some Web sites, but it's billions in theft of intellectual property rights globally.  And here we are, the United States of America, with the strongest -- some of the strongest laws and the strongest traditions of respect for intellectual property, and I don't see a broader comprehensive solution to this. It seems to me that they can move faster than we can -- we can adjust to them and that we're dealing with a component rather than the big picture.  </p><p>      Yes, sir, Mr. O'Leary?  And then...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p>      O'LEARY:  Congressman, I would argue that you're correct in the sense that this is a global problem.  It's multifaceted.  There's not a single approach that fits, but it's critically important to United States to maintain the high ground of the leadership in this because if we do not do it, other countries will not.  I would also note that the problem you're highlighting about the criminals moving faster, that's true regardless of what the crime is.  You ask anyone in law enforcement, that that's they'll tell you; you catch the ones who keep doing the same thing, and the people who would adapt and change you have to keep changing...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KING</emphasis>:  Are you aware of any state-sponsored intellectual property rights theft?  </p><p>      O'LEARY:  Are we worried about it?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KING</emphasis>:  Are you aware of state sponsored...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p>      O'LEARY:  We believe that that occurs, yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KING</emphasis>:  And I'm going to say I believe that happens from China as probably the lead globally to do that.  Does anyone disagree with that in the panel?  I didn't hear any disagreement.  I think I've gone far enough with this since my red light came on, but I do appreciate your -- all of your testimony, and I hope we can bring some piece of solution to this, and I hope at some point we can bring a whole solution to it.  </p><p>      Thank you very much, and I yield back the balance of my time.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. King.  </p><p>      The gentleman from Tennessee, Mr. Cohen, is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHEN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>      This is indeed an important issue for us to work out, and the theft of intellectual property is of grave concern.  But it nevertheless, First Amendment issues are important too.  And my first thought is that it doesn't seem like you need -- there should be that much difference from what the Google folks in the techie folks are wanting and what the MPAA and the RIA and the other AAs want.  </p><p>      Have -- let me ask maybe the gentleman from motion pictures, who's apparently got a Rick Perry problem with not being able to count to something, Mr. O'Leary.  Have y'all not gotten together and try to work this out in some way and fine-tune this to where there aren't these issues of people being penalized that are not guilty and sites being, you know, shut down, whether it's just a small infringement but not a total infringement?  </p><p>      O'LEARY:  Well, we do believe that this legislation will result in either of those things happening, but we work with -- our studios work with Google on a regular basis in terms of trying to get stuff taken down off the Internet.  There are ongoing relationships on this piece of legislation.  There have not, to my knowledge, been specific discussions about this.  But I want to be very clear; we have said from the beginning that if people are willing to come forward with constructive suggestions on how to do things that are not a pretext for maintaining the status quo, that we would listen to those things.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHEN</emphasis>:  Wonderful.  </p><p>      Ms. Oyama, do you have some positive, you know, not under pretense type -- pretext type of discussions that you like to come forth with?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  Yes.  So I think just in the broader context of figuring out how to go after piracy, it's really important to keep in mind the number one most effective tool for going after piracy would be to increase the amount of legitimate lawful services that are available on the Internet, right?  So if we can cut off the funding, we would decrease the supply of these pirate sites.  If we could have more legitimate services for music and movies and everything else, which I know that studios are working very hard to do, that would also decrease the consumer demand for this type of...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHEN</emphasis>:  Without necessarily itemizing each of them out, have you had the opportunity to post these to the team?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  Yes, so though we're here in DC today, I would assure you that all of our business partners, you know, on the West Coast are working very collaboratively, very, you know, much together to get the solutions, and we're always more than happy to continue to work with Mr. O'Leary and others.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHEN</emphasis>:  So we say -- you're all working now trying to come up with some language that would maybe -- that the chairman might put in the manager's amendment that would make all people happy?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  You know, there's been some conversations that I think there would need to be a lot more...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHEN</emphasis>:  I would hope there would be a lot more, and I think that's something that should take place.  </p><p>      Let me ask you a question, since I got you -- situate the microphone.  There are a couple of search engines in China and Russia, and Yandex (ph) I think it's one of them and Baidu, and some consider these rogue sites.  And whether they are not, I don't know.  They could be.  If they were considered such they were blocked because they had some pirate type folks among their constituency, how do you think the Chinese and Russians would respond toward -- towards your company and towards United States companies?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  That's an excellent question.  So I think we should realize that even though we would do something for really good reason here, it could potentially have international ramifications.  If the U.S.  Government is ordering U.S. companies to disappear for an search engines from our results, it -- it should be expected that there's going to be some form of retaliation internationally.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHEN</emphasis>:  And those sites of the leading Chinese and Russian search engines.  Is that correct?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  The sites that you mentioned?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHEN</emphasis>:  Yes, ma'am.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHEN</emphasis>:  Yes.  So if we -- is it possible under this legislation they'd be totally cut off entirely?  They'd be...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  If they were deemed rogue sites...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHEN</emphasis>:  Right. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  ...under section 102, they could -- search engines could receive an order to disappear the whole site.  It's really tough in a searcher out engine because although you could remove the direct link from a search, you know, as long as rogue site exists, people are still going to talk about it.  They're still going to blog about it. They're still going to post about it.  And so it's really not possible to remove all of worldwide discussion of the link.  And that's why we support the follow-the-money type legislation because that's really going after the source of the problem by choking off their financial reason to...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHEN</emphasis>:  Let me ask you another question, or maybe to the panel. I have the (inaudible) constituent services.  We do great constituent services in Tennessee nine.  In this way, on 1114, Ryan Turner (ph) wrote me an e-mail, and he says, \"I'm writing as your constituent.  As a constituent, I opposed this stop on mine I received.  I'm a student studying management of information systems.  Should this pass, I believe my future IT would be crippled.  Having the government handed DNS servers scares me, especially with the government suing Web site owners with one PRNI (ph)\" what I think is a misprint, \"the links as a content.    </p><p>      As a college student who owns over 30 domain names, most of these places for third parties to post text responses, should one of those include a link to material that infringe copyrights now -- now I would be held responsible.  I have no funding available to handle these claims, and I'm lucky enough to be trained on how to handle lawsuits with many -- many other entrepreneurs without formal training who have no idea how to handle it.\"  </p><p>      Would -- if he had this, and there was one text that came back that was maybe link to any illegal site, would he be cut off, and would he have to then go to hire at a lawyer and possibly go to court?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  I think so.  I think there's two ways that could happen. So one of the concerns, you know, that not just Google but the other technology companies will endorse the testimony the other trade associations are concerned about is that the definition in 103 of what is a site dedicated to theft is very broad.  There's some language in there that also refers to a site or a portion of the site.    </p><p>      So people have a lot of serious questions about what does that mean.  Are we looking at a full site or are we looking at -- you know, and today's Internet, the way most Web sites work, there's real-time communication, and so you have lots of real-time comments, you have lots of real-time posts.  If one comment or post is infringing, does that, you know, impugn the entire site, or we looking at it is statistically?  There's some other words in the definition they get people concerned that -- that it's overbroad.  </p><p>      So either been swept in it that way or enter the very broad immunities that are being given to service providers.  Pretty much anyone who qualifies under the definition of qualifying plaintiff, which is very broad, they could go to a payment or advertising service provider.  They could allege that the person that you mentioned is dedicated to a theft, and then those providers have complete immunity to shut them off.  So there's kind of -- there's a concern that there's a strong incentive in the bill, that if you wanted to immunize yourself, the easy thing to do would be to comply with the notice and shut them off.  And then...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  The chairman's time is expired, and I don't mean to cut you off, but you could frame your answer to a quick conclusion.  Or have you finished?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  I think that's good, thanks.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  OK.  Thanks.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I think you should go over.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  The gentleman from Arizona, Mr. Quayle, is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUAYLE</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I want to thank the witnesses for being here.  </p><p>      Ms. Oyama, I want to go back to what you were just talking about earlier about how long-term we can address the piracy issues via more legitimate websites that provide legitimate content on the Internet. And I want to go to your testimony that you indicated that the only long-term way to beat piracy online is to offer consumers more compelling legitimate alternatives, and you cited YouTube's free ad- based model for monetizing content.  </p><p>      You know, there could be some disagreement.  I don't know what's the best way to monetize content, whether it's a fee-based or free ad- based.  And if you look over the course of history, except for broadcast, it seems like most quality content has not been given away for free.  So one thing that I want to ask you is, would you agree that the piracy issues that we're dealing with and a pirate Web sites that we're dealing with actually makes it more difficult for a company to start a fee-based site that offers legitimate content, and thus, it forces content providers to look for ways that are going toward Web in ad-based -- I mean ad-based content to give it away for free?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  I think there's so many different models and ecosystem right now.  Certainly the problem of piracy is -- is of tremendous importance and great concern to any content provider, right?  You want to have control over the distribution of your content.  Some people choose to release it for free because they want to participate with their fans in that way.  Others want to license it, and others want to have an advertising model.  I think the kind of beauty of all the new services that we're seeing is there's no one-size-fits-all.  </p><p>      I do think we would approach you to is a really great example of how kind of technology and copyright can work together.  There's a tool on YouTube called content ID.  Because YouTube has a hosted platform, we host all the content so it's on our servers.  So through content ID, we're able immediately, a rights holder would give us their file.  If a user uploads a piece of content, we would immediately scan 6 million reference files.  And we could capture, if their song or their movie was being uploaded, and then the rights holder would have control of whether to monetize it or not.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUAYLE</emphasis>:  But I think my more direct question is that if we don't -- aren't able to crack down and have the tools and the ability to crack down on the pirate Web sites, then you are actually forcing content providers into a narrow avenue of that based, providing only content via ad-based and free markets and -- not free markets, but free content.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  So both -- both would be tremendously important, right? Increasing...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUAYLE</emphasis>:  Exactly.  But I mean it kind of goes -- when you're -- when you're looking at that and how we need to crack down on piracy, ad based, which is the model that Google uses, and it seems to be why -- one of the reasons you would be pushing for that because that is the way that Google makes their money, right?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  There's different ways, but that's...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUAYLE</emphasis>:  That's primary way.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  ...primary way for sure, yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUAYLE</emphasis>:  And I think that that's just my biggest concern is that if you're looking at just ad-based, you're cutting down one significant avenue for people to provide content, and if we don't shut down these pirate Web sites, that we're going to actually lose out on different types of business models, different types of content providing, and that was -- that was the point I wanted to make.  </p><p>      Ms. Pallante, I wanted to go to you.  Earlier, you stated in your opening testimony that you do not believe in the Safe Harbors under the DMCA are actually weakened by SOPA.  Could you expand on that a little bit?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PALLANTE</emphasis>:  Yes.  First of all, the bill says that, and secondly -- as a savings clause -- and secondly, there's no monetary relief. The injunctions that are allowed are already permitted under the DMCA. There are, contrary to popular belief, ways to get them to enjoin certain action for search engines and ISPs.  And there really does -- this bill is really designed to sit next to the DMCA.  The DMCA is related to particular files on a Web site, and does not require the participation of those who are really in a good position to help stem the tide of piracy.    </p><p>      So I would object to -- I'm I object to a couple of things that I have just heard from eyewitness, my fellow witness is, one is that I'm pretty sure that Google just said that it's the fault of content owners that we have rogue Web sites.  That just can't be the truth. Secondly, although follow the money could be effective, it does not bring in everybody in the Web -- in the ecosystem.  It doesn't bring in ISPs, it doesn't bring in search engines.  It doesn't account for the vast number of Web sites that offer content purposely for free, and it doesn't really address the broader role of law issue that we have on the Internet right now.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUAYLE</emphasis>:  And under the DMCR, there are actually instances where service provider can take down all content on a Webpage or on a Web site if there's infringing content on that Web site.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PALLANTE</emphasis>:  Yes, the only way I see that happening is if every single rights holder comes together at the same time it approaches the Web site and - and every file was actually infringing.  So...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUAYLE</emphasis>:  So it could be -- it could be possible under the DMCA.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PALLANTE</emphasis>:  It's highly unlikely.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUAYLE</emphasis>:  OK.  But the one thing I wanted to just get your final thoughts on, because opponents -- opponents of the bill actually say that it's going to endanger the security and the integrity of the Internet.  One of the things that the Internet has been very good at is in commerce, and wouldn't it also be fair to say that without shutting out these pirate Web sites, then we are also endangering the security and integrity of the Internet because they are putting out also -- often counterfeit goods and also infringe copyright material?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PALLANTE</emphasis>:  Right.  So there are three underlying purposes.  One is to protect content owners about their own property.  The second is to allow those who want to invest a place where there's sunshine and oxygen and a good environment for that.  And the third is to protect consumers, absolutely.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUAYLE</emphasis>:  Thank you.  I yield back.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  Can I just clarify one point?  I just wanted to make sure that nothing was mischaracterized, because I do not think that it's the fault of the rights holders.  Certainly, rights holders have the right to protect their content; however, they want, and we are completely committed to going after piracy.  My only point was that the success of the consumer appetite for services like Netflix and iTunes shows that there's a lot of different licensing models out there.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Can I follow-up on that, on one point, which I think is a practical point, which is being missed in Mr. Quayle's question. There are legitimate services out there now.  There are more of them, and there have been before, there will be more than tomorrow.  The problem is that when you go to Google and you punch in the name of the movie, those legitimate sites are buried on page 8 of the search results.  There is a better than average chance that Pirate Bay is going to end up ahead of Netflix.  That's a fundamental problem, no matter how many legitimate sites are out there, that we can't over, we can't do anything about.   </p><p>      If we could get Google to re-index those sites it away that favor legitimacy, to your question, Congressman Quayle, the consumers would be getting to those first.  But when Netflix is buried way down in the search results, it doesn't matter how good Netflix is -- is going to be.  And this is a practical problem that could be addressed today.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  OK.  And thank you, Mr. Quayle.  </p><p>      The gentlewoman from California, Ms. Chu, is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHU</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chair.  </p><p>      I would like ask about the savings clause, and I'd like to ask both Ms. Oyama and Mr. O'Leary about your opinion on this.  I'm aware that concerns have been raised by Internet companies, and many other sets of language of the bill may have unintended consequences.  And even though everybody agrees that the problem of foreign rogue sites is critical that we need to cut revenue to these sites, there may be disagreement on the language is drafted.  And I think it's really important that we try to recent common ground, that we work through language that is balanced and effective and make sure that we don't have unintended consequences.  </p><p>      One of the areas of disagreement on this online piracy act is an this question of -- of the savings clause and whether there is the community that is provided under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act for search engines and Internet service providers.  And so I would like to have your different opinions because there -- I -- some have represented to me that the Senate bill has a savings clause that seems to address this, but SOPA does not, and is that -- isn't that true?  I like to have your different opinions on this, Ms. Oyama and Mr. O'Leary.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  Sure.  So this is actually -- it sounds technical.  It's the savings clause, but it is of critical importance to the technology industry.  Businesses today really build their business models under the Safe Harbors that they know that they have on the DMCA.  So for technology company receives notice of infringement, they are required to expeditiously remove that infringement.  But they don't have kind of general monitoring obligation.  </p><p>      So the balance that we try to strike in any legislation would be if there are intermediaries who are required to do new things under this bill, that the bill would be really clear, advertisers shut off your services payment, shut off your services, and that would be clear, we take those obligations.  We want to make sure that this bill that's going after rogue sites doesn't strip us of those important Safe Harbors and kind of unrelated litigation or, you know, open the possibility that the status of orders could be used to establish red flag knowledge.    </p><p>      And so there's some language that we propose that would kind of alleviate that concern and keep this bill is effective as it needs to be to go after rogue sites.  But a -- but a savings clause to make sure that we're not open ourselves up to liability in a way that we would somehow need to proactively monitor all user generated content in real-time is really important to us.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHU</emphasis>:  Mr. O'Leary?  </p><p>      O'LEARY:  Congresswoman, I would just associate myself with the comments and testimony provided by the registrar of copyrights.  </p><p>      This legislation should as a complement to the DMCA.  It doesn't impugn those rights or the Safe Harbor in any shape -- way, shape or form.  The DMCA deals with good actors, legitimate services that are trying to take steps to get infringing stuff off of their sites. Rogue sites deal with a group of people that, under no definition, would fit underneath the DMCA.  They are bad actors.  They are dedicated to infringement.  These actually fit together.  To complement each other.  In no sense does this undermine the DMCA.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHU</emphasis>:  And...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  I think if that's the case, the one sentence clarifying that in any legislation would be tremendously helpful.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHU</emphasis>:  Ms. Pallante, what -- what is your opinion on this, on the savings clause and whether there are enough protections and the DMCA is not...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PALLANTE</emphasis>:  Right.  So again, the -- thank you for the question. The question, again, is just -- just -- well, the problem is just because somebody may be compliant under the DMCA does not mean that they shouldn't take action if the attorney general finds that there's a foreign infringing site run by criminals who are engaged in piracy. That is a -- just an unfair comparison, and this bill, if that is the argument, this bill does allow for that, and it's my view that it should.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHU</emphasis>:  Well, I'd like to ask a different question, and that is about jobs creation.  There are some that are saying SOPA would stifle innovation and job growth in that -- with a brokster (ph) opinion that -- which was a finding by the U.S. Supreme Court that it contributed to the infringement, that venture capital would dry up.  </p><p>      But Mr. Almeida, in your testimony, you noted that he represents over 4 million U.S. workers, and on their behalf support the -- that you actually support the Stop Online Piracy Act as an important jobs bill.  How do you respond to these claims that this legislation would stifle innovation and job growth?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ALMEIDA</emphasis>:  I think innovation is alive and well in the U.S., and I don't see this as stifling it in the least.  Our members work in the United States.  They're taxpayers.  They go to work.  They make products that we view as entertainment.  That is what we see this online piracy infringing on.  And you can't hit a price point when someone's giving it away for free to make a business model to compete with free. </p><p>      It also has to do with constructive innovation, and we believe in constructive innovation like Netflix as opposed to TVshack.bz, which is an infringing site that should be taken down.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHU</emphasis>:  Thank you.  I yield back.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  Did she -- did she yield back?  Did you yield back? Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHU</emphasis>:  Yes, I yield back.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  Thank you, Ms. Chair.  </p><p>      The gentleman from Texas, Mr. Poe, is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">POE</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I think all of you for being here. This panel or this committee is made up of former prosecutors, defense lawyers, and their even two former judges here.  And back in my experience on the bench down at the courthouse, or the Palace of Perjury, so referred to it in those days, saw a lot of thieves.  And it's, you know, stealing is stealing, and thieves are people we had to deal with.    </p><p>      I disagree with you, Mr. O'Leary.  They're not battle actors, they're thieves.  And this legislation is trying to get a grip on this.  We've got three -- really three groups say here.  We had the credit card companies, we had the search engine folks and the content providers.  If I had my way, I would lock all three of you in a room and don't - say, \"Don't come out until you all agree,\" and that we can solve it, I would -- I would think.  </p><p>      If you pull up, as I did, you pull up on Google search engine the Grinch Who Stole Christmas or Harry Potter, free Harry Potter movies for free the Grinch That Stole Christmas, you get a lot of free sites on there.  And as -- as a consumer, I can't tell who's a thief and who's not a thief.  And I know Google is doing a lot, millions of sites and all of that.  I've heard the testimony.  But at the point we are now, what can -- can Google offer to this bill that Google would sign on to the bill, specifically?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  Sure.  To -- to your point about the search results, one of the major commitments that we made this year was to improve the tools to make sure that when rights holders notify us, those search results will be disabled in the search.  And so the commitment that we had made at the beginning of the year was to reduce the turnaround time to under 24 hours.  And so we're happy to say right now it's -- it's six hours or less is the average turnaround.  In terms of what we could do affirmatively...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">POE</emphasis>:  Yes.  But this day forward.  You pull up the Grinch Who Stole Christmas and you keep going page after page for three Grinches.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  So long as those sites are there they are going to show up on the Internet.  And so we think that legislation that would target the source of those sites is necessary.  What we would do is we would support legislation that would go through the Department of Justice.    </p><p>      You would have a law enforcement aspect.  You would have a court determine that a site is dedicated to infringement.  And you could serve those orders on U.S. based payment providers and advertising. We have Google Checkout for payment.    </p><p>      We have AdSense, AdWords, a lot of advertising products that would directly regulate and impact our business.  But we think that if we can break the financial ties for those sites then that is really smart, targeted and effective and would avoid some of the collateral damage that we discussed earlier this morning.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">POE</emphasis>:  So, your answer is go after the finances.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  Cut off the finance.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">POE</emphasis>:  Yes.  Cut off the money.  So, if there was something that we added to the bill that would cut off the money then Google may support it?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  Those are certainly concepts in the bill that reflect that.  We think if you look at WikiLeaks that is how they've been taken out is by cutting off the money.    </p><p>      It's an approach that U.S. law enforcement uses for many different international problem, you know narcotics, terrorism.  I mean, it's been a proven way.  If you cut off someone's financial incentive, they're not going to want to pay for the servers and the bandwidth and the infrastructure to run these Web sites.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">POE</emphasis>:  OK.  Let me be a little more specific.  What can Google do? Not what the financial providers can do.  What can Google do to move this legislation forward?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  So, there's a lot we're doing in the private sector.  But in terms of the legislation, we would publicly support legislation like what I described, follow the money approach.  We would be happy to do that.  We would be happy to work with your staff on legislation in that way.  If it can avoid the collateral damage we discussed, and if we got a good definition of what the rogue site that didn't (inaudible) legitimate U.S. businesses.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">POE</emphasis>:  But you can't tell you when you pull it up, the Grinch Who Stole Christmas, who's the real Grinch and who's not.  You get all these page after page of free Grinches.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  That's why court adjudication or cooperation with Red Shoulders (ph) is real important.  There's lots of legitimate free movies.  There's lots of content that just the middle man wouldn't really know if that was licensed or infringing.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">POE</emphasis>:  You want to weigh in on that, Mr. O'Leary?  </p><p>      O'LEARY:  I think to use the example of The Grinch, there's a movie right now as I mentioned earlier called J. Edgar.  The only lawful place you can see that movie in a theater.  If you go back to your office and put J. Edgar into Google, you're going to get the same list of eight pages of sites where it's free.  That movie's not available for free anywhere.  If you want to see it you have to go to a theater right now.    </p><p>      So, I understand the complexity.  You're talking about something that is perhaps not in the theater.  But this is actually in the theater right now.  And there's no reason for it to be online in any fashion frankly.   </p><p>      I also think that what is being proposed, what was being suggested is -- as I said earlier, we should follow everybody's money. And isolating one or two things, that doesn't solve the search engine problem that we've been talking about.  And we think that should be a part of the discussion too.    </p><p>      We think it requires all of the people that are involved in this to work together to get it done.  Kind of to your theory of throw everybody in a room and sort it out.  If everybody doesn't go in the room at the beginning, you're not going to sort it out.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">POE</emphasis>:  Well, maybe we need a court order to get you all three in a room.   </p><p>      Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I yield back.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  Thank you.  Maybe get the FBI to help you in that, J. Edgar Hoover style.   </p><p>      Mr. Deutch, you're recognized for the next five minutes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEUTCH</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chair.   </p><p>      First of all, it's not just J. Edgar.  I -- I have teenage daughters who are awfully excited about the new Breaking Dawn movie, which is coming out.  You can watch that right now online for free.   </p><p>      What I -- what troubles me about this whole exchange quite frankly is on the one hand there's this great technology, Ms. Oyama, that you're so proud to trumpet, understandably, about -- from YouTube and what YouTube does in order to prevent illegal content from being posted.  Yet when you enter -- \"watch Breaking Dawn for free\" and you can do it online now, there you throw your arms up in the air, there's nothing we can do.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  Right.  I can understand how that would feel frustrating. Technologically there's a distinction.  So, on YouTube the content that is posted on YouTube is hosted on our servers.  So, we're able to match files.  If someone tries to upload something on YouTube we have a reference file we can match against.  We don't control the World Wide Web.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEUTCH</emphasis>:  I understand that's a technology issue.  We can talk more about that.   </p><p>      I have another question for you.  There is -- this has been a fruitful exchange.  Different than I might've expected from the way a number of us have referenced already.  The way this debate is played out in the local press in particular, I don't know whether -- I don't know whether Google shares the position publicly that this bill will kill the Internet and all of the advertisements that have resulted and all of the phone calls we received in our office.    </p><p>      But I do wonder whether there is any base level here that you would agree needs to be tackled.  And so if we -- if the issue is the language that says a portion thereof, let's assume that he bill didn't have that language in there.    </p><p>      So, you can't argue that Twitter would have to be taken down. Which, by the way, is an argument that is -- there's no basis for that argument under this bill.  You can't argue under this bill that Facebook would have to be taken down.  There's no basis for that under this proposed bill.  And I think -- I think that you understand that, notwithstanding the reference to individual tweets that might lead a whole site to be taken down.   </p><p>      My question is, if that language weren't in there, are there any of these Web sites that -- that you believe should be taken down, and that Google ought to play a role in helping us accomplish that?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  Yes.  We would be happy to work with the chairman, with your office on a follow the money legislation.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEUTCH</emphasis>:  OK.  Well, let me -- I understand -- so you don't like the way it's -- the bill is written.  Let me ask you about that because you referred -- you made many references today to following the money.  Yesterday your chairman recommended regulations based on tracing payments, banning Web sites offering illegal materials as a replacement for this bill consistent with what you've said today.   </p><p>      Many of the offshore sites clearly engaging in theft are driven by -- as you point out, are driven by ad revenue, not just credit card transactions.  As we follow -- if we want to follow the money we can't just focus on the credit cards obviously.  We have to focus on the ads.  Google, at least from the statistics I've been told retains over 75 percent of all search advertising revenue in the U.S.  Therefore following the money leads us to you.  </p><p>      So, tell me what -- tell me the steps that Google's taken already, understanding that you're concerned about these -- this intellectual property theft, understanding the impact that it's going to have that has every day on our economy.  Tell me the steps that Google has taken to combat it under -- using the follow the money approach that you favor.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  OK.  So, just to confirm a legislation that would go after ads is a big part of our business...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEUTCH</emphasis>:  I understand.  I understand.  But given...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  We're happy to support that.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEUTCH</emphasis>:  I understand that.  But tell me what you've done...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  OK.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEUTCH</emphasis>:  ... now in the absence -- because we all acknowledge this is an important issue.  And if...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  And one shouldn't prevent the other, right.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEUTCH</emphasis>:  Right.  You can play a significant role today.  So, if you can just speak to what you've done.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  OK.  So, there were some major commitments that our general counsel Kent Walker made at the beginning of the year.  I'll just try to tick off the major ones, but we should try to follow up with your office on more specifics.    </p><p>      For DMCA we've removed more than five million infringing files this year, as one rights holder notified us.  One of the concerns we'd heard is that there was some grit in the system and that there was frustration that it was taking too long.  So, we invested significant engineering hours and money to improve this role.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEUTCH</emphasis>:  Ms. Oyama, I hate to cut you off.  I don't have a lot of time here.  But I would -- I'd ask that you follow up.  I know -- I remember Mr. Walker's testimony.  I followed up with a letter after that hearing requesting all sorts of information.  That letter's still not -- I've not received a response.  So, I hope that -- I hope that a response will be forthcoming to that letter and to the request that I made here today.    </p><p>      I just -- I'd like to finish with this.  This notion that we're going to break the Internet, that somehow we're going to stifle innovation, the fact that the kid serving me coffee at Starbucks told me, hey, I hear you're taking up legislation that's going to make it impossible for me to download music.    </p><p>      The fact is what we're worried about is -- the reason this legislation -- the reason we're having this discussion, what we're worried about is not stifling that innovation in the future.  That's a concern that we all have.  I don't believe that the legislation does that.    </p><p>      But we know right now if we do nothing that the film industry and those young directors who are starting out aren't going to be able to do their craft.  And we're not going to have the next Adele, and we're not going to have the next Drake because they're not going to be compensated for their work.    </p><p>      And I hope that as we go forward and as you provide those answers that we can have an honest discussion about what's really at stake here and -- and let's move past these -- these -- these attacks on those of us who believe this and suggest that somehow we're going to mean an end to the Internet.    </p><p>      It's not -- it's not accurate.  I think -- I think you understand that it's not accurate.  And it doesn't do the American economy any -- any great service at all.    </p><p>      And with that I yield back.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  Gentleman yields back.  And the gentleman from Texas -- the other gentleman from Texas, Mr. Gohmert, is recognized for five minutes.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOHMERT</emphasis>:  Mr. Chairman -- there we go.    </p><p>      Again, also appreciate your being here.  It is a tough subject. And we're dealing with intellectual property here.  And I, like my friend Judge Poe, who was a district judge and also a chief justice. And we dealt with -- it wasn't called bad actors.  You dealt with theft.  And that's really what we're talking about here.    </p><p>      It's a crime.  It's a theft.  We don't want thieves working their way through an honest, legitimate, wonderful means of in this case the Internet.    </p><p>      Now, in the past some have used the analogy of the pawn shop, that you know the pawn shop can't intentionally and knowingly assist in theft.  And so there were laws made, most states have them, where people -- the law enforcement can go in and get information.    </p><p>      Now, I know, and I've been resistant to some of the pushes to force Internet providers and search engines into doing things that we don't even require pawn shops to.  And I thought some were going overboard in trying to make demands on search engines that we don't even demand at pawn shops.   </p><p>      But on the other hand, there is this aspect of our criminal law. And every state has it; the federal government has it.  Anyone who aids, abets, encourages, in any way assists someone in committing a crime, the law is very clear in every state and the federal code. You're just as guilty as if you committed the crime yourself.  The question is do you intentionally or knowingly aid?    </p><p>      Well, it's been brought up often enough.  There are thieves using the Internet.  And I keep hearing from people who say look, if it were illegal for me to use that free Web site, then how come I get access so easily?  They're expecting us to do something.  And I think most of us were hoping that there would be something worked out between the interests here.    </p><p>      But I can give you an example.  I know what the law is.  And I was -- I was -- I had an 8-track, A Warm Shade of Ivory, Henry Mancini, back in college.  And it got me through some all-nighters, that and Jonathan Livingston Seagull soundtrack.    </p><p>      And so anyway, Sleepless in Seattle has the song In the Wee Small Hours of the Morning, and I wanted to get that.  I wanted to download it.  I paid two bucks for it, not just $0.99.  Nobody has it except some free Web sites.  I knew not to go use those and download it free because it's illegal.  Most people don't.    </p><p>      So, when we talk about follow the money, we're talking about something terribly difficult in going to China, going to Russia and trying to follow the money over there.  We're not getting help from those folks.  Archer Blackford (ph) and I met with their folks in China that handled this stuff.  And it seemed pretty clear to me we weren't going to get a whole lot of help out of them.    </p><p>      So, what should we do to keep from hurting the innovation of the Internet and Google and Bing and these folks that come up with great ideas?  But at the same time balance the interests in this being a law-abiding society?  And I'm gratified to hear people on both sides of the aisle have similar concerns.    </p><p>      So, it just doesn't seem to me to be that onerous to say if someone goes to court for heaven sakes and proves with probable cause standards that somebody's committing a crime of theft, and then that is presented to an Internet provider, a search engine, these people are committing a crime, there's probable cause to believe that's justification for a warrant, why that's too onerous to say don't make them accessible.    </p><p>      And I'm still having trouble understanding that.  And I would welcome comments in that regard from whoever wishes to.  Thank you.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  Thank you.  I think we completely agree about the importance of having a federal judge play the role of an arbiter so that folks' services aren't being terminated just by a five-day notice to their provider without the ability to appear to defend themselves. I think to your point about what we can do is probably three things.    </p><p>      So, one would be building on the DMCA.  Under the DMCA today search results can be line edited out.  If a rights holder tells a search engine to remove a piece of content, we have worked incredibly hard over the last year to improve our tools.  The average turnaround time today is six hours if we get received notice.    </p><p>      So, we're working really hard on improving that.  It's not perfect.  It's not done.  It's something we'll need to work on.   </p><p>      The second piece, though, would be to build on that and to come together and support legislation that would impose new obligation on other providers.  So, we are also an advertising provider, largely an advertising provider, a payment provider.  A judicial process where a court determined that a site was dedicated to infringement and then instructed U.S. based intermediaries to shut off financial ties to that Web Site, that's the most important and effective thing we could do.    </p><p>      If we can knock them off at their knees and we can cut off their financial ties, they won't have a reason to be in business anymore. They won't be making money.  That's the effective way to go.    </p><p>      And then the third piece would be to get rid of the ineffective and harmful pieces.  So, I realize reasonable people can disagree about this.  But there is a tremendous concern in the technology industry about some of the remedies that are being proposed and some of the unintended consequences that would have you know potentially very severe repercussions for the Internet network, for people's security and free speech concerns.    </p><p>      So, getting the balance right is something we can support.  And we certainly think that there is a way forward and a way that we could all agree on going after these sites.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOHMERT</emphasis>:  OK.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LOFGREN (?)</emphasis>:  Would the gentleman yield?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOHMERT</emphasis>:  Well, I'd ask unanimous consent to allow others to finish answering because there's a couple of hands.  And I'd certainly...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  Gentleman is extended another minute.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOHMERT</emphasis>:  You had requested to comment.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLARK (?)</emphasis>:  I'd just add that in regard to your comments about thievery and Congressman Poe's, from our industry's perspective, it's more than thievery.  It's murder.  We do feel -- I particularly feel -- I have 28 years of federal law enforcement.  I know crime when I see it.  And I see counterfeit medicines as actually attempted murder.   </p><p>      I mean, it's not quick.  It's not immediate.  But when you're only giving a patient 20 percent of the medicine they need to cure their cancer or their heart problems or their high blood pressure, you're in fact killing them slowly.  But that's the issue here...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOHMERT</emphasis>:  Well, as a prosecutor you know that might not be murder.  It may be negligent homicide or other -- some other type of homicide.         </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLARK (?)</emphasis>:  Along those lines.  And it's frustrating if we are not immediately making progress in cutting that down.  </p><p>      I've worked with CBP in pilot programs and I'm seeing those counterfeits flooding in because of the purchases over the Internet over the rogue Web sites that are selling counterfeit medicines.  And it's incredulous to me how much is coming into the United States.   </p><p>      So, I would say, you know this bill is going forward with demonstrating that we need to change the status quo.  We can't accept what's existing right now.  And I agree very much that we have to demonstrate to people that there are consequences and this is a serious crime.    </p><p>      When you look at six months, four months, three years, that's the cost of doing business.  It can't be that bad if that's all they're going to get.  So, I also see the Title II (ph) in this that is very, very significant as well.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOHMERT</emphasis>:  Was there anybody else wanted to comment?  Thank you.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LOFGREN (?)</emphasis>:  Would the gentleman yield?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOHMERT</emphasis>:  Yes.  Sure.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LOFGREN (?)</emphasis>:  I just wanted to briefly -- one of the -- I think it was Mr. O'Leary suggested that if you type in \"J. Edgar movie\" you get all these infringing sites.  I just did that.  And what you get is the show times in Washington, a review, the Wikipedia article, the trailer from Warner Brothers, several reviews of the movie, the iTunes trailer.  There's not a single infringing site that comes up.  So, I...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARINO (?)</emphasis>:  (Inaudible)...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH (?)</emphasis>:  Would the gentle woman -- would the gentleman yield?  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK) </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARINO (?)</emphasis>:  ... you use the word \"free\" in there.  That's where those things come up.  Yes, I'll yield.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH (?)</emphasis>:  Would you yield?  Well, I just did the same thing and on...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LOFGREN (?)</emphasis>:  Google?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH (?)</emphasis>:  Google...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LOFGREN (?)</emphasis>:  Google or Bing?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH (?)</emphasis>:  Google'd it, \"watch J. Edgar Hoover free online on YouTube full version\".  Shows you how to download it at no cost right here.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LOFGREN (?)</emphasis>:  Well, I did a different search engine.  But the point I'm trying to make...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOHMERT</emphasis>:  Would the gentleman...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARINO (?)</emphasis>:  ... going back...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOHMERT</emphasis>:  ... reclaiming my time, I...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  The gentleman's time has expired.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOHMERT</emphasis>:  OK.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LOFGREN (?)</emphasis>:  I would ask could the gentleman be granted 15 seconds and so I might say just an answer to.  The point is the search engines are not capable of actually censoring the entire World Wide Web.    </p><p>      That's the problem.  You can't do that.  And so we need to go after the people who are committing crimes in a way that's going to work.  I think that we can do that, but this bill is not it...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARINO (?)</emphasis>:  Well, with all due respect, I wanted to show the... </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOHMERT</emphasis>:  Well, reclaiming my time...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  The gentleman's time...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOHMERT</emphasis>:  ... I agree, but...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  ... is expired.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOHMERT</emphasis>:  ... we also need to cut off the getaway car.  And with that -- and I'm not sure what the gentle lady has against Google, but I respect her using Bing.  And yield back the time.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  The gentleman yields back time he does not have.  I'm going to accuse you of being a liberal here in a minute.   </p><p>      Mr. Johnson is recognized for five minutes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.   </p><p>      Mr. O'Leary, SOPA requires payment networks like MasterCard to suspend payment transactions between a U.S. customer and an online merchant within five days.  According to Ms. Kirkpatrick's testimony, there are very legitimate challenges that payment networks have in meeting such a short deadline, especially considering the multiple players involved in an online transaction.   </p><p>      The Senate version requires payment networks to take actions as expeditiously as reasonable.  Earlier this year the White House negotiated a best practices document with the payment industry that has a reasonable period of time standard.    </p><p>      Which of these standards is acceptable to you, the within five days under SOPA, the expeditiously as reasonable under the Senate version, and a reasonable period of time as negotiated between the White House and the payment industry?  </p><p>      O'LEARY:  Yes, sir.  I think it's a legitimate question and one that we believe can be resolved favorably to everyone.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Which one do you think is most acceptable to you?  </p><p>      O'LEARY:  As I sit here right now I'm not prepared to pick between the three, quite honestly.  I certainly understand the point that was made by our colleagues at MasterCard.  If it's not possible you delve in five days.  We certainly don't want to create a time limit which forces them into an impossible situation.   </p><p>      At the same time we would like the legislation to recognize that if someone's trying to...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  (Inaudible)...  </p><p>      O'LEARY:  ... they don't do that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  If I give you -- if I open up the tent for you to stick your nose in, boy are you going to get all the way up in there.  I'm just appreciating your gift of gab.   </p><p>      But if I might ask Mr. Clark the same question.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLARK</emphasis>:  I feel the same way.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  OK.  All right.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLARK</emphasis>:  Sorry.  I feel the same way.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  All right.    </p><p>      Ms. Pallante, section 506 of the Copyright Act establishes criminal liability for the willful infringement of a copyright. Recently there has been confusion as to the definition of that term, willful.  Do you think that willfulness is the same as intentional? Or does the act -- tell me about the difference between those two standards.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PALLANTE</emphasis>:  Right.  So, that's a great question.  And the point of SOPA is to capture those that knowingly engage in a known legal duty. And that is the standard that most courts have accepted.  There are some exceptions to that.  I think that's something that can be clarified in the bill and legislative history perhaps.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  All right.    </p><p>      Ms. Oyama, the DMCA and Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act represent the legal underpinnings of the view that intermediaries need not monitor or supervise the communications of users.  It is a view that we have long touted and pushed across the world through various diplomatic channels.  We have harshly criticized governments who use such virtual walls to prevent citizen access to the Internet. China's a great example.    </p><p>      With that in mind, would this legislation allow companies to demand that search engines located inside the U.S. censor where American consumers are able to go on the Internet?  And how would this legislation likely be viewed by China and other -- and Iran and other countries that put these roadblocks up in terms of content to their citizens on the Internet?  And how would that affect our diplomacy?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  Thanks.  So, for the DMCA piece that you mentioned I think we would certainly agree.  The DMCA has proved to be a foundation for American innovation and has struck a balance.  So, if you're a new company or starting up you know what the laws are.  You have certainty.    </p><p>      And it also helps rights holders.  If a rights holder is aware that there is infringing content on the service provider, they just need to let us know.  Web posting companies, search engines, we will remove access to that content.  It strikes the right balance.    </p><p>      It does -- it takes care of infringing speech.  It leaves up legitimate speech.  And it reflects a careful balance.  It also -- because of the way Web services are used today, we see all over the place when there's real time events it's important that a Web platform enables that type of real-time communication or real-time ecommerce.    </p><p>      If you didn't have the DMCA and an intermediary platform was required or potentially liable for what its users were posting in real time, you would have to implement some type of proactive monitoring system.  It could really change the dynamics of the Web today.    </p><p>      I think the second...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  It would stifle the small entrepreneur that's just getting started more than it would hamper the larger providers of content...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  I think it's both, but...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  It would be a burden on both.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  Yes.  If you're a new company starting up, you'll have less money to invest in that type of monitoring.  So, certainly it would have an impact on small businesses.    </p><p>      To your question about you know kind of the speech aspect, you know if we impose a law here which would have court orders requiring a domestic search engine to make entire full Web sites disappear, and especially if there's some type of over broad definition, which would capture the legitimate speech, you know unfortunately what we do here would have other ramifications.  And we may think that this is a good reason.   </p><p>      We do think it's a good reason here.  But we feel the time for Google if DMCA requests competitors try to take each other down.  Pro- Democracy speech tries to be quelled.  We've seen in Libya in the recent activities there different politicians trying to take each other's YouTube channels out because they disagree with their views.    </p><p>      We see copyright used all the time as an excuse to quell speech. If we mandate this type of approach there, we really need to think carefully about what types of international ramifications that will have on free expression.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  Gentleman's time is expired.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  If I might get just one more question.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  All right.  The gentleman's already had extra time, but so has everybody else.  So, go ahead.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Thank you.   </p><p>      The Justice Department has responsibilities under the -- under the SOPA Act.  While at the same time we've been talking about downsizing government.  And in fact, the Justice Department has lost about 30 percent of their attorneys.    </p><p>      How does this affect the effort to criminally go after these pirates and also from a civil standpoint? I'll ask that to Mr. O'Leary.   </p><p>      O'LEARY:  Well, I think that you know this bill is actually -- speaks directly to that point.  That's part of the reason there's the ability for individual plaintiffs to move so that the burden does not fall solely on the Justice Department.    </p><p>      The content industry, Pfizer...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  What about the criminal part though?  Because we get people...  </p><p>      O'LEARY:  Well, these are...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  ... prosecuted for shoplifting and stealing little small petty items.  But this is multibillion dollar white collar fraud, which only the Justice Department has or should have the -- really has the resources and the breadth of law enforcement ability to address.  How does the downsizing of the Justice Department impact criminal prosecution?   </p><p>      O'LEARY:  Well, I think as a general premise when you downsize the Justice Department obviously it has an impact.  But let's be very clear.  The Justice Department does pursue criminal cases internationally...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  How can it do so...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p>      O'LEARY:  ... (inaudible)...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  Gentleman's time is expired.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  Some time ago.   </p><p>      Recognize myself for five minutes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Well, I am a liberal.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  All right.  I would not accuse you of being anything else.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Well, I bear that...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  My friend.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  I bear that stain with great honor.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  This is sort of reverse of the old story that I went to a fight and a hockey game broke out.  I came here and as one who has not made up his mind on this bill, hoping to receive information on this. And I think everybody on this panel is committed to fighting piracy.   </p><p>      I mean, maybe I'm the only member of this committee who's got a gold record.  I got it from the recording industry for my work on counterfeiting when I was the attorney general of California.  So, I very much believe that it's an important role for us to play, law enforcement and civil law in this regard.   </p><p>      But my concern is something that was brought to my attention as the chairman of the Cyber Security Subcommittee on Homeland Security. And that is the existence of a system that has been ongoing for some years called DNS Security, DNS SEC.  And I have heard from those -- some of the engineers that have been working on this in the Internet area that if we applied this law in this way it would undo what we've been doing to try and secure the Internet by way of DNS SEC or DNS Security.    </p><p>      So, I'd like to ask the panelists if any of you feel you can speak to this point because it's one that was raised with me.  I'm not a technical expert on this.  But was some real alarm by Internet engineers I would call them who really don't have a dog in this fight. But our concern -- in terms of the speech between the various special interests here, and I mean that in the proper way, special interests.   </p><p>      And so what I'd ask Mr. Clark, for instance.  Are you aware of this criticism?  And does this legislation, would it dis-incentivize Internet service providers from using the DNS Security extensions because it mandates the redirection of customers to another Web site?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLARK</emphasis>:  No.  I'm afraid I'm not familiar with that and not a cyber...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  OK.    </p><p>      Mr. O'Leary?  </p><p>      O'LEARY:  Well, I'm certainly aware of the argument.  And the people that we've talked to it's a concern which is frankly overstated, as I mentioned earlier in response to another question. There are numerous countries around the world that engage in this type of activity.  The Internet has worked without a problem in regard to that.    </p><p>      I think also you know they're overlooking and looking at this debate.  There's an existing security problem with the current state of play.  And that is these rogue sites taking private information from consumers and spreading malware and spyware and things like that.   </p><p>      The final thing I would say is that in regard to other things like dealing with malware, dealing with spyware, dealing with child pornography, this type of activity occurs all the time and the Internet seems to function just fine.  I tend to agree with the comments of Mr. Deutch that if the Internet is going to be all things to all people, it should also be in terms of trying to help us stop people from stealing our stuff.    </p><p>      The problem, frankly is, is that the Internet seems to...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  That's not my point.  My point is whether or not you can respond to specific question raised by Stuart Baker, former DHS assistant secretary of policy and former NSA general counsel to the effect that if this approach to respond to a legitimate problem were put into effect it would undercut an effort that's been going on for nearly a decade to secure the Internet by way of this program that I referred to.   </p><p>      O'LEARY:  We disagree with that position.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  OK.  Can you submit in writing for us specifically how you disagree...  </p><p>      O'LEARY:  Sure.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  ... with that?  </p><p>      O'LEARY:  Happy to.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  Ms. Kirkpatrick?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KIRKPATRICK</emphasis>:  I'm unfamiliar with that element.  I'm not aware of it.  I don't have the technical expertise to comment on it.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  Does anybody with your organization have this expertise?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KIRKPATRICK</emphasis>:  I certainly can follow up and get back to you.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  Please respond to that specific question because to me it's an underlying question that's extremely important.  And I've worked on the problem of cyber security.  If what we're doing here has the unintended consequence of upsetting what is, at least in the opinion of a number of experts -- and they may be wrong.  I'm trying to ferret this out.  Undercut a real effort that would practically help us secure the Internet.  That is bothersome.   </p><p>      Ms. Oyama?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  Sure.  So, I think the concerns that you mentioned are the ones that we've heard as well from many cyber security experts.  I know Stuart Baker has written about this.  The designers of DNS SEC themselves have published a white paper.    </p><p>      I am not -- I am not...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  Does your -- have your people...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  Do you have anybody that has expertise with your association that could respond to that specifically?  Because...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  I think...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  This is not part of this hearing.  And I'm very concerned that evidently this bill is not being referred to my subcommittee. And we have -- and I'm not parochial about this, but if we're going to do it we ought to at least talk about it and to have people come here and say our organization, either we don't take a position or we're not experts on this is upsetting.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  I think that there is great concern within our company...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  Well, could you please respond in writing on that?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  Sure, happy to.  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  And Mr. Almeida?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ALMEIDA</emphasis>:  No.  No expertise.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  OK.   </p><p>      Ms. Pallante, do you have any?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PALLANTE</emphasis>:  I think that Congress should absolutely consult objective technical experts.  But what I'll add is that ICE, through operation on our sites, has been using the existing seizure and civil forfeiture laws to essentially disappear Web sites in the United States.  So, this bill would take that criminal standard and apply it to foreign sites.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  Thank you very much.    </p><p>      Let's see, who's next?  Mr. Marino is next.  For five minutes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARINO</emphasis>:  Thank you. Chairman.   </p><p>      Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for being here.    </p><p>      And I want to -- I think my colleague and friend Ms. Lofgren and I pointed out a very good example of how easy this is on some sites and not others.  I think Zoe went to Bing and got the trailers.  And I went to Google, typing in \"free\" who sent me to YouTube for the free movie.  So, you know it's -- there's a lot of work to be done here.    </p><p>      Ms. Oyama, I want to compliment you on your decorum and your professionalism and your loyalty to your company for being here and answering the tough questions that you have been answering -- you have been answering.  You're certainly an asset to your corporation.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  Thank you.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARINO</emphasis>:  Nevertheless, I think it's reprehensible that the chairman, that the CEO, the president, the counsel, none of them thought it was responsible enough for them to be here.  And they sent you into the lion's den.  And you certainly deserve a large portion of their bonus at the end of the year.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  Can I just add one thing?  Our general counsel, he was here in the spring.  He cares very much about this problem...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARINO</emphasis>:  Good.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  ... and doing it the right way.  He, I think, sent a letter saying any other day -- he had a longstanding personal commitment for today.  Any other day he would be here and he looks forward to (inaudible)...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARINO</emphasis>:  All right.  I give that to him.  And I remove his name from that list.  And he can keep his bonus.  All right.  </p><p>      Let me ask you a question here.  I want to thank Google for what it did for child pornography getting off the Web site.  I was a prosecutor for 18 years and I find it commendable and I put those people away.    </p><p>      So, if you can do that with child pornography, why can you not do it with these rogue Web sites?  And let me follow that up with, why not hire some whiz kids out of college to come in and monitor this and get -- and work for the company to take these off?  </p><p>      My daughter who is 16 and my son is 12.  We love to get on the Internet.  And we download music.  And we pay for it.    </p><p>      And I get to a site, and I say this is a new one, this is good, we can get some music here.  My daughter says dad, don't go near that one.  That's illegal.  It's free, and given the fact that you're on Judiciary I don't think you should be doing that.  </p><p>      So, it's pretty -- maybe we need to hire her.  But why not?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OYAMA</emphasis>:  So, the two problems are similar in that they're both very serious problems.  They're both things that we all should be working to fight against.  But they're very different in how you go about combating it.    </p><p>      So, for child porn, we are able to design a machine that can detect child porn.  You can detect certain colors that would show up in pornography.  You can detect flesh tones.  You can have a manual reviewer or someone look at the content and they would say this is child porn and it shouldn't appear.   </p><p>      We can't do that for copyright just on our own because any video, any clip of content it's going to appear to the user to be the same thing.  And so you need to know from the rights holder, the owner of the right, have you licensed it?  Have you authorized it?  Or is this infringement?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARINO</emphasis>:  I only have a limited amount of time here, and I appreciate your answer.  But we had the technology.  Google has the technology.  We have the brain power in this country.  We certainly can figure it out.   </p><p>      Let me move on here.  First of all, Mr. Clark and Mr. O'Leary, I want to thank you for your dedication to law enforcement.  I've been down there for 18 years and thank you so much.   </p><p>      And Mr. Almeida, my father was a fireman for 30 years, so I know exactly what you're talking about.   </p><p>      So, I want to pose this question to anyone.  It's my understanding that taking down a portion of the site is much more difficult than taking down the entire site, so I'm hearing from the testimony here.  So, is there a more balanced approach that we can assist you in taking, but you take the lead on it, in diffusing this problem and stopping this infringement on this material, this illegal stealing of our materials that is costing us jobs and is costing this country a lot of money?    </p><p>      Do you understand my question?  Please jump in, anyone.  I don't think anyone understands my question.    </p><p>      Ms. Pallante?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PALLANTE</emphasis>:  No.  Well, I appreciate the question.  I don't know the answer.  </p><p>      Certainly when law enforcement goes before a judge and tries to get a court order that would allow it to seek relief from the Web site and then engage the search engines, the ISPs, the payment processors, et cetera to help, they -- they -- they would like to stop the infringing material and not the non-infringing material.  I don't know if it's a technical solution or if it's just a question of each Web site having different pages where they can easily find the infringing content.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARINO</emphasis>:  Do any of you agree with me that we do have the brain power and the technology available to figure this out if we want to spend the money?  All right.    </p><p>      Thank you and I yield back my time.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  Great.  Gentleman's time's up.   </p><p>      Mr. Almeida, you're recognized for the last five minutes of this hearing.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ALMEIDA</emphasis>:  Thank you for that strategic timing of my recognition, Mr. Chairman.  I appreciate that.  So, in honor of your discretion I will not use the whole time.   </p><p>      I would like to first of all associate myself with the comments of my colleague from California at the end of the diocese, Mr. Deutch. I think he's hit the nail on the head.  When you're the last guy you don't want to try to see if you can prolong things any more than usual.   </p><p>      I would like to ask the Chair, however, since there's written responses to this security thing, and I tried to write the guy's name down.  I'm new; I don't know.  Maybe it was Stuart Baker.  Maybe we could have Stuart Baker's concerns written so we can have something to compare those with.  And if that's out of order then I'll shut up on that and move right along...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  Mr. Baker's article was asked by unanimous consent to be part of the record from the gentle lady -- the gentle lady from California's giving it to me right now.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ALMEIDA</emphasis>:  OK.  Good.  Thank you.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  And if I were a chair I would have him here.  But I'm only temporary chair.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ALMEIDA</emphasis>:  Thank you for your compassion for someone who's been here for 61 days.   </p><p>      Finally, so that I have something to yield back, I appreciate the concerns and all.  This strikes me as one of those deals where the pursuit of the perfect is going to get in the way of the good.    </p><p>      One thing -- and I apologize for missing the part that I missed, but there was an opportunity to talk with some folks in anther committee that was kind of important.  But I didn't hear anything that said no, this is not an issue.  No, this is not taking place.  No, those jobs of this gentleman on the end are not being threatened.  No, it's not real-time impacts when Mr. Marino can dial it in and be watching it right now.   </p><p>      Quite frankly, I think there's an issue -- I don't know how you address it because nobody should leave the room thinking I'm technically savvy.  But -- I don't have anything to type on as a matter of fact.  They even took my iPhone away today.  So.   </p><p>      But I'll tell you this.  The impacts are instantaneous.  Once it's downloaded, it's gone.  That horse is out of the barn and it's never coming back.  And when you have a broken leg you need to go to the hospital.    </p><p>      And like it or not -- and I -- and I agree with Mr. Marino's comments.  Way to go.  Whatever they're paying you, it's not enough. And so if those pansies want to come by some day and say hi, tell them they're welcome.   </p><p>      So, anyhow, when your leg's broken you got to go to the hospital. And unfortunately you're in the medical business on this stuff.    </p><p>      And so I can just say that my concern is this.  You're a major operational piece of this.  The criminal activities are uncontroverted that are happening.  And to do nothing is wrong.  Nothing happens quick in this -- in this process I believe from my vast amount of experience.  And so it's time to try something.   </p><p>       And so while I appreciate the concerns, when I hear a recurring theme of follow the money, there's plenty money around to follow, and that's a good thing.  I'm a Republican.  It's a good thing to make money.  </p><p>      So, I will just tell you from my perspective, it's time to move. And while there're other concerns, and we want -- if there was a perfect bill that ever came out of here it would sure be neat for me to be here while it happens.  But I'm guessing it's not going to happen when I do.    </p><p>      So, I would appreciate best recommendations so that we can get moving on in terms of stopping something that's taken several years just to get to this point.  I am not picking on you.    </p><p>      And so with that, Mr. Chairman, I see the light is where it is. I yield back the most time that anybody's yielded back today.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  Very good.  The gentleman will be commended.    </p><p>      I'd like to thank our witnesses for the testimonies today.  And without objection, all members will have five legislative days to submit additional written questions for the witnesses or additional materials for the record.  We thank you all.  We appreciate your testimony on a very difficult subject.    </p><p>      This hearing is adjourned.    </p><p>      END   </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2011</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:549T-W5P1-JDPT-T1XP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

The Judiciary Committee will come to order. Without objection, the chair is authorized to declare recesses of the committee at any time. I'm going to recognize myself for an opening statement, then the ranking member, and then the chairman and the ranking member of the appropriate subcommittee.</p><p/><p>Today's hearing is on legislation that will help protect one of the most productive sectors of the American economy. While the Digital Millennium Copyright Act does provide some relief to copyright owners whose works are infringed, it only helps in limited circumstances. The DMCA provides no effective relief when a rogue Web site is foreign-based and foreign-operated, like the Pirate Bay, the 89th most-visited site in the U.S.</p><p/><p>It doesn't protect trademark owners and consumers from counterfeit and unsafe products like fake prescription medicines and misbranded drugs that are often presented to the public by unlicensed online pharmacies. Nor does the law assist copyright owners when rogue Web sites contribute to the theft of intellectual property on a massive scale.</p><p/><p>And finally, it does nothing to address the use of certain intermediaries, such as payment processors and Internet advertising services that are used by criminals to fund illegal activities. That's where the stop ...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>WATT: Mr. Chairman, I'm having trouble hearing your statement. Can you ...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>SMITH: I wouldn't want anyone to miss my statement, so I'll make sure that the sound system is working and that I'm close enough to the mic.</p><p/><p>WATT: Turn his mic way up.</p><p/><p>SMITH: OK. That's where the Stop Online Piracy Act comes in. This bill focuses not on technology, but on preventing those who engage in criminal behavior from reaching directly into the U.S. market to harm American consumers. We cannot continue a system that allows criminals to disregard our laws and import counterfeit and pirated goods across our physical borders.</p><p/><p>Nor can we fail to take effective and meaningful action when criminals misuse the Internet. The problem of rogue Web sites is real, immediate and widespread, it harms all sectors of the economy, and it's scope is staggering. One recent survey found that nearly one-quarter -- one-quarter of global Internet traffic infringes on copyrights.</p><p/><p>A second study found that 43 sits classified as digital piracy generated 53 billion visits per year. And that 26 sites selling just counterfeit prescription drugs generated 51 million hits annually. Since the United States produces the most intellectual property, our country has the most to lose if we fail to address the problem of these rogue Web sites.</p><p/><p>Responsible companies and public officials have taken note of the corrosive and damaging effects to rogue Web sites. One of our witnesses today represents Mastercard Worldwide, a company that takes seriously its obligation to reduce the amount of stolen intellectual property on the Internet. Mastercard deserves thanks for its commitment to support legislation that addresses the problems of online piracy.</p><p/><p>In contrast, another one of the companies represented here today has sought to obstruct the committee's consideration of bipartisan legislation. Perhaps this should come as no surprise, given that Google just settled a federal criminal investigation into the company's active promotion of rogue Web sites that pushed illegal prescription and counterfeit drugs on American consumers.</p><p/><p>In announcing a half-billion dollar forfeiture of illegal profits, the Peter Neronha, who led the investigation, stated, quote, \"Suffice it to say that this is not two or three rogue employees at the consumer service level doing this. This was a corporate decision to engage in this conduct,\" end quote. Over several years, Google ignored repeated warnings from the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy and the National Center on Addiction And Substance Abuse at Colombia University that the company was violating federal law.</p><p/><p>The company also disregarded requests to block advertisements from rogue pharmacies, screen such sites from searches, and provide warnings about buying drugs over the Internet. The Wall Street Journal reports Mr. Neronha characterized Google's efforts to appear to control unlawful advertisements as window dressing, since, quote, \"It allowed Google to continue earning revenues from the allegedly illicit ad sales, even as it professed to be taking action against them,\" end quote.</p><p/><p>Given Google's record, their objection to authorizing a court to order a search engine to not steer consumers to foreign rogue sites is easily understood. Unfortunately, the theft of America's intellectual property costs the United States economy more than $110 billion annually, and results in the loss of thousands of American jobs.</p><p/><p>Under current law, rogue sites that profit from selling pirated goods are often out of the reach of U.S. law enforcement agencies, and operate without consequences. The Stop Online Piracy Act helps stop the flow of revenue to rogue Web sites, and ensures the profits from American innovations go to American innovators. Protecting America's intellectual property will help our economy, create jobs, and discourage illegal Web sites.</p><p/><p>That concludes my opening statement, and the gentleman from Michigan, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, is recognized for his opening statement.</p><p/><p>CONYERS: Thank you, Chairman Smith, and good morning to my fellow colleagues on the committee. This is a very important hearing, and I want to commend you on your statement because you raised some issues that I think we will have to go into quite carefully.</p><p/><p>Now, there have been attempts to deal with the problem that's before us today. But H.R. 3261, Stop Online Piracy Act, represents a great deal of work and some experience from our attempts to deal with this subject before. I am very pleased that this is a bipartisan bill, and that I think that's very important.</p><p/><p>Now, there've been a number of attempts to stop online intellectual property theft and fraud. Some of the leading Internet service providers and right holders and the best practices standards that are being developed within the advertising network and payment processing companies, and particularly Mastercard, all come to my attention. I commend them.</p><p/><p>But this private cooperation is not sufficient. Our studies have shown that upwards of one-quarter of all Internet traffic is copyright-infringing. And to those who say that -- that a bill to stop online theft will break the Internet, I -- I'd like to point out that -- that it's not likely to happen. Users connect to the Internet through service providers like AT&amp;T and Verizon.</p><p/><p>But by most accounts -- and I have to bring up Google's name again in the beginning of this discussion -- Google's search engine connects users to Internet content more often than any other, and places the most advertisements. As users surf the Web, their computers connect with the main name servers to resolve the site name that they type into their browser and its location on the Web.</p><p/><p>Now, we're getting a number of reactions from this proposal. Some right holders have said that the market-based process outlined in section 103 of the bill doesn't go far enough and immunizes too many players who profit from piracy. But on the other hand, there's some in the technology section that have said this bill will break the Internet, and strangle startups and Silicon Valley giants alike.</p><p/><p>And so I reluctantly ask to put this into the record -- The Attack of the Internet Killers. Now, this is ...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>SMITH: Without objection, that'll be made a part ...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>CONYERS: \"This is very serious business. Don't walk, run. Tell Congress there's a better way. Threatens global Internet security, kills cloud computer, and an American jog-crushing monster. That's our bill H.R. 3261.\"</p><p/><p>SMITH: Isn't that a comic? CONYERS: No, this is serious. It's a -- it's a terrible thing. And that we -- we ought to know better. Now, on -- on a more serious note, we have, from our friends in the American Civil Liberties Union a -- a -- a caution that I have to take more seriously. Because they have some questions that they -- I -- I don't think -- I think needs to be examined here.</p><p/><p>And that is, the first is that there's an attorney general section of the bill that only the Justice Department, in its wisdom, can ask a court to filter or block Web content. What the American Civil Liberties Union is telling us is that we will, with this legislation, inadvertently involve non-fringing (sic) operators, and that this with a -- would violate their constitutional rights.</p><p/><p>Now, against that I'm going to ask to put in the eminent First Amendment scholar, Floyd Abrams', recommendation that says that the notion that this bill threatens freedom of expression is insupportable. It protects creative free speech, as Congress has done, and the Judiciary Committee especially has been particularly sensitive to protecting.</p><p/><p>And so I ask unanimous consent to put in the statement of attorney Floyd Abrams, and I yield back the balance of my time. Thank you.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Without objection. Thank you, Mr. Conyers.</p><p/><p>The gentleman from Virginia, Mr. Goodlatte, the chairman of the Intellectual Properties Subcommittee, is recognized.</p><p/><p>GOODLATTE: Mr. Chairman, thank you for holding this hearing and thank you for your leadership on this issue.</p><p/><p>For more than two centuries, America's economic strength has been built on a firm foundation. The rule of law, respect for individuals and private property, and the promotion of industry through policies that reward creativity and innovation are essential virtues that helped a fledging nation encourage the initiative of its citizens and, in time, emerges the most advanced and prosperous on Earth.</p><p/><p>These virtues are not universal. In an increasingly connected world, threats that emanate from areas where these principles are not shared are jeopardizing our ability to sustain the incentives needed to foster growth and development, and advance human progress. These threats create challenges for us in both the physical world and the virtual world, where the systematic and willful violation of intellectual property rights now poses a clear, present and growing danger to American creators and innovators, U.S. consumers, and our collective confidence in the Internet ecosystem.</p><p/><p>In order to continue to incentivize artists, authors and inventors we need to ensure that these creators have the ability to earn a return on their investments. Increasingly, foreign piracy is stripping creators of that ability. Within the Internet ecosystem today, there are legitimate commercial sites that offer consumers authorized goods and services. Indeed, many exciting new technologies and Web sites help content owners distribute music, movies, books, games, software and other copyrighted works in ways that were not even imaginable 10 years ago.</p><p/><p>However, there are also rogue sites that steal the intellectual property of others and traffic in counterfeit and pirated goods. In recent years, these Web sites have grown and evolved. They have become increasingly sophisticated, and rival legitimate sites in appearance, operation, and indicia (ph) of reliability. U.S. consumers are frequently led to these sites by search engines that list them among the top search results.</p><p/><p>After clicking on a site, they are immediately reassured by the logos of U.S. payment processors and the presence of major corporate advertising supporting the site. These sites sell infringing copyrighted works, but they are not limited to those. Increasingly, these sites also offer counterfeit goods, such as counterfeit automobile parts, medicines, baby formula, and other products that can pose serious threats to the health and safety of American citizens.</p><p/><p>What's worse, these rogue sites often list the real customer service contact information for the legitimate companies, which deteriorates the reputation of the legitimate maker of these goods. For all these reasons, I have joined Chairman Smith in introducing the Stop Online Piracy Act, which creates new tools for law enforcement to combat these growing threats.</p><p/><p>Specifically, this legislation gives law enforcement the authority to bring an action in a federal court to declare a Web site in violation of the law, and allow the court to issue a court order to intermediaries to block transactions and access to those sites found to be infringing. The bill also provides content owners with a limited liability to request the court to declare a Web site as violating the law.</p><p/><p>However, the content owners must first attempt to work directly with financial services and advertising intermediaries to solve the problem. Only if those parties cannot reach agreement are content owners allowed to seek a court declaration against an infringing Web site. It is my hope that this provision will allow content owners and intermediaries to work together to root out infringing sites quickly.</p><p/><p>It should be noted that there has been criticism from many in the online community about the scope of this bill, its effect on the functioning of the Internet, and that it could entangle legitimate Web sites. It's my -- it is not my intention to do so, and I stand ready to work with the tech community to address any legitimate concerns they have.</p><p/><p>I have requested detailed comments from the tech community about their concerns, and look forward to continuing to work with them and Chairman Smith and other members of the Judiciary Committee to ensure that this legislation punishes lawbreakers while protecting content owners as well as legitimate online innovators and startups.</p><p/><p>Mr. Chairman, this is a good bill. But a number of issues raised about it need to be carefully addressed. I look forward to working with you on those issues as we move forward to protect content owners online, and I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Thank you, Mr. Goodlatte.</p><p/><p>The gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. Watt, the ranking member of the Intellectual Properties Subcommittee, is recognized.</p><p/><p>WATT: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, in my experience there's usually only one thing at stake when we have long lines outside a hearing, as we do today. And when giant companies like those opposing this bill, and their supporters, start throwing around rhetoric like this is -- this bill will kill the Internet, or it's an attempt to build the great firewall of America -- and that one thing is usually money.</p><p/><p>While I appreciate that the stakeholders of Internet companies that have market caps in the billions of dollars care, as we all do, about the First Amendment and other precious rights, it seems clear to me that the obstinate opposition we have seen in the days since introduction of the Stop Online Piracy Act is really about the bottom line. Piracy and counterfeiting make money, and lots of it.</p><p/><p>This is not speculative. Sites that specialize in stolen goods attract a lot of eyeballs which, in turn, attracts a lot of advertising, which in turn means, well, you got it -- lots of money. To be fair, many of the copyright and trademark owners who want this bill to help enforce their rights are also businesses and are also motivated by money. But in my mind, stopping theft of your work or products is an appropriate incentive to secure profits.</p><p/><p>But doing nothing, or next to nothing, to prevent theft through the use of tools a company creates or controls is not an appropriate incentive to secure profits. So as policymakers, our goal must be to confront the criminal enterprises that are flourishing on the Internet, stealing from the rights holders, and visiting untold harms on consumers. Doing nothing is not an option.</p><p/><p>Not only are online piracy and counterfeiting drains on our economy, they expose unwary consumers to fraud, identity theft, confusion and, at worst, physical harm. The penetration of hazardous products and good into the American marketplace, including our military supply chain, poses an unacceptable risk of serious bodily injury or death to our citizens.</p><p/><p>Tolerance of online theft of music, movies and software reinforces a culture of entitlement, stifles creativity, injures artists, and undermines jobs, stability and growth. While I have never been a big advocate of current seizure laws, why would we not -- as this bill does -- give the attorney general, at a minimum, the same power to block foreign thieves from access to the U.S. markets as the attorney general has for domestic markets.</p><p/><p>Given the limits of government resources, why should we not establish a framework to enable rights holders to engage specific intermediaries within the Internet ecosystem to meet the challenges of online piracy and counterfeiting. I think one of the big problems here is that, to date, the economic incentives for the big Internet companies to work against online piracy are just not there. To be sure, there are many intermediaries that are inadvertently involved with pirate sites, and have come to the table with construction suggestions for crafting a balanced bill that will work.</p><p/><p>I commend the ISPs, payment processors like Mastercard who share today, and Visa, GoDaddy, who is the largest registrar of domain names, and a number of software companies who have raised reasonable concerns and are willing to work together to address them. But again, when I hear overblown claims like this bill is a, quote, \"giveaway to greedy trial lawyers or a killer of innovation and entrepreneurs, that the co-sponsors of this bill are the Internet killers,\" I become suspicious of the message as well as the messengers.</p><p/><p>And as one who cares deeply about the constitutional guarantees of free speech and due process, it is beyond troubling to hear hyperbolic charges that this bill will open the floodgates to government censorship. That's simply not the world we live in. And to guess that by establishing a means to combat theft of Internet property online we will somehow devolve into a repressive regime belittles the circumstances under which true victims of tyrannical government actually live.</p><p/><p>I urge everyone to set aside all the hyperbole and accusations. I'm the first to admit that I don't like or love everything about this bill. But its very strong -- it's a very strong, solid effort to begin the process of responsibly providing the attorney general and rights holders with necessary tools to keep pace with, and ultimately to outpace, the high-tech bandits roving the Internet.</p><p/><p>I believe there are still some things we can do in the legislation to avoid unintended consequences, maintain the integrity of the Internet, and preserve certain freedoms, including many of the specific suggestions made by the ranking member. Our staffs have worked closely together to identify ways to improve this bill, and we will continue to do so.</p><p/><p>And I appreciate the fact that crafting a bill governing online -- the online environment requires attention to technological details. But I start from the premise that Internet freedom does not and cannot mean Internet lawlessness. And that the goals of freedom and lawfulness are no more incompatible in the Internet space than they are in the physical world.</p><p/><p>Mr. Chairman, there's an African proverb that says when elephants fight it's the grass that suffers. Perhaps if we refocus this debate on the ills that may befall innocent consumers who fall prey to the perils of piracy and counterfeited goods, rather than on the balance sheets of all the big companies, we can reach a worthy compromise. I look forward to hearing from the witnesses, and engaging in ongoing dialogue as we move the bill forward. The stakes for America and American consumers are too high to get engaged in too much hyperbole.</p><p/><p>Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Thank you, Mr. Watt. Without objection, other members' opening statements will be made a part of the record. We welcome our distinguished panelists today, and I will now introduce them.</p><p/><p>Our first witness is Maria Pallante, the register of copyrights. Ms. Pallante was appointed by the librarian of Congress, Dr. James Billington, as the 12th register on June 1 of this year. Immediately prior to that appointment, Ms. Pallante served as the acting register. As register, Ms. Pallante continues the tradition of serving as the principle advisor to Congress on matters of copyright policy.</p><p/><p>Ms. Pallante has spent much of her career in the office where she previously served as the associate register for policy and international affairs, deputy general counsel, and policy advisor. In addition, Ms. Pallante spent nearly a decade as intellectual property counsel and director of licensing for the Guggenheim Museums in New York. She earned her law degree from George Washington University, and her bachelor's degree from Misericordia University, where she was also awarded an honorary degree of humane letters.</p><p/><p>Our second witness is John P. Clark, the vice president of global security and chief security officer for Pfizer. Since joining Pfizer in 2008, Mr. Clark has been recognized as a leading authority on the threat that counterfeit medicines pose to patient health and safety. Prior to joining Pfizer, Mr. Clark served as deputy assistant secretary of U.S. Immigration and Custom Enforcement. In that capacity, he was responsible for overall management and coordination of the agency's operation, and he served as the assistant security's principle representative to the Department of Homeland Security and to the law enforcement and intelligence communities.</p><p/><p>Starting as a U.S. Border Patrol agent in 1980, Mr. Clark spent more than 25 years as a law enforcement professional before retiring from public service. A New York native, Mr. Clark received his bachelor of science degree in history from the State University of New York at Binghamton, and a master of science degree from National Louis University.</p><p/><p>Before joining DOJ ...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>(UNKNOWN): (OFF-MIC).</p><p/><p>SMITH: Excuse me. Our third witness is Michael O'Leary, the senior executive vice president for global policy and external affairs at the Motion Picture Association of America. In that position, Mr. O'Leary supervises all international, federal and state affairs operations around the world for the association. Before moving to MPAA, Mr. O'Leary served more than a dozen years at the Department of Justice, where he worked on legislative intellectual property and enforcement issues.</p><p/><p>During his tenure at the DOJ, he served as the deputy chief of the computer crime and intellectual property section, where he prosecuted and supervised some of the most significant domestic and international criminal and IP cases undertaken by the department. Before joining DOJ, Mr. O'Leary spent five years serving as counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee. He grew up in Montana, is a graduate of Arizona State University and the University of Arizona school of law.</p><p/><p>Our fourth witness is Ms. Linda Kirkpatrick, who serves as the group head of customer performance integrity at Mastercard worldwide. In this role, Ms. Kirkpatrick is responsible for driving the strategy, development and execution of global customer compliance programs, data integrity, and dispute resolution and management. Ms. Kirkpatrick has been with Mastercard since 1997. She earned her bachelor of arts degree in economics, with a concentration in finance, from Manhattanville College in Purchase, New York.</p><p/><p>Our fifth witness is Katherine Oyama, a policy counsel for Google, where she focuses on copyright and trademark law and policy. In 2009 to early 2011, she worked in the office of the vice president as associate counsel and deputy counsel to Vice President Joseph R. Biden. Prior to her government service, Ms. Oyama was a litigation associate with Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr, where she worked on intellectual property cases, government regulatory litigation, and pro bono matters.</p><p/><p>She previously worked in the media entertainment practice of a New York-based strategy consulting firm, for the Silicon Valley-based Internet startup LoudCloud, Inc., and for the Texas-based company Electronic Data Systems. Ms. Oyama is a graduate of Smith College, where she graduated with honors in government, and the University of Cal at Berkeley school of law, where she served as senior articles editor of the Berkeley Technology Law Journal.</p><p/><p>Our final witness is Paul Almeida, the president of the Department of Professional Employees of the AFL-CIO. Mr. Almeida has served as president of the DPE since February 2001. Prior to his tenure with DPE, Mr. Almeida served as president of the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers for seven years. Mr. Almeida earned his degree in engineering from Franklin Institute in Boston, and he resides in Arlington, Massachusetts.</p><p/><p>We welcome you all. Every member of the panel will have five minutes to give their testimony. And we have a light on the table to indicate when that time is about to expire and has expired. Again, we welcome you.</p><p/><p>And Ms. Pallante, we'll begin with you.</p><p/><p>PALLANTE: Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to appear today. And I would also like to thank you, Ranking Member Conyers, Chairman Goodlatte, Ranking Member Watt of the subcommittee, and all of the members of the committee for your continued leadership on copyright policy.</p><p/><p>Congress has updated the Copyright Act many times in the past 200 years, including the enforcement provisions. But as we all know, this work is never finished. Infringers today are sophisticated and they are bold. They blatantly stream and disseminate books, music, films and software through Web sites using the services of trusted search engines, advertising networks, and credit card companies.</p><p/><p>This is not a problem that we can accept. In my view, it is about the rule of law on the Internet. Much of the bill employs a strategy of follow the money. I testified in support of this approach in March, and I still agree that it is an important part of the equation. Many sites make money by selling illegal access to copyrighted works or by offering related advertising.</p><p/><p>But the approach does have some limitations. Many of the worst sites do not sell infringing content. They offer it for free. And they do not run ads. I would like to offer an example involving Google, but I would first like to say that I have a great deal of respect for Google and I cannot imagine the Internet without it. However, if you conduct a search for the phrase \"download movies,\" Google search engine will supply the words for free.</p><p/><p>And it will return a list of sites that offer illegal copies or streams at no charge and with no advertising. These cases require a different kind of strategy than follow the money. The same is true when damage is imminent, for example when a site is streaming live sporting events or selling movies before they have been released to the public.</p><p/><p>In the context of foreign infringing sites, the bill addresses this problem by giving the Department of Justice the power to require search engines to dismantle direct hyperlinks and to require service providers to block the access of subscribers within the United States. These actions require court approval, and incorporate the existing legal standards of seizure and civil forfeiture law. These are the same standards that ICE has used effectively for Operation In Our Sights.</p><p/><p>Mr. Chairman, I do not want to suggest that blocking Web sites is a small step. It is not. And the public interest groups that oppose this part of the bill are right to be concerned about unintended consequences. However, it may ultimately come down to a question of philosophy for Congress. If the attorney general is chasing 21st century infringers, what kinds of tools does Congress want to provide, how broad, and how flexible?</p><p/><p>The bill also gives copyright owners some tools, but these do not involve search engines or ISPs, and I think that this is the right calibration. Put another way, the bill reflects the fact that many industries contribute to the success of the Internet, and it properly distinguishes between the actions that law enforcement and private citizens can bring.</p><p/><p>One of the more interesting aspects of the bill is that before authors or other copyright owners can seek court orders it requires them to alert payment processors and ad networks about infringing content, and requests that they sever financial ties. This approach creative, and it provides incentives for the parties to cooperate. It also allows for counter-notification.</p><p/><p>However, whether the notification system is ultimately effective will largely depend upon whether it can be implemented in a manner that is clear and fair for all involved. The intermediaries at issue are running businesses in good faith, and the Web sites at issue are entitled to due process. The bill does incorporate due process where court orders are involved. The notification system would operate outside the purview of a court, and therefore it may benefit from further due process review.</p><p/><p>Finally, I do not believe it is the intent of the bill to negate the safe harbors of the DMCA, and I do read it that way. Nothing subjects ISPs to liability for their acts or their failures to act. No monetary relief can be obtained. And the injunctive relief permitted by the bill appears to be consistent with what the DMCA already permits.</p><p/><p>This said, the bill has many moving parts. And I note that a number of stakeholders with differing perspectives have offered productive suggestions. As the committee works to refine the bill, I would encourage you to fully consider these suggestions. However, in closing, I would also like to state that I believe that Congress has a responsibility to protect the exclusive rights of copyright owners. And I hope that you will advance the bill with this in mind.</p><p/><p>Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Thank you, Ms. Pallante.</p><p/><p>Mr. Clark?</p><p/><p>CLARK: Chairman Smith, Ranking Member Conyers, distinguished members of the committee ...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>WATT: Can you pull the mic a little bit closer, please, or cut it on?</p><p/><p>CLARK: It's a pleasure to appear before you today to discuss the threat that counterfeits (sic) medicines pose to the health and safety of patients in the United States and around the world. It's a global issue.</p><p/><p>As vice president of global security for Pfizer, I work to mitigate the threat that counterfeit medicines pose to the health and safety of patients who rely on Pfizer medicines to live healthier and longer lives. I commend the chairman, the ranking member, and the committee for co-sponsoring the Stop Online Piracy Act for their legislative effort. It's a positive step forward in our fight against counterfeit medicines.</p><p/><p>Counterfeit medicines pose a threat because of the conditions under which they are manufactured, in unlicensed, unregulated sites, frequently under unsanitary conditions. In many instances, they contain none of the active pharmaceutical ingredients found in authentic medicine or in incorrect dosages, depriving patients of the therapeutic benefits of the incorrect -- of the medicine prescribed by their physicians.</p><p/><p>In others, they may contain toxic ingredients, such as heavy metals, arsenic, pesticides, rat poison, brick dust, floor wax, leaded highway paint, and even sheet rock or wallboard. Counterfeit medicines are a global problem, and I'm pleased to share our experience in combating them and how the Stop Online Piracy Act aims to strengthen the U.S. arsenal.</p><p/><p>Pfizer has implemented an aggressive anti-counterfeiting that attacks counterfeits at their source. Since 2004, we've prevented more than 138 million dosages of counterfeit Pfizer medicines alone, more than 68 million finished dosages, and enough active pharmaceutical ingredient to manufacture another 70 million from reaching global patients.</p><p/><p>Additional raids by law enforcement, based on evidence we have provided, have also resulted in seizures of millions of dosages of counterfeits marketed by other major pharmaceutical companies. In the United States, we work closely with ICE, the FBI and FDA on their investigations, and with customs and border protection to improve their ability to prevent counterfeit Pfizer medicines from reaching U.S. patients.</p><p/><p>While the true scope of the counterfeit problems is hard to estimate, we have confirmed that counterfeit Pfizer medicines have been found and seized in at least 101 countries, and have reached the supply chains in 53 countries. Technology has created a new front in this battle. Today, the major threat to patients in the U.S. are the many professional-looking Web sites that promise safe, FDA-approved, branded medicines from Canada or the U.K.</p><p/><p>And for that reason, we appreciate the chairman and ranking member's focus on the threat in Title 1 of the bill, giving the attorney general new tools and incentivizing private stakeholders to act against rogue Web sites. With immunity in place for every stakeholder's action, it would be an important step forward. Patients don't realize that many of the Web sites don't disclose the true source of the products they dispense, or even where their -- the alleged dispensing online pharmacy is located.</p><p/><p>In such instances, the World Health Organization has estimated that patients have more than a 50 percent chance of receiving a counterfeit medicine. I happen to believe that -- that's a very low estimate. I'd like to share two short case studies. The first is RX North (ph). Patients who visited RX North's Web site thought they were ordering from a Canadian pharmacy, and would receive authentic FDA-approved medicines.</p><p/><p>In reality, the medicines dispensed from RX North (ph) were traced from China, where they were manufactured, through Hong Kong, on to Dubai, into the U.K., where they were intercepted. Among the medicines seized by U.K. customs were Lipitor, found to contain only 82 percent to 86 percent of the active pharmaceutical ingredient, which is an incredibly high number for most counterfeits -- as well as counterfeit versions of medicines from four other companies, including one found to contain trace -- traces of metal.</p><p/><p>Second is the case of Kevin Xu, convicted of misbranding drugs and trafficking in counterfeit goods. It demonstrates how attractive a target the U.S. supply chain is for those who counterfeit our medicines, and how weak our current penalties for counterfeiting medicine are. During meetings with our undercover consultant, Xu boasted of the global scope of his criminal enterprise.</p><p/><p>He offered a list of branded counterfeit medicines that he could provide, including five Pfizer medicines. The evidence we gathered was shared with an ICE investigation of Xu. An order placed by an ICE undercover agent was filled with only -- with a counterfeit. When the tablets were tested, they were found to contain an insignificant levels of the active pharmaceutical ingredient found in the authentic medicine.</p><p/><p>Xu was sentenced to just 78 months in federal prison without parole, the maximum sentence under the applicable U.S. sentencing guideline range. This punishment does not reflect the seriousness of the crime. The Stop Online Piracy Act takes a positive step toward making these penalties even tougher.</p><p/><p>Pharmaceutical counterfeiting is a low-risk, high-profit criminal activity that has attracted drug traffickers, firearms smugglers and terrorists. One of the principle players in the 2003 Lipitor breach here in the U.S. was a convicted cocaine trafficker. In 2006, the U.S. attorney for the eastern district of Michigan announced the indictment of 19 people who gave a portion of their profits from the sale of counterfeit Viagra to Hezbollah.</p><p/><p>Those who counterfeit medicines are confident that even if caught they'll get just a slap on the wrist. Even here in the U.S., the maximum sentence imposed under the Food and Drug Cosmetics Act is just three years. Recognizing the inherent risks that any counterfeit medicine poses to patients, we must enhance the penalties for pharmaceutical counterfeiting to provide a greater deterrent.</p><p/><p>Expedited procedures must be in place to shut down rogue Web sites dispensing counterfeit medicines to the U.S. The Stop Online Piracy Act is a significant step forward in those efforts, and I thank the chairman and ranking member for introducing this important piece of legislation. I'd like to work with you so that our laws recognize the grave health and safety risks posed by counterfeit medicines, and serve as a deterrent.</p><p/><p>I work with foreign government representatives in the global fight against counterfeiting. It's hypocritical for us to speak with foreign government representatives, as I often do, about their lack of effective legislation when U.S. law is still lacking. This bill, if enacted with strong penalties and mechanisms to shut down rogue Web sites, will be highly effective in our global argument for all governments to fully appreciate the serious health and safety aspects of this problem, and encourage similar efforts around the world.</p><p/><p>Thank you again for this opportunity to express my views. For Pfizer, pharmaceutical counterfeiting is first and foremost an issue of patient health and safety. We look forward to working with you on the global fight against counterfeit medicines. Thank you.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Thank you, Mr. Clark.</p><p/><p>Mr. O'Leary? O'LEARY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Conyers, Chairman Goodlatte, and Ranking Member Watt, distinguished members of the committee. I'm honored to be here, and thank you for holding this important hearing. I also want to thank you for introducing this legislation, which will help protect American creativity and American jobs from thieves who hide overseas and seek to profit off the hard work of people in this country.</p><p/><p>I also want to acknowledge my fellow panelists. I'm pleased to be here with all of them today, and look forward to working with them throughout this process. I want to particularly acknowledge the contributions of Ms. Kirkpatrick and Mastercard. As the chairman alluded to earlier, they are truly a fine example of a corporation trying to make the Internet a safe marketplace for people all over the world. And frankly, their example is one to be followed.</p><p/><p>Critics would have you, as Mr. Watt alluded to, believe that this is a battle between two giant corporations. And there's certainly a lot of truth to that. But I'm also very proud to be part of a wide- ranging coalition that includes the AFL-CIO, who we'll hear from shortly. Members of the Chamber of Commerce, big business, small business, individual creators, and entrepreneurs. So I think critics would have you believe that this bill is really about supporting Hollywood and -- and things like that.</p><p/><p>But the truth of the matter, when you look behind the rhetoric and the hyperbole, is that it goes -- intellectual property is something which affects every facet of the American economy. And it affects people all over the country. In cases of the industry that I represent, the American Motion Picture and Television industry, we believe that these jobs are worth protecting. They're more fully detailed in my written testimony, but I would just mention a few.</p><p/><p>There are people like Dan Lemieux, who's a stunt coordinator from Michigan. He's worked on numerous films, television shows like Nip Tuck, The Shield. The industry includes over 95,000 small businesses. They employ 10 people or less. Businesses like Fletcher Camera, which is in Chicago. They have 25 employees in that small business, and they provide movie equipment for productions that occur all over the -- all over the Midwest.</p><p/><p>There are hundreds of thousands of businesses that provide services to productions. There's a small paint and decorating firm in Baltimore, Maryland. It's a fifth-generation, family-run operation and it has supplied paint for virtually every major production which has occurred in the mid-Atlantic region over the past few years.</p><p/><p>I want to be very clear with this committee that hard work, innovation and creativity are not solely the province of people who live in northern California. There are people all over this country who contribute to the economy every day, who contribute to our culture, who contribute to what we make creatively. And their jobs are just as important and just as worth protecting as anyone else's.</p><p/><p>And that's why we think this bill is so important. Because it's a positive step in that direction. In this economic climate, we simply cannot afford to turn our back on any industry which is coming forward and producing things that are -- that we can take all over the world and be successful with. Our industry competes.</p><p/><p>When we are given an opportunity to compete globally, we succeed. Where we have trouble, frankly, Mr. Chairman, is where we don't have an opportunity to compete fairly. And one of the problems we have is competing with people who are trying to steal our stuff. We're not before the Congress looking for a handout or a bailout. We're simply asking for an opportunity to stop from stealing the products that we make.</p><p/><p>In recent weeks, you've heard a lot of spurious arguments about this legislation. They've been chronicled in a number of the opening remarks. That it violates the First Amendment, that it undermines existing (inaudible) and protection law, that it somehow stifles innovation, and it will, yes, break the Internet. I irony, of course, of that argument is that I believe it was first heard -- it was first raised by those opposing the DMCA many years ago, as the chairman will recall.</p><p/><p>and I believe some of those same people are here today opposing this bill because they think it will undermine the DMCA. So there's a bit of irony there which seems to be lost inside the Beltway. But I suspect that outside the Beltway, people see it for what it is. These -- these allegations that you're hearing are simply taken from the playbook of those people who have consistently opposed every effort that the Congress has come forward with in the last few years to protect intellectual property.</p><p/><p>The good news is, is that every time Congress protects intellectual property the Internet flourishes. Every time the United States stands up for legitimacy over illegitimacy the Internet gets bigger and stronger. More things are available to consumers, more products are available to consumers, we make more movies, they see more television.</p><p/><p>Protecting legitimacy is a positive thing for the economy and for innovation, and people that tell you otherwise are wrong. They've been wrong when they've been raising these -- these arguments for the past two decades, and they're wrong in the context of this bill. What you understand so clearly, Mr. Chairman, is that the Stop Online Piracy -- and the Stop Online Piracy Act reflects this -- is that there is a very great difference between legitimate marketplace and the illicit sites and services that we are talking about.</p><p/><p>The legitimate market is protected against the threat -- when the legitimate market is protected against the threat of online theft, the only people who lose are those that do not work, take no risk, make no investment. And said, those are the people that simply try to profit off the hard work of others.</p><p/><p>We've also heard arguments that Congress should limit its approach to the threat of rogue sites to, quote, \"following the money.\" It's worth noting that whoever usually makes that argument is really saying you should follow someone else's money. If we are, in fact, going to follow the money -- which is something we should do -- we should follow all of the money, not just some of it.</p><p/><p>Piracy is a complex problem that can't be fixed in piecemeal solutions, but this bill is an important first step in trying to deal with what is a very real and growing threat. This is fundamentally about jobs and about protecting the jobs that Americans have creating products that are enjoyed all over the world.</p><p/><p>Ultimately, someone once said that to lead is to choose. And the bill, Mr. Chairman, that you put before the Congress in this debate is one which provides a number of choices. It's a choice between illegal and legitimate. It's a choice between a safe, vibrant Internet for everyone in a black market Internet. It's a -- it's a choice between protecting American creativity and jobs, or protecting thieves.</p><p/><p>These are simple choices, from our perspective, and with the leadership that's been provided by this committee we look forward to this process of debating this bill and putting something on the president's desk that both Republicans and Democrats can support. And, at the end of the day, will allow these hardworking Americans to keep their job and keep creating the products that the world enjoys. Thank you.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Thank you, Mr. O'Leary.</p><p/><p>Ms. Kirkpatrick?</p><p/><p>KIRKPATRICK: Thank you. Good morning, Chairman Smith, Ranking Member Conyers, and members of the committee. My name is Linda Kirkpatrick and I am group head, franchise development, customer performance integrity at Mastercard wide -- worldwide, in Purchase, New York.</p><p/><p>Mastercard commends the committee on its attention to the issue of Internet-based infringement, including the work that went into H.R. 3261, the Stop Online Piracy Act. We greatly appreciate the opportunity to be here today, and look forward to working with you to combat this critical issue.</p><p/><p>Mastercard's rules and requirements prohibit the use of its system for any illegal purposes, including for the sale of products or services that infringe on intellectual property rights. Mastercard recognizes the important role it plays in combating this issue, and has taken a number of steps that demonstrate its commitment to this important cause.</p><p/><p>These efforts which are discussed in my written testimony, including publishing the Mastercard antipiracy policy, which sets out the specific process by which Mastercard and rights holders can work together to identify and prevent the sale of infringing products or services, working with the White House's Office of U.S. Intellectual Property Enforcement coordinator in the development of industry best practices to address online infringement, and the implementation and maintenance of Mastercard's business risk assessment and mitigation program, otherwise known as our brand program.</p><p/><p>By way of background, Mastercard operates a global payment system that connects over 1 billion cardholders and millions of merchants worldwide to complete Mastercard-branded payment transactions. Mastercard neither issues payment cards to cardholders, nor does it contract with merchants to accept payment cards. Rather, Mastercard's financial institution customers issue payment cards to cardholders and/or contract with merchants to accept the cards.</p><p/><p>The card-issuing customers are known as \"issuer.\" Those customers that contract with merchants for card acceptance are commonly called \"acquirers.\" Each cardholder's account relationship is with the issuer that issued the card to the cardholder, and each merchant's acceptance relationship is with its acquirer.</p><p/><p>Mastercard has a long history of working with law enforcement, private stakeholders, its customers and others to address illegal or otherwise brand-damaging activities that may involve the Mastercard payment system or the unauthorized use of our widely-recognized family of payment brands. Our commitment to working with rights holders to prevent the Mastercard system from being used to facilitate online infringement is evidenced by our industry-leading antipiracy policy, which is publicly available on our Internet site.</p><p/><p>In accordance with that policy, Mastercard has established procedures that apply when a law enforcement entity or rights holder brings to Mastercard's attention evidence of alleged infringement. We have a established an e-mail address for the submission of such requests and a set of information requirements for such requests which are largely similar to the information required of rights holders in H.R. 3261.</p><p/><p>The process we have implemented was developed collaboratively through strong working relationships with rights holders and their trade associations, and has led to the investigation of thousands of Internet sites and the termination of hundreds of rogue merchants. Mastercard has also worked closely with the White House's Office of the U.S. Intellectual Property Enforcement coordinator in the development of a best practices document to address online infringement.</p><p/><p>Development of the best practices document involved input from a wide variety of stakeholders, including numerous representatives from the rights holder community, payment networks, and other parties involved in online commerce. The best practices are designed to assist rights holders in protecting their intellectual property through a voluntary system, and in no way diminished the ability of rights holders to take independent action to enforce their intellectual property rights.</p><p/><p>Our business risk assessment and mitigation program, or brand program, is another key component of Mastercard's corporate efforts to preserve the integrity of Mastercard payment system and protect against illegal and brand-damaging transactions. More specifically, the brand program serves to restrict access to the Mastercard system by merchants whose products and services may pose significant fraud, regulatory, or legal risks.</p><p/><p>The brand program was created to enforce Mastercard rules prohibiting acquirers from engaging in, or supporting, any merchant activity that is illegal or that may damage the goodwill of Mastercard or reflect negatively on the Mastercard brand. Merchant activities that infringe upon the intellectual property rights of another are expressly covered on the -- under the protocols of the brand program.</p><p/><p>Mastercard is fully committed to continuing to address this important issue. As the committee moves forward with legislation, Mastercard believes it is essential to ensure that any obligations imposed on payment systems are capable of being readily implemented through reasonable policies and procedures, and that payment systems be shielded from litigation and liability when acting in accordance with the bill's requirements.</p><p/><p>In my written testimony, we have offered a few general comments on the bill along those lines that we believe are consistent with the committee's objectives, I look forward to answering any questions that you may have. Thank you..</p><p/><p>SMITH: Thank you, Ms. Kirkpatrick.</p><p/><p>And Ms. Oyama?</p><p/><p>OYAMA: Thank you. Chairman Smith, Ranking Member Conyers, members of the committee, thank you so much for the opportunity to testify today, not just on behalf of Google, but also on behalf of the Consumer Electronics Association, CCIA, Net Coalition, TechNet, TechAmerica, which together represent thousands of companies.</p><p/><p>Google takes the problem of online piracy and counterfeiting very seriously. We devote our best engineering talent, and tens of millions of dollars every year, to fight it. In the last year alone, we have spent more than $60 million to weed out bad actors from our ad services. We have shut down nearly 150,000 AdWords accounts, mostly based on our own detection efforts. And so far this year, we've processed 5 million DMCA take-down requests, targeting nearly 5 million items.</p><p/><p>We are as motivated as anyone to get this right, but the Stop Online Piracy Act is not the right approach. SOPA would undermine the legal, commercial and cultural architecture that has propelled the extraordinary growth of Internet commerce over the past decade, a sector that has grown to $2 trillion in annual U.S. GDP, including $300 billion from online advertising.</p><p/><p>Virtually every major Internet company, from Twitter to Facebook, Yahoo! and eBay, as well as a diverse array of other groups, from venture capitalists to librarians to musicians have expressed serious concerns about this bill. Unfortunately, this legislation is overbroad. It undermines the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which has for more than a decade struck a balance.</p><p/><p>The DMCA provides copyright owners with immediate recourse when they discover infringement online, while also giving service providers the certainty that they need to invest in the products on which millions of Americans rely. The bill sweeps in innocent Web sites that have violated no law. It imposes harsh and arbitrary sanctions without due process.</p><p/><p>The following example shows how the bill, as currently written, would work. Imagine a Web site, let's call it Dave's Online Emporium, which enables small businesses to sell clothing and accessories. More than 99 percent of the sellers on Dave's Emporium are entirely legitimate. But, unbeknownst to Dave, one seller has started selling counterfeit bags and T-shirts that -- that parody a copyrighted design.</p><p/><p>Dave's Emporium takes great care to comply with copyright laws, including take-down procedures, including repeat infringement provisions of the DMCA. But under the Stop Online Piracy Act the entire site could be deemed, quote, \"dedicated to theft\" based on the violations of this single seller, and the whole business effectively shut down. Just about any private party, a corporation, a copyright troll, someone with an axe to grind could send a notice to payment and advertising companies to terminate services to the site without first involving law enforcement or triggering any judicial process.</p><p/><p>The complaining party has no duty to contact Dave's Emporium directly to resolve the issue before going straight to ads and payment services to terminate his service. If the Emporium fails to respond with a counter-notice within five days Dave's site could effectively be put out of business.</p><p/><p>Facing these potential risks, Dave might think twice about establishing his Online Emporium in the first place. Countless Web sites of all kinds -- commercial, social, personal -- could be shuttered or put out of business based on allegations that may or may not be valid. And the resulting cloud of legal uncertainty would threaten new investment, entrepreneurship and innovation.</p><p/><p>In a new study of venture capitalists released today, more than 80 percent said that the Safe Harbor provisions of digital copyright laws are essential. Weakening those Safe Harbor provisions would have a recession-like impact on new investment. And at the same time, this proposed law imposes new and unclear obligations on Internet service providers to take, quote, \"technically feasible and reasonable measures to block access to sites to remove them from search results,\" turning these providers into de facto Web censors.</p><p/><p>This won't work. As long as there's money to be made pushing pirated and counterfeit products, tech-savvy criminals around the world will find ways to sell these products online. And ordering ISPs and search engines to disappear Web sites from the Internet will not change this fundamental reality. We urge you instead to target the problem at the source. Shut down illegal foreign sites by cutting off their revenue.</p><p/><p>We support legislation that builds on the DMCA. Our proposal would empower the Justice Department to target foreign sites that violate current law. And a court could then order advertisers and payment services, in which our services would be included, to cut off ads and payments to those sites. Google has been working with the committee on such a solution for over six months, and we will continue to do so. When all is said and done, we must address online piracy effectively in ways that continue to allow the Internet to drive this economy and this country forward. Thank you.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Thank you, Ms. Oyama.</p><p/><p>Mr. Almeida?</p><p/><p>ALMEIDA: Good morning, Chairman Smith, Ranking Member Conyers, and distinguished members of the committee. My name is Paul Almeida. I'm the president of the Department for Professional Employees, a coalition of 22 national unions affiliated with the AFL-CIO. I am honored to speak today on behalf of the 4 million professional and technical people whom are affiliated unions represent.</p><p/><p>Those people include creators, performers and craftspeople in arts, entertainment and media, professional and technical people in education, health care and public administration, in aerospace and other manufacturing, in pharmaceuticals, science, engineering, information technology and in professional sports.</p><p/><p>The people I represent work in a wide range of occupations and industries. They share a wide range of interests as workers and consumers, as well as ardent defenders of the First Amendment. On their behalf, permit me to commend you and thank you. Their unions unanimously support the Stop Online Piracy Act, as does the entire AFL-CIO.</p><p/><p>My message is simple. It has three parts. First, strengthening protections for U.S. intellectual property helps American workers, jobs, incomes and benefits. Second, counterfeit goods endanger workers, both as workers and consumers. Third, there is no inconsistency between protecting free speech and an open Internet and safeguarding intellectual property.</p><p/><p>If the United States allows the tax on intellectual property to go unanswered it puts good livelihoods at risk. Online access continues to accelerate and expand. It increasingly displaces tradition models for distributing content, and thus heightens the potential for digital theft. Estimates of the number of jobs lost to digital theft in arts, entertainment, and the media sector alone run in the hundreds of thousands.</p><p/><p>Losses of income arise because entertainment professionals depend on compensation at two points. First, when the professionals do the work, and later when the reuse of the intellectual property. Royalties and residuals from downstream revenues enable entertainment professionals to survive between projects. In manufacturing, the estimates of losses from counterfeits also run in the billions. Again, the victims include workers who face lost jobs and income.</p><p/><p>We should not allow rogue Web sites to facilitate the distribution of counterfeit goods. My second point, counterfeits endanger workers as workers and as consumers. Only last week, the Senate Committee on Armed Services heard about an astonishing extent of counterfeit electronic parts in the military supply chain. Counterfeits kill.</p><p/><p>When protective vests are fake, soldiers and police officers can die. When prescription drugs are fake patients can die. And when smoke detectors are fake homeowners and firefighters can die. In may, the Atlanta, Georgia fire and rescue department recalled roughly 18,500 smoke detectors that it distributed for a free Atlanta smoke alarm program. The smoke detectors were counterfeit, and so were the Underwriter Laboratory seals.</p><p/><p>An alert from the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission noted the unreliable counterfeit alarms pose a life-safety hazard to the occupants in the event of a fire. Counterfeit smoke detectors pose a life-safety hazard not just to homeowners, but to firefighters. Harold Schaitberger, general president of the International Association of Firefighters, another union affiliated with DPE, wrote to Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Conyers to support the Stop Online Piracy Act.</p><p/><p>President Schaitberger noted that \"the preparedness and safety of our members depends on reliable equipment.\" A blog called Techdirt.com posted a defamatory response. \"Who does the MPAA actually think it's fooling. Is Congress so stupid that it can't figure out for itself that firefighters have no clue what the debate is about?\" The blog accused firefighters of supporting censorship. It implied the only reason the firefighters spoke up was because the MPAA was paying off the union. Firefighters know the consequences of counterfeit equipment.</p><p/><p>My third point, freedom of speech is not the same as lawlessness on the Internet. Protecting intellectual property is not the same as censorship. The First Amendment does not protect stealing goods off trucks. I mentioned earlier that the people whom I represent today include ardent defenders of the First Amendment. Newspaper and broadcast journalists, radio broadcasters, newswriters, scriptwriters, and many others in the arts and entertainment and media, when they oppose wage theft there is no inconsistency with the First Amendment.</p><p/><p>Digital theft and rogue Web sites diminishes incentives to invest, and leads to a downward spiral for U.S. workers in our economy. That's the bad news. The good news is that you are taking action. The professional and technical workers and their unions, whom I represent, look forward to your passing the Stop Online Piracy Act. Thank you.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Thank you, Mr. Almeida.</p><p/><p>I'll recognize myself for questions. And Ms. Pallante, let me direct a couple questions to you. In your prepared written statement, you said, quote, \"If Congress does nothing to provide serious responses to online piracy, the U.S. copyright system will ultimately fail,\" end quote. Now what did you mean by that?</p><p/><p>PALLANTE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yes, I don't think that's an overstatement. The system that we have for copyright, and have had since 1790, is based on a system of exclusive rights which authors can license and which publishers and producers can invest. And then distribute and otherwise bring to life for consumers not only here, but through reciprocal agreements with foreign countries.</p><p/><p>If those exclusive rights cannot be meaningfully enforced and can be usurped in a lawless environment, they will become meaningless. And if Congress does not update the piracy laws, as it has done consistently for many, many years, many decades, hundreds of years ...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>SMITH: I -- I think you just anticipated my next question, which was going to be do you think the legal system has all the tools it needs now to combat the infringing Web sites?</p><p/><p>PALLANTE: I don't. I think that this is a timely hearing. I think Congress has done and excellent job of intervening when technology outpaces the law. It did that in the NET Act, it did that in the ART Act, and I think that this is similar legislation. We're looking at a situation where very sophisticated and very smart and very blatant infringers will leap to offshore locations so that they can direct infringing goods, which often belong to our companies, back to American consumers.</p><p/><p>They're outside the jurisdiction of our courts. We're not suggesting that we would intervene in domestic courts in foreign countries. What we are saying is that we should have some response to allowing them to do that with impunity.</p><p/><p>SMITH: OK. Thank you, Ms. Pallante.</p><p/><p>Ms. Oyama, let me direct a couple questions to you. And first, let me say that you spoke a lot of the right words today. We've heard those words before. And I only hope that your company and other simpler -- other similar companies will practice what you preached. And that, we will wait to see.</p><p/><p>Let me ask you a couple questions. You do acknowledge that there is a severe problem, I gather, with the theft of intellectual property by foreign criminals.</p><p/><p>OYAMA: That's a problem that we take extremely seriously. We have hundreds of employees that work on it.</p><p/><p>SMITH: And I believe you agree that if we cut off access to American consumers and U.S. dollars that that will decrease the amount of intellectual property theft, as well.</p><p/><p>OYAMA: We think cutting off the money is a very effective solution. The sites are in business because they profit.</p><p/><p>SMITH: OK. Now, in -- particularly in regard to Google, do you think Google should stop returning search results for foreign sites that are breaking U.S. law?</p><p/><p>OYAMA: Under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, a rights holder could come directly to Google, would not need to go to court. And they could alert us of the foreign infringement.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Well, a ...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>OYAMA: And we would remove that.</p><p/><p>SMITH: A lot of people don't think the DMCA is sufficient, including the registrar of copyrights. Do you think we should go beyond that to try to stop returning the search results for foreign sites?</p><p/><p>OYAMA: Thank you for the question. I think there's a lot of misperception about what it and what isn't ...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>SMITH: No, no. I was asking a specific question here. Should Google stop returning search results for foreign sites that are breaking U.S. law?</p><p/><p>OYAMA: We do, when notified by rights holder. We've done that more than 5 million times.</p><p/><p>SMITH: So the -- the answer is yes, then.</p><p/><p>OYAMA: Yes</p><p/><p>SMITH: OK, thank you. Another question is this. Should Google stop placing ads on illegal sites that are stealing American intellectual property?</p><p/><p>OYAMA: Our policies prohibit that. We've proactively ejected more than 12,000 sites this year.</p><p/><p>SMITH: OK. And so you would agree not to either facilitate nor place ads on illegal sites that are stealing U.S. property.</p><p/><p>OYAMA: If a site is violating the law we would eject them for our system, and we do that.</p><p/><p>SMITH: OK. Again, I hope you can practice what you preach today. That would be a major -- a major breakthrough. It seems to me -- and let me just conclude in this way -- that Google and other companies really have a decision to make. And I hope they will make the right decision. I hope they will decide to help other American companies. It's not necessarily going to benefit Google or some of your allies, but I hope you will decide to help American companies protect their intellectual property from being infringed by foreign criminals.</p><p/><p>And that is, I know, a decision that you all are having to make and weigh. I acknowledge, and regret to a large extent, that if you make the right decision that is going to mean you're going to have to give up some of the revenue you might get from some of those ads that are actually on the infringing Web sites themselves. That's a decision for you all to make, but I think you can make the right one there. I simply hope that you, and others, will decide to do what's good for American -- for other American companies, do what's good for American jobs, and do what's good for American economy, as well. But thank you for your testimony.</p><p/><p>The gentleman from -- the gentleman from California, Mr. Berman, is recognized for 5 minutes.</p><p/><p>BERMAN: Well, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and Ranking Member Conyers. And I'd like to thank the chairman for responding to my letter inviting Google to testify. I think it's important to under -- understand what legitimate issues the opposition may have so they can be addressed.</p><p/><p>I haven't heard concrete changes they would recommend. I haven't received a Google proposal or suggested proposal on -- focusing on foreign rogue Web sites, and would love to see it's apparently been discussed with the committee.</p><p/><p>Opponents of the legislation say, \"We support the bill's stated goals, and ask that sponsors consider more targeted ways to combat foreign rogue Web sites. That's the response to every idea put forward to stop theft. Why isn't this the time for the tech community to put forward concrete and specific proposals that will efficiently combat the theft that takes place on the Internet.</p><p/><p>The rhetoric around this bill is over the top. None of the sponsors of this bill are against the First Amendment, none of the sponsors of this bill want to shut down the Internet, and none of the sponsors want to stymie technology. Perhaps the first example that I'll focus on is opponents claiming that the legislation will undermine U.S. foreign policy and encourage repression by foreign governments.</p><p/><p>I wrote Secretary Clinton and asked her opinion. She clearly, forcefully -- she clearly and forcefully said there is no contradiction between intellectual property rights protection and enforcement ensuring freedom of expression on the Internet. In other words, we can adopt legislation like H.R. 3261 to better protect U.S. intellectual property online, at the same time demand that foreign governments respect Internet freedom.</p><p/><p>And I'd like to submit those records -- those letters for the record.</p><p/><p>SMITH: No, so objection.</p><p/><p>BERMAN: I'm going to -- based on your answers to Mr. Smith's question, I'd like to -- to follow up. I thought I heard you say, in response to the chairman's question, that Google does not link to pirate Web sites.</p><p/><p>OYAMA: Under the DMCA procedures that Congress set out, a rights holder can notify Google about foreign infringement and we would remove it. BERMAN: All right. Well, explain to me this one. The Pirate Bay is a notorious pirate site, a fact that its founders proudly proclaim in the name of the site itself. In fact, the site's operators have been criminally convicted in European. One has apparently fled to Cambodia. It is being blocked by court order in at least Italy, Denmark, Belgium, Ireland and Finland.</p><p/><p>And yet Google continues to send U.S. customers, or at least I don't know what you're doing this morning, but -- but before this morning 'cause maybe you can read my mind -- U.S. Google continues to send U.S. consumers to the site by linking to the site in your search results. Why do you do this? Requiring copyright owners to send thousands upon thousands of notice -- of notices for individual torrent links to the Pirate Bay, only to have those same files reappear on the system when Google calls the Pirate Bay again?</p><p/><p>We all know that this is a notoriously egregious pirate site. Why does Google refuse to deindex the site in your search results?</p><p/><p>OYAMA: Copyright infringement, counterfeiting, these are issues that we take incredibly seriously. We invest tens of millions of dollars into the problem. We have hundreds of people around the world that work on it. When it comes to copyright ...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>BERMAN: Why does Google refuse to deindex the site in your search results?</p><p/><p>OYAMA: We will immediately -- if we're notified by a rights holder, we would remove the link from our search results to the Pirate Bay. We've done that over 5 million times this year. When it's a copyright ...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>BERMAN: You -- you -- you remove the link to a particular item.</p><p/><p>OYAMA: Exactly.</p><p/><p>BERMAN: Why don't you refuse to deindex the site in your search results?</p><p/><p>OYAMA: The procedures that Congress set out under the DMCA ensure that today, with ...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>BERMAN: Would it make sense to have a law that allowed you to -- if that's -- if the DMCA doesn't go far enough, a law that essentially told you that's what you should do in response to dealing with a clearly established rogue Web site that -- that flaunts it in every possible way?</p><p/><p>OYAMA: So we have no idea of knowing if a given search result is infringing or is authorized. We do need the cooperation of the rights holder to let us know. And today, we are removing links. We think, in terms of a legislative approach, something that goes after the real incentive for those sites to be in business makes sense.. So enhancing the DMCA and going after advertising which is our -- services and payment providers we think makes sense. We think the DMCA ...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>BERMAN: Could -- could you -- could you draft some proposals that reflect that position so we could look at them? I mean, I would love it if you and the Consumer Electronics Association and public knowledge in these groups would give us something specific. You think this is -- it goes too far, it's too excessive.</p><p/><p>Give us something specific. Infuse yourself with the notion of you want to stop digital theft. What works? And use your brilliant minds that you have in your organizations to give us some specifics because the DMCA is not going the job. That's so obvious.</p><p/><p>OYAMA: We are -- we are very interested in working with your staff, with the chairman and other members of the committee. I do believe through Net Coalition we have provided that language, and we'd be happy to -- to follow up. We do think -- in terms of searches that Congress got it right under the DMCA. It leaves up legitimate content, it takes down infringing content.</p><p/><p>We want to make sure that when we're dealing with speech that we use a scalpel.</p><p/><p>BERMAN: Well, I -- my time has expired. But you cannot look at what is going on since the passage of the DMCA and say Congress got it just right.</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>OYAMA: We agree ...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>BERMAN: ...maintain the status quo.</p><p/><p>OYAMA: We (inaudible) would be useful.</p><p/><p>SMITH: The gentleman's time has expired. Thank you, Mr. Berman.</p><p/><p>The gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. Coble, is recognized.</p><p/><p>COBLE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good to have you all with us. I've had to miss some of the hearing, Mr. Chairman, because of other meetings, but it's good to be here. I was going to examine Ms. Pallante, but the chairman beat me to it. I was going to examine Ms. Oyama, but Mr. Berman beat me to it. But I'll -- I'll still try to recover.</p><p/><p>Ms. Obama, let me ask you this -- Ms. Oyama. What relief does the DMCA offer to a trademark owner who is trying to prevent counterfeiters from selling things?</p><p/><p>OYAMA: So for counterfeit it's dealt with a little bit differently. For counterfeit, at Google, we will act -- do our -- for our advertising we've adjusted. So, for example, for AdWords we've ejected over 100,000 accounts in the last year. There is a very kind of stark difference between copyright and trademark.</p><p/><p>Congress, so far, has not enacted a DMCA for trademark. Copyright laws are exclusive, right? Trademarks, it depends on what geography you're in, right? What product you can use. Given name- specific can be used on lots of different products, and so I know there's been kind of a long-standing conversation about -- about that issue.</p><p/><p>Certainly, if we ever were to receive a court order about counterfeit related to search, well of course we would comply with that court order.</p><p/><p>COBLE: I thank you.</p><p/><p>Mr. Clark -- Mr. Clark, how involved are organized criminal networks in the -- the manufacturer and distribution of counterfeit medicines?</p><p/><p>CLARK: From my estimation and experience, it's -- it's a problem that's growing. I don't think we've reached the level yet where we -- we are seeing global cartels, per se, as we do in narcotics. But as the notoriety of the crime gets around, the profit margins are so phenomenal and the penalties on a global scale are so low, that it's a no-brainer for -- for organized crime to -- to look at this as a -- a -- a way to go.</p><p/><p>So it is growing. We've seen instances of it. Not systemic instances, but we have seen, as I just cited, the Detroit instance where money was going to Hezbollah. We have seen drug traffickers. But I think it's -- it's growing in that capacity.</p><p/><p>COBLE: Mr. Clark, what aspects of SOPA do you believe are particularly important to combating the problem of counterfeiting medicines?</p><p/><p>CLARK: I apologize, Congressman. I -- I missed the first part of that.</p><p/><p>COBLE: What aspects of SOPA, the bill before us, do you believe are particularly important to combating the problem of counterfeiting medicines?</p><p/><p>CLARK: I think all aspects. My biggest worry, Congressman, is that counterfeit medicines are still not perceived by the public, by law enforcement, by the judiciary -- our judges and prosecutors -- as a serious crime yet. When you see somebody like Kevin Xu, who has a -- a global reputation for supplying counterfeits, it was my understanding during his undercover discussions he offered a list of counterfeit medicines. And yet, he said if anything is on that list -- anything else off that list that you want, I can have it for you. Give me two weeks.</p><p/><p>We're talking cancer medicines, we're talking blood pressure medicines, we're talking Alzheimer's medicines. And I think when we see a few tablets here or there we have a tendency not to think of the consequences those tablets bring. A lot of people in the United States, I think, look at it and say there's no bodies in the street, nobody seems to be dying from counterfeit so it -- it can't be that serious of a crime.</p><p/><p>COBLE: I got you.</p><p/><p>CLARK: But when you look at people, if, at best -- if they're getting 20 percent of the active pharmaceutical ingredient in the medicines that they're taking, such as this Alzheimer's medicine that was manufactured in Turkey, manufactured in facilities such as this, where there are no conditions that -- in terms of licensing, regulatory, environmental are applied, even with just 20 percent of the -- the active ingredient, what's the other 80 percent?</p><p/><p>And if there's nothing but benign chemicals in that 80 percent, they're still not going to get relieve (sic) of their disease, and they eventually die. So my biggest worry, Congressman, is that people are dying from these counterfeits. We just haven't figured out a way to correlate the deaths from counterfeits with -- with the problem yet.</p><p/><p>COBLE: I -- thank you. I want to beat -- I want to beat that red light that will illuminate imminently, and say to Ms. Kirkpatrick I am advised that Mastercard has been instrumental in -- in combating piracy. And, Mr. Chairman, I think it should be noted for those who have combated particularly flagrant piracy that should be noted.</p><p/><p>And I thank you all for being with us, and I yield back, Mr. Chairman.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Thank you, Mr. Coble.</p><p/><p>The gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. Watt's recognized.</p><p/><p>WATT: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And let me start by thanking all of the witnesses for being here today. This is a difficult issue. This legislation raises some interesting new challenges, but circumstances are raising difficult new challenges. Ms. Oyama, let me -- let me start with you because I want to be sure I understood your testimony.</p><p/><p>I got the impression that you do not object strenuously to the provisions of section 102 because they require a court order. That your primary objections are with respect to the provisions in 103, where -- private market-based system to protect customers are involved because they don't get -- it doesn't require giving notice to the site owner, or whoever's put up the site. Am I misstating where you are on that?</p><p/><p>OYAMA: We would certainly agree the concerns about 103 are the greatest. One, because of the scope of what ... (CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>WATT: Well, let me -- let me -- let me separate the question. Do you have concerns with section 102?</p><p/><p>OYAMA: We would be -- the legislation we support ...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>WATT: The question is, do you have concerns with section ...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>OYAMA: With some of the remedies, yes. The ...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>WATT: Some of the remedies. OK, and you'll -- and you'll give us that in writing so that we can evaluate those concerns.</p><p/><p>OYAMA: Yes. The ...'</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>WATT: But your primary concerns are with section 103. Is that -- am I misstating it?</p><p/><p>OYAMA: I think if we got -- if we got the remedies right in 102, focused on ads and payments, the way that these sites are making money.</p><p/><p>WATT: I didn't -- I'm -- I'm not trying to get you to resolve that issue about 102 today. I -- I'm -- I'm -- I'd rather have that in writing.</p><p/><p>OYAMA: Much more workable, yes.</p><p/><p>WATT: Right. But your concerns about 103 have to do with the lack of notice to the -- to the site owner, right?</p><p/><p>OYAMA: Yeah, in part. I think the ...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>WATT: OK. So do -- is there some effective way that we could give notice to the site owner that you are aware of? And if you could give me those suggestions in writing. Because I have those concerns, too. The problem is, we don't -- we don't currently have any effective way -- access to those -- to that information to give them notice, and you do I think in your system because you put up the -- you put up the site. OK.</p><p/><p>Now, if you can help me with those two things we'll be far down the road. I'm not adverse to -- to addressing your concerns. I've indicated to that -- you -- to you, both in private and -- and I'm saying it publicly today. Let me talk about this constitutional standard that -- and make sure that I understand where you are on that. Because you appear to be advocating a constitutional standard that would prohibit the enforcement of any laws online.</p><p/><p>In your written testimony, you disagree with Professor Abrams' conclusion that it is constitutional to block access to a Web site that is primarily infringing, even though such blocking may incidentally impact protected speech. Your written testimony won't concede that blocking a Web site that is almost entirely infringing would be -- would be constitutional.</p><p/><p>And you've confirmed that in what you've just said verbally here. Does that mean that you consider it unconstitutional for law enforcement to seize a child pornography site if the site also contains one copy of the King James Bible?</p><p/><p>OYAMA: So the speech concerns that have been raised ...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>WATT: I -- just answer that question for me, and then I'll -- I'll go forward from there.</p><p/><p>OYAMA: There are certainly legitimate ...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>WATT: What -- what about if it contains 20 copies of the King James Bible, but it's still 90 percent child pornography? Are you saying First Amendment rights won't allow us to do that?</p><p/><p>OYAMA: I think we agree with Floyd Abrams that you need to look at the whole site. You need to make sure that it's really dedicated to infringement.</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>WATT: OK. Well, and -- and ...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>OYAMA: ...legitimate speech ...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>WATT: And probable cause would -- would require the attorney general's office to do that. I mean, he's not going to go and -- and cite you unless -- or stop this process unless he's gone through that analysis. The question is, do you think that there's something unconstitutional about taking down a site that is overwhelmingly, primarily devoted to -- to -- to stolen products?</p><p/><p>And -- and I -- you know, if -- if that's -- if that's your position I think we're going to have a real problem with it.</p><p/><p>OYAMA: No, I think if -- if there was a site out there that was 100 percent terrible that's a separate issue. The definition ... (CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>WATT: No, I'm saying 90 percent terrible. I'm saying 98 percent terrible. Is it -- is 2 percent going to save this site from being taken down?</p><p/><p>OYAMA: I don't think there's an exact number. I think when you are sweeping in vast majorities of legitimate speech without notice, that raises significant questions.</p><p/><p>WATT: Is that 51 percent, or is it 60 percent, or -- I mean, how -- how are we going to do this? You're telling me I can't violate somebody's constitutional rights if it incidentally adversely impacts their -- their protected rights. That's what you're saying.</p><p/><p>OYAMA: No, I think if a site was primarily dedicated to infringement there's a lot of tools that ...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>WATT: OK, well, that's what the bill says, isn't it?</p><p/><p>OYAMA: Well, we would not agree that the scope of the definition captures totally infringing sites. We have a lot of concerns that it sweeps in legitimate ...'</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>WATT: No, I didn't say totally infringing. That --That's not what you said, either. That's not what you said. You said primarily infringing. And -- and then all of a sudden you shifted over to totally infringing. Is this a question about whether something is totally infringing or primarily infringing, or do you -- you think that both of them -- that one should be protected and one should not be protected?</p><p/><p>OYAMA: I think a definition that was narrowly drawn, that has something like primarily, would be helpful.</p><p/><p>WATT: OK. So you're going to give us some language on that? My time is up.</p><p/><p>OYAMA: We have a definitional ...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>SMITH: The gentleman's time has expired. Thank you, Mr. Watt.</p><p/><p>The gentleman from Virginia, Mr. Goodlatte, is recognized.</p><p/><p>GOODLATTE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Oyama, I want to pursue that line of questioning.</p><p/><p>Years ago, a former chairman, Henry Hyde, put me in a room with about 30 government representatives from the content industry, from the online industry, Internet service providers, and a few that had a foot in both camps. And we worked for months in a -- in a hot room, and came to agreement on the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and, in particular, the notice and takedown provisions which you have spoken highly of.</p><p/><p>And I -- I agree with you that those provisions still have a - a role in protecting online copyright. But the Internet has changed dramatically since then. The speeds have accelerated. The technology is more sophisticated, search engines are more sophisticated, and the criminals who use all of that to rip off legitimate businesses of all kind are more sophisticated.</p><p/><p>So as you know, and as I've said, I'm interested in making sure that this legislation gives effective tools to combat lawbreakers. But to also ensure it does not entangle legitimate online businesses or the ability of entrepreneurs to continue to bring exciting new products and services to the Internet. Can you tell the committee the top concerns the tech community has about the bill, and your specific recommendations on how to fix those concerns within the bill?</p><p/><p>OYAMA: Sure, thank you. I think when the conversation started the idea was to target foreign rogue sites, sites that were clearly breaking the law. And to introduce -- build on the DMCA, introduce new, harsh remedies. That is definitely approach that we could get behind, that we would support.</p><p/><p>I think when the tech community now is looking at this language, there's serious concerns that the definition of a site that's dedicated to the theft of U.S. property, you know, probably purely unintentionally, it sweeps in a great amount of lawful Web sites. So, for example, the unit of analysis for what -- what -- what the site is, there's some language in there that says an Internet site or a portion thereof.</p><p/><p>So there's some concern about whether we're looking at the whole site, are we just looking at one blog, one Tweet, one comment, one page on a site. So -- so getting the definition right would be really important. There's other words within the definition that seem to introduce notions like facilitate. That's one of reasons why the Consumer Electronics Association, who I mentioned, they have serious concerns.</p><p/><p>Because they manufacture so many different devices. somebody could say that the Internet itself facilitates infringement. So we need to make sure that we're really -- we're really staying within the existing confines of copyright law. I would also mention in the definition there's some language -- you can be dedicated to theft if you have -- no one understands, sir, what this means -- if you have taken deliberate actions to avoid confirming a high probability of the use of your site for infringement.</p><p/><p>Right now, small business owners, when they're starting a Web site, they know if they comply with the DMCA, they are lawful companies, they can see investment, they can go forward. If they have to somehow subscribe to that kind of definition, the folks that we're hearing from, they just have no idea how they would even possibly build their site to fit that definition. So I think getting -- getting the scope of what is a site dedicated to infringement would be critical. And from there, we're certainly more than happy to work on remedies. The two that we think are really smart -- if you look at Wikileaks, I think this is a good example of -- of the fact that this is a strong remedy. Is choking these sites off at the revenue source.</p><p/><p>They are in business because they can either sell advertising or because they can profit from subscribers. If you could get the entire industry together and you could choke off advertising, and you could choke off payments to those sites, you would be incredibly effective to introducing the collateral damage that we had discussed to free speech or to Internet architecture, things like that.</p><p/><p>So ensuring that we had the right remedies and the right scope, I think there's plenty of opportunity for all -- all players for a cross-section of industry to come together.</p><p/><p>GOODLATTE: Let me -- let me just follow up on that. The more detailed information you give us, the better our ability to address legitimate concerns. So will you commit to working with me to identify the specific problems that the tech community has with the bill, and working to address those specific problems to improve the bill as we move forward?</p><p/><p>OYAMA: Absolutely.</p><p/><p>GOODLATTE: And some have argued that this legislation would break the Internet. As the co-chair of the Congressional Internet Caucus, that's the last thing I want to do. Can you explain exactly how this legislation would impact the functioning of the Internet?</p><p/><p>OYAMA: So I think -- I think the major concerns that have been raised, really, kind of in the cyber security field -- so there's a white paper by a group of engineers who designed DNSSEC. There's some other leading cyber security folks who have spoken out about it. I think -- I think Stewart Baker has been on record. He's a former senior official at DHS and the former general counsel of the NSA.</p><p/><p>One of the provisions in the bill would require ISPs to perform DNS blocking. There's kind of a two-fold concern there. One is that -- that the -- the methods proposed here are not compatible with a more than 10-year long effort in the cyber security field to implement DNSSEC in a way that would prevent cyber security attacks.</p><p/><p>So I am not the cyber security expert. The -- but the folks that -- that wrote that code are saying that this will really harm the U.S. and the global effort to make DNS more secure. I think the second piece is, we know that users, unfortunately, are seeking this material. We can predict that there are going to be circumvention efforts.</p><p/><p>And so there's a big concern that if we place certain obligations on U.S. DNS providers that users are going to reroute their traffic to offshore rogue providers. And the vulnerabilities that an offshore rogue provider could introduce into the network, not -- not just for the kid that's looking for the movie or for some bad actor, but for anyone who's network that they're on, is really significant. It could introduce spyware, malware, privacy concerns.</p><p/><p>I know this is, you know, something that, really, the folks who are the experts in this field have raised. But, you know, that's been kind of a critical concern about ...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>GOODLATTE: (Inaudible), I hate to interrupt. I -- I do believe that Mr. Clark, if the chairman will permit -- Mr. Clark, from his past experience with the Department of Justice, might also be able to comment on this issue ...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>GOODLATTE: Mr. Clark, could you give a very brief response?</p><p/><p>CLARK: Very briefly. I -- I -- unfortunately, I don't have the cyber experience. It wasn't one of the areas I -- I actually worked myself. We -- I've managed it. I don't know the intricacies about it, though, in all honesty. So I apologize for not having an answer for that.</p><p/><p>GOODLATTE: I apologize, Mr. Chairman. I thought -- thought there was an opportunity there, but perhaps not. Ms. Oyama, thank you. We look forward to working with you.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Thank you, Mr. Goodlatte.</p><p/><p>The gentlewoman from California, Ms. Lofgren, is recognized.</p><p/><p>LOFGREN: Before my questions, I would like to ask unanimous consent to introduce a number of items into the record -- opposition to the provisions of the bill.</p><p/><p>The letters are from to Consumer Union and other consumer groups -- TechNet, TechAmerica, the American Library Association, the Competitive Enterprise Institute, Human Rights Watch, other public interest groups, dozens of human rights groups around the world, a written statement from the ACLU, a paper from the Brookings Institute (sic) explaining how the bill would undermine security and stability of the Internet, a white paper by five leading DNS engineers and Internet security experts, a letter from the Anti-Phishing Working Group, an article from Stewart Baker, the former general counsel of the NSA and policy chief DHS under the Bush administration entitled Copyright Bills Could Kill Hopes for Secure 'Net, a letter signed by AOL, eBay, Facebook, Twitter, Yahoo!, LinkedIn, Google, Mozilla and Ziinga, and a Harvard Business Review article entitled Great Firewall of America.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Without objection.</p><p/><p>LOFGREN: You know, I think some today have sort of written off, I think, serious criticisms of this bill's hyperbole. And that the only objection is about money and hyperbole. And I just don't think that's the case. The big tech companies weren't the ones who said this bill would cause the U.S. to lose its position as a global leader in supporting a free and open Internet. That's from dozens of human rights groups around the world. The big tech companies want the ones who wrote that the bill has the potential to do consumers more harm than good. That's from the Consumers Union and other nonprofit consumer groups. The big tech companies didn't write the bill is in conflict with the First Amendment. That's from the ACLU and over 100 law professors.</p><p/><p>It wasn't the big tech companies who said the bill kill our best hope for securing the Internet. No, that's from Stewart Baker, the former assistant secretary for DHS and the former general counsel of the national security agency. Dozens of venture capitalists, not big tech companies, wrote that the bill will stifle investment in Internet services, throttle innovation and hurt American competitiveness, and it hasn't generally been the policy of this committee to dismiss the views of those in industries that we're going to regulate. And these are just a few of the examples.</p><p/><p>Now, I understand why cosponsors of the legislation are not happy about widespread criticism of the bill. But I think impugning the motives of the critics rather than engaging in the substance is a mistake. I have a number of questions, and I know that, you know, we've got six witnesses here; five are in favor and only one is against. And that troubles me. I'll just say that. You know, I don't think it's a balanced effort, and I'm sorry that we don't have any technical expertise on this panel in terms of engineering talent, because I think that is an important issue as to the DNS blocking portions of the bill.</p><p/><p>So let me ask a question of Mr. O'Leary: Do you believe that software program should be illegal if they allow a user to circumvent Internet filtering ordered by the government?</p><p/><p>O'LEARY: I don't believe that software program should be per se illegal. I think if people misuse them, then they should be -- if they misuse any product in violation of the law, they should...</p><p/><p>LOFGREN: So the ability to just simply circumvent the takedown order as a software add-on to a browser should continue to be illegal...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>O'LEARY: Well, no. If you're saying you're building something in specifically to avoid an order of the court not to do something, I do have a problem with that.</p><p/><p>LOFGREN: So you think that software ought to be illegal?</p><p/><p>O'LEARY: Well, that's not what I said, no.</p><p/><p>LOFGREN: Well, it's one or the other. Either you should be able to do that or you should be able to do it. Which is it?</p><p/><p>O'LEARY: Does the software have a legitimate purpose, or is it simply to circumvent the court order?</p><p/><p>LOFGREN: Well, circumventing software can be a multiplicity of use. We -- for example...</p><p/><p>O'LEARY: Right. But in your question, you said the software would -- would be created to allow circumventing.</p><p/><p>LOFGREN: There is a -- there is an add-on to Firefox that will allow a...</p><p/><p>O'LEARY: I think that most legitimate companies in the United States, including Firefox, should abide by court orders and follow the law.</p><p/><p>LOFGREN: So -- well, you're not really answering the question. I will take from you, you will you think that that ought to be regulated at least.</p><p/><p>O'LEARY: Regulated in much the same way that we regulate people driving drunk and stealing things, yes. I think that -- I know that the word regulation has...</p><p/><p>LOFGREN: Let me -- let me ask you this, because I don't have a long time, and I assume that you are directing your comments at people that Northern California people didn't care about jobs and the rest of America, either to myself or Mr. Lungren, since we're the only members of the committee from Northern California. I will say I do care about jobs all over America. And in fact eBay, which is headquartered in San Jose, has enabled thousands of Americans all over the country to form small businesses and to use the Internet to sell products.</p><p/><p>A guy to know your concept of -- you think that this is a big problem, and I think it's a problem. I think it's that Internet piracy is something that is troubling, it's illegal, and I think we need to do something about it. So let me just put that out there. How many sites do you think need to be shut down in order to say we've succeeded in the fight against Internet privacy? Is that it doesn't, is it hundreds, that thousands? Do you have any idea of the scope of the number of sites that need to be...</p><p/><p>O'LEARY: Well, first of all, you mischaracterized my comment about Northern -- Northern California, and I'd like to correct the record on that. I was in place...</p><p/><p>LOFGREN: Well, do it later, because I don't have that much time. Answer my question.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Actually, the gentlewoman's time has expired, but you're free to answer the question.</p><p/><p>O'LEARY: Thank you. The comment about Northern California was, in the context of this debate, the perception has been created by opponents of this bill that all of the innovation in all of the creative thinking comes out of -- out of Silicon Valley. I was not taking umbrage with anyone in Silicon Valley. We have great relationships with a lot of people in Silicon Valley. Pixar, which makes wonderful movies, is in Silicon Valley. Apple, which is a legitimate online retailer, is in Silicon Valley.</p><p/><p>LOFGREN: But -- but...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>O'LEARY: I was also making the simple point, Congresswoman, that there are people all over this country in places like Detroit, Baltimore, Texas, North Carolina...</p><p/><p>LOFGREN: Mr. Chairman, I wonder, since...</p><p/><p>O'LEARY: I'm happy to answer your question...</p><p/><p>LOFGREN: May I have an additional 30 seconds?</p><p/><p>SMITH: Will the gentleman answer the question very briefly?</p><p/><p>LOFGREN: How many sites?</p><p/><p>O'LEARY: Well, I know for a fact that we can start with Pirate Bay, which was mentioned earlier. I do not know how many...</p><p/><p>LOFGREN: So is it just Pirate Bay, do you think, or is it a dozen, is it 1,000? What you think?</p><p/><p>O'LEARY: It would be easier to answer the question if I was allowed to. There are multiple sites out there. This is a legitimate problem. We have been very clear, and we will continue to be clear that there is no silver bullet. The problem is evolving and changing. I cannot sit here right now and tell you in good faith that I know what that number is. But what I do know is that there are literally hundreds of sites out there that are engaging in this activity...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>LOFGREN: Do you think it's in the neighborhood of...</p><p/><p>SMITH: The Gentlewoman's time is...</p><p/><p>O'LEARY: ...know that is to go to Google and type in J. Edgar, and you will get a list of...</p><p/><p>LOFGREN: Or Baidu or Bing or any of them...</p><p/><p>O'LEARY: ...sites that are engaging in this illegal activity...</p><p/><p>LOFGREN: So it's hundreds of thousands?</p><p/><p>SMITH: The gentlewoman's time is expired. But let me remind members that their welcome to submit written questions to any of the panelists, and will try to get those answers to the members as quickly as we can.</p><p/><p>The gentleman from California, Mr. Issa, is recognized.</p><p/><p>ISSA: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and suggests a lady from the North, while I am deep in the Confederacy of California, went through quite a litany of good opponents of the bill. I'd like to add to that a unanimous consent that following: A joint letter by 160 entrepreneurs, founders and CEOs and executives, a letter expressing concern about SOPA from the Digital media Association, statement by the Consumer Electronics Association, Electronics Association, which was denied an opportunity to be here as a witness, letter signed by 53 venture capitalists expressing concern regarding the protect act, and a transcript of recent remarks made by VP Joe Biden that he gave in -- at the London Cyber Security Conference germane to hear his concerns about this bill.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Without objection.</p><p/><p>ISSA: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p/><p>I've been the victim of piracy. So you're not going to have a problem with me agreeing with the problem. Hardware, software, got it all. But Mr. Clark, I'm going to hope that you can stretch for this part of it, even though it's not in your title. You're familiar with ITC, aren't you?</p><p/><p>CLARK: Yes, I am.</p><p/><p>ISSA: Pfizer regularly for patent infringement on imported products will go to the IDC and get relatively quick justice using administrative law judges available to them and injunctive relief against a patent violator, correct?</p><p/><p>CLARK: Outside of my field, but I would believe that is the case.</p><p/><p>ISSA: So when we deal with rogue elements outside the jurisdiction of the United States that a recording in the United States, we have a history of an organization that is quick, administration and can have continued jurisdiction against non-U.S. entities who are, in fact, trying to take what they have stolen then sell it into America. Is that correct, correct to your understanding?</p><p/><p>CLARK: Generally speaking, yes.</p><p/><p>ISSA: OK. Have any of the other of you -- just raise your hands -- were to the ITC in your background or familiar with them? One another. Well, let me just run through quickly because time will be very limited and questions seem to be - the answer seemed to be long. We have a court of jurisdiction. Now, they do not specifically have the mandate to follow the money and provide injunctive relief against Google, eBay or anybody else after they find it offshore and French are and seek remedies. But they have their own consults, they have administrative law judges. They have a procedure.</p><p/><p>Mr. Chairman, I object to this bill in its current form, mostly because I believe it fails to use tools that are generally better than the tools that we have at our disposal in this bill, and I believe that if the real remedies sold is, in fact, a quart of continued jurisdiction, specializing in intellectual property and designed to, in fact, reach a quick solution to a question of whether there is wrongdoing and then follow the money through injunction, not to fines, and, obviously, criminal referral. My intention is to offer legislation on a bipartisan basis that will, in fact, look at the legitimate concerns, take a great deal of these 80 pages.</p><p/><p>However, and this is where it's tough, Mr. Chairman and ranking member, suggests that it jurisdiction not within this committee get a substantial portion of this bill, because I believe that that is as appropriate as it is for the federal courts to consider domestic entities who are violating it.</p><p/><p>And so with that, Miss Oyama? Am I pronouncing it right?</p><p/><p>OYAMA: Yes.</p><p/><p>ISSA: Has-- in your experience, has Google worked with the ITC or any other administrative law judges in executing on other people's judgments?</p><p/><p>OYAMA: I would imagine in the patent context, yes. It's not my field, so I can't speak to it.</p><p/><p>ISSA: OK. I too agree that having a quarter continued jurisdiction that, in fact, can work for injunctive relief as technologies available is generally something that Google and the other search engines would see as reasonable once there is a judgment entered against an offender somewhere?</p><p/><p>OYAMA: Yes, I think would be happy to work on that type of solution.</p><p/><p>ISSA: And I'm going to get to the others. But Mr. Clark, if you had that and you had a judgment against party A, who had an Internet site, and then 25 other similar party show up from the same country didn't have all the identities that tell you it's basically the same group you already have a judgment against, wouldn't you benefit from having a court that we specifically gave jurisdiction to to determine quickly that those are alter ego's and execute upon them so that you would go through this wack-a-mole (ph) again and again trying to prove to somebody that it's basically the same people doing it again?</p><p/><p>CLARK: My working relationship with the ITC has been very, very limited. I'm not quite certain what their capabilities are. If you say you're going to empower them to do certain work like that, it would make some sense.</p><p/><p>ISSA: Currently, they are the -- and the others will probably know this -- that's a place that plaintiffs go to if there's any importation and they have a patent because they can administer a decision faster than the fastest rocket -- fastest rocket docket, and unlike eBay decision, they have injunctive relief not only as a tool but as the one and only tool, and he used it without his question because, in fact, that is the mandate of Congress.</p><p/><p>CLARK: But you were still talking about referral process. I think the DOJ that for criminal follow-up and for asset... ISSA: Right. And I recognize at some point the administrative law judges look and say we have a domestic entity that is not complying with our injunctions or a site that is just as rogue in the U.S. So I'm very aware that there are elements here that, if you are cooperating or facilitating with a foreign entity, that there would have to be a referral. That's not going to be Yahoo or Google or eBay. It's going to be, as you know, the rogue sites you fight every day.</p><p/><p>CLARK: Right. And I would just be worried about the bifurcation of activity and in the referral process in the elongation of the end result is something like that were arranged.</p><p/><p>ISSA: So I look forward to showing both are witnesses in the committee that, in fact, the ITC's time to judgment and their execution is actually much shorter than our federal courts and less discretionary than the Justice Department generally.</p><p/><p>I think the gentleman -- the chairman for his indulgence and yield back.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Thank you, Mr. Issa.</p><p/><p>The gentlewoman from Texas, Ms. Jackson Lee, is recognized.</p><p/><p>JACKSON LEE: Let me thank the gentleman -- chairman very much in the ranking member. And let me call the world and -- for the record and say I want the U.S. Library of Congress, I want Pfizer, the Motion Picture Association of America, MasterCard, Google and are good friends at the technical aspect of our moviemaking business and all supporters to be made whole. I think we have a consensus that online piracy is a both devastating and destructive element of the nation's economy. In fact I have said I think I believe often that it steals the genius of this country.</p><p/><p>We are very proud of the motion picture industry, and I am, if you will, cup runeth over. I may be your physical armor when I see the massive thievery that goes on, and certainly in some of our international friends.</p><p/><p>So I start off with that, and I want to find a common ground. And as I have looked at the legislation, I hope the chairman and ranking member will give us the time to really study the legislation. Several things come to mind. One, this legislation has no referral. I'm a member of the Homeland Security Committee, and our committee spent years helping to build the switch to the DNS SEC, and if this bill would pass, we would have a challenge with that format. And the question is, would everyone who needs to make changes to the DNS SEC would instead be on the phone to the lawyers asking whether they will be sued for adopting security technology that will make the mandated login redirect system even more difficult.</p><p/><p>We have to look at all of these issues. So I want to ask the Library of Congress first if he has any comments regarding that conflict that we're supposed to be collaborative. You're the only government witness. I'm not sure if you've thought of that, but let me give you a second question quickly, since our time is going quickly. I am concerned about how this bill will -- what effect it will have on small businesses, particularly those that couldn't afford to go to court should a rights holder come forward and demand that their access revenue be shut off. If a rights holder accuses a small- business Web site of being -- facilitating -- excuse me, a facilitating infringement and a payment process that shuts off payments to that business isn't payment process immune from suit under section 104, and what rights do they have?</p><p/><p>So first, is there any collaboration or recognition about the system that the DHS has formulated?</p><p/><p>PALLANTE: I'm sorry, I don't -- I don't know the...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>JACKSON LEE: Don't know have that question. Mr. Chairman, I think we have to have that answer from whatever resources we can get.</p><p/><p>Next, if you can have any insight on how it impacts small businesses, this particular legislation.</p><p/><p>PALLANTE: Yes. That section of the bill, I believe, was actually invented to make it easier and quicker to avoid the court process and the cost. That's the goal. There is no liability for the intermediaries under that section. There's an obligation if it goes to the next stage and is a court order. There's an obligation...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>JACKSON LEE: Right. So there's still a process that a small business might have to be engaged in.</p><p/><p>PALLANTE: But...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>JACKSON LEE: There's still a process. This makes it easier...</p><p/><p>PALLANTE: There is, and their good-faith intermediaries, and they have not themselves broken the law, and the bill tries to take that into account. If we can refine that, we should.</p><p/><p>JACKSON LEE: Yes, because they still have an obstacle to climb, if you might.</p><p/><p>Let me go to Ms. Oyama -- excuse me. Forgive us from not reading the name correctly. I don't have it in front of me. But let me quickly give you a series of questions. Ms. Oyama, is that correct?</p><p/><p>OYAMA: Yes.</p><p/><p>JACKSON LEE: All right. Thank you. One of the -- one of the kind of groups that I've been engaged in over the last couple of months is the generation of youth that are excited about startups. They're everywhere. They are job creators, and I see them as the new nucleus of job creation in America. They are -- they are obviously functioning now. They're all trying to emulate all the stars of social network. We know that won't be the case, but they are trying to create jobs.</p><p/><p>So let me raise these concerns with you. I think immediately what comes to mind is that this legislation may be overly broad, that it too easily circumvents Internet users, and it is inherently incompatible with the way, Internet actually works. Would you comment on the overbroad -- the circumventing Internet users and incompatible with the way the Internet works? Can you do that quickly for me, and then I'd like to go back to Miss -- if you could be listening to this question about the, Ms. Pallante, if you have any idea about the problematic aspect of this first small -- again, a small, a minority of businesses.</p><p/><p>But Ms. Oyama?</p><p/><p>OYAMA: Sure. On the overbreadth concern...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>JACKSON LEE: Overbroad.</p><p/><p>OYAMA: Overbroad, a huge concern is the scope of the definition of what the site dedicated to that. So that's a concern that's been raised among small businesses, larger tech companies is. If we're going to go after rogue sites, we have to make sure that they're rogue sites and that they're breaking the law. There's a lot of concern that right now the definition would cover new ground. It would cover site that today are complying with the DMCA. So they're taking down infringement when there notified by (inaudible) holders. It would be sites that today, under existing law, if they were hauled to court, they would be found not guilty under existing copyright law. So I think there's scope concern there.</p><p/><p>JACKSON LEE: Circumvented by Internet users. It can be too easily circumvents it by Internet users.</p><p/><p>OYAMA: Yes. So one of the concerns is that, on the -- the notice to terminate provision, that piece does not go through court, and so somebody could just notify a service provider. You could go away for Thanksgiving if your Web site owner. Your (inaudible) team providing services under the bill could be shut off than five days. So there's a lot of concern that, you know, that doesn't really provide adequate due process in terms of the way current businesses work.</p><p/><p>I would say, in terms of the incompatibility with the Internet, in the Internet here, Internet traffic is going to route around blockages. It's a kind of working with the grain of the Internet we think is really smart, it's really effective. It's why we support the legislation we discussed before about cutting off the funding sources. It's worked in going after sites like Wikileaks, which is incredibly sophisticated site. Much of international law enforcement was going after Wikileaks, and if you go to Wikileaks' homepage, it says that they're going down because payment provider shut them off. SMITH: The gentlewoman's time has expired.</p><p/><p>The gentleman from Florida, Mr. Ross, is recognized.</p><p/><p>ROSS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p/><p>Ms. Oyama, you feel that this bill is an infringement of First Amendment right of free speech?</p><p/><p>OYAMA: You know, I think short of their constitutionality, it certainly raises free-speech concerns.</p><p/><p>ROSS: Is it -- is it censorship that you're concerned about? Is that...</p><p/><p>OYAMA: Yes, so the U.S. has had a good platform globally to speak out for free expression, and I think a lot like this which would, for the first time, empower the government...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>ROSS: And that would empower the government to require you to do something that you don't want to do, which would be to set that aside. Is that correct?</p><p/><p>OYAMA: We're happy to disable links, and we're notified by rights holders. We think that going...</p><p/><p>ROSS: And as long as you do without a third party such as the government, it's not an infringement of First Amendment rights of free speech, nor is it a -- as censorship, is it?</p><p/><p>OYAMA: We don't do full site blockages. We do page by page...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>ROSS: Would you do take downs?</p><p/><p>OYAMA: Under the MPAEI (ph)?</p><p/><p>ROSS: Yes. Which is the same thing. I'm just having a hard time distinguishing when you do it it's OK, but when you have a third- party such as the federal government requiring you to do it, then it becomes censorship and an infringement on First Amendment rights...</p><p/><p>OYAMA: I see.</p><p/><p>ROSS: But let me ask a further...</p><p/><p>OYAMA: ...government approach it's much broader in this bill.</p><p/><p>ROSS: Let me go a little bit further here because I want to go to your example of Dave's Emporium, which I think is a great example for people such as me, who think simply to understand the small business. But I want to look at it from a consumer's rights perspective. Let's say that Dave's Emporium, because that 1 percent vendor that uses on the Internet that's found through your -- your Google search, results and the purchase of a product that causes death or personal injury.</p><p/><p>Now, in that chain of commerce, Google would be brought into action, especially where there's joint and several liability as a deep pocket, to defend that suit and probably pay damages. All of that could've been prevented had there been an investigation, had there been the appropriate execution under this act. In fact, not only would it have been prevented, but also, under this bill, is there not an affirmative defense that Dave's Emporium could've asserted in the sense that I don't have the -- the resources to hire a lawyer that would mitigate my responsibility to now have to defend the order to take down?</p><p/><p>So what I'm getting at is, is that, even further, you have immunities under this act that would prevent a third-party suit against you if you shut it down. But you don't have immunity if, in fact, you allow for the sale and purchase of products that are not only counterfeit, but they also result in death or personal injury.</p><p/><p>OYAMA: So on counterfeit, is definitely something that we agree with you. Counterfeit is a big problem. It's something that we invest tons of engineering hours, millions of dollars into going after. For example, for ad work, we adjusted 95 percent...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>ROSS: But it would seem to me that you would -- you would want to have the immunities. You would want to have some protection, some safe harbors to prevent lawsuits against you in the execution of your -- of your -- of your business.</p><p/><p>OYAMA: I think if a court is instructing intermediaries to take action, there's probably some place for immunities. But the concern here is that Dave could be shut off for five days not pursuant to its terms of service. Certainly no one has the absolute...</p><p/><p>ROSS: But he could be put out of business being sued because of a harmful product that could've been prevented had Google investigated the site.</p><p/><p>OYAMA: So certainly no one has an absolute right to ads or payment services. We think that they're...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>ROSS: Well, Dave's in that situation either way, and I think that he needs to have some protections. And I think that this bill will offer some of that.</p><p/><p>But let me -- let me shift to another thing, let me tell you I appreciate what Google has done with regard to child pornography. I mean you guys have stepped up to the plate tremendously. And I think that's a wonderful example. You need to be congratulated for that. You do it because it's the right thing to do, and it would seem to me that following the letter of the law, you could do the same thing in this regard in an effort to hold down, or at least eliminate, the use of pirated sites by way of the search engine and Google.</p><p/><p>OYAMA: So child pornography is certainly a huge, you know, problem. It's something we take very seriously. Technically, going after child pornography on a search engine is completely different from copyright because the machine can detect child pornography. A machine can look for flesh tones. A human, if you look at it, would know what it is that good adjusted. And with...</p><p/><p>ROSS: But it's still the right thing to do.</p><p/><p>OYAMA: ...the copyright, you can't just look at the video and tell whether it's infringing our license, right? It needs to be a collaboration with the rights owner.</p><p/><p>ROSS: Real quickly, Ms. Kirkpatrick, not a question; just a thank you, on behalf of MasterCard, for what you're doing because you're cutting off the source of the problem. And that's very important.</p><p/><p>Mr. Almeida, I had a chance to meet a couple of days ago with one of your members, gentleman who, a lifelong songwriter. He's in this room. And he met with me, and he said, \"You know, the problem isn't that it's a fight over between the movie houses than the producers; it's the small people, the people will follow their passion, the people who have the artistic ability to do something they've always wanted to do that now, after 30 years of being a songwriter, has to look at whether he can keep his house, what is future's can hold.\" And I wish you would do for me and explain to the members up here is how this adversely impacts not the giants in Hollywood not the Giants in Nashville, but those that participate, those whose creativity and innovation will be stifled unless there's some protections.</p><p/><p>ALMEIDA: Well, I think there does need to be protections, and I think that's what this bill hopes to do. The -- and this isn't to protect the big -- the big dogs in Hollywood.</p><p/><p>ROSS: Right.</p><p/><p>ALMEIDA: Our members who were behind the scenes, who were stagehand...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>ROSS: The foundation.</p><p/><p>ALMEIDA: ...who -- the people who built the sets, the backend payments for those workers support their health and petrified, that's being cut off. They're adversely being impacted by these rogue sites and by the piracy of their videos. A video being released today will be available by the weekend on the Web. And so we're hoping that this legislation will help to take a step forward in that area.</p><p/><p>ROSS: Thank you. Obviously, my time's expired. I yield back.</p><p/><p>SMITH: And thank you, Mr. Ross.</p><p/><p>The gentlewoman from California, Ms. Waters, will be recognized.</p><p/><p>WATERS: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.</p><p/><p>Let me just say that I find the discussion on H.R.3261 extremely interesting and engaging, and I think Mr. Ross frame this issue somewhat in its opening statement, when he talked about the giants and competition and the -- the profits and the money that's involved being at the basis of all of it. And let me just say that I view any proposed changes in IP and copyright laws as an opportunity to examine whether changes will expand opportunities for women and minority entrepreneurs, both in Hollywood and Silicon Valley. And I come to this discussion just having witnessed a CNN presentation called Black in America about Soledad O'Brien this past weekend, which I found very, very interesting.</p><p/><p>Having said that, I'd like to direct my first question to Maria Pallante, U.S. copyright registrar. User generated content Web sites like Facebook and YouTube are enormously popular. Individuals and groups use these platforms to share videos that range from fraternity and sorority step shows and high school talent shows to videos of kids performing a new dancer imitating a new music video. Many up-and- coming artists who don't have record deals also use UGC sites to showcase their talents, covering popular songs.</p><p/><p>Now, to the extent many uploaded video clips feature the use of copyrighted music and other types of content that is not for profit or commercial gain, do you think that this bill would include a Safe Harbor fair use exception or other explicit provision that would ensure we aren't trying to subject parity and leisurely activities to felony penalties? Are you at all concerned that some of the section's broader language could have unintended consequences that may chill the use of UGC sites and digital platforms that have served an important social utility?</p><p/><p>PALLANTE: Thank you for the question. I'm not concerned as it's written. The -- we're talking about two different levels of activity. This bill would go after sites dedicated to infringement. I think what is on the table in this room is a position that one can be compliant with the DMCA through notice and takedown of very specific sites when notified, and therefore, not have the obligation to participate in a solution that is about broad, willful, criminal, egregious, dedicated activity. Two different -- they -- these two things will operate at the same time, and the notice and takedown system will remain intact.</p><p/><p>WATERS: Also, I would like to ask about another issue that I'm very concerned with, and I would like to direct this to Ms. Katherine Oyama to Google. I'm very concerned about the voluntary authority and legal immunity the bill gives Internet service providers to block access to sites they reasonably believe are infringing sites. This provision would seem to run counter to the FCC's recently issued open Internet net neutrality rules. I can foresee cases in which an Internet service provider that holds all my content may use the section as a pretext to unfairly block access to a competing Web site that is not really dedicated to infringement. This section does not require credible claims, merely a reasonable belief that doesn't exclude commercial disputes or anticompetitive conduct. It is my understanding that the Senate doesn't have ISPs voluntary blocking authority in its bill. Can you foresee any unintended consequences with the voluntary blocking provisions? Is there a way that this bill could be refined to ensure that voluntary actions are based on credible evidence in certain thresholds?</p><p/><p>OYAMA: Sure. Thank you.</p><p/><p>So we do see today the Internet used by countless small businesses to facilitate communication to facilitate e-commerce. It is truly people's daily livelihood. And so we do think that there should be due process built-in if something essential to your site like your services is going to be taken away. I think the provision you were mentioning is section 104 the bill. I think the broader technology community shares those concerns. You know, one, if you look at the scope of sites that could be captured by a service provider's reasonable belief that they were dedicated to theft within bill, that's a very broad.</p><p/><p>And then two, the number of service providers have received complete immunity for terminating service without going to court, without going through a due process, is not just the providers that are required to take action under this bill; it's much broader. So it would include -- it would include advertisers, search engines, payment providers, but also domain name registers, ISPs, much broader, you know, a much broader group of folks. If you were to lose your domain name and your small independent business, that -- that is everything. And so making sure that you are at least protected by the terms of service when you sign up for a contract would, you know, probably make sense to us.</p><p/><p>WATERS: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I yield back the balance of my...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>SMITH: And thank you, Ms. Waters.</p><p/><p>The gentleman from Iowa, Mr. King, is recognized.</p><p/><p>KING: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate being recognized, and I appreciate the testimony of the witnesses.</p><p/><p>I want to just take a bit of a different tack here, if I could, and looking at the fraudulent Internet sites and the piece of this that's the direct focus of this hearing, and I'm just looking through some of the -- some of the background material, the problem of illegal pirating of copyrighted intellectual property. And I would think that, you know, it's all trademarks and copyrights of patents altogether that I think about, not just Web sites and things that we can look at.</p><p/><p>And so the -- there's a pattern across this country, or across the world, of certain countries that are pretty effective at this, and I'd just ask you if there's anybody on the panel, just raise your hand or answer, if you have a list of countries that are the most egregious violators of intellectual property rights from an American perspective?</p><p/><p>Yes, sir? I can't read your names. I'm sorry, so...</p><p/><p>O'LEARY: Thank you, Congressman. It's Michael O'Leary. I -- the -- sorry. The content industry has contributed share to something through the state department. There's a number of different ways. There's a notorious markets filing, which chronicles the areas of the world where this is the most problematic, and then there's the special 301 process, whereby the United States puts forward a list and kind of characterizes where countries fall in terms of their protection of intellectual property.</p><p/><p>And the reason for that, frankly, very simply, is that intellectual property is not just an American problem; it's a global problem, and what you're seeing around the world is that other countries are starting to recognize the benefit of not just protecting American intellectual property, but protecting their own. I would note, for example, that there are at least 16 countries in the world that engage in site blocking now, which has been the focus of some of the debate here. The Internet seems to be working fine in those countries. It seems to be having an impact in terms of taking sites like the Pirate Bay, which is blocked in many countries, but not in the United States off-line.</p><p/><p>So in many ways, the United States has historically been a world leader, but the truth of the matter, Congressman, from our perspective is if we don't step up and deal with the problems we have today, we're going to see background and we're not going to be the world leader. And that's -- that's unfortunate for country because we do lead the world in the production of intellectual property, and we ought to be leading the world in protecting it.</p><p/><p>KING: Mr. O'Leary, do you have an opinion and then, as you've given me a couple of sources that might look at. Can -- do you have a recollection on from which countries originate the greatest theft of intellectual property?</p><p/><p>O'LEARY: Off the top of my head, I would hesitate to list them in any type of specific order. I mean there are different problems in different parts of the world. There are hard goods problems, which is kind of the more traditional disk type piracy that occurs in places like Russia. There are problems with online, country like Spain has a significant online piracy problem. There are other places in Europe. We would be happy to provide you with the committee with a complete list. I'm hesitant to speculate because I don't trust my memory well enough to get them in the right order.</p><p/><p>KING: Is China on your list?</p><p/><p>O'LEARY: China's on the list, yes.</p><p/><p>KING: And... (CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>O'LEARY: There's definitely a piracy problem in China, yes.</p><p/><p>KING: Do you have any recollection of what the loss might be to American property rights holders from China?</p><p/><p>O'LEARY: I don't off the top of my head. It would be -- I'm not sure, frankly, that there's a way to measure it given the realities of China.</p><p/><p>KING: Would anyone in the panel be aware of any studies out of that U.S. trade representative? It seems that three or four years ago, at least U.S. trade representative has a -- has a study done that calculates that loss of -- loss to U.S. intellectual property rights holders to different nations? China, Russia comes to mind. Anyone care to answer that? I thought not on the underlying to...</p><p/><p>PALLANTE: Well, yes, Maria Pallante from the Copyright Office. I don't -- I don't have the dollar amount for you, but I would just echo what Michael said, which is that special 301 process identifies problematic standards in our trading partners when it comes IP as well as notorious markets and Web sites.</p><p/><p>KING: Does anyone have a more of a comprehensive solution? We're talking about shutting down some Web sites, but it's billions in theft of intellectual property rights globally. And here we are, the United States of America, with the strongest -- some of the strongest laws and the strongest traditions of respect for intellectual property, and I don't see a broader comprehensive solution to this. It seems to me that they can move faster than we can -- we can adjust to them and that we're dealing with a component rather than the big picture.</p><p/><p>Yes, sir, Mr. O'Leary? And then...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>O'LEARY: Congressman, I would argue that you're correct in the sense that this is a global problem. It's multifaceted. There's not a single approach that fits, but it's critically important to United States to maintain the high ground of the leadership in this because if we do not do it, other countries will not. I would also note that the problem you're highlighting about the criminals moving faster, that's true regardless of what the crime is. You ask anyone in law enforcement, that that's they'll tell you; you catch the ones who keep doing the same thing, and the people who would adapt and change you have to keep changing...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>KING: Are you aware of any state-sponsored intellectual property rights theft?</p><p/><p>O'LEARY: Are we worried about it?</p><p/><p>KING: Are you aware of state sponsored...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>O'LEARY: We believe that that occurs, yes.</p><p/><p>KING: And I'm going to say I believe that happens from China as probably the lead globally to do that. Does anyone disagree with that in the panel? I didn't hear any disagreement. I think I've gone far enough with this since my red light came on, but I do appreciate your -- all of your testimony, and I hope we can bring some piece of solution to this, and I hope at some point we can bring a whole solution to it.</p><p/><p>Thank you very much, and I yield back the balance of my time.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Thank you, Mr. King.</p><p/><p>The gentleman from Tennessee, Mr. Cohen, is recognized.</p><p/><p>COHEN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p/><p>This is indeed an important issue for us to work out, and the theft of intellectual property is of grave concern. But it nevertheless, First Amendment issues are important too. And my first thought is that it doesn't seem like you need -- there should be that much difference from what the Google folks in the techie folks are wanting and what the MPAA and the RIA and the other AAs want.</p><p/><p>Have -- let me ask maybe the gentleman from motion pictures, who's apparently got a Rick Perry problem with not being able to count to something, Mr. O'Leary. Have y'all not gotten together and try to work this out in some way and fine-tune this to where there aren't these issues of people being penalized that are not guilty and sites being, you know, shut down, whether it's just a small infringement but not a total infringement?</p><p/><p>O'LEARY: Well, we do believe that this legislation will result in either of those things happening, but we work with -- our studios work with Google on a regular basis in terms of trying to get stuff taken down off the Internet. There are ongoing relationships on this piece of legislation. There have not, to my knowledge, been specific discussions about this. But I want to be very clear; we have said from the beginning that if people are willing to come forward with constructive suggestions on how to do things that are not a pretext for maintaining the status quo, that we would listen to those things.</p><p/><p>COHEN: Wonderful.</p><p/><p>Ms. Oyama, do you have some positive, you know, not under pretense type -- pretext type of discussions that you like to come forth with?</p><p/><p>OYAMA: Yes. So I think just in the broader context of figuring out how to go after piracy, it's really important to keep in mind the number one most effective tool for going after piracy would be to increase the amount of legitimate lawful services that are available on the Internet, right? So if we can cut off the funding, we would decrease the supply of these pirate sites. If we could have more legitimate services for music and movies and everything else, which I know that studios are working very hard to do, that would also decrease the consumer demand for this type of...</p><p/><p>COHEN: Without necessarily itemizing each of them out, have you had the opportunity to post these to the team?</p><p/><p>OYAMA: Yes, so though we're here in DC today, I would assure you that all of our business partners, you know, on the West Coast are working very collaboratively, very, you know, much together to get the solutions, and we're always more than happy to continue to work with Mr. O'Leary and others.</p><p/><p>COHEN: So we say -- you're all working now trying to come up with some language that would maybe -- that the chairman might put in the manager's amendment that would make all people happy?</p><p/><p>OYAMA: You know, there's been some conversations that I think there would need to be a lot more...</p><p/><p>COHEN: I would hope there would be a lot more, and I think that's something that should take place.</p><p/><p>Let me ask you a question, since I got you -- situate the microphone. There are a couple of search engines in China and Russia, and Yandex (ph) I think it's one of them and Baidu, and some consider these rogue sites. And whether they are not, I don't know. They could be. If they were considered such they were blocked because they had some pirate type folks among their constituency, how do you think the Chinese and Russians would respond toward -- towards your company and towards United States companies?</p><p/><p>OYAMA: That's an excellent question. So I think we should realize that even though we would do something for really good reason here, it could potentially have international ramifications. If the U.S. Government is ordering U.S. companies to disappear for an search engines from our results, it -- it should be expected that there's going to be some form of retaliation internationally.</p><p/><p>COHEN: And those sites of the leading Chinese and Russian search engines. Is that correct?</p><p/><p>OYAMA: The sites that you mentioned?</p><p/><p>COHEN: Yes, ma'am.</p><p/><p>OYAMA: Yes.</p><p/><p>COHEN: Yes. So if we -- is it possible under this legislation they'd be totally cut off entirely? They'd be...</p><p/><p>OYAMA: If they were deemed rogue sites...</p><p/><p>COHEN: Right. OYAMA: ...under section 102, they could -- search engines could receive an order to disappear the whole site. It's really tough in a searcher out engine because although you could remove the direct link from a search, you know, as long as rogue site exists, people are still going to talk about it. They're still going to blog about it. They're still going to post about it. And so it's really not possible to remove all of worldwide discussion of the link. And that's why we support the follow-the-money type legislation because that's really going after the source of the problem by choking off their financial reason to...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>COHEN: Let me ask you another question, or maybe to the panel. I have the (inaudible) constituent services. We do great constituent services in Tennessee nine. In this way, on 1114, Ryan Turner (ph) wrote me an e-mail, and he says, \"I'm writing as your constituent. As a constituent, I opposed this stop on mine I received. I'm a student studying management of information systems. Should this pass, I believe my future IT would be crippled. Having the government handed DNS servers scares me, especially with the government suing Web site owners with one PRNI (ph)\" what I think is a misprint, \"the links as a content.</p><p/><p>As a college student who owns over 30 domain names, most of these places for third parties to post text responses, should one of those include a link to material that infringe copyrights now -- now I would be held responsible. I have no funding available to handle these claims, and I'm lucky enough to be trained on how to handle lawsuits with many -- many other entrepreneurs without formal training who have no idea how to handle it.\"</p><p/><p>Would -- if he had this, and there was one text that came back that was maybe link to any illegal site, would he be cut off, and would he have to then go to hire at a lawyer and possibly go to court?</p><p/><p>OYAMA: I think so. I think there's two ways that could happen. So one of the concerns, you know, that not just Google but the other technology companies will endorse the testimony the other trade associations are concerned about is that the definition in 103 of what is a site dedicated to theft is very broad. There's some language in there that also refers to a site or a portion of the site.</p><p/><p>So people have a lot of serious questions about what does that mean. Are we looking at a full site or are we looking at -- you know, and today's Internet, the way most Web sites work, there's real-time communication, and so you have lots of real-time comments, you have lots of real-time posts. If one comment or post is infringing, does that, you know, impugn the entire site, or we looking at it is statistically? There's some other words in the definition they get people concerned that -- that it's overbroad.</p><p/><p>So either been swept in it that way or enter the very broad immunities that are being given to service providers. Pretty much anyone who qualifies under the definition of qualifying plaintiff, which is very broad, they could go to a payment or advertising service provider. They could allege that the person that you mentioned is dedicated to a theft, and then those providers have complete immunity to shut them off. So there's kind of -- there's a concern that there's a strong incentive in the bill, that if you wanted to immunize yourself, the easy thing to do would be to comply with the notice and shut them off. And then...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>SMITH: The chairman's time is expired, and I don't mean to cut you off, but you could frame your answer to a quick conclusion. Or have you finished?</p><p/><p>OYAMA: I think that's good, thanks.</p><p/><p>SMITH: OK. Thanks.</p><p/><p>(UNKNOWN): I think you should go over.</p><p/><p>SMITH: The gentleman from Arizona, Mr. Quayle, is recognized.</p><p/><p>QUAYLE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I want to thank the witnesses for being here.</p><p/><p>Ms. Oyama, I want to go back to what you were just talking about earlier about how long-term we can address the piracy issues via more legitimate websites that provide legitimate content on the Internet. And I want to go to your testimony that you indicated that the only long-term way to beat piracy online is to offer consumers more compelling legitimate alternatives, and you cited YouTube's free ad- based model for monetizing content.</p><p/><p>You know, there could be some disagreement. I don't know what's the best way to monetize content, whether it's a fee-based or free ad- based. And if you look over the course of history, except for broadcast, it seems like most quality content has not been given away for free. So one thing that I want to ask you is, would you agree that the piracy issues that we're dealing with and a pirate Web sites that we're dealing with actually makes it more difficult for a company to start a fee-based site that offers legitimate content, and thus, it forces content providers to look for ways that are going toward Web in ad-based -- I mean ad-based content to give it away for free?</p><p/><p>OYAMA: I think there's so many different models and ecosystem right now. Certainly the problem of piracy is -- is of tremendous importance and great concern to any content provider, right? You want to have control over the distribution of your content. Some people choose to release it for free because they want to participate with their fans in that way. Others want to license it, and others want to have an advertising model. I think the kind of beauty of all the new services that we're seeing is there's no one-size-fits-all.</p><p/><p>I do think we would approach you to is a really great example of how kind of technology and copyright can work together. There's a tool on YouTube called content ID. Because YouTube has a hosted platform, we host all the content so it's on our servers. So through content ID, we're able immediately, a rights holder would give us their file. If a user uploads a piece of content, we would immediately scan 6 million reference files. And we could capture, if their song or their movie was being uploaded, and then the rights holder would have control of whether to monetize it or not.</p><p/><p>QUAYLE: But I think my more direct question is that if we don't -- aren't able to crack down and have the tools and the ability to crack down on the pirate Web sites, then you are actually forcing content providers into a narrow avenue of that based, providing only content via ad-based and free markets and -- not free markets, but free content.</p><p/><p>OYAMA: So both -- both would be tremendously important, right? Increasing...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>QUAYLE: Exactly. But I mean it kind of goes -- when you're -- when you're looking at that and how we need to crack down on piracy, ad based, which is the model that Google uses, and it seems to be why -- one of the reasons you would be pushing for that because that is the way that Google makes their money, right?</p><p/><p>OYAMA: There's different ways, but that's...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>QUAYLE: That's primary way.</p><p/><p>OYAMA: ...primary way for sure, yes.</p><p/><p>QUAYLE: And I think that that's just my biggest concern is that if you're looking at just ad-based, you're cutting down one significant avenue for people to provide content, and if we don't shut down these pirate Web sites, that we're going to actually lose out on different types of business models, different types of content providing, and that was -- that was the point I wanted to make.</p><p/><p>Ms. Pallante, I wanted to go to you. Earlier, you stated in your opening testimony that you do not believe in the Safe Harbors under the DMCA are actually weakened by SOPA. Could you expand on that a little bit?</p><p/><p>PALLANTE: Yes. First of all, the bill says that, and secondly -- as a savings clause -- and secondly, there's no monetary relief. The injunctions that are allowed are already permitted under the DMCA. There are, contrary to popular belief, ways to get them to enjoin certain action for search engines and ISPs. And there really does -- this bill is really designed to sit next to the DMCA. The DMCA is related to particular files on a Web site, and does not require the participation of those who are really in a good position to help stem the tide of piracy.</p><p/><p>So I would object to -- I'm I object to a couple of things that I have just heard from eyewitness, my fellow witness is, one is that I'm pretty sure that Google just said that it's the fault of content owners that we have rogue Web sites. That just can't be the truth. Secondly, although follow the money could be effective, it does not bring in everybody in the Web -- in the ecosystem. It doesn't bring in ISPs, it doesn't bring in search engines. It doesn't account for the vast number of Web sites that offer content purposely for free, and it doesn't really address the broader role of law issue that we have on the Internet right now.</p><p/><p>QUAYLE: And under the DMCR, there are actually instances where service provider can take down all content on a Webpage or on a Web site if there's infringing content on that Web site.</p><p/><p>PALLANTE: Yes, the only way I see that happening is if every single rights holder comes together at the same time it approaches the Web site and - and every file was actually infringing. So...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>QUAYLE: So it could be -- it could be possible under the DMCA.</p><p/><p>PALLANTE: It's highly unlikely.</p><p/><p>QUAYLE: OK. But the one thing I wanted to just get your final thoughts on, because opponents -- opponents of the bill actually say that it's going to endanger the security and the integrity of the Internet. One of the things that the Internet has been very good at is in commerce, and wouldn't it also be fair to say that without shutting out these pirate Web sites, then we are also endangering the security and integrity of the Internet because they are putting out also -- often counterfeit goods and also infringe copyright material?</p><p/><p>PALLANTE: Right. So there are three underlying purposes. One is to protect content owners about their own property. The second is to allow those who want to invest a place where there's sunshine and oxygen and a good environment for that. And the third is to protect consumers, absolutely.</p><p/><p>QUAYLE: Thank you. I yield back.</p><p/><p>OYAMA: Can I just clarify one point? I just wanted to make sure that nothing was mischaracterized, because I do not think that it's the fault of the rights holders. Certainly, rights holders have the right to protect their content; however, they want, and we are completely committed to going after piracy. My only point was that the success of the consumer appetite for services like Netflix and iTunes shows that there's a lot of different licensing models out there.</p><p/><p>(UNKNOWN): Can I follow-up on that, on one point, which I think is a practical point, which is being missed in Mr. Quayle's question. There are legitimate services out there now. There are more of them, and there have been before, there will be more than tomorrow. The problem is that when you go to Google and you punch in the name of the movie, those legitimate sites are buried on page 8 of the search results. There is a better than average chance that Pirate Bay is going to end up ahead of Netflix. That's a fundamental problem, no matter how many legitimate sites are out there, that we can't over, we can't do anything about. If we could get Google to re-index those sites it away that favor legitimacy, to your question, Congressman Quayle, the consumers would be getting to those first. But when Netflix is buried way down in the search results, it doesn't matter how good Netflix is -- is going to be. And this is a practical problem that could be addressed today.</p><p/><p>SMITH: OK. And thank you, Mr. Quayle.</p><p/><p>The gentlewoman from California, Ms. Chu, is recognized.</p><p/><p>CHU: Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p><p/><p>I would like ask about the savings clause, and I'd like to ask both Ms. Oyama and Mr. O'Leary about your opinion on this. I'm aware that concerns have been raised by Internet companies, and many other sets of language of the bill may have unintended consequences. And even though everybody agrees that the problem of foreign rogue sites is critical that we need to cut revenue to these sites, there may be disagreement on the language is drafted. And I think it's really important that we try to recent common ground, that we work through language that is balanced and effective and make sure that we don't have unintended consequences.</p><p/><p>One of the areas of disagreement on this online piracy act is an this question of -- of the savings clause and whether there is the community that is provided under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act for search engines and Internet service providers. And so I would like to have your different opinions because there -- I -- some have represented to me that the Senate bill has a savings clause that seems to address this, but SOPA does not, and is that -- isn't that true? I like to have your different opinions on this, Ms. Oyama and Mr. O'Leary.</p><p/><p>OYAMA: Sure. So this is actually -- it sounds technical. It's the savings clause, but it is of critical importance to the technology industry. Businesses today really build their business models under the Safe Harbors that they know that they have on the DMCA. So for technology company receives notice of infringement, they are required to expeditiously remove that infringement. But they don't have kind of general monitoring obligation.</p><p/><p>So the balance that we try to strike in any legislation would be if there are intermediaries who are required to do new things under this bill, that the bill would be really clear, advertisers shut off your services payment, shut off your services, and that would be clear, we take those obligations. We want to make sure that this bill that's going after rogue sites doesn't strip us of those important Safe Harbors and kind of unrelated litigation or, you know, open the possibility that the status of orders could be used to establish red flag knowledge.</p><p/><p>And so there's some language that we propose that would kind of alleviate that concern and keep this bill is effective as it needs to be to go after rogue sites. But a -- but a savings clause to make sure that we're not open ourselves up to liability in a way that we would somehow need to proactively monitor all user generated content in real-time is really important to us.</p><p/><p>CHU: Mr. O'Leary?</p><p/><p>O'LEARY: Congresswoman, I would just associate myself with the comments and testimony provided by the registrar of copyrights.</p><p/><p>This legislation should as a complement to the DMCA. It doesn't impugn those rights or the Safe Harbor in any shape -- way, shape or form. The DMCA deals with good actors, legitimate services that are trying to take steps to get infringing stuff off of their sites. Rogue sites deal with a group of people that, under no definition, would fit underneath the DMCA. They are bad actors. They are dedicated to infringement. These actually fit together. To complement each other. In no sense does this undermine the DMCA.</p><p/><p>CHU: And...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>OYAMA: I think if that's the case, the one sentence clarifying that in any legislation would be tremendously helpful.</p><p/><p>CHU: Ms. Pallante, what -- what is your opinion on this, on the savings clause and whether there are enough protections and the DMCA is not...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>PALLANTE: Right. So again, the -- thank you for the question. The question, again, is just -- just -- well, the problem is just because somebody may be compliant under the DMCA does not mean that they shouldn't take action if the attorney general finds that there's a foreign infringing site run by criminals who are engaged in piracy. That is a -- just an unfair comparison, and this bill, if that is the argument, this bill does allow for that, and it's my view that it should.</p><p/><p>CHU: Well, I'd like to ask a different question, and that is about jobs creation. There are some that are saying SOPA would stifle innovation and job growth in that -- with a brokster (ph) opinion that -- which was a finding by the U.S. Supreme Court that it contributed to the infringement, that venture capital would dry up.</p><p/><p>But Mr. Almeida, in your testimony, you noted that he represents over 4 million U.S. workers, and on their behalf support the -- that you actually support the Stop Online Piracy Act as an important jobs bill. How do you respond to these claims that this legislation would stifle innovation and job growth?</p><p/><p>ALMEIDA: I think innovation is alive and well in the U.S., and I don't see this as stifling it in the least. Our members work in the United States. They're taxpayers. They go to work. They make products that we view as entertainment. That is what we see this online piracy infringing on. And you can't hit a price point when someone's giving it away for free to make a business model to compete with free. It also has to do with constructive innovation, and we believe in constructive innovation like Netflix as opposed to TVshack.bz, which is an infringing site that should be taken down.</p><p/><p>CHU: Thank you. I yield back.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Did she -- did she yield back? Did you yield back? Thank you.</p><p/><p>CHU: Yes, I yield back.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Thank you, Ms. Chair.</p><p/><p>The gentleman from Texas, Mr. Poe, is recognized.</p><p/><p>POE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I think all of you for being here. This panel or this committee is made up of former prosecutors, defense lawyers, and their even two former judges here. And back in my experience on the bench down at the courthouse, or the Palace of Perjury, so referred to it in those days, saw a lot of thieves. And it's, you know, stealing is stealing, and thieves are people we had to deal with.</p><p/><p>I disagree with you, Mr. O'Leary. They're not battle actors, they're thieves. And this legislation is trying to get a grip on this. We've got three -- really three groups say here. We had the credit card companies, we had the search engine folks and the content providers. If I had my way, I would lock all three of you in a room and don't - say, \"Don't come out until you all agree,\" and that we can solve it, I would -- I would think.</p><p/><p>If you pull up, as I did, you pull up on Google search engine the Grinch Who Stole Christmas or Harry Potter, free Harry Potter movies for free the Grinch That Stole Christmas, you get a lot of free sites on there. And as -- as a consumer, I can't tell who's a thief and who's not a thief. And I know Google is doing a lot, millions of sites and all of that. I've heard the testimony. But at the point we are now, what can -- can Google offer to this bill that Google would sign on to the bill, specifically?</p><p/><p>OYAMA: Sure. To -- to your point about the search results, one of the major commitments that we made this year was to improve the tools to make sure that when rights holders notify us, those search results will be disabled in the search. And so the commitment that we had made at the beginning of the year was to reduce the turnaround time to under 24 hours. And so we're happy to say right now it's -- it's six hours or less is the average turnaround. In terms of what we could do affirmatively...</p><p/><p>POE: Yes. But this day forward. You pull up the Grinch Who Stole Christmas and you keep going page after page for three Grinches.</p><p/><p>OYAMA: So long as those sites are there they are going to show up on the Internet. And so we think that legislation that would target the source of those sites is necessary. What we would do is we would support legislation that would go through the Department of Justice.</p><p/><p>You would have a law enforcement aspect. You would have a court determine that a site is dedicated to infringement. And you could serve those orders on U.S. based payment providers and advertising. We have Google Checkout for payment.</p><p/><p>We have AdSense, AdWords, a lot of advertising products that would directly regulate and impact our business. But we think that if we can break the financial ties for those sites then that is really smart, targeted and effective and would avoid some of the collateral damage that we discussed earlier this morning.</p><p/><p>POE: So, your answer is go after the finances.</p><p/><p>OYAMA: Cut off the finance.</p><p/><p>POE: Yes. Cut off the money. So, if there was something that we added to the bill that would cut off the money then Google may support it?</p><p/><p>OYAMA: Those are certainly concepts in the bill that reflect that. We think if you look at WikiLeaks that is how they've been taken out is by cutting off the money.</p><p/><p>It's an approach that U.S. law enforcement uses for many different international problem, you know narcotics, terrorism. I mean, it's been a proven way. If you cut off someone's financial incentive, they're not going to want to pay for the servers and the bandwidth and the infrastructure to run these Web sites.</p><p/><p>POE: OK. Let me be a little more specific. What can Google do? Not what the financial providers can do. What can Google do to move this legislation forward?</p><p/><p>OYAMA: So, there's a lot we're doing in the private sector. But in terms of the legislation, we would publicly support legislation like what I described, follow the money approach. We would be happy to do that. We would be happy to work with your staff on legislation in that way. If it can avoid the collateral damage we discussed, and if we got a good definition of what the rogue site that didn't (inaudible) legitimate U.S. businesses.</p><p/><p>POE: But you can't tell you when you pull it up, the Grinch Who Stole Christmas, who's the real Grinch and who's not. You get all these page after page of free Grinches.</p><p/><p>OYAMA: That's why court adjudication or cooperation with Red Shoulders (ph) is real important. There's lots of legitimate free movies. There's lots of content that just the middle man wouldn't really know if that was licensed or infringing.</p><p/><p>POE: You want to weigh in on that, Mr. O'Leary?</p><p/><p>O'LEARY: I think to use the example of The Grinch, there's a movie right now as I mentioned earlier called J. Edgar. The only lawful place you can see that movie in a theater. If you go back to your office and put J. Edgar into Google, you're going to get the same list of eight pages of sites where it's free. That movie's not available for free anywhere. If you want to see it you have to go to a theater right now.</p><p/><p>So, I understand the complexity. You're talking about something that is perhaps not in the theater. But this is actually in the theater right now. And there's no reason for it to be online in any fashion frankly.</p><p/><p>I also think that what is being proposed, what was being suggested is -- as I said earlier, we should follow everybody's money. And isolating one or two things, that doesn't solve the search engine problem that we've been talking about. And we think that should be a part of the discussion too.</p><p/><p>We think it requires all of the people that are involved in this to work together to get it done. Kind of to your theory of throw everybody in a room and sort it out. If everybody doesn't go in the room at the beginning, you're not going to sort it out.</p><p/><p>POE: Well, maybe we need a court order to get you all three in a room.</p><p/><p>Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Thank you. Maybe get the FBI to help you in that, J. Edgar Hoover style.</p><p/><p>Mr. Deutch, you're recognized for the next five minutes.</p><p/><p>DEUTCH: Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p><p/><p>First of all, it's not just J. Edgar. I -- I have teenage daughters who are awfully excited about the new Breaking Dawn movie, which is coming out. You can watch that right now online for free.</p><p/><p>What I -- what troubles me about this whole exchange quite frankly is on the one hand there's this great technology, Ms. Oyama, that you're so proud to trumpet, understandably, about -- from YouTube and what YouTube does in order to prevent illegal content from being posted. Yet when you enter -- \"watch Breaking Dawn for free\" and you can do it online now, there you throw your arms up in the air, there's nothing we can do.</p><p/><p>OYAMA: Right. I can understand how that would feel frustrating. Technologically there's a distinction. So, on YouTube the content that is posted on YouTube is hosted on our servers. So, we're able to match files. If someone tries to upload something on YouTube we have a reference file we can match against. We don't control the World Wide Web.</p><p/><p>DEUTCH: I understand that's a technology issue. We can talk more about that.</p><p/><p>I have another question for you. There is -- this has been a fruitful exchange. Different than I might've expected from the way a number of us have referenced already. The way this debate is played out in the local press in particular, I don't know whether -- I don't know whether Google shares the position publicly that this bill will kill the Internet and all of the advertisements that have resulted and all of the phone calls we received in our office.</p><p/><p>But I do wonder whether there is any base level here that you would agree needs to be tackled. And so if we -- if the issue is the language that says a portion thereof, let's assume that he bill didn't have that language in there.</p><p/><p>So, you can't argue that Twitter would have to be taken down. Which, by the way, is an argument that is -- there's no basis for that argument under this bill. You can't argue under this bill that Facebook would have to be taken down. There's no basis for that under this proposed bill. And I think -- I think that you understand that, notwithstanding the reference to individual tweets that might lead a whole site to be taken down.</p><p/><p>My question is, if that language weren't in there, are there any of these Web sites that -- that you believe should be taken down, and that Google ought to play a role in helping us accomplish that?</p><p/><p>OYAMA: Yes. We would be happy to work with the chairman, with your office on a follow the money legislation.</p><p/><p>DEUTCH: OK. Well, let me -- I understand -- so you don't like the way it's -- the bill is written. Let me ask you about that because you referred -- you made many references today to following the money. Yesterday your chairman recommended regulations based on tracing payments, banning Web sites offering illegal materials as a replacement for this bill consistent with what you've said today.</p><p/><p>Many of the offshore sites clearly engaging in theft are driven by -- as you point out, are driven by ad revenue, not just credit card transactions. As we follow -- if we want to follow the money we can't just focus on the credit cards obviously. We have to focus on the ads. Google, at least from the statistics I've been told retains over 75 percent of all search advertising revenue in the U.S. Therefore following the money leads us to you.</p><p/><p>So, tell me what -- tell me the steps that Google's taken already, understanding that you're concerned about these -- this intellectual property theft, understanding the impact that it's going to have that has every day on our economy. Tell me the steps that Google has taken to combat it under -- using the follow the money approach that you favor.</p><p/><p>OYAMA: OK. So, just to confirm a legislation that would go after ads is a big part of our business...</p><p/><p>DEUTCH: I understand. I understand. But given...</p><p/><p>OYAMA: We're happy to support that.</p><p/><p>DEUTCH: I understand that. But tell me what you've done...</p><p/><p>OYAMA: OK.</p><p/><p>DEUTCH: ... now in the absence -- because we all acknowledge this is an important issue. And if...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>OYAMA: And one shouldn't prevent the other, right.</p><p/><p>DEUTCH: Right. You can play a significant role today. So, if you can just speak to what you've done.</p><p/><p>OYAMA: OK. So, there were some major commitments that our general counsel Kent Walker made at the beginning of the year. I'll just try to tick off the major ones, but we should try to follow up with your office on more specifics.</p><p/><p>For DMCA we've removed more than five million infringing files this year, as one rights holder notified us. One of the concerns we'd heard is that there was some grit in the system and that there was frustration that it was taking too long. So, we invested significant engineering hours and money to improve this role.</p><p/><p>DEUTCH: Ms. Oyama, I hate to cut you off. I don't have a lot of time here. But I would -- I'd ask that you follow up. I know -- I remember Mr. Walker's testimony. I followed up with a letter after that hearing requesting all sorts of information. That letter's still not -- I've not received a response. So, I hope that -- I hope that a response will be forthcoming to that letter and to the request that I made here today.</p><p/><p>I just -- I'd like to finish with this. This notion that we're going to break the Internet, that somehow we're going to stifle innovation, the fact that the kid serving me coffee at Starbucks told me, hey, I hear you're taking up legislation that's going to make it impossible for me to download music.</p><p/><p>The fact is what we're worried about is -- the reason this legislation -- the reason we're having this discussion, what we're worried about is not stifling that innovation in the future. That's a concern that we all have. I don't believe that the legislation does that.</p><p/><p>But we know right now if we do nothing that the film industry and those young directors who are starting out aren't going to be able to do their craft. And we're not going to have the next Adele, and we're not going to have the next Drake because they're not going to be compensated for their work.</p><p/><p>And I hope that as we go forward and as you provide those answers that we can have an honest discussion about what's really at stake here and -- and let's move past these -- these -- these attacks on those of us who believe this and suggest that somehow we're going to mean an end to the Internet.</p><p/><p>It's not -- it's not accurate. I think -- I think you understand that it's not accurate. And it doesn't do the American economy any -- any great service at all.</p><p/><p>And with that I yield back.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Gentleman yields back. And the gentleman from Texas -- the other gentleman from Texas, Mr. Gohmert, is recognized for five minutes.</p><p/><p>GOHMERT: Mr. Chairman -- there we go.</p><p/><p>Again, also appreciate your being here. It is a tough subject. And we're dealing with intellectual property here. And I, like my friend Judge Poe, who was a district judge and also a chief justice. And we dealt with -- it wasn't called bad actors. You dealt with theft. And that's really what we're talking about here.</p><p/><p>It's a crime. It's a theft. We don't want thieves working their way through an honest, legitimate, wonderful means of in this case the Internet.</p><p/><p>Now, in the past some have used the analogy of the pawn shop, that you know the pawn shop can't intentionally and knowingly assist in theft. And so there were laws made, most states have them, where people -- the law enforcement can go in and get information.</p><p/><p>Now, I know, and I've been resistant to some of the pushes to force Internet providers and search engines into doing things that we don't even require pawn shops to. And I thought some were going overboard in trying to make demands on search engines that we don't even demand at pawn shops.</p><p/><p>But on the other hand, there is this aspect of our criminal law. And every state has it; the federal government has it. Anyone who aids, abets, encourages, in any way assists someone in committing a crime, the law is very clear in every state and the federal code. You're just as guilty as if you committed the crime yourself. The question is do you intentionally or knowingly aid?</p><p/><p>Well, it's been brought up often enough. There are thieves using the Internet. And I keep hearing from people who say look, if it were illegal for me to use that free Web site, then how come I get access so easily? They're expecting us to do something. And I think most of us were hoping that there would be something worked out between the interests here.</p><p/><p>But I can give you an example. I know what the law is. And I was -- I was -- I had an 8-track, A Warm Shade of Ivory, Henry Mancini, back in college. And it got me through some all-nighters, that and Jonathan Livingston Seagull soundtrack.</p><p/><p>And so anyway, Sleepless in Seattle has the song In the Wee Small Hours of the Morning, and I wanted to get that. I wanted to download it. I paid two bucks for it, not just $0.99. Nobody has it except some free Web sites. I knew not to go use those and download it free because it's illegal. Most people don't.</p><p/><p>So, when we talk about follow the money, we're talking about something terribly difficult in going to China, going to Russia and trying to follow the money over there. We're not getting help from those folks. Archer Blackford (ph) and I met with their folks in China that handled this stuff. And it seemed pretty clear to me we weren't going to get a whole lot of help out of them.</p><p/><p>So, what should we do to keep from hurting the innovation of the Internet and Google and Bing and these folks that come up with great ideas? But at the same time balance the interests in this being a law-abiding society? And I'm gratified to hear people on both sides of the aisle have similar concerns.</p><p/><p>So, it just doesn't seem to me to be that onerous to say if someone goes to court for heaven sakes and proves with probable cause standards that somebody's committing a crime of theft, and then that is presented to an Internet provider, a search engine, these people are committing a crime, there's probable cause to believe that's justification for a warrant, why that's too onerous to say don't make them accessible.</p><p/><p>And I'm still having trouble understanding that. And I would welcome comments in that regard from whoever wishes to. Thank you.</p><p/><p>OYAMA: Thank you. I think we completely agree about the importance of having a federal judge play the role of an arbiter so that folks' services aren't being terminated just by a five-day notice to their provider without the ability to appear to defend themselves. I think to your point about what we can do is probably three things.</p><p/><p>So, one would be building on the DMCA. Under the DMCA today search results can be line edited out. If a rights holder tells a search engine to remove a piece of content, we have worked incredibly hard over the last year to improve our tools. The average turnaround time today is six hours if we get received notice.</p><p/><p>So, we're working really hard on improving that. It's not perfect. It's not done. It's something we'll need to work on.</p><p/><p>The second piece, though, would be to build on that and to come together and support legislation that would impose new obligation on other providers. So, we are also an advertising provider, largely an advertising provider, a payment provider. A judicial process where a court determined that a site was dedicated to infringement and then instructed U.S. based intermediaries to shut off financial ties to that Web Site, that's the most important and effective thing we could do.</p><p/><p>If we can knock them off at their knees and we can cut off their financial ties, they won't have a reason to be in business anymore. They won't be making money. That's the effective way to go.</p><p/><p>And then the third piece would be to get rid of the ineffective and harmful pieces. So, I realize reasonable people can disagree about this. But there is a tremendous concern in the technology industry about some of the remedies that are being proposed and some of the unintended consequences that would have you know potentially very severe repercussions for the Internet network, for people's security and free speech concerns.</p><p/><p>So, getting the balance right is something we can support. And we certainly think that there is a way forward and a way that we could all agree on going after these sites.</p><p/><p>GOHMERT: OK.</p><p/><p>LOFGREN (?): Would the gentleman yield?</p><p/><p>GOHMERT: Well, I'd ask unanimous consent to allow others to finish answering because there's a couple of hands. And I'd certainly...</p><p/><p>SMITH: Gentleman is extended another minute.</p><p/><p>GOHMERT: You had requested to comment.</p><p/><p>CLARK (?): I'd just add that in regard to your comments about thievery and Congressman Poe's, from our industry's perspective, it's more than thievery. It's murder. We do feel -- I particularly feel -- I have 28 years of federal law enforcement. I know crime when I see it. And I see counterfeit medicines as actually attempted murder.</p><p/><p>I mean, it's not quick. It's not immediate. But when you're only giving a patient 20 percent of the medicine they need to cure their cancer or their heart problems or their high blood pressure, you're in fact killing them slowly. But that's the issue here...</p><p/><p>GOHMERT: Well, as a prosecutor you know that might not be murder. It may be negligent homicide or other -- some other type of homicide.</p><p/><p>CLARK (?): Along those lines. And it's frustrating if we are not immediately making progress in cutting that down.</p><p/><p>I've worked with CBP in pilot programs and I'm seeing those counterfeits flooding in because of the purchases over the Internet over the rogue Web sites that are selling counterfeit medicines. And it's incredulous to me how much is coming into the United States.</p><p/><p>So, I would say, you know this bill is going forward with demonstrating that we need to change the status quo. We can't accept what's existing right now. And I agree very much that we have to demonstrate to people that there are consequences and this is a serious crime.</p><p/><p>When you look at six months, four months, three years, that's the cost of doing business. It can't be that bad if that's all they're going to get. So, I also see the Title II (ph) in this that is very, very significant as well.</p><p/><p>GOHMERT: Was there anybody else wanted to comment? Thank you.</p><p/><p>LOFGREN (?): Would the gentleman yield?</p><p/><p>GOHMERT: Yes. Sure. LOFGREN (?): I just wanted to briefly -- one of the -- I think it was Mr. O'Leary suggested that if you type in \"J. Edgar movie\" you get all these infringing sites. I just did that. And what you get is the show times in Washington, a review, the Wikipedia article, the trailer from Warner Brothers, several reviews of the movie, the iTunes trailer. There's not a single infringing site that comes up. So, I...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>MARINO (?): (Inaudible)...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>SMITH (?): Would the gentle woman -- would the gentleman yield?</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK) MARINO (?): ... you use the word \"free\" in there. That's where those things come up. Yes, I'll yield.</p><p/><p>SMITH (?): Would you yield? Well, I just did the same thing and on...</p><p/><p>LOFGREN (?): Google?</p><p/><p>SMITH (?): Google...</p><p/><p>LOFGREN (?): Google or Bing?</p><p/><p>SMITH (?): Google'd it, \"watch J. Edgar Hoover free online on YouTube full version\". Shows you how to download it at no cost right here.</p><p/><p>LOFGREN (?): Well, I did a different search engine. But the point I'm trying to make...</p><p/><p>GOHMERT: Would the gentleman...</p><p/><p>MARINO (?): ... going back...</p><p/><p>GOHMERT: ... reclaiming my time, I...</p><p/><p>SMITH: The gentleman's time has expired.</p><p/><p>GOHMERT: OK.</p><p/><p>LOFGREN (?): I would ask could the gentleman be granted 15 seconds and so I might say just an answer to. The point is the search engines are not capable of actually censoring the entire World Wide Web.</p><p/><p>That's the problem. You can't do that. And so we need to go after the people who are committing crimes in a way that's going to work. I think that we can do that, but this bill is not it...</p><p/><p>MARINO (?): Well, with all due respect, I wanted to show the... GOHMERT: Well, reclaiming my time...</p><p/><p>SMITH: The gentleman's time...</p><p/><p>GOHMERT: ... I agree, but...</p><p/><p>SMITH: ... is expired.</p><p/><p>GOHMERT: ... we also need to cut off the getaway car. And with that -- and I'm not sure what the gentle lady has against Google, but I respect her using Bing. And yield back the time.</p><p/><p>SMITH: The gentleman yields back time he does not have. I'm going to accuse you of being a liberal here in a minute.</p><p/><p>Mr. Johnson is recognized for five minutes.</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p/><p>Mr. O'Leary, SOPA requires payment networks like MasterCard to suspend payment transactions between a U.S. customer and an online merchant within five days. According to Ms. Kirkpatrick's testimony, there are very legitimate challenges that payment networks have in meeting such a short deadline, especially considering the multiple players involved in an online transaction.</p><p/><p>The Senate version requires payment networks to take actions as expeditiously as reasonable. Earlier this year the White House negotiated a best practices document with the payment industry that has a reasonable period of time standard.</p><p/><p>Which of these standards is acceptable to you, the within five days under SOPA, the expeditiously as reasonable under the Senate version, and a reasonable period of time as negotiated between the White House and the payment industry?</p><p/><p>O'LEARY: Yes, sir. I think it's a legitimate question and one that we believe can be resolved favorably to everyone.</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: Which one do you think is most acceptable to you?</p><p/><p>O'LEARY: As I sit here right now I'm not prepared to pick between the three, quite honestly. I certainly understand the point that was made by our colleagues at MasterCard. If it's not possible you delve in five days. We certainly don't want to create a time limit which forces them into an impossible situation.</p><p/><p>At the same time we would like the legislation to recognize that if someone's trying to...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: (Inaudible)...</p><p/><p>O'LEARY: ... they don't do that. JOHNSON: If I give you -- if I open up the tent for you to stick your nose in, boy are you going to get all the way up in there. I'm just appreciating your gift of gab.</p><p/><p>But if I might ask Mr. Clark the same question.</p><p/><p>CLARK: I feel the same way.</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: OK. All right.</p><p/><p>CLARK: Sorry. I feel the same way.</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: All right.</p><p/><p>Ms. Pallante, section 506 of the Copyright Act establishes criminal liability for the willful infringement of a copyright. Recently there has been confusion as to the definition of that term, willful. Do you think that willfulness is the same as intentional? Or does the act -- tell me about the difference between those two standards.</p><p/><p>PALLANTE: Right. So, that's a great question. And the point of SOPA is to capture those that knowingly engage in a known legal duty. And that is the standard that most courts have accepted. There are some exceptions to that. I think that's something that can be clarified in the bill and legislative history perhaps.</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: All right.</p><p/><p>Ms. Oyama, the DMCA and Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act represent the legal underpinnings of the view that intermediaries need not monitor or supervise the communications of users. It is a view that we have long touted and pushed across the world through various diplomatic channels. We have harshly criticized governments who use such virtual walls to prevent citizen access to the Internet. China's a great example.</p><p/><p>With that in mind, would this legislation allow companies to demand that search engines located inside the U.S. censor where American consumers are able to go on the Internet? And how would this legislation likely be viewed by China and other -- and Iran and other countries that put these roadblocks up in terms of content to their citizens on the Internet? And how would that affect our diplomacy?</p><p/><p>OYAMA: Thanks. So, for the DMCA piece that you mentioned I think we would certainly agree. The DMCA has proved to be a foundation for American innovation and has struck a balance. So, if you're a new company or starting up you know what the laws are. You have certainty.</p><p/><p>And it also helps rights holders. If a rights holder is aware that there is infringing content on the service provider, they just need to let us know. Web posting companies, search engines, we will remove access to that content. It strikes the right balance.</p><p/><p>It does -- it takes care of infringing speech. It leaves up legitimate speech. And it reflects a careful balance. It also -- because of the way Web services are used today, we see all over the place when there's real time events it's important that a Web platform enables that type of real-time communication or real-time ecommerce.</p><p/><p>If you didn't have the DMCA and an intermediary platform was required or potentially liable for what its users were posting in real time, you would have to implement some type of proactive monitoring system. It could really change the dynamics of the Web today.</p><p/><p>I think the second...</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: It would stifle the small entrepreneur that's just getting started more than it would hamper the larger providers of content...</p><p/><p>OYAMA: I think it's both, but...</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: It would be a burden on both.</p><p/><p>OYAMA: Yes. If you're a new company starting up, you'll have less money to invest in that type of monitoring. So, certainly it would have an impact on small businesses.</p><p/><p>To your question about you know kind of the speech aspect, you know if we impose a law here which would have court orders requiring a domestic search engine to make entire full Web sites disappear, and especially if there's some type of over broad definition, which would capture the legitimate speech, you know unfortunately what we do here would have other ramifications. And we may think that this is a good reason. We do think it's a good reason here. But we feel the time for Google if DMCA requests competitors try to take each other down. Pro- Democracy speech tries to be quelled. We've seen in Libya in the recent activities there different politicians trying to take each other's YouTube channels out because they disagree with their views.</p><p/><p>We see copyright used all the time as an excuse to quell speech. If we mandate this type of approach there, we really need to think carefully about what types of international ramifications that will have on free expression.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Gentleman's time is expired.</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: If I might get just one more question.</p><p/><p>SMITH: All right. The gentleman's already had extra time, but so has everybody else. So, go ahead.</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: Thank you.</p><p/><p>The Justice Department has responsibilities under the -- under the SOPA Act. While at the same time we've been talking about downsizing government. And in fact, the Justice Department has lost about 30 percent of their attorneys.</p><p/><p>How does this affect the effort to criminally go after these pirates and also from a civil standpoint? I'll ask that to Mr. O'Leary.</p><p/><p>O'LEARY: Well, I think that you know this bill is actually -- speaks directly to that point. That's part of the reason there's the ability for individual plaintiffs to move so that the burden does not fall solely on the Justice Department.</p><p/><p>The content industry, Pfizer...</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: What about the criminal part though? Because we get people...</p><p/><p>O'LEARY: Well, these are...</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: ... prosecuted for shoplifting and stealing little small petty items. But this is multibillion dollar white collar fraud, which only the Justice Department has or should have the -- really has the resources and the breadth of law enforcement ability to address. How does the downsizing of the Justice Department impact criminal prosecution?</p><p/><p>O'LEARY: Well, I think as a general premise when you downsize the Justice Department obviously it has an impact. But let's be very clear. The Justice Department does pursue criminal cases internationally...</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: How can it do so...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>O'LEARY: ... (inaudible)...</p><p/><p>SMITH: Gentleman's time is expired.</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: Thank you.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Some time ago.</p><p/><p>Recognize myself for five minutes.</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: Well, I am a liberal.</p><p/><p>SMITH: All right. I would not accuse you of being anything else.</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: Well, I bear that...</p><p/><p>SMITH: My friend.</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: I bear that stain with great honor.</p><p/><p>SMITH: This is sort of reverse of the old story that I went to a fight and a hockey game broke out. I came here and as one who has not made up his mind on this bill, hoping to receive information on this. And I think everybody on this panel is committed to fighting piracy.</p><p/><p>I mean, maybe I'm the only member of this committee who's got a gold record. I got it from the recording industry for my work on counterfeiting when I was the attorney general of California. So, I very much believe that it's an important role for us to play, law enforcement and civil law in this regard.</p><p/><p>But my concern is something that was brought to my attention as the chairman of the Cyber Security Subcommittee on Homeland Security. And that is the existence of a system that has been ongoing for some years called DNS Security, DNS SEC. And I have heard from those -- some of the engineers that have been working on this in the Internet area that if we applied this law in this way it would undo what we've been doing to try and secure the Internet by way of DNS SEC or DNS Security.</p><p/><p>So, I'd like to ask the panelists if any of you feel you can speak to this point because it's one that was raised with me. I'm not a technical expert on this. But was some real alarm by Internet engineers I would call them who really don't have a dog in this fight. But our concern -- in terms of the speech between the various special interests here, and I mean that in the proper way, special interests.</p><p/><p>And so what I'd ask Mr. Clark, for instance. Are you aware of this criticism? And does this legislation, would it dis-incentivize Internet service providers from using the DNS Security extensions because it mandates the redirection of customers to another Web site?</p><p/><p>CLARK: No. I'm afraid I'm not familiar with that and not a cyber...</p><p/><p>SMITH: OK.</p><p/><p>Mr. O'Leary?</p><p/><p>O'LEARY: Well, I'm certainly aware of the argument. And the people that we've talked to it's a concern which is frankly overstated, as I mentioned earlier in response to another question. There are numerous countries around the world that engage in this type of activity. The Internet has worked without a problem in regard to that.</p><p/><p>I think also you know they're overlooking and looking at this debate. There's an existing security problem with the current state of play. And that is these rogue sites taking private information from consumers and spreading malware and spyware and things like that.</p><p/><p>The final thing I would say is that in regard to other things like dealing with malware, dealing with spyware, dealing with child pornography, this type of activity occurs all the time and the Internet seems to function just fine. I tend to agree with the comments of Mr. Deutch that if the Internet is going to be all things to all people, it should also be in terms of trying to help us stop people from stealing our stuff.</p><p/><p>The problem, frankly is, is that the Internet seems to...</p><p/><p>SMITH: That's not my point. My point is whether or not you can respond to specific question raised by Stuart Baker, former DHS assistant secretary of policy and former NSA general counsel to the effect that if this approach to respond to a legitimate problem were put into effect it would undercut an effort that's been going on for nearly a decade to secure the Internet by way of this program that I referred to.</p><p/><p>O'LEARY: We disagree with that position.</p><p/><p>SMITH: OK. Can you submit in writing for us specifically how you disagree...</p><p/><p>O'LEARY: Sure.</p><p/><p>SMITH: ... with that?</p><p/><p>O'LEARY: Happy to.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Ms. Kirkpatrick?</p><p/><p>KIRKPATRICK: I'm unfamiliar with that element. I'm not aware of it. I don't have the technical expertise to comment on it.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Does anybody with your organization have this expertise?</p><p/><p>KIRKPATRICK: I certainly can follow up and get back to you.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Please respond to that specific question because to me it's an underlying question that's extremely important. And I've worked on the problem of cyber security. If what we're doing here has the unintended consequence of upsetting what is, at least in the opinion of a number of experts -- and they may be wrong. I'm trying to ferret this out. Undercut a real effort that would practically help us secure the Internet. That is bothersome.</p><p/><p>Ms. Oyama?</p><p/><p>OYAMA: Sure. So, I think the concerns that you mentioned are the ones that we've heard as well from many cyber security experts. I know Stuart Baker has written about this. The designers of DNS SEC themselves have published a white paper.</p><p/><p>I am not -- I am not...</p><p/><p>SMITH: Does your -- have your people...</p><p/><p>OYAMA: Yes.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Do you have anybody that has expertise with your association that could respond to that specifically? Because...</p><p/><p>OYAMA: I think...</p><p/><p>SMITH: This is not part of this hearing. And I'm very concerned that evidently this bill is not being referred to my subcommittee. And we have -- and I'm not parochial about this, but if we're going to do it we ought to at least talk about it and to have people come here and say our organization, either we don't take a position or we're not experts on this is upsetting.</p><p/><p>OYAMA: I think that there is great concern within our company...</p><p/><p>SMITH: Well, could you please respond in writing on that?</p><p/><p>OYAMA: Sure, happy to. Yes.</p><p/><p>SMITH: And Mr. Almeida?</p><p/><p>ALMEIDA: No. No expertise.</p><p/><p>SMITH: OK.</p><p/><p>Ms. Pallante, do you have any?</p><p/><p>PALLANTE: I think that Congress should absolutely consult objective technical experts. But what I'll add is that ICE, through operation on our sites, has been using the existing seizure and civil forfeiture laws to essentially disappear Web sites in the United States. So, this bill would take that criminal standard and apply it to foreign sites.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Thank you very much.</p><p/><p>Let's see, who's next? Mr. Marino is next. For five minutes.</p><p/><p>MARINO: Thank you. Chairman.</p><p/><p>Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for being here.</p><p/><p>And I want to -- I think my colleague and friend Ms. Lofgren and I pointed out a very good example of how easy this is on some sites and not others. I think Zoe went to Bing and got the trailers. And I went to Google, typing in \"free\" who sent me to YouTube for the free movie. So, you know it's -- there's a lot of work to be done here.</p><p/><p>Ms. Oyama, I want to compliment you on your decorum and your professionalism and your loyalty to your company for being here and answering the tough questions that you have been answering -- you have been answering. You're certainly an asset to your corporation.</p><p/><p>OYAMA: Thank you.</p><p/><p>MARINO: Nevertheless, I think it's reprehensible that the chairman, that the CEO, the president, the counsel, none of them thought it was responsible enough for them to be here. And they sent you into the lion's den. And you certainly deserve a large portion of their bonus at the end of the year.</p><p/><p>OYAMA: Can I just add one thing? Our general counsel, he was here in the spring. He cares very much about this problem...</p><p/><p>MARINO: Good.</p><p/><p>OYAMA: ... and doing it the right way. He, I think, sent a letter saying any other day -- he had a longstanding personal commitment for today. Any other day he would be here and he looks forward to (inaudible)...</p><p/><p>MARINO: All right. I give that to him. And I remove his name from that list. And he can keep his bonus. All right.</p><p/><p>Let me ask you a question here. I want to thank Google for what it did for child pornography getting off the Web site. I was a prosecutor for 18 years and I find it commendable and I put those people away.</p><p/><p>So, if you can do that with child pornography, why can you not do it with these rogue Web sites? And let me follow that up with, why not hire some whiz kids out of college to come in and monitor this and get -- and work for the company to take these off?</p><p/><p>My daughter who is 16 and my son is 12. We love to get on the Internet. And we download music. And we pay for it.</p><p/><p>And I get to a site, and I say this is a new one, this is good, we can get some music here. My daughter says dad, don't go near that one. That's illegal. It's free, and given the fact that you're on Judiciary I don't think you should be doing that.</p><p/><p>So, it's pretty -- maybe we need to hire her. But why not?</p><p/><p>OYAMA: So, the two problems are similar in that they're both very serious problems. They're both things that we all should be working to fight against. But they're very different in how you go about combating it.</p><p/><p>So, for child porn, we are able to design a machine that can detect child porn. You can detect certain colors that would show up in pornography. You can detect flesh tones. You can have a manual reviewer or someone look at the content and they would say this is child porn and it shouldn't appear.</p><p/><p>We can't do that for copyright just on our own because any video, any clip of content it's going to appear to the user to be the same thing. And so you need to know from the rights holder, the owner of the right, have you licensed it? Have you authorized it? Or is this infringement?</p><p/><p>MARINO: I only have a limited amount of time here, and I appreciate your answer. But we had the technology. Google has the technology. We have the brain power in this country. We certainly can figure it out.</p><p/><p>Let me move on here. First of all, Mr. Clark and Mr. O'Leary, I want to thank you for your dedication to law enforcement. I've been down there for 18 years and thank you so much.</p><p/><p>And Mr. Almeida, my father was a fireman for 30 years, so I know exactly what you're talking about.</p><p/><p>So, I want to pose this question to anyone. It's my understanding that taking down a portion of the site is much more difficult than taking down the entire site, so I'm hearing from the testimony here. So, is there a more balanced approach that we can assist you in taking, but you take the lead on it, in diffusing this problem and stopping this infringement on this material, this illegal stealing of our materials that is costing us jobs and is costing this country a lot of money?</p><p/><p>Do you understand my question? Please jump in, anyone. I don't think anyone understands my question.</p><p/><p>Ms. Pallante?</p><p/><p>PALLANTE: No. Well, I appreciate the question. I don't know the answer.</p><p/><p>Certainly when law enforcement goes before a judge and tries to get a court order that would allow it to seek relief from the Web site and then engage the search engines, the ISPs, the payment processors, et cetera to help, they -- they -- they would like to stop the infringing material and not the non-infringing material. I don't know if it's a technical solution or if it's just a question of each Web site having different pages where they can easily find the infringing content.</p><p/><p>MARINO: Do any of you agree with me that we do have the brain power and the technology available to figure this out if we want to spend the money? All right.</p><p/><p>Thank you and I yield back my time.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Great. Gentleman's time's up.</p><p/><p>Mr. Almeida, you're recognized for the last five minutes of this hearing.</p><p/><p>ALMEIDA: Thank you for that strategic timing of my recognition, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate that. So, in honor of your discretion I will not use the whole time.</p><p/><p>I would like to first of all associate myself with the comments of my colleague from California at the end of the diocese, Mr. Deutch. I think he's hit the nail on the head. When you're the last guy you don't want to try to see if you can prolong things any more than usual.</p><p/><p>I would like to ask the Chair, however, since there's written responses to this security thing, and I tried to write the guy's name down. I'm new; I don't know. Maybe it was Stuart Baker. Maybe we could have Stuart Baker's concerns written so we can have something to compare those with. And if that's out of order then I'll shut up on that and move right along...</p><p/><p>SMITH: Mr. Baker's article was asked by unanimous consent to be part of the record from the gentle lady -- the gentle lady from California's giving it to me right now.</p><p/><p>ALMEIDA: OK. Good. Thank you.</p><p/><p>SMITH: And if I were a chair I would have him here. But I'm only temporary chair.</p><p/><p>ALMEIDA: Thank you for your compassion for someone who's been here for 61 days.</p><p/><p>Finally, so that I have something to yield back, I appreciate the concerns and all. This strikes me as one of those deals where the pursuit of the perfect is going to get in the way of the good.</p><p/><p>One thing -- and I apologize for missing the part that I missed, but there was an opportunity to talk with some folks in anther committee that was kind of important. But I didn't hear anything that said no, this is not an issue. No, this is not taking place. No, those jobs of this gentleman on the end are not being threatened. No, it's not real-time impacts when Mr. Marino can dial it in and be watching it right now.</p><p/><p>Quite frankly, I think there's an issue -- I don't know how you address it because nobody should leave the room thinking I'm technically savvy. But -- I don't have anything to type on as a matter of fact. They even took my iPhone away today. So.</p><p/><p>But I'll tell you this. The impacts are instantaneous. Once it's downloaded, it's gone. That horse is out of the barn and it's never coming back. And when you have a broken leg you need to go to the hospital.</p><p/><p>And like it or not -- and I -- and I agree with Mr. Marino's comments. Way to go. Whatever they're paying you, it's not enough. And so if those pansies want to come by some day and say hi, tell them they're welcome.</p><p/><p>So, anyhow, when your leg's broken you got to go to the hospital. And unfortunately you're in the medical business on this stuff.</p><p/><p>And so I can just say that my concern is this. You're a major operational piece of this. The criminal activities are uncontroverted that are happening. And to do nothing is wrong. Nothing happens quick in this -- in this process I believe from my vast amount of experience. And so it's time to try something.</p><p/><p>And so while I appreciate the concerns, when I hear a recurring theme of follow the money, there's plenty money around to follow, and that's a good thing. I'm a Republican. It's a good thing to make money.</p><p/><p>So, I will just tell you from my perspective, it's time to move. And while there're other concerns, and we want -- if there was a perfect bill that ever came out of here it would sure be neat for me to be here while it happens. But I'm guessing it's not going to happen when I do.</p><p/><p>So, I would appreciate best recommendations so that we can get moving on in terms of stopping something that's taken several years just to get to this point. I am not picking on you.</p><p/><p>And so with that, Mr. Chairman, I see the light is where it is. I yield back the most time that anybody's yielded back today.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Very good. The gentleman will be commended.</p><p/><p>I'd like to thank our witnesses for the testimonies today. And without objection, all members will have five legislative days to submit additional written questions for the witnesses or additional materials for the record. We thank you all. We appreciate your testimony on a very difficult subject.</p><p/><p>This hearing is adjourned.</p><p/><p>END</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Leonard Lance, R-NJ; Blake Burman, Fox News</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Time: 10:25:00</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Date: 2018-09-02</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BLAKE BURMAN, FOX NEWS: Joining me now is the New Jersey Congressman Leonard Lance.  He is a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Thank you for joining us in studio this morning.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">REP. LEONARD LANCE (R), NEW JERSEY:  Thank you for having me.</p><p>BURMAN:  There's a couple different hearings.</p><p>The Senate side is more on how these tech companies can -- can help out with elections, and et cetera.  On your side, you have got Jack Dorsey in the hot seat and what many view as a bias of these social media companies against conservatives.</p><p>You plan to ask the Twitter CEO what?</p><p>LANCE:  Whether there is bias and why, based upon their algorithm, they may have chosen certain content over other content.  </p><p>It will be a busy day for Mr. Dorsey.  He will be at the Senate first and then he comes over to our side of the Congress, to the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Wednesday afternoon.  </p><p>BURMAN:  So I guess the question is, do you think that, if there -- if you think there is bias, do you think it's purposely being directed at conservatives, at Republicans?  And if it is, Twitter's a massive company.</p><p>Is there anything that you could even do about it?</p><p>LANCE:  I don't know whether it's intentional or not, but we intend to get to the bottom of it.  </p><p>And this is based upon our majority leader, Kevin McCarthy, who is very strong on this issue.  And he has worked with the chairman of the committee, Greg Walden of Oregon.  And we intend to get to the bottom of it.  And, of course, the American people demand fairness and not bias in any way, shape, or form.  </p><p>BURMAN:  Of course, the follow-up here is -- is regulation, right, whether this company, other big tech companies need to be regulated.</p><p>The president specifically earlier this week, on Twitter, and then there were a lot of questions after it, took on Google.  And this was the question that was posed to President Trump.  Watch it real quick about regulation and Google.  Watch here. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  You know what we want?  Not regulation.  We want fairness.  When we have fairness, we are all very happy.  </p><p>But you're talking about a tremendous amount.  I mean, I'm president.  They got me here.  You're talking about a tremendous number of people.  We want to see fairness.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  So the president there wouldn't wholeheartedly endorse regulation.  It's kind of a political catch-22 for him, because he's been talking about one of his big prizes is how they have been able to slash regulation over the first 18, 19 months of his presidency.  </p><p>So if you endorse it, it's kind of backing something that you want to essentially unwind.  Do these companies needs to be regulated?</p><p>LANCE:  They need to be fair.</p><p>And I think the president is 100 percent accurate.  Let's see if they can be fair.  And I don't favor over-regulation.  I favor a free and fair Internet.  And so let's get to the bottom of it.  And I agree with the president.</p><p>BURMAN:  If they are regulated, how would you even go about that?  How on Congress would that get done?</p><p>LANCE:  That would be a challenging endeavor.  </p><p>And, of course, I favor what is known as the BROWSER Act by Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee.  And that relates to this whole issue.  </p><p>But, first, let's get to the bottom of it.  </p><p>BURMAN:  Here was the statement that Google put out as it relates to Google.  They said this -- quote -- \"Search is not used to set a political agenda and we don't bias our resorts\" -- \"results,\" rather, \"toward any political ideology.\"</p><p>A spokesperson goes on to say: \"We continually work to improve Google search, and we never ranked search results to manipulate political sentiment.\"</p><p>That's Google's take.</p><p>Do you believe them?</p><p>LANCE:  We will see what is said on Capitol Hill this week.  </p><p>I am a cautious lawyer, but we ought to get to the bottom of it.  And that is why we're holding our hearing in the Energy and Commerce Committee.  </p><p>BURMAN:  All right, the president also brought up the issue of antitrust.  So you could go at it through potentially regulation.  He brought up the issue of maybe there's an antitrust issue.</p><p>This is what the president said in an interview with Bloomberg earlier this week.  He said -- quote -- \"I won't comment on the breaking up, whether that's that -- meaning Google -- \"or Amazon or Facebook.\"</p><p>He went on to say: \"As you know, many people think it's a very antitrust situation, the three of them, but I just -- I won't comment on that.\"</p><p>Antitrust issues here?</p><p>LANCE:  Potentially.  </p><p>But that would be referred to the Department of Justice.  And I don't know whether it actually qualifies as an antitrust violation.  But, first, we on Capitol Hill are going to see whether or not there is bias, intentional or otherwise.  </p><p>BURMAN:  So I guess the big picture here is just that.  Is the bias intentional?  Is it unintentional?  </p><p>We're at the dawn of the Internet age, right?  Like, these companies are just a handful of years old.  Is it possible that they're just trying to work their way through some things, or is it simply this is Silicon Valley trying to target Republicans here?  </p><p>LANCE:  I hope it's not the latter.  I hope that it's a situation where the company is just trying to work through this situation.  </p><p>But there are some concerns regarding the fact that it might be deliberate.  I don't reach that conclusion yet.  That's why we're holding the hearing.  </p><p>BURMAN:  You got Dorsey in the hot seat.  Do you want to see Bezos?  You have already had Zuckerberg.  Do you want to continue to pull these people in there?  You think anything enlightening can come from it?  </p><p>LANCE:  Yes, I think the testimony of Mark Zuckerberg was very enlightening, when he came before the committee in the spring.  </p><p>I think that he may have violated, his company may have violated a consent agreement with the FTC in 2011.  I asked him specifically about that.  And I asked him whether he had a position the BROWSER legislation, and he's yet to get back to us on that.  </p><p>BURMAN:  OK, wait and see, I guess.

Enache via Hereticus Economicus:[1] In hisarticle[2], 'The Right's Phony Class War,' David Sessions claims that 'woke capital' is a myth invented by the social conservative right, and the right's opposition to this myth is somehow aimed at hurting the majority of Americans, from all backgrounds, because, after all, big corporations [and Big Tech in particular] are just benign suppliers of demand - it's not as if they engage in social engineering or anything [sarcasm]. Sessions concludes that the right doesn't have an economic program to empower the working class, quite the opposite. I agree with this conclusion, but I disagree with the premise. Sessions doesn't address at all the fact that conservative ideas and outlets, to one degree or another, are being censored by Big Tech, and he likely welcomes this phenomenon. More so, from his writing, the author doesn't believe in a managerial class of vested interests in the United States that holds cosmopolitan views. </p><p>Cosmopolitan elites are a fantasy in the author's view. As if, somehow, there are no liberals, no xenophiles in the top echelons of society, part of trans-national corporate interests and factions who are pushing for Globalization. The author implies that the only elites are straight, white, xenophobes xenophobes whohaven'tbuilt a single mile ofnew wall[3]since Trump took office. Denouncing 'woke capital' \u2014 business interests voicing support for progressive social politics \u2014 has become an obsession. [] In June, Arkansas senator Tom Cotton gave a speech on the Senate floor denouncing 'the dictatorship of woke capital,' by which he meant 'a troubling trend among giant corporations using this wealth and power to force liberal dogma on an unwilling people.' The freak-out about 'woke capital' not only rests upon a fictional sociological divide between a hostile ruling class and a resistant populace, but the residual fantasy of a socially conservative 'moral majority.' The basic laws of capitalist marketing dictate that corporations respond to their customers' tastes. What social conservatives interpret as economic power tipping the scales in favor of progressive values is really a response to what the overwhelming majority of Americans believe: between 65 and 69 percent of Americans, in all ethnic demographics and regions of the country, support gay marriage, and a clear majority supports trans rights. This is plain manipulation. The author is using a [liberal] market argument to explain capitalism, which is funny, since writers for the Jacobin are marxists; and marxists claim that capitalism is all about replicating [certain] socio-economic relations in order to perpetuate itself. This means that the population is constrained in what it can demand and what the capitalist system is allowed to supply. It's also important to distinguish between capitalism, as Adam Smith understood it / industrial capitalism as opposed to finance capitalism [maximizing shareholder value ideology], and the social engineering that's going on today, just like it was during the Cold War, when State secret servicessponsored[4]both conservativeandleft-wing ideology. I remember a bit by George Carlin on national television on the issue of private vs public means of transport, asking himself, since when do the people get what they want? I ask Sessions, what do gay rights and trans rights have to do with bs notions spewed in 'progressive' echo chambers like: men can become pregnant too, gender is a social construct [not biological at all], the US flag is racist, only whites can be racist, the encouragement of children to engage in sexual activities, straight and otherwise, the promotion of Government-subsidized abortion irrespective of circumstances, the promotion of hormone therapy for minors, including toddlers, with sex change being the aim, the promotion of hedonism etc I agree that the tories aren't the 'moral majority' and that they haven't real economic solutions, but spare me the sophistry. Big Tech is engaged in social engineering, and the establishment [State and private sector] clearly has had a liberal bias and it retains it - despite Trump being in office. Sessions also employs the appeal to majority fallacy and commits a straw man as well. He states that a majority of Americans support gay rights and trans rights. Sure, and a majority of Americans oppose socialism. What's to be done, Mr. Sessions? You'll most likely argue that a majority of Americans hold this view due to mainstream anti-socialist propaganda. Well, the conservatives can say the same with regard to the pro-LGBTQ stance. Sessions also cites a survey in which a majority of Americans say that immigration is a positive thing. This is the straw man I referred to earlier. The question was immigration, as in legal,regulated immigration[5]- not illegal immigration; and the latter point is what conservative politicians oppose, well, in their speeches anyway. See Also <url normalizedValue=\"https://theduran.com/woke-hypocrisy-concerning-porn\">https://theduran.com/woke-hypocrisy-concerning-porn</url>/  No matter how loudly populist conservatives rage about cosmopolitan elites and woke capital, no matter how much they pretend the Left only cares about political correctness, there's only one side that has a plan for the real America. Yes, I've heard that before and quite the plan it is. Huge Government investment [Green New Deal], medicare for all, including for illegal aliens, and State-sponsored abortions irrespective of context, thus making the practice a preferred method of birth control, plus open borders [a boon to capitalists] - the result of all this being endless competition among workers, higher rents and interest payments and homelessness as a result of uncaptured land values, overcrowding, sanctuary cities, social and ethnic unrest, more crime, and a bigger slice of the pie for the vested interests. What a splendid vision of the future Subsidizing the likes of the Koch Brothers while lying to voters that the 'progressive' State is going to keep Big Capital in check by cranking up themarginal tax[6]rate. The American Left has sold out to CIA money more than half a century ago and did all it could to separate itself from the Eastern Block. That's why they're so alien today in visage and message to anyone who actually lived in a popular or socialist republic. Its obsession with open borders has everything to do with the [shared] agenda of its ideological nemesis. You can read more about ithere[7]. In conclusion, if Trump won't get a second executive term, it's not going to be a victory for the Left, but a defeat for Trump, losing on his own beard, as we say here in Romania.Liked it?

MATT GAETZ (R-FL)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[*]      JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST:  Joining me now, Florida Congressman, Matt Gaetz and author of the upcoming book, \"Firebrand: Dispatches from the Frontlines of the MAGA Revolution,\" which is now available for preorder.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">All right, so Congressman, you basically got these Big Tech executives to admit that they can have employees go rogue, censor conservatives, rewire and re-engineer sites to censor conservatives, and they don't have any idea what's going on under their own nose.</p><p>REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL):  Big Tech used to tell us that it was just glitches in the algorithm that caused bias and mistreatment of conservatives. But now we see there are blacklists and deep inside the heart of every Silicon Valley woke-topian may beat the heart of an online tyrant.</p><p>And when you have those folks with that type of power, it does not give us the freedom, the democracy, the engagement that we deserve in a country as great as America.</p><p>WATTERS:  Yes, and you guys have to threaten to bust up these monopolies if they don't play fair. You had -- I can't believe you're not on this committee because you're on every single committee, but Fauci was getting grilled by a bunch of your colleagues the other day. And here's Jim Jordan kind of giving it to Fauci.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH):  Can the government limit the protesting?</p><p>DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES:  I don't think that's relevant to --</p><p>JORDAN:  Well, you just said, if it increases the spread of the virus, I'm just asking, should we limit it?</p><p>FAUCI:  Well, I'm not in a position to determine what the government can do in a forceful way.</p><p>JORDAN:  No limit to protests, but, boy, you can't go to church on Sunday.</p><p>FAUCI:  I don't know how many times I can answer that. I'm not going to opine on limiting anything. I'm just going to tell you --</p><p>JORDAN:  You've opined on a lot of things, Dr. Fauci.</p><p>FAUCI:  Yes, but I've never said --</p><p>JORDAN:  This is something that directly impacts the spread of the virus and I'm asking your position on the protests.</p><p>FAUCI:  Yes, I'm -- well, I'm not going to opine on limiting anything --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS:  All right, Congressman, a very smart guy, Dr. Fauci, but it seems like he's wearing thin with some of your colleagues. Is that true?</p><p>GAETZ:  Yes. After watching that, I wondered whether or not churchgoers should just adopt the language of the protesters. Maybe we can have potluck protests or Sunday school sit-ins.</p><p>Maybe instead of giving our donations through tithes, we can just count that as bail money to release our eternal souls.</p><p>Jim Jordan pointed out that we don't get to choose the parts of the First Amendment that the government is going to allow and not allow, and though this is an uncommon virus, it should not deprive public health officials of basic commonsense.</p><p>WATTERS:  Right. I mean, both protected under the First Amendment, but they're playing games with the rhetoric and the regulations.</p><p>All right, Barack Obama, I guess made some news, came out and said some pretty wild stuff at the funeral of the former Congressman the other day. This is what he said about nuking the filibuster. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  By ending some of the partisan gerrymandering so that all voters have the power to choose their politicians, not the other way around.</p><p>And if all this takes eliminating the filibuster, another Jim Crow relic, in order to secure the God-given rights of every American, then that's what we should do.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS:  All right, so there everybody at the Lewis funeral gave him a big round of applause. So that's the game now. If Biden wins and they retake the Senate, they already have the House. They nuke that filibuster, man, they could add D.C. as a state. That could really tip the balance of power.</p><p>They could expand the Supreme Court, Congressman. They could go after guns. They could do anything they want and just jam a radical agenda down everyone's throat. Are people prepared for that?</p><p>GAETZ:  Well, you know, when you look at Barack Obama, I guess it's surprising and confusing, that he is such a fan of Jim Crow relics, because it was Senator Obama in 2005, on President Bush's judicial nominations, and again in 2006, when Justice Alito was nominated, who said that the filibuster was necessary and important to debate in the Senate.</p><p>So, you know, maybe he was more willing to embrace Jim Crow relics as a senator than he is as a former President. But gosh, you know, John Lewis is someone who just should be celebrated outside of politics of -- you know, at his funeral.</p><p>I didn't really think that it was appropriate to be talking about the intricacies of redistricting and the filibuster while honoring a great American icon like John Lewis.</p><p>WATTERS:  Yes, they lecture Republicans about decorum. All right, there he is, Congressman Matt Gaetz, best hair in Congress. I don't know --</p><p>GAETZ:  You've got the best hair on Fox News, Jesse, so what a combo.</p><p>WATTERS:  What a combo. I just don't have your hairdryer. I've got to save some money for that.</p><p>GAETZ:  I'll send one to Emma.</p><p>WATTERS:  Please do.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTNW-2429516149</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTNW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60H4-8YX1-JBHT-D2FC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">319798</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"887\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 CQ Roll Call Aug 2, 2020</copyright><publicationName>Political Transcript Wire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 2, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>Senate</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Gaetz, Matt</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Jordan, Jim</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Obama, Barack</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Demonstrations &amp;

Patrick McHenry, R-North Carolina, ranking Republican member of the House Financial Services Committee, issued the following opening statement at a hearing on Facebook's impact on the financial services sector with CEO Mark Zuckerberg:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Today is a trial on American innovation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"There's a growing concern about the role that technology plays in our lives.</p><p>\"Yes, technology has led to greater prosperity, more freedom of expression, and the ability to transcend the limits of space and time to connect us with one another.</p><p>\"But we know there's also a downside to all of this.</p><p>\"The vitriol on social media is frightening. The growing inequality between those who have access to the latest tech gadgets remain on the coasts, while folks living in rural America are still trying to get basic access to the internet.</p><p>\"Not to mention the anxiety of this age, that nervous feeling of needing to check your phone throughout the day.</p><p>\"There's a lot of anger out there, and it's now being directed at the architects of this system.</p><p>\"That's why you're here today Mr. Zuckerberg.</p><p>\"This is not just about Libra, not just about some bad housing ads, and maybe not really about Facebook at all.</p><p>\"You are here as one of the titans of this new era that we call the digital age. And fair or not, you are here today to answer for it.</p><p>\"But of course, you are not America's first innovator, and this is not the first time that America has faced difficult questions about technology.</p><p>\"Sadly, throughout the history of innovation, a major theme is the exploitation of fear.</p><p>\"Politicians, enabled by special interests and a lack of understanding of new technology, use fear to justify what is ultimately a power grab.</p><p>\"New laws. New regulation. But ultimately, old and tired ways to centralize power here in Washington.</p><p>\"Some of this has led to comical results.</p><p>\"There was time when legislators pushed for so-called 'red flag' laws, which required vehicles, called 'horseless carriages,' to immediately stop on the side of the road and disassemble the automobile until 'equestrian or livestock was sufficiently pacified.'</p><p>\"But other times in history the use of fear was not so funny.</p><p>\"Our last hearing on Libra, for example, was a moment where a member of Congress actually compared the technology to September 11th.</p><p>\"Look, I have my own qualms about Facebook and Libra and the shortcomings of Big Tech. There are many.</p><p>\"But if history has taught us anything, it's better to be on the side of American innovation, competition, and most importantly the freedom to build a better future for all of us.</p><p>\"Progress is not preordained.</p><p>\"Let us not forget that the wave of innovation is spreading across the world--with or without us.</p><p>\"So that is why I believe American innovation is on trial today.</p><p>\"And the question is: Are we going to spend our time trying to devise ways for government planners to centralize power and control as to who, when, and how innovators can innovate, or are we going to spend our time building a brighter future for America together?\"</p><p>* * *</p><p>- Watch Ranking Member McHenry's remarks here (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mul0CxA7zS8\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mul0CxA7zS8</url>)</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-6901634 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR6901634</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XBK-70D1-DYG2-R38R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"527\"/><timeReceived>8:00 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 23, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, what a big Thursday we have, it is Thursday, June 27th.</p><p>Breaking news this morning, in trade tensions, President Donald Trump has arrived in Japan for the G20. He arrived just moments ago. There's a shot of Air Force One. Chinese officials say that President Xi Jinping is about to present President Trump with \"terms\" for settling the trade fight, according to the Wall Street Journal this morning.</p><p>The 2020 race is on, the first Democratic debate focused on the economy and President Trump.

While he is there, he could sign off on a trade deal with China. Take a look. There is the shot of the President just moments ago, departing from Air Force One. And we've got these new details from the Journal this morning about what China is planning to present to the President in terms of moving this trade deal one step forward.</p><p>Blake Burman is live this morning, in Osaka. He joins me now with the very latest. Good morning to you, Blake, or good evening, actually.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Good evening. It is good morning, good evening, everyone, I put it, Maria. It is 7:00 here, local time. You just saw President Trump departing Air Force One moments ago, in a rainy Osaka, Japan, as he is set to start the G20 summit and the meetings around it, 7:00 tonight, as we mentioned, so it will be a short day here for him.</p><p>The President is set to meet with the leader of Australia first, and then the meetings really pick up tomorrow as the President, in bilateral meetings alone, will meet with leaders of Japan, India, Germany, Brazil, and then he will have his one-on-one as well, with Russia's Vladimir Putin.</p><p>Then, on Saturday, he'll have breakfast with the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, meet with Turkey's Erdogan, and, of course, have that \"extended\" meeting with the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping.</p><p>Just minutes before the President touched down here in Japan, the Wall Street Journal broke the news that according to the Journal, that China's Xi, is preparing to present the President, with \"terms\" as to how to dial back the temperatures in the trade war between the two nations.</p><p>According to the Journal, those terms would include removing the ban, the Huawei ban that is currently in place, and also, Beijing wants all punitive tariffs to be lifted. Now, ahead of the meeting, the President still was talking up the idea of future tariffs when he spoke with you yesterday. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Look, we have lost billions and billions and trillions of dollars with China, right? We're now taking in billions and billions of dollars, and I've only done phase one. Phase one is 25 percent on $250 billion. I haven't done phase two yet.</p><p>Now, phase two doesn't have to be 25 percent, it could be 10 percent, which people can absolutely handle. But our people aren't going to pay for that either.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: This will be the first meeting between President Trump and President Xi, since both met last year, at the G7, November, December, in Argentina. You remember, Maria, leading up to that sit-down dinner between the two.</p><p>There was all of this discussion, all of these talks about tariffs and what would happen next. Those two met and then the tariffs were put on hold, coming into this. The President is, once again, talking about tariffs. But now we are learning that Xi Jinping is set to present the President with terms that might stop all of that, potentially.</p><p>But you've got to wonder to the flipside of that, if this is what China wants and the U.S. agrees to it, what might the U.S. get out of the equation? Remember, we heard from the Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, leading into these talks that about 90 percent of the deal was done before China backed away as the U.S. sees it.</p><p>So, that is, sort of, the stage that is set as the President is here, in Osaka, Japan, to begin the G20 summit. Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, we know how the President feels about tariffs. He's called himself a tariff man, yesterday, when I asked him about --</p><p>BURMAN: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- what's Plan B, if you don't get a deal? He said (INAUDIBLE) Plan A, there's Plan B, and that is continuing the tariffs.</p><p>BURMAN: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And he even threw out the fact yesterday, saying, you know what? It doesn't have to be 25 percent. It could be 10 percent on that $300 billion, so --</p><p>BURMAN: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: With the Chinese saying, look, we want all the tariffs lifted, that's a big step. It probably will require China to do a lot, as well.</p><p>BURMAN: That's like going home, Maria, and saying, you know, to my wife, I want the dishes done, I want the trash taken out and I want all of this. She might look back and me and say, well, what do I get out of it? Right?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>BURMAN: You know, they're going to bring their -- they're going to bring their terms, they're going to bring what they want. But the U.S. side --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>BURMAN: -- is going to have to get something in return, if the U.S. were to agree to that, and keep in mind, in the lead-up to all of this, senior administration officials were saying that if nothing happened at all, the President would still be, as they put it, comfortable.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>BURMAN: So President Trump walking into this comfortable with tariff, as China is clearly trying to dial it back a notch.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Blake, thank you. We'll be watching, big weekend for you, Blake Burman joining us in Osaka, Japan this morning. And joining me right now, Texas Congressman Michael Burgess, he's in Washington this morning, and Congressman, it's good to see you this morning, your reaction to what we're hearing here, that the Chinese want all the tariffs lifted?</p><p>REP. MICHAEL BURGESS (R-TX): Well, the good news is that the talks are going on. I -- like you, concerned that the last time they thought they were -- the president thought he was closed to a closure (ph) on this, and the parameters all changed rather rapidly. I think, in fact, I was on your show the day after that happened, so that was startling.</p><p>So, we know these things can take stops and starts. But the good news is that they are -- it looks like they're on again and they're talking, and that's a positive step.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. So, we'll see what comes out of this. I assume you agree the president is likely not to agree to any deal or agree to lifting tariffs, if unless, the Chinese agree to stop stealing intellectual property from the west.</p><p>BURGESS: I would think that would have to be the opening -- the opening start.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly, all right. Let me move on to the excitement of last night. Democratic presidential candidates took to the stage last night, trading barbs on healthcare, taxes and the economy. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. BETO O'ROURKE (D-TX), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This economy has got to work for everyone. And right now, we know that it isn't. I would support a tax rate and a tax code that is fair to everyone. Tax capital --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Seventy percent?</p><p>O'ROURKE: -- the same rate that you tax ordinary income. Take that corporate tax rate up to 28 percent.</p><p>SEN. CORY BOOKER (D-NJ), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This economy is not working for average Americans.</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: There are a lot of politicians who say, oh, it's just not possible, we just can't do it, have a lot of political reasons for this. What they're really telling you is they just won't fight for it. Well, healthcare is a basic human right.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congressman, your reaction to what you heard last night?</p><p>BURGESS: Did I just hear Beto O'Rourke advocate for the Steve Forbes flat tax?</p><p>BARTIROMO: It sounded like it.</p><p>BURGESS: So, it was -- you know, I -- of course, I work in the United States House of Representatives, the Democrats are the majority. I hear their arguments for things all day long. But even coming from that environment, I was startled last night by, really, how far-left the Democratic Party has moved and it was -- the president said it was boring.</p><p>I would say, perhaps, it was a little concerning to me, just exactly how far left they have moved on some of these things. Look, I did think the whole process was unfair to Elizabeth Warren. She's the frontrunner on the stage and it was -- it was hard for her to get any words in.</p><p>But the entirety of the night, it was just who can go further left of the person who just spoke. And it's an odd process. I know we went through a 16-candidate process --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>BURGESS: -- on the Republican side, four years ago, but there's just got to be a better way to do this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you think that's going to fly with the American people come 2020? These ideals of, really, socialism, when you look at Medicare for All or when you look at - well, Elizabeth Warren, wants a wealth tax, 70 percent rate.</p><p>BURGESS: I don't, but I'll be honest with you, I did not think there was any way the Republicans could lose the majority of the House of Representatives with the economy doing as well as it was, in 2018 --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>BURGESS: And clearly, I was wrong on that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, that's a good point (ph).</p><p>BURGESS: What I was seeing last night -- we get round two tonight, but it's -- I would use the word, concerning, how far left -- and everyone who spoke got a little farther to the left. I served with several of the -- of the folks who were on the stage. I know Jay Inslee and --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Sure.</p><p>BURGESS: -- he was not surprising. I didn't know the gentleman from Maryland that well. He actually had the only, sort of, reasonable comments during the night. But obviously, that was not the -- that was not the coin of the realm.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We're looking at a number of movers this morning, Rite Aid, Boeing, we're going to get to that in a moment, but I got to get your take on the border crisis. Attorneys are filing a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging the children are being held in detention centers and they are being mistreated.</p><p>This, as Bank of America says it will stop lending to companies that do business with the detention centers. Your Senate colleagues passed $4.6- billion aid package for migrants at the border, after failing to pass the House bill earlier in the week. Tell me your reaction to all of these and where you see this going.</p><p>BURGESS: When they said detention centers, I don't know what they're talking about. Obviously, people who are picked up on the border are taking to a Customs and Border Protection facility. That is the law. That's what Congress requires them to do.</p><p>Children are not supposed to stay there longer than 72 hours. The reason that some have, is because the receiving facility, the next facility that should be involved is Department of Health and Human Services, and because of the funding constraints, their beds are -- they have a -- they have a bed problem. They need -- they need space. They need capacity. And they can't take a child out of Customs and Border Protection and move them to HHS, unless there's a bed there.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, which is why I'm questioning this whole Wayfair thing, you know, the employees walking out of Wayfair, because they don't want Wayfair to provide the beds. I mean, who are you hurting?</p><p>BURGESS: Well, there is a distinction. In Customs and Border Protection, we require them. They're there to protect the country. That's what we've asked them to do. Health and Human Services is there to provide care for the children until they get settled in whatever their next location is.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>BURGESS: That's also under law that Congress has provided. I think the funding part of this has really been mystifying because the president asked for this May 1st.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>BURGESS: So it's not a surprise.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. They said they didn't want any more beds, by the way, the Dems, your colleagues on the left said, no more beds, you're at capacity, leave it there. And, of course, these centers are being overwhelmed. Congressman, it's good to see you, lot of insights from you, we appreciate it.</p><p>BURGESS: All right. Thanks very much.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you, Congressman Burgess there. More trouble for Boeing, as I mentioned, another software issue has been discovered in the 737 Max jet, Cheryl Casone on headlines now, Cheryl?</p><p>CASONE: Yes, Maria, here we go. The Federal Aviation Administration has found a flaw that could push the plane's nose down automatically. Fixing the problem will likely delay the 737's return to service through late summer, following two deadly crashes.</p><p>Boeing says it agrees with the FAA, and it's working to address the problem. Again, this could be past Labor Day, folks, Boeing shares, lower in the premarket, down about four percent. That is a loss of almost 15 bucks. There is Boeing, folks (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>All right, the FCC is investigating Sinclair Broadcast Group, the agency reportedly concerned it was misled during Sinclair's unsuccessful attempt to buy Tribune Media last year. This is according to a report in the Wall Street Journal. Nexstar Media is set to buy Tribune, in a deal valued at $4.1 billion. That is pending FCC approval right now.</p><p>Well, Amazon is adding another option for customers to get packages from them. They're picking them up at Rite Aid stores. Yes, you can pick your stuff up at Rite Aid. Amazon's shoppers can pick up purchases at the specialized counters in more than 1,500 Rite Aid locations by the end of this year.</p><p>And mid-July shaping up to be a wall shopping delight, Wal-Mart, the latest retailer to announce some special deals aimed at taking on Amazon's Prime Day, the sale from July 14th through the 17th, hopes to steal some Amazon's thunder Prime Day, starts on July 15th. A great idea is always one to be stolen, and it has been, Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: There you go. Cheryl, thank you.</p><p>CASONE: You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Join us in the 8:00 a.m. hour, I'll be speaking with the chief security officer of Huawei Technologies, he is here this morning, so don't miss this important interview, coming up, right in the middle of the meeting between the U.S. and China, on these new terms that Xi Jinping apparently is going to present to the President.</p><p>Coming up, the tariff threat, big companies claiming that they'll be hit hardest during the holidays, the numbers coming up next, and then hidden talent, Attorney General William Barr busts out the bagpipes, his amazing performance, right after this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Big show this morning, coming up, Huawei Technologies Chief Security Officer is with us this morning, Andy Purdy, my special guest, coming up.</p><p>Former Presidential Envoy to Iraq and former National Commission on Terrorism, Chairman Paul Bremer, joining us this morning, along with the co-host of \"THE FIVE\" Juan Williams, weighing in also. Don't miss a moment of it. We've got a big 2-1/2 hours coming up.</p><p>And we're talking trade and tariffs right now, Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo, joining the list of companies opposing China tariffs.</p><p>The three, saying in a statement, while we appreciate the administration's efforts to protect U.S. intellectual property and preserve U.S. high-tech leadership, the disproportionate harm caused by these tariffs to U.S. consumers and businesses will undermine, not advance, these goals.</p><p>The companies say that the tariffs could cost American consumers $840 million this holiday season. President Trump is set to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Saturday, during the G20 summit in Japan. And yesterday, I spoke with the President in an exclusive interview right here. Here's what he said about a potential trade deal and those tariffs.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you think that they can do anything, you could hear anything from this meeting on Saturday, with Xi Jinping that would push you to put that aside and not put that remaining $325 billion in products on tariff?</p><p>TRUMP: No, it's possible. It's absolutely possible.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What could he say?</p><p>TRUMP: We have to get a good deal. Look, they have taken advantage of us, as a country, for so long, they're so far ahead. On average, this country is losing more than $500 billion a year with China. We've rebuilt China. They've done a great job. They're smart. They're genius. They're great.</p><p>But you know what? They're so far ahead, what they've done to us. And primarily, I said they've done well with Europe, they've done well. But what the money they make with us, I mean, if I do what I'm doing, we totally cut that off. We totally cut it off. There's no more $500 billion. It will go down to a trickle.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining the conversation this morning, FOX Business Network's Dagen McDowell, the Washington Examiner Commentary Writer and Editor, Siraj Hashmi, and FOX News Contributor, The Hill Columnist, Liz Peek, great to see everybody this morning.</p><p>LIZ PEEK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good morning.</p><p>SIRAJ HASHMI, COMMENTARY WRITER AND EDITOR, WASHINGTON EXAMINER: Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good morning to you.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. You know, when I see those statements -- that statement from American companies, it makes me feel like it's more of the same over these last couple of decades, where American companies were so interested in selling to the 1.4 billion person population of China, they forgot to protect their own products.</p><p>You know, the U.S. administration sees this as an a national security risk, I don't know that the CEOs are really understanding that.</p><p>PEEK: Well, they also wanted to access cheap labor, I mean, let's face it. American corporations and, by the way, they were bashed last night, incessantly, during the Democratic debates, I don't want to pile on.</p><p>But the truth is, they have enabled our situation now, where we are so dependent on China, I mean, why didn't any of these companies think to diversify their resources, their supply chains, when China came increasingly authoritarian and, you know, basically stealing their property, I mean, it's amazing the story, really.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It really is.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But, if it is a national security issue, the President needs to hit that harder than he has been --</p><p>PEEK: Yes, I agree.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- rather than talking about we're losing money to China. The half a billion dollars he's talking about is a trade deficit.</p><p>PEEK: Right, which a lot of people disagree.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. From an accounting perspective, it's not a loss, number one, and ultimately, Americans will feel these tariffs. They might not feel a lot of them, but, again, it illustrates that we do bear the cost as a nation. China doesn't pay these tariffs, we do.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Secretary Pompeo has been pretty significantly, you know, consistent on this national security risk. You're right. The President keeps bringing up the trade issue.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But, it's the President who does -- who is anywhere, everyone and on Twitter, all day long, particularly on the weekend. He needs to do a better job of messaging that.</p><p>HASHMI: One of the interesting things about this video game, particular issue, is that President Trump, actually, after the Parkland shooting, blamed the video games as the reason for all this violence, so if these tariffs, sort of, prevent American families from getting more video games, that actually will work in his favor.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We've got an impact on markets right now with these headlines, China wants the U.S. to lift the ban on Huawei, and as a result we're seeing a real --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We want to show you a developing situation this morning. Futures are down. There is news today from the Wall Street Journal, that China wants the Huawei ban lifted, as well as punitive tariffs off. The Dow Futures right now, down 86 points. S&amp;P Futures are still up 3-1/2 and the NASDAQ Futures, up 15 points.</p><p>But let's take a look at what the Journal is reporting, because I want to get your take on this. President Trump set with terms, the U.S. should meet before Beijing is ready to settle a market rattling trade confrontation, according to the Wall Street Journal.</p><p>Chinese officials with knowledge of the plan are insisting that the U.S. remove its ban on the sale of U.S. technology to Chinese telecom giant, Huawei Technologies, Liz, your reaction?</p><p>PEEK: Well, I think Xi is -- President Xi is coming into this meeting being very tough, so is President Trump. On your program yesterday, he declared that he is perfectly happy with tariffs and he might raise them more. So, I think both of them are coming together. I assume both want a trade deal.</p><p>Look, President Xi is seeing his economy slip. He's got problems in Hong Kong. His authority is being tested, as not before, in his tenure as head of state. I just think this is a negotiating position. And it's not going to happen, by the way.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I don't think it's going to happen either. Go ahead, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So, Beijing also wants the U.S. to lift all punitive tariffs, drop efforts to get China to buy even more U.S. exports than Beijing said it would, when the two leaders met last December. However, the Journal reports Xi Jinping is not expected to take a confrontational tone with President Trump. This is a back to square one.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It really is.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's why that other network totally fouled up the Steven Mnuchin interview, with the 90 percent done on the trade deal. Wrong. This is -- this moment one. This is the starting point.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's exactly right. And the 90 percent was back in April. Yes, they were 90 percent there, maybe, back in April, before the Chinese reneged.</p><p>MCDOWELL: This is a five percent.</p><p>HASHMI: Since we're back to square one, maybe President Trump can go after China for the human rights abuses, specifically the Uyghur Muslims in the Xinjiang province and the 1 million plus of them who are in re-education camps.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You make a great point. Yes, the Chinese have been rounding up Muslims and putting them in these camps.</p><p>PEEK: Oh, it's horrifying.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And then they're being guarded with guns.</p><p>PEEK: That's not -- there's so many infringements of human rights going on in China --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly.</p><p>PEEK: -- right now, it's staggering. But that, I don't think is Trump's number one concern.</p><p>BARTIROMO: No.</p><p>PEEK: I think Trump's number one concern is changing the way they do business, and you know what? This isn't a very good opener.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But the markets' concerns have been China, tariffs and the Federal Reserve. I spoke with (INAUDIBLE) Hodges Capital Management, Craig Hodges. And here's what he said he's looking at in terms of driving markets right now.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: We've got $1-1/2 billion under management. You've got to put that money to work, in what has become a confusing market. Are you looking for growth in terms of the market right now, still?</p><p>CRAIG HODGES, FOUNDER, HODGES CAPITAL MANAGEMENT: Yes, growth is where it's at, of course, but what's surprising in the market today, you can find growth stories that trade at value prices. There's a lot of that. There's been -- it's kind of a have and have not market.</p><p>And, you know, we're (INAUDIBLE) at Hodges Capital, we do about, you know, 2,600 company touches over about 800 different companies, and we're finding ideas that are, you know, like a -- like a -- let's say a Norwegian cruise line that should grow 12, 15 percent, that's trading around 10 times earnings.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow, that's a good opportunity.</p><p>HODGES: Yes. There are a lot of those. And, you know, my favorite idea out there right now is commercial metals which, you know, the steel business, which I know in your interview with President Trump, he talked about the steel, how much better it's doing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>HODGES: There's a company that has a 50 percent share of the rebar market, of course, rebar goes into construction, roads, bridges and such, a little company with a $2 billion market cap that has a 50 percent share of that. And the chances are over the next year, we'll have an infrastructure bill through, and that's going to benefit, and that stock is trading around six times earnings.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow, six times earnings.</p><p>HODGES: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That is low.</p><p>HODGES: Just incredibly cheap. And so, there's parts of the market that are very forgotten, that are kind of left for dead, and that's where Hodges Capital, where we're focused.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Which is a really big opportunity for stock picker and for someone who's actually looking for specific ideas. Let's talk, before we get to ideas, about the broader market --</p><p>HODGES: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Because the Federal Reserve, potentially, cutting interest rates has become a big theme. Is that what you're expecting?</p><p>HODGES: Yes, you know, I don't know that I know how to handicap it. I mean, you can listen to people, and just about 50 percent say they're going to cut, 50 percent say they probably aren't, they're kind of (INAUDIBLE) when they're not. To us, it really doesn't matter.</p><p>If the volatility, which I know we'll have volatility, if the volatility presents itself, we'll go in and buy companies -- good companies that go on sale. So, the positive is that rates are low, that's going to stimulate the economy and whether it's this month or here in six months, what they do, I don't know that it has a whole lot of effect.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But the backdrop feels good to you, right?</p><p>HODGES: It does.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Because you're talking about unemployment at a 51-year low, 3.1 percent economic growth in the first quarter. We're about to start earnings season. What kind of an earnings period are you expecting for the second quarter?</p><p>HODGES: I think it will be a little disappointing and that you're seeing most of -- most of the management teams we're talking to. They're using the tariff situation as a way to bring down expectations a little bit. I think they're do -- going to do some under-promising and over-delivering is what the hope is.</p><p>So, maybe a little bit of an adjustment. But like you said, the economy is in -- is in a good strong place, full employment, low rates, and surprisingly, investor sentiment is not that great. You know, the markets close to highs but every time the market should get to highs, optimism should be out there, we don't have that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>HODGES: So, I think that that's a positive.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Market climbing a wall of worry again. Right?</p><p>HODGES: Absolutely, absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO: As this the old saying that we always used to say.</p><p>HODGES: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK, then, there's China. So, the president's headed to Japan. He's got to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Saturday. Anything coming out of that, that you think could be a market mover.</p><p>HODGES: Yes, I think expectations are very low that something will happen. So, if surprisingly something happens, I think that will be extremely bullish for the market, of course, the market hates the uncertainty.</p><p>So, if nothing's done, you'll probably get more volatility. You'll probably have some -- you know, some five percent corrections along the way.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But that's not going to just wait you, you're still looking for those growers.</p><p>HODGES: Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. So, you mentioned one, where else are the growth stories in the market today?</p><p>HODGES: You know, a lot of the some retailers that have really been hit hard like a restoration hardware, it's another one that trades below its growth rate.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I like that company.</p><p>HODGES: Yes, and you know, it's come down from 150 into the 110 area. Had -- just had a great quarter. Capri is a stock that's come off about that's been cut in half this year.</p><p>It's still growing around 15 percent trading around eight times earnings. So, there are parts of that you can find growth. And you're not having to pay crazy multiples.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, you want to buy into this whole notion that things are slowing now.</p><p>HODGES: Yes, I think it's evident that it's slowing, but not dramatically. Things are still good. The thing that Trump has done, it's given company executives a lot more optimism, a lot more opportunities. You know, the eight years of Obama, we'd have companies come in and say, you know, this is an anti-business president.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But?</p><p>HODGES: It's the opposite with Trump. These executives feel like Trump is actually working for them. And I think he really is --</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes -- he, that was Craig Hodges with Hodges Capital Management. The news of the morning, of course, is the news coming out of the Wall Street Journal about the terms that China is setting in terms of getting any agreements with the U.S. Markets are moving on that. We'll take a short break. When we come back, we're looking at big tech. President Trump hints that the U.S. could bring legal action against companies such as Facebook, Google, over online bias. That's next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Thursday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, June 27th. Your top stories right now. 6:35 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>\"BREAKING NEWS\" this morning. President Trump arriving in Japan for the G20 summit. A short time ago, Chinese officials say President Xi Jinping will present President Trump with terms for settling the trade fight. This is according to The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>We want to bring you the terms. The terms include lifting the ban on Huawei and lifting all punitive damages. Lifting all of the tariffs, and not forcing Beijing to buy a significant additional amount of goods from the U.S.</p><p>In the 8:00 a.m. hour this morning, I'll be speaking with Huawei Technologies chief security officer Andy Purdy. We're going to talk about why this is one of the terms of the Chinese government that the ban is lifted on Huawei.</p><p>Markets this morning, a mix. Take a look at the Dow Industrials lower this morning, 67 points, following the trade news this morning from The Wall Street Journal that President Trump is going to talk with Xi Jinping, and Xi Jinping is going to present these terms.</p><p>Yesterday, the market ended mixed and really little change. Take a look, when all was set and down, the DowIndustrials were down 11 points, even though in the morning the market was trading on a false report about being 90 percent there. Most people recognize that, that was not true.</p><p>The S&amp;P was down 3-1/2 points yesterday. And the Nasdaq was up 25. The Dow and the S&amp;P ended near session lows pairing gains in the last half hour of trading. European Indices this morning look like this. FT-100 down 33, CAC Quarante down, 19. The DAX Index lower by three points.</p><p>And in Asia, overnight markets rallied on the US-China trade optimism. Hang Seng Index was up almost 1-1/2 percent.</p><p>There is more trouble for Boeing this morning. A new software problem has been found in the 737 MAX. The stock taken a hit in the pre-market down five percent. That's an issue obviously for the Dow Jones Industrial Average as well. Boeing shares down better than five percent again this morning.</p><p>Then, there is Bitcoin, sliding after a big rally recently. The cryptocurrency pulling back following the recent rapid rise. We're taking a look at what's causing this down 761 right now.</p><p>Barr's bagpipes. Check this out. We've got the Attorney General's surprise performance rocking the house. All of that coming up this morning.</p><p>But looking at big technology this morning. President Trump slammed Google and Facebook yesterday. In my exclusive interview, the U.S. could bring legal action over alleged bias, said the president.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Look, we should be suing Google and Facebook and all that, which perhaps we will, OK? But, you see or Apple, they're suing Apple for billions of dollars. They're suing everybody. They make it very almost impossible to do two-way business.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>TRUMP: So, what happened, I said folks, they are worse than China, except smaller. It's smaller than China, but they're worse than China.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg endorsed federal privacy legislation, meanwhile, and greater regulation of political advertising yesterday at the Aspen Ideas Festival in Colorado.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, FACEBOOK: Look in the absence of regulation on some of these things, we're going to do the best that we can and build up very sophisticated systems to be able to handle these issues. But at the end of the day, I don't think that, that is necessarily the ideal state that we all want to be in. I think, we would be better off if we had a more robust democratic process setting the rules on how we wanted to arbitrate and draw some of the trade-offs between a lot of these values that we hold dear.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining us right now is the founder and chief analyst at disruptive tech research, Lou Basenese. Good to see you, Lou. Thanks so much for being here.</p><p>LOU BASENESE, FOUNDER OF DISRUPTIVE TECH RESEARCH: Good to be here, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What do you think? Do you think the U.S. government is going to sue some of these companies?</p><p>BASENESE: Look, I think its verbal intervention for now. I mean, President Trump is saying not that he's going to, but that we should. And I think he's keeping him -- keeping him accountable, keeping him guessing what he's going to do next. I mean, I think it's the adage I grew up it was, trust your mother, but cut the deck.</p><p>So, he's trusting that they're going to be accountable, but threaten verbal (INAUDIBLE), threat actual suit. I mean, it's happening in Europe, I mean it wouldn't be unprecedented.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I don't even think the president or this administration trusts, by the way. The social media companies. Dagen, you've reported a lot on the fact that they have all of this terrible content and they've been so slow to take the content down. But it's even more than that. They are censoring conservative conversation. We've seen evidence of that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: When in doubt, blame the algorithm. That is the message out of -- out of social media companies and Silicon Valley. One thing that I keep pointing out as well is these social media companies have legal cover. They are not considered media companies in the eye of the law -- in the eyes of the law, and they cannot be sued for defamation.</p><p>They have this goes back to a law that was passed in the 90s kind of that the -- at the real beginnings of the growth in the Internet. And I think that if somebody really wants to put the hammer down on these companies, that's something you take -- you take aim at. And you're going to hear a lot more of this from say, Elizabeth Warren as these debates pick up steam, as the Democrats really try to make a name for themselves. So, they're in agreement with Trump on this.</p><p>HASHMI: Interesting you bring up Elizabeth Warren in March. She had a post that was taken down on the Facebook, calling for the breakup of Facebook. And also, Google who's you know, obviously, the subject of this conversation.</p><p>In the past year, they have to pay a $1.7 billion fine to the European Union for antitrust violations. So, the Department of Justice looking into this. It's a -- it's a big deal.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BASENESE: Right, Facebook -- Yes, and Facebook is facing what? Maybe a $5 billion fine which would be record fine from the FTC. Look, self- regulation does not work with social media. I think you've said it like it's become the algorithm. And that we blame it on the algorithm. There's been no responsibility, you've seen Mark Zuckerberg come before Congress multiple times and he makes a half-hearted apology but makes more excuses.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PEEK: Right, yes, and he calls for regulation knowing that that's the best thing that could happen to Facebook. Because A, Congress has no idea how to cut -- how to regulate these companies.</p><p>BASENESE: Right.</p><p>PEEK: And the bigger you are, the more protected you are from any kind of regulation, which will completely clobber newcomers startups et cetera that might challenge you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And when I said to the president yesterday, I said, \"Listen, Mr. President, would you rather see competition coming to this market, would that fix the problem? Or do you want to actually see legislation?\"</p><p>He said, \"I think, we need legislation to see competition.\"</p><p>BASENESE: Yes, I would agree. I mean, look at what Facebook's done. I mean, we know now know that they were using monitoring software to figure out to acquire WhatsApp early. They knew that it was going to be the next big social media network and they pounced on that. That they're using the network and the data that they have to their ultimate advantage. It's anticompetitive.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But they -- but they again, for month after month, over a period of over a year, people were committing murders and committing suicide on their live video streaming service.</p><p>BASENESE: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And that you had the massacre in New Zealand. That video was up for roughly an hour after the massacre started. So, again, they're concerned about making money growing their business, but they really don't give a flying you-know-what about people committing murder.</p><p>BASENESE: I agree with --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: There was a man who killed his child on Facebook and that was over a year ago.</p><p>BASENESE: Well, here is my thing. They can figure out everything else. They can figure out all your preferences. But you're telling me that they can't spend billions of dollars to figure out how to keep that content offline. I'm sorry, I just don't buy that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I don't want too.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, what do you like -- what do you want to do with these stocks at this point. I mean, let's say is as an investor, you own these stocks.</p><p>BASENESE: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It will in -- incoming legislation, hurt the prices.</p><p>BASENESE: Look, I would tell you history is instructive here. Facebook really hasn't gotten hurt as a stock because of the threat of regulation. Last July, it got hit the hardest because of a revenue warning. So, we've talked about this before, it's profits over principles in Facebook. And for most investors, they're turning a blind eye to this. I think they --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: But doesn't increase legislation or regulation, doesn't that mean that it's going to cost the more money? Doesn't that impact profits?</p><p>BASENESE: Yes. But I mean, you think about Facebook makes 30 bucks per user in revenue. I mean, you said it, Liz, like they're fighting the fight of we're just going to drag this out. Regulation is going to take a long time, we'll just play -- we'll play good citizen and we'll see how long it takes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, all right. We will leave it there. It's good to have you this morning, Lou.</p><p>BASENESE: Thanks, Maria. I appreciate it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much, Lou Basenese. Let me ask you, you know for a long time, Huawei has been saying, look, we're not attached to the Chinese government. Right? We're not being told to spy on anybody from the People's Liberation Army.</p><p>And yet here you have Xi Jinping, saying he wants the ban on Huawei lifted as part of any agreement with the U.S.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And there's a story. Just -- I don't know if this is exclusively Bloomberg, but Huawei personnel worked with China's military on research.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, but that's just came out this morning. I think that's going to be big news.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's right.</p><p>HASHMI: The same deal with Alibaba. People didn't think they were -- people thought they're independent of the Chinese government. And later developed that they were actually (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>PEEK: Look, there's a -- there was a 2017 law passed in China, saying every company had to be responsible to help intelligence gathering.</p><p>HASHMI: Yes. OK, well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I mean it's no secret that Huawei has worked with the military. I mean, there is something called civil-military fusion. Where when you have an innovation in China, first, it goes to the military to see that it can be applied they're -- then, it can be use (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HASHMI: Different. Different that -- it's different being in a remote studio where you're just like --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: There are a lot of microphones going on right now, guys.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Somebody needs to turn the (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK, we're going to take a short break, and take a look of the democratic debate when we come back. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- military to see that it can be applied there, then it can be used.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's different being in a remote studio where you're just like.</p><p>BARTIROMO: There are a lot of microphones going on right now guys. OK, we're going to take a short break and take a look at the Democratic debate when we come back stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The Notre Dame fire investigation revealing that the inferno was probably sparked by an accident. Cheryl Casone with the headlines right now, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: There had been suspicions about this, Maria. Prosecutors say that there is no evidence the fire was deliberately started. So, among the possible causes, a power failure or possibly a cigarette. The April 15th fire destroyed Notre Dame's (INAUDIBLE) and the wooden beams supporting the roof. French President Emmanuel Macron wants the cathedral restored by 2024, in time for the Paris Summer Olympics. There had been construction going on at the same time, we should add here.</p><p>Pier One imports closing more stores this year than originally planned. The retailer is looking to close 57 locations, 12 more than it announced back in April. And the CEO says there could be more to come. The company posted its seventh straight sales decline last quarter. Same store sales falling 13 percent.</p><p>And an impressive performance from Attorney General William Barr who surprised the U.S. Attorney's National Conference with his hidden talent. Turns out the nation's top law enforcement guy plays the bagpipes.</p><p>CASONE: The crowd gave him, Maria, a standing ovation and we should add that he was playing with the pipes and drums bag pipers on the stage from the NYPD. So, it's a pretty cool moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I love it. Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Coming up --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Name that song!</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Careless whisper.</p><p>MCDOWELL: No.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Well, we have the first night of the Democratic debate last night, did you watch it? A look at what's trending. Plus, the microphone glitch. Wait until you see what happened. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The first 2020 Democratic presidential debate. Lauren Simonetti with what's trending this morning and the details on a microphone glitch last night. That was horrible.</p><p>SIMONETTI: It was. It was embarrassing. It's always funny that what is exactly trending and what people talk about and this is an exchange that they certainly talked about. A hot mic issues. Let's watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RACHEL MADDOW, HOST, MSNBC: What's happening?</p><p>CHUCK TODD, HOST, MSNBC: We are hearing our colleagues' audio. If the control room could turn off the mic. If the control room could turn off the mics of our previous moderators, we will --</p><p>MADDOW: You know, we prepared for everything. We did not prepare for this.</p><p>TODD: Guess what, guys, we are going to take a quick break.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI: They tossed to commercial break. But unfortunately, Savannah Guthrie and Lester Holt's mics were open when they were done, and they coming up on Chuck Todd's question to Elizabeth Warren. Donald Trump having fun with this. One of two tweets sent last night: \"NBC News and MSNBC should be ashamed of themselves for having such a horrible technical breakdown,\" he on, \"truly unprofessional and only worthy of a fake news organization, which they are.\"</p><p>Google trends show that most people searched for Tulsi Gabbard, the Iraq war veteran and the Hawaii congresswoman, across the nation, probably because nobody knows who she is nationwide and she also had the least amount of time to speak. Something her sister tweeted about saying: \"Well, NBC must love Elizabeth Warren because she's having the most amount of time to speak.\" The number two candidate was Cory Booker. Interesting, look at the red part. We know him here as a New Jersey senator in the northeast but the southern part of the country not sure who Cory Booker is. And odd they that Elizabeth Warren was also searched. But it could be for a variety of reasons, why viewers are looking up these candidates.</p><p>And finally, we had fun with it. Bars offering all sorts of promotions and drinking games, like every time you hear the word impeach, drink up; no border wall, drink up. They should include \"free\" on that list. The word \"free,\" right?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, Elizabeth Warren did get the bulk of time.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Yes, she did get a lot of time. If you ask who the winner was last night, you know, ten down, ten to go, who won in the first round, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker I thought did really well and also Julian Castro -- he had a specific answer on immigration and his exchange with Beto O'Rourke who basically comes out very shallow, where are his policies?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Beto is (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>SIMONETTI: Beto is (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>MCDOWELL: But he looked like he had eaten bad sushi for dinner. He wasn't sure what was about to happen.</p><p>SIMONETTI: And what was that that came out with his opening line was in Spanish. I mean, you're trying to get the Spanish voters.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The Spanish was just too much.</p><p>MCDOWELL: A little bit pandering.</p><p>PEEK: But that's kind of who he is, you know. The dental thing -- when he's videotaping himself -- it's about himself and showboating. I mean, and I think voters are done with that.</p><p>SIMONETTI: All-in, they were boring as the president said: \"We need a (INAUDIBLE) Ted, or like boring --\"</p><p>BARTIROMO: Gracias.</p><p>SIMONETTI: De nada, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Breaking news, new reports that China wants the Huawei ban lifted and the punitive tariffs removed. These are the terms if China's going to agree to any deal. The president has arrived in Osaka, Japan for the G20 meeting.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Good Tuesday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, August 6th, your top stories, right now, 8:00 a.m. on the button on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Markets are poised for a gain at the start of trading this morning, of course, we are not all the way back from that horrible sell-off yesterday, but the Dow Futures right now, up 257 points, S&amp;P Futures up 28, and the NASDAQ Futures up 90 points, after a broad-based sell-off yesterday, which was sparked by the Chinese Yuan, falling to an 11-year low against the dollar.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Dow, the NASDAQ, and the S&amp;P seeing their worst day of the year, yesterday, with the Dow down 767 points, 3 percent, S&amp;P was down almost 3 percent as well, and the NASDAQ down 278 points, 3-1/2 percent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Global markets, this morning, are certainly bouncing after yesterday's declines. In Germany, factory orders rebounded, rising 2-1/2 percent that was higher than economists were expecting, and the DAX Index in Germany right now, is up 68 points, that's two-thirds of one percent.</p><p>In Asia overnight, it was red across the board, but also here, well off of the session lows, with the Shanghai composite down 1-1/2 percent, when all was said and done.</p><p>The U.S.-China trade turmoil continues and it has turned into a currency war. The U.S. has designated China, a currency manipulator, after letting the Yuan depreciate, an accusation that Beijing is denying, more and what it all means for the economy, trade negotiations and your money.</p><p>Big technology was hit hard by China trade worries yesterday, the sector seeing the heaviest selling of all industries, Facebook, Apple, Netflix, Google parent company, Alphabet, and chip maker Nvidia, among the big losers where Nvidia was down 6-1/2 percent on the session, the others down 3-1/2 percent, where they are headed from here, we are taking a look.</p><p>The Fed four, former Federal Reserve chairmen, coming together to say why America needs an independent Fed, we've got that op-ed this morning, you are talking about it, all those coming up this Tuesday morning.</p><p>And joining me to break it all down, FOX Business Network's Dagen McDowell, FOX Business Network's Deirdre Bolton, and Forbes Media chairman, former Republican presidential candidate, Steve Forbes, great to see everybody today.</p><p>STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA: Good to be with you.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good to see you.</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We have a busy show. We want to also tell you who's joining the conversation this morning, because we've got the chief economic adviser of Allianz, Mohamed El-Erian, joining us this morning, to talk markets and investing, and what's happening with China.</p><p>Also, Alpha One Capital Partners founding partner, Dan Niles, he is an expert on technology and we're really interested in getting his views in terms of where tech goes from here after that sharp sell-off yesterday on the China story.</p><p>Texas Congressman Michael Burgess is here, and host of Varney &amp; Company, Stuart Varney weighs in, as well, don't miss a moment of it. And, of course, we know that this was a severe selling yesterday because of the China-U.S. trade.</p><p>It doesn't look like a deal is happening anytime soon, I've, sort of, given up on that. I'm not expecting a deal.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Our viewers so smart. Somebody tweeted the show and said, it seems like, irrational reaction to a 10 percent tariff on $300 billion in imported goods, is $30 billion. Why would the market sell-off like this?</p><p>But, you know, panics aren't rational, and it doesn't take much when a market is very overvalued, price to perfection, where you have assets around the globe that are like that on top of a very leveraged economy here, there, and everywhere.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's a good point.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And so, what was unnerving yesterday, was what was going on currencies overseas, where you have, entities, companies, say, in China, and even South Korea, when their currency drops, you -- they have dollar denominated or foreign currency denominated debt and they're trying to repay those debts. And who are the lenders? They're like banks and institutions outside of China and South Korea.</p><p>There could be in the U.S. and they could be in Europe, so that's where you start getting into -- you're trying to repay these debts denominated in foreign currencies with their own currency that's falling in value. That's how you get a financial crisis. That's what was going on yesterday.</p><p>We're not there, but if you're wondering why you would see the 10-year yield drop, the low, before President Trump was even -- before his election as president. That's what was happening. That was the concern in the market.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And don't forget, the impact of the stronger dollar, I mean, look, and putting the China story for a second, the implications of a stronger dollar, weaker foreign products --</p><p>BOLTON: It's harder for our manufacturers --</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- weaker commodities, so all of this is playing out and we're seeing a reaction from investors. The president just tweeted about this, by the way.</p><p>Here's what the president just said, massive amounts of money from China and other parts of the world, pouring into the United States for reasons of safety, investment and interest rates. We are in a very strong position. Companies are also coming to the U.S. in big numbers, a beautiful thing to watch.</p><p>Maybe, but yesterday, certainly, was anything but beautiful, with that market down 800 points. Steve.</p><p>FORBES: Well, this gets to the whole uncertainty about what -- if you are going to make an investment, you have to know what the rules of the road are. And in terms of the tariffs, they raised the cost of doing business because it affects profit margins.</p><p>So, it's the uncertainty where this is going to head. Are we going to have tariffs on autos and the like, which would be devastating for Europe, so yes, money is coming in, just as it has in the past when you have a crisis, but we have to be aware of, though, is the dollar isn't so much getting stronger as it is, other currencies are getting weaker.</p><p>We don't know what happened in the 70s, it was almost a race to the bottom. We had a terrible decade. I don't think it's going to happen this time, but it's a danger out there. The market has to discount it.</p><p>BOLTON: Yes, yesterday was a game -- I mean, Goldman, for what it's worth, saying no trade deal between U.S. and China before 2020, and three Fed rate cuts this year, that's always their prediction.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And that would be September, the next one, and then December --</p><p>BOLTON: Yes, that's where the Fed funds futures --</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- for a rate fund.</p><p>BOLTON: -- are pricing in, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Three rate cuts, while we have unemployment at 51-year low, pretty extraordinary, you know, you can't -- I mean yes, we are going to see a higher opening this morning with Futures are pointing to, but this is not resolved.</p><p>So, we are coming off of the worse day of 2019 for the markets with an unresolved situation. So, nobody should be surprised, if yes, we go up today at the open or even later today, but then, head south again, tomorrow or by the close tonight.</p><p>Jackie DeAngelis is on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange right now, looking at markets this morning, Jackie, good morning to you.</p><p>JACKIE DEANGELIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK, FINANCIAL CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Maria. And it looks like the markets are going to take a little bit of a pause today, a sigh of relief, if you will, with Futures pointing to that higher open.</p><p>That loss yesterday, 767 points at close, more than 900 points, at the session low, it looks like investors are coming back in, they're bargain hunting after that sell-off.</p><p>Now, the big story continues to be the China story that you guys have been talking about all morning, what happens next? And the big fear as Mr. Forbes said, is that corporate profits here in the United States will suffer as a result of everything we are seeing, all of this turmoil.</p><p>Now, the biggest losers yesterday on the Dow, across the board, a range of sectors, tech, industrials, financials, you name it, but the stocks that got hit the hardest on a percentage base, Apple, Visa, Boeing, Goldman Sachs, IBM, 3M, Home Depot, simply put -- those are the stocks that have a lot of China exposure.</p><p>Now, the rest of the indicators this morning seem a little bit more stable today, looking at oil, gold, the 10-year, even Bitcoin had that huge move up. Stocks poised to move today, tech is in focus, and the pre-markets. I'm going to show you some green arrows here, everything from Google, Microsoft, Apple, then drilling down into the semis, Intel, Micron, Broadcom, these are all poised for rebound, guys.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Thank you so much, Jackie, we'll be watching that. And don't forget, the stronger dollar is not going to be good news for foreigners for the emerging markets. So that, sort of, will likely deepen the global slowdown that we've all been talking about, which is one of the issues that the U.S. is dangling with -- is wrangling with, rather, pardon me.</p><p>FORBES: Yes, this is where Central Banks demonstrate they don't know how to manage their currencies for stability, it's just rather shocking.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining us right now to talk more about this is Texas Congressman, member of the House Energy and Commerce Committees and medical doctor himself, Michael Burgess. Congressman, it's good to see you this morning, thanks so much for being here.</p><p>REP. MICHAEL BURGESS (R-X): Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Your reaction to what's happening --</p><p>BURGESS: Thanks for having me on.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- with China right now, obviously, the fight is deepening?</p><p>BURGESS: It was -- it was interesting the juxtaposition of 20 years ago, we talked about irrational exuberance as the market was going up and perhaps, today, we have irrational pessimism as the market goes down.</p><p>Look, China being a currency manipulator is not new news, we talked about this to Secretary Paulson, in the Bush administration, right before the Beijing Olympics, and wanting the Treasury secretary to take a stronger position, they didn't then. Situation has (ph) largely been unresolved for over a decade, now this president is serious about our -- number one, our trade relationship with China, the trade deficit, and he said so, he campaigned on that, he won an election on that, and he's following through on that.</p><p>I also agree with him that from all appearances, the United States of America has the strongest economy in the world. Right now, we are the best thing going. And so the desire of companies to want to do business with the United States, or in the United States, seems to be even stronger still.</p><p>FORBES: So, Congressman, do we -- if we don't get a deal in the immediate future with China, do we end up putting on more and more tariffs? How do you see this playing out?</p><p>BURGESS: Well, I think, yesterday was perhaps some of, if you will, a wake-up call all around, and perhaps the impetus to get a deal, both on the part of the Chinese and the United States, perhaps that impetus is a little stronger today than it was 24 hours ago.</p><p>But, clearly, there is a deal to be had. The president, at one point, and (ph) his negotiator and Ambassador Lighthizer thought they were at a point where they had a deal several months ago, and I think I was -- I think I was on this show as we talked about that.</p><p>And then, the Chinese walked away from it. Perhaps, it is time to come back, and see if dealing in good faith, we can get passed this.</p><p>FORBES: One unrelated question, Congressman, I can't resist. Are we going to still push for flat tax?</p><p>BURGESS: A flat tax would solve our problems.</p><p>FORBES: Yes.</p><p>BURGESS: A flat tax would solve our problems, yes, so you're correct.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, meanwhile, the tax cut plan, definitely moved the needle on economic growth, and on job creation. And yet, now the worry is that this fight with China, you're going to take away all the benefits of that.</p><p>BURGESS: Look, the -- again, I think the president has pointed this out. The economy of the United States is in its strongest position, really, in anything that I can remember.</p><p>If you are ever going to correct the problems that existed with the trade imbalance with China, wouldn't now be the time to do it, when the -- from the position of strength, rather than trying to bargain from a position of weakness -- which obviously was the case, even just a few short years ago. You know, you also were talking about the minimum wage a little earlier --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>BURGESS: This is the (INAUDIBLE) I have worried about that, is if we do a federal increase across the board in the minimum wage, we're going to put additional pressure on the labor market. That's not a good thing for people who are in entry level positions, so -- you know, when that happened in 2008, the next thing you saw were the significant job losses, that coupled with the economic uncertainty --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>BURGESS: -- that was brought to us by the big banks, really is one of the things that lit the fuse for the --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Which is why --</p><p>BURGESS: -- economic meltdown in 2008.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- we were surprised to hear the CEO of A&amp;W say we can't pay them, 15, even though it's largely high school kids' first jobs. Look, I've got to -- I've got to turn to the horrible news of the last week --</p><p>BURGESS: Sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- the mass shootings in El Paso, Texas and in Dayton, Ohio. President Trump is planning to visit those cities tomorrow. Yesterday, he condemned all forms of hate, racism, and bigotry and white supremacy.</p><p>During comments at the White House, he also signaled Congress should work on reinstating red flag laws that could help stop a tragedy. Here's what he said, so listen to this.</p><p>BURGESS: Yes.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I am directing the Department of Justice to work in partnership with local state and federal agencies as well as social media companies to develop tools that can detect mass shooters before they strike.</p><p>We must make sure that those judged to pose a grave risk to public safety do not have access to firearms. And that if they do, those firearms can be taken through rapid due process. That is why I have called for red flag laws, also known as extreme risk protection orders.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: What about that, Congressman, what do you think about this red flag laws? And do you think Congress can get that legislation done?</p><p>BURGESS: Let me -- let me answer the first part of your question, first. I -- every time a terrible incident like this occurs -- and let me just say, again, our hearts are heavy in Texas for the loss of so many fellow Texans on Saturday, and then unfortunately over the last 24 hours, two more individual succumbed to their wounds that they received Saturday morning.</p><p>So, it's just, sort of an ongoing tragedy that's occurring, and of course, we also stay in solidarity with our -- with our friends and neighbors in Dayton, Ohio. But, yes, every time there is a -- what I call a notorious shooting, there seems to be a place where someone could have done something. I don't know if that's the case on these two episodes last weekend. But, frequently, that is what you encounter.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>BURGESS: And the question then comes, why? Why did not someone do something if something in fact could have been done? That's, I think, what the president is getting at, these temporary gun violence protection orders and asking the Justice Department to look into that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I think it's an excellent idea. And, yes, perhaps that is a tool that law enforcement could have at this disposal. You've got to respect due process. No one wants to infringe upon the likes -- rights of the law-abiding, but at the same time, when there are clear, clear evidence --</p><p>I mean, the Aurora shooting in Colorado, the shooting in Illinois, where the person was actually found to be in error in his application --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>BURGESS: -- for a permit, and then no one ever went back and did anything. And 10 years later, you have a tragedy, so these are things that I think are imminently within the purview of --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>BURGESS: -- yes to Department of Justice, yes local law enforcement, and we should give them the tools they need.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congressman, thank you. Our condolences to you and to all friends and family in El Paso, Michael Burgess, thank you so much.</p><p>Coming up, the Apple card is here. The technology giant partners with Goldman Sachs to rollout a new credit card today. Both stocks were the drags on the Dow yesterday. We're taking a look at them today, stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back, investors are gearing up for earnings, as well from Walt Disney later today. Cheryl Casone with those details now, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes, it might be all about the movies, Maria. Disney's mega hit \"Avengers: Endgame\" expected to help drive them more than 40 percent jump in the company's revenue from a year ago. But analysts are looking for earnings per share to fall as it prepares to launch its streaming service Disney Plus, that's going to be later on this year. Taking a look at Disney shares in the premarket, as you can see here, a little bit higher, about 1-1/2 percent trending higher in the premarket.</p><p>Well, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos sold stock worth $2.8 billion last week alone, although it's not clear why. Bezos had previously said he plans to sell stock worth a billion dollars each year to fund his base company Blue Origin, not here (INAUDIBLE) too much, it's actually up more than one percent.</p><p>And from Amazon to Apple, they have rolled out their virtual credit card for the iPhone's Wallet app. Apple's been working with Goldman Sachs on this credit card. It offers two percent cash back in purchases, there's no fees on it. Apple is also offering an option for physical card. If you really want that, you can have it made with titanium, Maria. And those Apple in the premarket right now, it's up more than one percent.</p><p>But you know what, Apple Pay in some banks, still aren't connecting, so this is actually a very interesting move I think.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's interesting to see them get in to the credit card business.</p><p>CASONE: Yes, probably makes sense.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Cheryl, thank you.</p><p>Coming up, trade fears fuelling markets. Futures are rebounding this morning, up 200 points as you can see, following yesterday's sharp selloff. We're breaking down what's at stake to strike a deal between the U.S. and China.</p><p>And then death crimes, the alarming new report that reveals families are falling into debt to maintain their middle class status, back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. So consumer debt now at a record level. More family's falling deep into debt to maintain their middle class status according to the Wall Street Journal.</p><p>Joining us right now is Ramsey Solutions financial expert, author of Everyday Millionaires, Chris Hogan. And Chris, what causes the debt crunch for many families? And of course we have to also take note of days like yesterday don't help any because it could really impact somebody's 401(k) when you see a market down 800 points.</p><p>CHRIS HOGAN, FINANCIAL EXPERT, RAMSEY'S SOLUTION: Yes, Maria, what we've got right now with the debt situation at almost four trillion excluding mortgages, is that Americans have this appetite for debt. We keep taking on more and more a literally living beyond our means and use in debt to try to supplement our income.</p><p>So what I want people to do is just really wake up and look at this and let's stop the cycle. Meaning take control of your situation, start to live on a budget, start to get yourself out of debt and understand, you have to be in control.</p><p>As far as yesterday with the Dow dropping, listen, building wealth is a long-term strategy, not a quick hit gain. I want people to relax. I'm getting a lot of questions about 401(k)s. Chris, what do I do? And I say leave it alone. You've got a long term strategy. You just need to relax, it will correct and it will go back up.</p><p>FORBES: Chris, in terms of consumer debt, what portion of consumers paying of their income now to service their debts versus say five or 10 years ago?</p><p>HOGAN: Well, it's definitely increased, Steve. I mean, everyone is taking on credit card debt, personal loan has absolutely ballooned where people are spending upwards of 38 percent or more on consumer debt.</p><p>So, looking at this, I want people to understand, you've got an opportunity to give yourself a raise just by getting out of debt. So the step to take is to list your debts, smallest to biggest. We teach what's called the debt snowball inside the Financial Peace University. When you attack the smallest debt first, you can give yourself a raise without going to your employer and asking. You can stay in control.</p><p>FORBES: And in terms of getting that debt of the banks that are now forgotten 2008, why the sudden seemingly ease of a getting it over your head again?</p><p>HOGAN: Well, I think Steve, as you well know, the market in that industry constricted a lot to try to correct for the mistakes that they'd made in years past. But I think we're back on that track.</p><p>Which means for Americans what we have to understand is debt is going to be available to you. Whether it's personal loans or credit cards that are showing up in your mailbox, I want people to take control. Learn to say no to debt, stop comparing yourself to what your neighbors are doing and start to compete with your own internal goals.</p><p>I believe that American dream is alive and available, people just need a clear and pleasant plan on how to get there.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Chris, it's Dagen McDowell. Good to see you my friend, always. But you pointed out that is the thing is to get the money out of your hands, get it into a 401(k) plan before you can get your hands on it and spend it.</p><p>And also, I was in the Apple store for a lot of time over the weekend. And they have a stock ownership plan there and that builds loyalty in the company. Take advantage of that if you have it.</p><p>HOGAN: Oh I agree, Dagen. And I tell people, once you get yourself out of debt and you have a fully funded emergency fund. Then investing 15 percent of your income is definitely the way to go.</p><p>But be aware and be careful, you know, employees stock plans are single stocks. That's a lot like going to Vegas so you don't want headache and heartache. You want a long-term plan that's going to help you grow your money. Remember, we want to build wealth, not try to get rich quick.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Chris, great to talk with you as always. On a day like this, we really need your advice. Thank you, Chris.</p><p>HOGAN: Thank you so much.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll see you soon. Chris Hogan from Ramsey Solutions.</p><p>Coming up, trade fears fuelling markets. Futures rebounding this morning following yesterday's broad and sharp sell-off, will it stick?</p><p>And then we are zeroing in on technology, took a real beating yesterday. The industry losing a combined $162 billion in market value in yesterday's trade fuelled market rout.</p><p>Alpha One Capital partners co-founder Dan Niles will join me to weigh in on yesterday's tech rout, why he says you should stay away from Apple right now, coming up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Tuesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. Happy Tuesday. It is Tuesday, August 6th. Your top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast. U.S.- China trade turmoil turning to currency, the U.S. has designated China a currency manipulator after allowing the Yuan to depreciate, an accusation Beijing is denying this morning.</p><p>President Donald Trump tweeted this, \"Massive amounts of money from China and other parts of the world pouring into the United States for reasons of safety, investment and interest rates.\" Markets are poised for a turnaround this morning following yesterday's broad selloff. It was sparked by the Yuan falling to an 11-year low against the dollar.</p><p>The Dow Futures right now up 214 points, almost one percent, S&amp;P is up 24 points, and the NASDAQ up 78 points, better than one percent. Global markets are also bouncing this morning, of course not to the tune that they fell yesterday, but the European Indices are mixed. FT-100 just slipped into negative territory, but the CAC Quarante in Paris is up 30, and the DAX Index in Germany is up 30 as well.</p><p>In Germany, we had to some economic data out this morning. Factory orders up, 2-1/2 percent, much higher than economists were expecting so that is boosting stocks there. In Asia overnight, it was right across the board, but off of session lows when all was said and done. Shanghai Composite in China down one 1-1/2 percent.</p><p>Big tech was hit hard by China trade, the sector seeing the heaviest selling yesterday, in a long time, Facebook, Apple, Netflix, Google parent Alphabet. And chipmaker NVIDIA, among the big losers. As you can see, NVIDIA shares down 6-1/2 percent on the session yesterday. This morning, they are bouncing fractionally on the upside, as you can see there.</p><p>Meanwhile, we're looking at markets this, opening fractionally higher for the open, at least, this after the market meltdown yesterday. Dow Futures up 236 points. You do still have this U.S.-China trade tension escalating and causing that market selloff. Washington is accusing Beijing of currency manipulation.</p><p>And joining me right now is Allianz Chief Economic Adviser, Mohamed El- Erian. Mohamed, it's good to have you this morning. Thank so much for being with me.</p><p>MOHAMED EL-ERIAN, CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISER, ALLIANZ: Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So first, your reaction to the U.S. calling China a currency manipulator and what that means for this fight between the U.S. and China.</p><p>EL-ERIAN: If you look at the strict definition of currency manipulator, China is not then. And if you wanted to call China a currency manipulator, you should have done it a few years ago. But this is not about strict definition, this is about the weaponization of economic tools and we're seeing that on trade, now we're going to see it on currency. What does it mean? It simply opens the door wider for actions against China. And that's why the Chinese reacted in the way they did.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. You have a new op-ed in the Financial Times this morning. I want to get right to it. You write this, \"With trade tensions more likely to grow than ease, investors now need to reassess whether further monetary policy loosening will again allow liquidity to push markets forward or instead prove less effective in countering economic and political headwinds.\"</p><p>Mohamed, you don't think the Fed can do much about the fight between China and the U.S., and the economy right now.</p><p>EL-ERIAN: Yes. I mean they're going to ease and that's going to allow other central banks to ease, but that doesn't solve the underlying problem, and the underlying problem is two-fold. Too little growth around the world, the U.S. is in a better place, but overall, the global economy is not doing to a too well. And secondly, the policy mix is unbalanced. We have too much liquidity, too much monetary policy, and not enough everything else.</p><p>So, the Fed can continue to loosen policies, other central banks continue to lose in policies, but that doesn't solve the underlying issues.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. So, what would solve the underlying issues then, Mohamed?</p><p>EL-ERIAN: So I know a few things. One, I think, you need fairer trade, a more level-playing field so that countries can go back to trading according to global Rules. Secondly, where there is room, Germany, Netherlands, you need some fiscal expansion. Thirdly, you need structural pro-growth policies, including in the U.S. an infrastructure, but especially in Europe and in -- and in China.</p><p>Maria, this is not the about engineering. I think most economists agree on what's need, this is about politics, it's a political environment that has hindered this sort of policy approach.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And in terms of the currency manipulator title, it's really toothless, right? It doesn't really mean anything other than just putting Beijing on alert that maybe the U.S. will do other things to get them to start focusing on the currency and stop allowing it to go down.</p><p>EL-ERIAN: That's absolutely right, and it's interesting to see how the Chinese reacted. So, their words were quite aggressive but the actions were not. The Chinese Central Bank could have fixed the midpoint above seven. It didn't, it fixed it at 6.97, so the central bank didn't add to its aggressive words by aggressive action.</p><p>And that's why we have this tentative common markets today, but I'm going to stress, it is tentative. We have trade tensions, and on top of that, we have currency tensions.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So Goldman Sachs, this morning, is out with a note saying we're expecting three rate cuts this year. I assume that means next one in September, next one after that in December. Do you agree with that? And does it seem weird to you that we're talking about rate cuts in an environment where we have unemployment at a 51-year low and an economy growing two to three percent with 2.1 percent GDP in the second quarter, and 3.1 in the first quarter.</p><p>EL-ERIAN: Yes, it seems weird. You're absolutely right. If you look at the traditional economic arguments, they don't signal that the -- that the Fed should be cutting, and also if you look at the need to have some cushion for if our economy really slows --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly.</p><p>EL-ERIAN: -- it's not a great idea to cut now. However, the Fed has no choice. It's been put in a -- in the -- in a corner by the markets and the markets really have been forcing this 180 turn on Fed policy and they're going to continue to force the Fed to loosen policies.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, we know that it, you know, the Fed made a mistake at the end of last year, wanting to raise rates and unwind that balance sheet, but are they feeling that they're getting into a corner because of the president? I mean there's an op-ed today defending the Federal Reserve by former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker, Alan Greenspan, Ben Bernanke, and Janet Yellen. So, they all get together, they write this op-ed in The Journal this morning, advocating for an independent central bank. They title it \"America Needs an Independent Fed.\"</p><p>They write, \"Even the perception that monetary policy decisions are politically motivated are influenced by threats that policymakers won't be able to serve out their terms of office can undermine public confidence that the central bank is acting in the best interests of the economy. That can lead to unstable financial markets and worst, economic outcomes, your reaction to this, and do you think this is what this is about?</p><p>EL-ERIAN: So I don't think this what is this is about. I think that they have a point all four in stressing the importance of political independence of a central bank. You need operational autonomy. The political system should set the targets of what the central bank should do but then leave the implementation to the central bank. But this is not about political pressure. This is about market pressures.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.</p><p>EL-ERIAN: Markets have not only been conditioned to expect ample and predictable central bank support, they feel entitled to it and that increasingly has put central banks in a corner, and the only way they can get out of that corner is through economic growth.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Do you see economic growth anywhere else? Would you be putting money into for example, Europe? What about Asia? Mohamed, in terms of allocating capital, how do you see the world?</p><p>EL-ERIAN: So I think it's too early to reduce exposure to the U.S. in favor of the rest of the world. The U.S. is in a much better place. It's also too early to bet on dollar weakness. I mean people tend to want to see the dollar weaker. It's not going to get weaker. We're the stronger economy, we have higher nominal interest rates and we are the destination for flight-to-quality.</p><p>So, don't fade the U.S. either in terms of security selection or in terms of dollars. However, see how you felt over the last day because that tells you how you're going to feel when fundamentalists assert themselves as ultimately they will. And if you didn't feel well, if you almost felt forced to do something silly --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>EL-ERIAN: -- then you're overexposed.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, real quick on the dollar here, doesn't that cut into profits? Is that going to slow down this economy?</p><p>EL-ERIAN: It's going to have an impact on the economy, yes, but that's the reality of being the best economy in the world right now. OK? People are going to don't continue to favor the U.S.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Hmm.</p><p>EL-ERIAN: We're going to continue to see capital inflows so, yes, it's not great, but, you know what, it's happening for good reason.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there. Mohamed, always great to get your insights on this. Thanks so much.</p><p>EL-ERIAN: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Mohamed El-Erian joining us there. President Trump just tweeted on China. Here's what the president just said, \"As they have learned om the last two years, our great American farmers know that China will not be able to hurt them and that their president has stood with them, and done what no other president would do and I'll do it again next year if necessary.\" Writes the president. Staying firm against China.</p><p>Plus tech wreck, that's next, the sector losing a combined $162 billion in market value yesterday alone. Apple, for example, lost $125 billion in value since its high last week. AlphaOne Capital partners cofounder, Dan Niles, will join me. Why he's warning to stay away from Apple stock right now. Back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The escalating trade feud fueling markets. Futures this morning are rebounding about 200 points. As you can see, Dow Futures up 216, almost one percent, S&amp;P Futures up 24, and the NASDAQ Futures up 76 on top of yesterday's sharp selloff, all three major indices suffered their worst trading day of 2019.</p><p>The Dow tanked 767 points, the biggest one day percentage drop since December, the Chinese currency, the Chinese Yuan, collapsing to an 11-year low versus the dollar, and then the U.S. responded by labeling Beijing a currency manipulator. China has since stabilized the currency. We told you earlier about big tech as well.</p><p>The tech wreck really taking a hit yesterday, combined the largest five companies that's Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook lost a combined $162 billion in market cap yesterday. That was only five companies. AlphaOne Capital Partners Co-Founder Dan Niles will join me on why he's warning investors to stay far away from Apple stock in this environment. Back in a moment with Dan.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Markets this morning bouncing a bit, Dow Futures up 220 points, almost one percent. S&amp;P Futures up 25, and the NASDAQ Futures up 81 on top of a dramatic selloff yesterday, all three major indices seeing their worst trading day of the year. The technology-heavy NASDAQ was hardest hit, down 3-1/2 percent.</p><p>Joining me right now over the telephone is AlphaOne Capital Partners founding partner, Dan Niles. Dan has been an expert in technology investing for two decades, at least. Dan, it's great to have you this morning. Thanks so much for being with me.</p><p>DAN NILES, CO-FOUNDER, ALPHAONE CAPITAL PARTNERS (via telephone): My pleasure, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So when you see a market like that yesterday, in the face of the China trade, and I want to get your take on the China story because I know you've got real thoughtful answers and solutions here but first, what do you want to do in a market that showed such weakness yesterday?</p><p>NILES: Well, actually, yesterday, we were covering a lot of our shorts, so the way we looked at it, so our positioning coming in when the Fed went ahead that day and cut rates, we aggressively were selling stocks, we were shorting stocks and so we were fortunate that we came into the -- that -- yesterday sitting on nearly 10 percent in cash.</p><p>And so when the markets got hammered yesterday, what we did was we went in and we actually started covering our shorts, and started to look for market bounce. The volumes are up 40 percent, relative to their 20-day average, the put/call ratio, which means people are looking for an insurance, who's up about at one -- 1-1/2. The breadth was horrible, you know, -6 on the NYSE in the volume on the stocks going down, was about 10x, the volume on the upstart, so the total volume in the market.</p><p>So, a lot of those things seem to indicate that the panic was getting a little bit overdone, and so that's why we, you know, ended up actually covering over half the shorts we had.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow. So the short covering maybe suggests that you think, what, that it was overdone, and that perhaps --</p><p>NILES: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- we're not going to see continuation of this selloff even though there's not a resolution to the China-U.S. fight.</p><p>NILES: Well, remember, there's the short-term and the long-term. I mean markets don't go straight down. The S&amp;P down six days in a row, and so, you know, you had had some really climatic selling our opinion going on, so we're not sure we're all clear.</p><p>In fact, our belief is that you get a short-term bounce and then the markets probably go lower from there, because as you rightly said, right? There is no resolution here. My personal opinion is things probably worse before they get better, but in the short-term, you're throwing all the stocks out.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.</p><p>NILES: And so there's not a lot of discrimination happening and that creates opportunities and I think that's what you need to look for. So, you know, names like Apple that we think are the forefront of these last round of tariffs, where they're on cell phones and PCs, et cetera, the first round of tariffs wasn't on that. I mean Apple's actually down less than the NASDAQ and Facebook and Google, which aren't affected by the tariffs, are actually down more. So, I think, you know, this creates some opportunities and certain names, and so that's what we're looking at.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean I'm looking at a Cornerstone Macro research report right now and they point out that the phase three tariffs are really going to have an outsized impact on the consumer when you consider the kinds of things that will be taxed and tariffed like cell phones, laptops, flat screen T.V.s, apparel, footwear, toys, games, things like that, so do you think the consumer here gets weaker because we're going to see the tariffs, means prices will go up?</p><p>NILES: Well, I mean absolutely, right? And I mean we're all rational buyers, prices go up on the margin, yes. Are you going to buy less? Absolutely. And so I think this latest round, you know, for companies like Apple, that's all P.C.s and iPhones, that's definitely going to impact them. They either have to cut prices off some tariffs or they have to eat the price increases.</p><p>You don't pay anything when you log on to your Facebook. You don't pay anything when you do a search on Google. Now obviously, there's a second order impact there where if, you know, the markets keep falling, the companies that advertise on them, they may advertise a bit less. But it's a second order impact versus a first order impact for a company like Apple that gets immediately impacted by the tariffs, they go to into place on September 1st.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What about this issue of the U.S. calling Beijing a currency manipulator, Dan? I know that for basically intents and purposes, this is pretty toothless, and it's basically the U.S. saying to China, \"Do something to fix the problem or we will do something bigger.\" But is this a significant development that they have gone and after so many years of threatening, that they did in fact call them a currency manipulator?</p><p>NILES: Well, I think you said it right. It's somewhat to -- well, there's nothing that really comes out of that. I mean the Yuan did hit 11-year low. What, to me, was -- so that was completely out of the blue to some degree so I was really surprised by that. What's interesting to me is the Chinese reaction, which is the Yuan, they actually strengthened that last night, and I think that's why the markets, to a large degree, are bouncing because after it sort of got devalued the day before on Monday, you know, overnight, they actually strengthened it.</p><p>I thought for sure they would weaken it even further, so I think that's why you're seeing this big rebound in the markets today despite that, and, you know, we'll see what happens going forward. This is, as you rightly pointed out beginning of this interview, this is not anywhere close to being done yet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So go through some of these names within tech, which you've been so great at navigating this sector for so long, given the fact that Google, Facebook, Apple had such tough days yesterday.</p><p>NILES: Sure. So I think, you know, we talked about Apple already, but, you know, let's look at Facebook, so in Facebook, last quarter, their revenues actually reaccelerated to 28 percent year-over-year growth and margins and EPS were also better-than-expected. But if you look at the stocks, it's only trading at a 23 P/E for 30 percent revenue growth. And you have pretty much it seems like every other day you get a negative headline on Facebook, and the business is actually stronger than people thought.</p><p>So, I think that's a pretty big positive. You're also having some new sources of revenue coming into this platform, 2.7 billion people on the planet use the collection of Facebook property.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>NILES: And, you know, selling on Instagram is going to be big and I think Google, to me, I'm actually even more excited about, because Google announced a $25-billion share repurchase. They've only bought back $25 billion of shares over last the five years combined.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Hmm.</p><p>NILES: So, this is most shareholder-friendly they've ever been. Their business also reaccelerated during the quarter. So, obviously, you have all the negative headlines about, you know, every presidential candidate seems to be intent on trying to break up big tech.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>NILES: But that's going to take multiple years to happen and between there, you got very good companies at very low P/Es growing very fast.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I'm glad you mentioned that. That was next question. What about the idea of regulation? All right. How do you want to allocate capital right here, Dan? You covered your shorts, loved your shorts yesterday, we're looking at a day that the market's going to bounce over the near-to-midterm, are there ears you like in this market?</p><p>NILES: Yes. I absolutely do. So, as I said, the internet, we'd already started nibbling at Facebook and Google during the selloff. We plan on buying more, not sure we'll do that today but, you know, those are areas we want to get bigger in. We also want to like the gaming stocks. We actually own a fair bit of electronic arts where we think when you look at the yield gaming, that's becoming our huge business. I mean I think we all heard about the 16-year-old that $2 million playing Fortnite --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Correct.</p><p>NILES: -- gives you an idea, \"I clearly should've had my kids playing more videogames, you know, it gives you an idea how big these businesses are becoming --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>NILES: -- and there's a lot of recurring revenue, so.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And you said earlier, avoid Apple right now, real quick, Dan.</p><p>NILES: Yes. I think you have to avoid Apple because as we talked about, right? That's where the bulk of the tariffs are impacting and stocks down less than the NASDAQ or Facebook or Google or some other stocks that don't have tariff rate at this time.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Great insights as well from you, Dan. Great to talk with you. Thanks so much.</p><p>NILES: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Dan Niles. We'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: My thanks -- my thanks to this fantastic panel. Have a great day, everybody. \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" begins right now. Stu, take it away.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning, Maria.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2019080603cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WRS-THB1-JB20-G0R4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7336\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 6, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0001YLV</classCode><className>NVIDIA CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0001S8A</classCode><className>FORBES INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Commissioned and conducted by the HealthCare Executive Group[1] and Change Healthcare,[2] the 9th Annual Industry Pulse Survey[3] report reveals a significant number of healthcare leaders are planning tooffer programs addressing care coordination, transportation, food insecurity, and other factors for members over the next 12 months. 9th Annual Industry Pulse Survey Overview The 9th annual national survey identifies what payers and other healthcare stakeholders see as the top challenges facing the industry, as well as the greatest opportunities for positive change. The report draws from185 healthcare leaders, 28% of whom are at the president or C-suite level, 48% VP-level or above, and includes HCEG members, Health Plan Alliance members, and Change Healthcare, customers. </p><p>The overall report provides a timely perspective on more than 16 topics, including general market trends, population health, value-based care, consumer engagement, clinical and data analytics, risk sharing, SDoH, cybersecurity, and more. Social Determinants of Health Remains in Focus When asked how they plan to integrate social determinants of health (SDoH) into their population health[4] programs, 18 percent respondents cited coordinating with community programs and resources as their leading approach to integrating social determinants of health. The next most popular modes of integration were offering a social assessment together with the health risk assessment (15.1%), and integrating non-medical data (13.9%) such as financial status and educational attainment. Barriers to Addressing Social Determinants in Population Health Programs The report finds healthcare stakeholders face several barriers in trying to address social determinants in population health programs and in clinical care: 1. The lack of payment structures for non-medical approaches (49.2%) 2. Lack of effectiveness metrics for non-medical solutions (48.7%) 3. Member or patient adoption of solutions (45.5%) 4. Limitations on data sharing (42.9%) 5. Adding skill sets to address social determinants of health (40.7%) 6. Identifying solutions (e.g. software, services) (32.8%) 7. Regulations (28.6%) 8. Identifying partners (28.6%) Other Industry Pulse Survey findings include: Clinical Data Sources are on the Move - More data is being pulled from the EHR (30.1%), where core clinical data lives. - health information exchange (HIE) data more than doubled in just a year, from 3.8% in 2017 to 9.1% in 2018. - Rising integration of information from patient health surveys (9.1%) with EHR data indicates that stakeholders are giving focus to individual patients, not just population health. - Lagging are fundamentals like real-time data on hospital admissions and discharges. Improvement in these measures would bode well for coordination of care across providers. Big Tech and Retail will Disrupt Healthcare - Nearly one-third (32.2%) said the greatest impact of big tech and big retail will be on the business models that now dominate, indicating that healthcare leaders recognize that external entrants will force the industry to change how it conducts business. - Placing second and third after business models were innovations in care delivery (13.3%), and refinement of consumer experience (11.1%)\u2014which aligns with the inherent strengths of retail and technology market entrants. Care Coordination is Key to Surmounting Barriers - When asked which non-medical barriers to care or health the respondents' organizations plan to act on in the next year, Nearly two-thirds (63.7%) of respondents named care coordination, a traditional companion service to direct medical care, as a key to overcoming barriers. - Some of these barriers derive directly from the social determinants of health. Transportation (39.1%) and food insecurity and access (27%) also ranked high. - New phone app services like ridesharing and delivery are seen as solutions to these barriers to care and health. Organizations such as Lyft and Uber are engaging with providers and payers to transport patients to doctor visits and hospitals, preventing the financial losses of missed or re-booked appointments\u2014and avoiding the costs of delayed or missed care. Patient Engagement is Critical to Healthcare Consumers- The Industry Pulse survey asked about patient portals\u2014nearly 15% of respondents use these\u2014and personalized content, which came in much lower at 6.9%. The lack of personalization likely limits the effectiveness of educational materials, which ranked high among responses at 15.2%. - Only 11% said their organizations are identifying members' communications preferences. The industry will have to do better on this\u2014and on delivering a more engaging consumer experience. Incentives Help People Engage as Consumers - Nearly half (49.3%) of respondents said that offering patients incentives for healthy behaviors is one of best tools for engaging them as consumers. - High-deductible health plans are great for cost control, but a poor means for getting patients to think about how to shop for and use their healthcare. Value-Based Contracts are Being Adopted Slowly - Year after year, shared-risk, value-based healthcare has appeared to be just around the corner. However, healthcare seems to be perpetually stuck at being three to five years away from adopting shared-risk value-based contracts. - More than 90% of respondents said that VBC won't be dominant for one to five years or more\u2014or that it will never happen. - Making value-based contracts happen will require major changes in business models. It's more than just operationalizing the steps from concept to contract to claims processing. Payers Struggle to Support Providers' High-Value Care - Regarding payer support of providers' efforts to give high-value care, there's good news and bad news. The bad news is that standardized data and outcome measures are lacking; 27.9% of respondents said so. - Payers and providers both believe that if they work together to develop risk-management programs, they'll have the best chances of success. - Other strategies cited by respondents include sharing performance data (13.9%), co-development of bundled payments around episodes of care (13%), developing APIs to improve interoperability (10.6%), and sharing outcome data (7.7%). Digital Health Adoption on the Rise - Patient portals (73.1% of respondents are using them) and telehealth services (54%) top the list, establishing these as digital cornerstones. - Most respondents said clinical data integration is also key, with only 10.9% saying they have no plans to implement it. - Pricing and payment have always been important to patients; the same now goes for healthcare stakeholders, with digital payment options and cost transparency apps making a strong showing. - Automation in the form of machine learning and AI[5] has the highest potential in the minds of respondents, with just over half planning to employ it. By contrast, robotic process automation drew the largest chorus of no's, with 47.2% saying their organizations would not use it.

But as this trend widens, new systemic and security risks may be introduced in the financial system. These are some of the findings of a new World Economic Forum report, The New Physics of Financial Services - How artificial intelligence is transforming the financial ecosystem, prepared in collaboration with Deloitte.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Big financial institutions are taking a page from the AI book of big tech: They develop AI applications and make them available as a 'service' through the cloud,\" said Jesse McWaters, AI in Financial Services Project Lead at the World Economic Forum. \"It is turning what were historically cost centres into new source of profitability, and creating a virtuous cycle of self-learning that accelerates their lead.\"</p><p>The report points to Ping An's One Connect and BlackRock's Aladdin platform as prime examples of the trend:</p><p>- In China, One Connect sells AI-powered services ranging from credit adjudication to instantaneous insurance claims settlement to hundreds of small and mid-sized Chinese banks and is expected to fetch up to $3 billion at public sale</p><p>- In the US, Aladdin provides sophisticated risk analytics and comprehensive portfolio management tools that leverage machine learning to a range of asset managers and insurers and is expected by BlackRock's Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink to provide 30% of the firm's revenues by 2022</p><p>The report, which draws on interviews and workshops with hundreds of financial and technology experts, observes that the \"size of the prize\" driven through these as-a-service offerings and other applications of AI is much larger than that of the more narrow applications that drive efficiency through the automation of human effort.</p><p>The report predicts that AI will also accelerate the \"race to the bottom\" for many products, as price becomes highly comparable via aggregation services and third-party services commoditize back office excellence.</p><p>\"AI's role in financial services is often seen narrowly as driving efficiency through the automation of human effort, but much greater value can be driven through more innovative and transformative applications,\" said Rob Galaski, Deloitte Global Banking &amp;#38; Capital Markets Consulting Leader.</p><p>As such, financial institutions are seeking to build new sources of differentiation on the back of AI, such as on-the-fly product customization and free advisory services built into products.</p><p>- Canadian lender RBC is providing its automotive dealership clients with sophisticated demand-forecasting tools that complement the existing credit products it provides to these firms</p><p>- IEX, a young New York-based stock exchange, is exploring the use of machine learning in creating new order types that protect trades from execution during unstable, potentially adverse conditions</p><p>The net result for customers will be \"self-driving finance\" - a customer experience where an individual's or firm's finances are effectively running themselves, engaging the client only to act as a trusted adviser on decisions of importance.</p><p>\"A small business won't go to a bank for a revolving line of credit,\" said Bob Contri, Deloitte Global Financial Services Leader. \"It will seek out a liquidity solution that anticipates how their need for growth capital will evolve and provides customized products to meet those needs,\" he said.</p><p>But the expanding presence of AI in finance doesn't come without tensions and risks.</p><p>- First, financial institutions will be drawn closer to big tech since cloud computing is central to most AI strategies. But there is a chance that most of the benefits will escape them.</p><p>- Second, the report warns that AI will raise new challenges for the financial ecosystem, particularly around regulation. The divergent path being taken by regulators around the world towards customer data could create a new form a regulatory arbitrage, project participants said.</p><p>- Finally, the report points to systemic and security risks from creating a more networked finance system, where a few AI databases contain most clients' information.</p><p>About the report: The New Physics of Financial Services - How artificial intelligence is transforming the financial ecosystem is the result of hundreds of meetings and interviews with executives from incumbent financial institutions like JP Morgan, HSBC, Zurich, Citibank and Allianz, as well as leading financially focused technology firms such as Ping An, Tradeshift, Element AI, Claritymoney, IEX, Huawei and Palentir .

These firms expect to use AI for purposes beyond cost reduction including revenue generation, process automation, risk management, customer service, and client acquisition.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In Transforming Paradigms: Global AI in Financial Services Survey, over 150 senior financial services executives in both fintech and incumbent financial institutions responded to a range of questions on the impact AI will have on the industry, concluding that there will be a significant gap between firms that quickly implement AI and firms that lag behind.</p><p>Currently, 60% of firms invest less than 10% of their research and development (R&amp;D) resources on AI despite evidence of accelerating returns. Pay offs have shown to be especially strong between investment levels of 10% and 30%, as well as investment levels of 30% and over 40%.</p><p>\"The comprehensive and global study confirms that AI is affecting the financial system at an accelerating pace,\" said Matthew Blake, head of financial and monetary systems at the World Economic Forum. \"With the rising trend of mass adoption of the technologies throughout financial services, those firms that implement AI quickly look set to sprint ahead.\"</p><p>The study has also revealed executive fears surrounding AI bias and market-wide risks, with over half of executives saying they expect mass AI adoption to worsen bias and discrimination within the sector. Other market-wide risks were also identified.</p><p>This is a worry, but 70% of respondents also believe they are at least somewhat prepared to mitigate Al bias risks. Generally, firms using risk and compliance teams in AI implementation are most confident about their chances.</p><p>The report also identified a difference between how fintechs and incumbent firms are expecting to use AI in their businesses. For example, a higher share of fintechs are creating AI-based products and services, employ autonomous decision-making systems, and rely on cloud-based offerings. Meanwhile, traditional financial services players predominantly focus on harnessing AI to improve existing products.</p><p>\"This empirical research underscores the growing importance of harnessing AI in financial services,\" said Bryan Zhang, executive director of CCAF, \"which gives new impetus for firms to develop a holistic and future-proof AI strategy.\"</p><p>The Global AI in Financial Services Survey, which was produced in collaboration with EY and Invesco, looks into many areas of AI adoption in financial services.

A deal would be the latest example of convergence in the media and tech world, and it could usher in another wave of consolidation in the sector.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Wall Street Journal, citing anonymous sources, said that a deal could happen as soon as this weekend. (Time Warner is the parent company of CNN.)</p><p>Shares of AT&amp;T were down 3% after the news broke.</p><p>AT&amp;T declined to comment to CNNMoney, and Time Warner did not immediately return requests for comment.</p><p>Several news outlets cited a range of possible sale prices, from at least $90 per share to $110 per share. AT&amp;T reportedly would use cash and its own stock to finance the deal. It is currently worth $230 billion, while Time Warner's market value is about $70 billion.</p><p>Larry Haverty, associate portfolio manager with The Gabelli Multimedia Trust -- a fund that owns shares of both AT&amp;T and Time Warner -- said he thinks it is \"highly likely\" the two companies will combine.</p><p>He added that AT&amp;T could wind up paying as much as $110 a share for Time Warner, which is a price that has also been reported by Bloomberg. That would be almost 25% higher than the stock's current price, and would value Time Warner at more than $85 billion.</p><p/><p>But any AT&amp;T-Time Warner deal would be subject to a lengthy regulatory review process.</p><p>That's because an acquisition of Time Warner would cement AT&amp;T as one of the country's dominant media companies, with significant control over both programming and the distribution of that programming.</p><p>AT&amp;T recently completed the acquisition of satellite TV provider DirecTV, which has access to 20 million households in the United States and also holds the lucrative rights to the National Football League's Sunday Ticket package.</p><p>AT&amp;T's broadband U-Verse service has another 5 million subscribers in the U.S. AT&amp;T also still owns a huge wireless and landline phone business as well. This is the company many still know by its nickname Ma Bell after all.</p><p/><p>With the addition of Time Warner, AT&amp;T would gain control of household names in the media world: CNN, HBO, a collection of valuable cable channels like TNT and Cartoon Network and the Warner Bros. movie and TV studio.</p><p>A purchase of Time Warner would immediately make AT&amp;T a global media giant, on par with cable company Comcast -- which also owns NBCUniversal and DreamWorks Animation -- as well as Disney, the parent of ESPN, ABC, Lucasfilm, Pixar and Marvel.</p><p>AT&amp;T CEO Randall Stephenson has made it known that he wants AT&amp;T to control more programming. And the Comcast-NBC merger has proven that a content distribution firm can thrive by owning a media firm as well.</p><p>Bloomberg reported on Thursday that talks between AT&amp;T and Time Warner have been taking place for several weeks.</p><p>Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes is a \"willing seller\" if he \"gets an offer he thinks is fair,\" Bloomberg said, citing an anonymous source.</p><p>This isn't the first time that Time Warner has been in play. Rupert Murdoch's Fox made an offer for Time Warner in 2014 but withdrew the bid after it became clear that Time Warner was not interested in a deal.</p><p>At the time, a senior source involved in the bid said Murdoch was the wrong bidder at the wrong time.</p><p>\"Wait two or three years,\" the source said, \"and Time Warner will be on the market.\"</p><p>Sure enough, two years later there has been anticipation on Wall Street about a potential Time Warner transaction.</p><p/><p>Analysts believe Time Warner's portfolio of entertainment and news businesses are a logical fit with several potential buyers, including AT&amp;T. Gabelli's Haverty said an AT&amp;T-Time Warner would make Stephenson's vision \"strategically complete.\"</p><p>It is also becoming clear that content can be very valuable to large technology firms as well.</p><p>There were rumors circulating on Wall Street earlier this year that Apple may be interested in making a bid for either Time Warner or Netflix.</p><p>Google parent Alphabet and Amazon have also been mentioned in vague trader chatter as possible acquirers of Time Warner or other big media companies.</p><p>But Haverty doesn't think that one of the big tech firms will buy Time Warner.</p><p>He notes that software firm Salesforce recently faced a shareholder revolt when it was rumored to be seriously considering a bid for struggling social media company Twitter -- and Salesforce ultimately decided against a deal.</p><p>Haverty said Apple or Alphabet could face similarly disgruntled investors if either proposed a purchase of Time Warner.</p><p>Still, any deal for Time Warner could kick off another wave of mergers in the media sector.</p><p>CBS, which also owns the cable network Showtime as well as the Eye Network, is already said to be in talks to reunite with Viacom, the owner of the Paramount movie studio, Nickelodeon and MTV.</p><p>Sumner Redstone and his family control both companies.</p><p/><p>But Dave Novosel, a media analyst for corporate bond research firm Gimme Credit, noted in a report earlier this month that CBS might be more interested in selling to Time Warner instead of merging with Viacom.</p><p>\"We think that CBS would rather combine with Time Warner,\" he wrote, adding that \"Time Warner would provide an attractive film business, which CBS does not have but presumably would like\" and that \"HBO would be a nice complement to Showtime.\"</p><p>Whether or not Time Warner wants to be an acquirer as opposed to a seller is debatable.</p><p>A Time Warner acquisition may cause Fox and Disney to consider big deals of their own too.</p><p>To that end, shares of three other big cable programming companies -- AMC Networks, Discovery Communications and Scripps Networks Interactive -- all surged Friday as well.</p><p>If Time Warner is sold, it would mark the end of an era for what was once an even larger media powerhouse.</p><p>Time Warner controversially merged with AOL back in 2000, a deal that many still view as one of the least successful in corporate history.</p><p>But under the leadership of Bewkes, Time Warner has spun off AOL (now owned by Verizon), Time Warner Cable (now a part of Charter Communications) and the magazine and book publishing unit Time Inc.</p><p>\"Bewkes has created a pure play content firm that may only be rivaled by Disney. Selling to AT&amp;T would answer the question of what's next for Time Warner,\" Haverty said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNMNY-20161021time-warner-att-merger-talks1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNMNY2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5M0K-PGW1-DY60-K089-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">266331</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1042\"/><timeReceived>6:20 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CNNMoney.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"15302\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"10\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>October 21, 2016 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC0009PXP</classCode><className>AT&amp;T INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009DMB</classCode><className>DREAMWORKS ANIMATION SKG INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS517312 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS (EXCEPT SATELLITE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS517311 WIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS511140 DIRECTORY &amp;

A deal would be the latest example of convergence in the media and tech world, and it could usher in another wave of consolidation in the sector.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Wall Street Journal, citing anonymous sources, said that a deal could happen as soon as this weekend. (Time Warner is the parent company of CNN.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Shares of AT&amp;T were down 3% after the news broke.</p><p>AT&amp;T declined to comment to CNNMoney, and Time Warner did not immediately return requests for comment. </p><p>Several news outlets cited a range of possible sale prices, from at least $90 per share to $110 per share. AT&amp;T reportedly would use cash and its own stock to finance the deal. It is currently worth $230 billion, while Time Warner's market value is about $70 billion.</p><p>Larry Haverty, associate portfolio manager with The Gabelli Multimedia Trust -- a fund that owns shares of both AT&amp;T and Time Warner -- said he thinks it is \"highly likely\" the two companies will combine. </p><p>He added that AT&amp;T could wind up paying as much as $110 a share for Time Warner, which is a price that has also been reported by Bloomberg. That would be almost 25% higher than the stock's current price, and would value Time Warner at more than $85 billion.</p><p>But any AT&amp;T-Time Warner deal would be subject to a lengthy regulatory review process. </p><p>That's because an acquisition of Time Warner would cement AT&amp;T as one of the country's dominant media companies, with significant control over both programming and the distribution of that programming. </p><p>AT&amp;T recently completed the acquisition of satellite TV provider DirecTV, which has access to 20 million households in the United States and also holds the lucrative rights to the National Football League's Sunday Ticket package. </p><p>AT&amp;T's broadband U-Verse service has another 5 million subscribers in the U.S. AT&amp;T also still owns a huge wireless and landline phone business as well. This is the company many still know by its nickname Ma Bell after all.</p><p>With the addition of Time Warner, AT&amp;T would gain control of household names in the media world: CNN, HBO, a collection of valuable cable channels like TNT and Cartoon Network and the Warner Bros. movie and TV studio.</p><p>A purchase of Time Warner would immediately make AT&amp;T a global media giant, on par with cable company Comcast -- which also owns NBCUniversal and DreamWorks Animation -- as well as Disney, the parent of ESPN, ABC, Lucasfilm, Pixar and Marvel.</p><p>AT&amp;T CEO Randall Stephenson has made it known that he wants AT&amp;T to control more programming. And the Comcast-NBC merger has proven that a content distribution firm can thrive by owning a media firm as well.</p><p>Bloomberg reported on Thursday that talks between AT&amp;T and Time Warner have been taking place for several weeks. </p><p>Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes is a \"willing seller\" if he \"gets an offer he thinks is fair,\" Bloomberg said, citing an anonymous source.</p><p>This isn't the first time that Time Warner has been in play. Rupert Murdoch's Fox made an offer for Time Warner in 2014 but withdrew the bid after it became clear that Time Warner was not interested in a deal.</p><p>At the time, a senior source involved in the bid said Murdoch was the wrong bidder at the wrong time.</p><p>\"Wait two or three years,\" the source said, \"and Time Warner will be on the market.\"</p><p>Sure enough, two years later there has been anticipation on Wall Street about a potential Time Warner transaction.</p><p>Analysts believe Time Warner's portfolio of entertainment and news businesses are a logical fit with several potential buyers, including AT&amp;T. Gabelli's Haverty said an AT&amp;T-Time Warner would make Stephenson's vision \"strategically complete.\"</p><p>It is also becoming clear that content can be very valuable to large technology firms as well. </p><p>There were rumors circulating on Wall Street earlier this year that Apple may be interested in making a bid for either Time Warner or Netflix. </p><p>Google parent Alphabet and Amazon have also been mentioned in vague trader chatter as possible acquirers of Time Warner or other big media companies.</p><p>But Haverty doesn't think that one of the big tech firms will buy Time Warner. </p><p>He notes that software firm Salesforce recently faced a shareholder revolt when it was rumored to be seriously considering a bid for struggling social media company Twitter -- and Salesforce ultimately decided against a deal.</p><p>Haverty said Apple or Alphabet could face similarly disgruntled investors if either proposed a purchase of Time Warner.</p><p>Still, any deal for Time Warner could kick off another wave of mergers in the media sector. </p><p>CBS, which also owns the cable network Showtime as well as the Eye Network, is already said to be in talks to reunite with Viacom, the owner of the Paramount movie studio, Nickelodeon and MTV. </p><p>Sumner Redstone and his family control both companies. </p><p>But Dave Novosel, a media analyst for corporate bond research firm Gimme Credit, noted in a report earlier this month that CBS might be more interested in selling to Time Warner instead of merging with Viacom.</p><p>\"We think that CBS would rather combine with Time Warner,\" he wrote, adding that \"Time Warner would provide an attractive film business, which CBS does not have but presumably would like\" and that \"HBO would be a nice complement to Showtime.\"</p><p>Whether or not Time Warner wants to be an acquirer as opposed to a seller is debatable. </p><p>A Time Warner acquisition may cause Fox and Disney to consider big deals of their own too.</p><p>To that end, shares of three other big cable programming companies -- AMC Networks, Discovery Communications and Scripps Networks Interactive -- all surged Friday as well. </p><p>If Time Warner is sold, it would mark the end of an era for what was once an even larger media powerhouse. </p><p>Time Warner controversially merged with AOL back in 2000, a deal that many still view as one of the least successful in corporate history.</p><p>But under the leadership of Bewkes, Time Warner has spun off AOL (now owned by Verizon), Time Warner Cable (now a part of Charter Communications) and the magazine and book publishing unit Time Inc.</p><p>\"Bewkes has created a pure play content firm that may only be rivaled by Disney. Selling to AT&amp;T would answer the question of what's next for Time Warner,\" Haverty said.</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2016 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

It also calls for urgent investment in media and information literacy education, and strategies to empower journalists and foster a diverse and sustainable news media ecosystem. The High-Level Expert Group (HLEG), which authored the report, was set up last November by the European Union\u2019s executive body to help inform its response to the \u2018fake news\u2019 crisis which is currently challenging Western lawmakers to come up with an effective and proportionate response. The HLEG favors the term \u2018disinformation\u2019 \u2014 arguing (quite rightly) that the \u2018fake news\u2019 badge does not adequately capture \u201cthe complex problems of disinformation that also involves content which blends fabricated information with facts\u201d. \u2018Fake news\u2019 has also of course become fatally politicized (hi, Trump!), and the label is frequently erroneously applied to try to close down criticism and derail debate by undermining trust and being insulting. </p><p>(Fake news really is best imagined as a self-feeding ouroboros.) \u201cDisinformation, as used in the Report, includes all forms of false, inaccurate, or misleading information designed, presented and promoted to intentionally cause public harm or for profit,\u201d says the HLEG\u2019s chair, professor Madeleine de Cock Buning, in a report forward. \u201cThis report is just the beginning of the process and will feed the Commission reflection on a response to the phenomenon,\u201d writes Mariya Gabriel, the EC commissioner for digital economy and society, in another forward. \u201cOur challenge will now lie in delivering concrete options that will safeguard EU values and benefit every European citizen.\u201d The Commission\u2019s next steps will be to work on coming up with those \u201ctangible options\u201d to better address the risks posed by disinformation being smeared around online. Gabriel writes that it\u2019s her intention to trigger \u201ca free, pluralistic democratic, societal, and economic debate in Europe\u201d which fully respects \u201cfundamental EU values, e.g. freedom of speech, media pluralism and media freedom\u201d. \u201cGiven the complexity of the problem, which requires a multi-stakeholder solution, there is no single lever to achieve these ambitions and eradicate disinformation from the media ecosystem,\u201d she adds. \u201cImproving the ability of platforms and media to address the phenomenon requires a holistic approach, the identification of areas where changes are required, and the development of specific recommendations in these areas.\u201d A \u201cmulti-dimensional\u201d approach There is certainly no single button fix being recommended here. Nor is the group advocating for any tangible social media regulations at this point. Rather, its 42-page report recommends a \u201cmulti-dimensional\u201d approach to tackling online disinformation, over the short and long term \u2014 including emphasizing the importance of media literacy and education and advocating for support for traditional media industries; at the same time as warning over censorship risks and calling for more research to underpin strategies that could help combat the problem. It does suggest a \u201cCode of Principles\u201d for online platforms and social networks to commit to \u2014 with increased transparency about how algorithms distribute news being one of several recommended steps. The report lists five core \u201cpillars\u201d which underpin the its various \u201cinterconnected and mutually reinforcing responses\u201d \u2014 all of which are in turn aimed at forming a holistic overarching strategy to attack the problem from multiple angles and time-scales. These five pillars are:  enhance transparency of online news, involving an adequate and privacy-compliant sharing of data about the systems that enable their circulation online;  promote media and information literacy to counter disinformation and help users navigate the digital media environment;  develop tools for empowering users and journalists to tackle disinformation and foster a positive engagement with fast-evolving information technologies;  safeguard the diversity and sustainability of the European news media ecosystem;  promote continued research on the impact of disinformation in Europe to evaluate the measures taken by different actors and constantly adjust the necessary responses; Zooming further in, the report discusses and promotes various actions \u2014 such as advocating for \u201cclearly identifiable\u201d disclosures for sponsored content, including for political ad purposes; and for information on payments to human influencers and the use of bot-based amplification techniques to be \u201cmade available in order for users to understand whether the apparent popularity of a given piece of online information or the apparent popularity of an influencer is the result of artificial amplification or is supported by targeted investment\u201d. It also promotes a strategy of battling \u2018bad speech\u2019 by expanding access to \u2018more, better speech\u2019 \u2014 promoting the idea that disinformation could be \u2018diluted\u2019 \u201cwith quality information\u201d. Although, on that front, a recent piece of MIT research investigating how fact-checked information spreads on Twitter, studying a decade\u2019s worth of tweets, suggests that without some form of very specific algorithmic intervention such an approach could well struggle to triumph against human nature \u2014 as information that has been fact-checked as false was found to spread further and faster than information that had been fact-checked as true. In short, humans find clickbait more spreadable. And that\u2019s why, at least in part, disinformation has scaled into the horribly self-reinforcing problem it has. A bit of algorithmic transparency The report\u2019s push for a degree of algorithmic accountability by calling for a little disinfecting transparency from tech platforms is perhaps its most interesting and edgy aspect. Though its suggestions here are extremely cautious. \u201c[P]latforms should provide transparent and relevant information on the functioning of algorithms that select and display information without prejudice to platforms IPRs [intellectual property rights],\u201d the committee of experts writes. \u201cTransparency of algorithms needs to be addressed with caution. Platforms are unique in the way they provide access to information depending on their technological design, and therefore measures to access information will always be reliant on the type of platform. \u201cIt is acknowledged however that, more information on the working of algorithms would enable users to better understand why they get the information that they get via platform services, and would help newsrooms to better market their services online. As a first step platforms should create contact desks where media outlets can get such information.\u201d The HLEG\u2019s is itself made up of 39 members \u2014 billed as representing a range of industry and stakeholder points of view \u201cfrom the civil society, social media platforms, news media organisations, journalists and academia\u201d. And, yes, staffers from Facebook, Google and Twitter are listed as members \u2014 so the major social media tech platforms and disinformation spreaders are directly involved in shaping these recommendations. (See the end of this post for the full list of people/organizations in the HLEG.) A Twitter spokesman confirmed the company has been engaged with the process from the beginning but declined to provide a statement in response to the report. At the time of writing requests for comment from Facebook and Google had not been answered. The presence of powerful tech platforms in the Commission\u2019s advisor body on this issue may explain why the group\u2019s suggestions on algorithmic accountability comes across as rather dilute. Though you could say that at least the importance of increased transparency is being affirmed \u2014 even by social media\u2019s giants. But are platforms the real problem? One of the HLEG\u2019s members, European consumer advocacy organization BEUC, voted against the report \u2014 arguing the group had missed an opportunity to push for a sector inquiry to investigate the link between advertising revenue policies of platforms and the dissemination of disinformation. And this criticism does seem to have some substance. As, for all the report\u2019s discussion of possible ways to support a pluralistic news media ecosystem, the unspoken elephant in the room is that Facebook and Google are gobbling up the majority of digital advertising profits. Facebook very deliberately made news distribution its business \u2014 even if it\u2019s dialing back that approach now, in the face of a backlash. In a critical statement, Monique Goyens, director general of BEUC, said: \u201cThis report contains many useful recommendations but fails to touch upon one of the core causes of fake news. Disinformation is spreading too easily online. Evidence of the role of behavioral advertising in the dissemination of fake news is piling up. Platforms such as Google or Facebook massively benefit from users reading and sharing fake news articles which contain advertisements. But this expert group choose to ignore this business model. This is head-in-the-sand politics.\u201d Giving another assessment, academic Paul Bernal, IT, IP and media law lecturer at the UEA School of Law in the UK, and not himself a member of the HLEG, also argues the report comes up short \u2014 by failing to robustly interrogate the role of platform power in the spread of disinformation. His view is that \u201cthe whole idea of \u2018sharing\u2019 as a mantra\u201d is inherently linked to disinformation\u2019s power online. \u201c[The report] is a start, but it misses some fundamental issues. The point about promoting media and information literacy is the biggest and most important one \u2014 I don\u2019t think it can be emphasized enough, but it needs to be broader than it immediately appears. People need to understand not only when \u2018news\u2019 is misinformation, but to understand the way it is spread,\u201d Bernal told TechCrunch. \u201cThat means questioning the role of social media \u2014 and here I don\u2019t think the High Level Group has been brave enough. Their recommendations don\u2019t even mention addressing this, and I find myself wondering why. \u201cFrom my own research, the biggest single factor in the current problem is the way that news is distributed \u2014 Facebook, Google and Twitter in particular.\u201d \u201cWe need to find a way to help people to wean themselves off using Facebook as a source of news \u2014 the very nature of Facebook means that misinformation will be spread, and politically motivated misinformation in particular,\u201d he added. \u201cUnless this is addressed, almost everything else is just rearranging the deckchairs on the Titanic.\u201d Beyond filter bubbles But Lisa-Maria Neudert, a researcher at the Oxford Internet Institute, who says she was involved with the HLEG\u2019s work (her colleague at the Institute, Rasmus Nielsen, is also a member of the group), played down the notion that the report is not robust enough in probing how social media platforms are accelerating the problem of disinformation \u2014 flagging its call for increased transparency and for strategies to create \u201ca media ecosystem that is more diverse and is more sustainable\u201d. Though she added: \u201cI can see, however, how one of the common critiques would be that the social networks themselves need to do more.\u201d She went on to suggest that negative results following Germany\u2019s decision to push for a social media hate speech law \u2014 which requires valid takedowns to be executed within 24 hours and includes a regime of penalties that can scale up to \u20ac50M \u2014 may have influenced the group\u2019s decision to push for a far more light-touch approach. The Commission itself has warned it could draw up EU-wide legislation to regulate platforms over hate speech. Though, for now, it\u2019s been pursuing a voluntary Code of Conduct approach. (It has also been turning up the heat over terrorist content specifically.) \u201c[In Germany social media platforms] have an incentive to delete content really generously because there are heavy fines if they fail to take down content,\u201d said Neudert, criticizing the regulation. \u201c[Another] catch is that there is no legal oversight involved. So now you have, basically, social networks making decisions that used to be with courts and that often used to be a matter of months and months of weighing different legal [considerations].\u201d \u201cThat also just really clearly showed that once you are thinking about regulation, it is really important that regulators as well as tech companies, and as well as the media system, are really working together here. Because we are at a point where we have very complex systems, we have very complex levers, we have a lot of information133; So it is a delicate topic, really, and I think there\u2019s no catch-all regulation where we can get rid of all the fake news.\u201d Also today, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the world wide web, published an open letter warning that disinformation threatens the social utility of the web, and making the case for a direct causal link between a few \u201cpowerful\u201d big tech platforms and false information being accelerated damagingly online. In contrast to his assessment, the report\u2019s weakness in speaking directly to any link between big tech platforms and disinformation does look pretty gaping. Asked about this, Neudert agreed the topic is being \u201ctalked about in the EU\u201d, though she said it\u2019s being discussed more within the context of antitrust. She also claimed there\u2019s a growing body of research \u201cdebunking the idea that we have filter bubbles\u201d, and counter-suggesting that online influence sources are in fact \u201cmore diverse\u201d. \u201cI oftentimes do feel like I live in my own personal social bubble or echo chamber. However research does suggest otherwise \u2014 it does suggest that there\u2019s, on the one hand, much more information that we\u2019re getting, and also much more diverse information that we\u2019re getting,\u201d she claimed. \u201cI\u2019m not so sure if your Facebook or if your Twitter is actually a gatekeeper of information,\u201d she added. \u201cI think your Facebook and your Twitter on some hand still, more or less, give you all of the information you have on the Internet. \u201cWhere it gets more problematic is then if you also have algorithms on top of it that are promoting some issue to make them appear larger over the Internet \u2014 to make them appear at the very top of the news feed.\u201d She gave the example \u2014 also called out recently in an article by academic and techno-sociologist, Zeynep Tufecki \u2014 of YouTube\u2019s problematic recommendation algorithms, which have been accused of having a quasi-radicalizing effect because they are choosing ever more extreme content to surface in their mission to keep viewers engaged. \u201cThis is where I think this argument is becoming powerful,\u201d Neudert told TechCrunch. \u201cIt is not something where the truth is already dictated and where it is set in stone. A lot of the outcomes are really emerging. \u201cThe other part of course is you can have many, many different and diverse opinions \u2014 but there\u2019s also things to be said about what are the effects of information being presented in whatever kind of format, providing it with credibility, and people trusting that kind of information.\u201d Being able to distinguish between fact and fiction on social media is \u201csuch a pressing problem\u201d, she added. Less trusted sources One tangible result of that pressing fact or fiction problem that\u2019s also being highlighted by the Commission today in a related piece of work \u2014 its latest Eurobarometer survey \u2014 is the erosion of consumer trust in tech platforms. The majority of respondents to this EC survey viewed traditional media as the most trusted source of news (radio 70%, TV 66%, print 63%) vs online sources being the least trusted (26% and 27%, respectively for news and video hosting websites). So there seem to be some pretty clear trust risks, at least, for tech platforms becoming synonymous with online disinformation. The vast majority of Eurobarometer survey respondents (83%) also said they viewed fake news as a danger to democracy \u2014 whatever fake news meant to them in the moment they were being asked for their views on it. And those figures could certainly be read \u2014 or spun \u2014 as support for new regulations. So again, platforms do need to worry about public opinion. Discussing potential technology-based responses to help combat disinformation, Neudert\u2019s view is that automated fact-checking tools and bot detectors are \u201cgetting better\u201d \u2014 and even \u201cgetting useful\u201d when combined with the work of human checkers. \u201cFor the next couple of years that to me looks like the lowest fruitful approach,\u201d she said, advocating for such tools as an alternative and proportionate strategy (vs the stick of a new legal regime) for working across the vast scale of online content that needs moderation without risking the pitfall of chilling censorship. \u201cI do think that this combination of technology to drive attention to patterns of problems, and to larger trends of problem areas, and that then combined with human oversight, human detection, human debunking, right now is an important alley to go to,\u201d she said. But to achieve gains there she conceded that access to platforms\u2019 metadata will be crucial \u2014 access that, it must also be said, is most certainly not the rule right now; and which has also frequently not been forthcoming, even when platforms were reasonably pressed regarding specific concerns. Despite the closed door historical arrogance of platforms to access requests, Neudert nevertheless argues for \u201cflexibility\u201d now and \u201cmore dialogue and \u201cmore openness\u201d, rather than heavy-handed German-style content laws. But she also cautions that online disinformation is likely to get worse in the short term, with AI now being actively deployed in the potentially lucrative business of creating fakes, such as Adobe\u2019s experiments with its VoCo speech editing tool. Wider industry pushes to engineer better conversational systems to enhance products like voice assistants are also fueling developments here. \u201cMy worry is also that there are a lot of people who have a lot of interest in putting money towards [systems that can create plausible fakes],\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of money is being devoted to artificial intelligence getting better and better and it can be used for the one side but it can also be used for the other side. \u201cI do hope with the technology developing and getting better we also have a simultaneous movement of research to debunk what is a fake, what is not a fake.\u201d On the lesser known anti-fake tech front she said interesting things are happening too, flagging a tool that can analyze videos to determine whether a human in a clip has \u201ca real pulse\u201d and \u201creal breathing\u201d, for example. \u201cThere is a lot of super interesting things that can be done around that,\u201d she added. \u201cBut I hope that kind of research also gets the money and gets the attention that it needs because maybe it is not something that is as easily monetizable as, say, deepfake software.\u201d One thing is becoming crystal clear about disinformation: This is a human problem. Perhaps the oldest and most human problem there is. It\u2019s just that now we\u2019re having to confront these unpleasant and inconvenient fundamental truths about our nature writ very large indeed \u2014 not just acted out online but also accelerated by the digital sphere. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RVMPCU-RLPMN662178720180313</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RVMPCU2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RVS-7PW1-J9XT-P2C7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">424987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3227\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Plus Company Updates(PCU)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"45923\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 13, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

However, the innovation landscape is uncertain as \"BigTech1\" entrants make their presence felt and incumbents face technical and regulatory complexity in developing collaborative payments ecosystems between themselves and fintechs. </p><p>More than bank-led initiatives will be needed to grow the new payments landscape, the report noted. The broader financial services community\u2014 including public-sector organizations, regulators and third parties \u2014have to work together with large payment users to ensure a smooth, balanced and robust payments ecosystem, according to a press release on the report. Non-cash transactions are expected to post a compound annual growth rate of 12.7 percent through to 2021, following growth of 10.1 percent in 2015-16, which saw the total volume of non-cash transactions reach $482.6 billion.Developing markets lead growthDeveloping markets are driving the non-cash boom, with Russia (CAGR of 36.5 percent), India (33.2 percent) and China (25.8 percent) as notable movers during 2015-16. Mature markets maintained steady growth of more than 7 percent. Developing markets are set to post a 21.6 percent CAGR, led by Asia at 28.8 percent over the next five years. By 2021, developing markets are expected to account for around half of all non-cash transactions worldwide, overtaking the mature markets for the first time, whose current share stands at 66.3 percent.Big tech firms open e-walletsDisruption of the payments market is accelerating as new technologies take hold. In particular, e-wallets are on the rise and present a major market opportunity for non-traditional payments providers. In 2016, e-wallets accounted for 8.6 percent of non-cash transactions (a volume of $41.8 billion), of which 71 percent were facilitated by big tech providers. Although disruption is accelerating and market entrants are proliferating, there are regulatory and technical complexity challenges to the development of innovative new payments ecosystems. Only 38 percent of bank executives said they were \"planning an anchor role\"in new payments ecosystems. \"As demand for digital payments is strong, especially in developing markets, some banks may want to revisit their choice to not seek an anchor role in the new emerging payments ecosystem,\" Anirban Bose, CEO of Capgemini's Financial Services and a member of the group's executive board, said in the release. \"With their significant market share in the payments industry and implementation of new technologies, banks are in a unique position to shape the marketplace. They can also create new revenue streams through innovative, collaborative relationships with fintechs and active participation by the broader financial services community.\" Like banks, corporate treasurers should also consider their role in the new ecosystem as they expect value-added services that are safe, efficient, reliable and global and could co-design these services with banks. \"Large payments users are also a key constituency in the evolution of innovation in the payments industry. Without their participation, payments services providers are missing a vital opportunity to shape new offerings in transaction banking such as in cash aggregation, cash forecasting and automated treasury,\" said Bruno Mellado, head of international payments and receivables at BNP Paribas, in the release. \"These offerings could equip corporate treasurers with the means to move beyond a tactical or operational role and towards a more strategic one for their companies.\"Innovation faces complexitiesMany respondents said adoption of a real-time payments infrastructure was being inhibited by lack of interoperability between schemes (identified by 74.1 percent of executives) and weak data and authorization standardization (59.3 percent). Regarding distributed ledger technology, 85.9 percent highlighted lack of interoperability, 83.1 percent lack of regulatory clarity, and 77.1 percent ability to scale, as factors limiting adoption. The report also noted regulatory and industry initiatives are threatening to create conflicts as they spread from a regional to a global level. Conflicting KRIIs pose implementation and operational challenges that could hinder the transition to new payments ecosystems. Examples include the Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (5AMLD) and PSD2 conflict, as well as GDPR and PSD2. The World Payments Report 2018 is comprised of primary research based on executive interviews and an online survey. This edition also includes the introduction of the Payments Open Banking Assessment, which demonstrates the state of open banking in 16 countries from a payments perspective.

Researchers warn that this centralization and subsequent sale of personal data amounts to a direct threat on rights of privacy, freedom of opinion and expression, freedom of thought and the right to equality and non-discrimination.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Google and Facebook dominate our modern lives - amassing unparalleled power over the digital world by harvesting and monetizing the personal data of billions of people,\" said Kumi Naidoo, secretary general of Amnesty International. \"Their insidious control of our digital lives undermines the very essence of privacy and is one of the defning human rights challenges of our era.</p><p>\"To protect our core human values in the digital age - dignity, autonomy, privacy - there needs to be a radical overhaul of the way Big Tech operates, and to move to an Internet that has human rights at its core,\" he added.</p><p>The report contends that Google and Facebook have established dominance over the primary channels that most of the world, outside of China, relies on to realize their rights online.</p><p>The various platforms they own, including Facebook, Instagram, Google Search, YouTube and WhatsApp, facilitate the ways people seek and share information, engage in debate and participate in society. Google's Android also underpins most of the world's smartphones.</p><p>It highlights that though other big tech companies like Amazon and Apple hold a signifcant share of the personalized information market, Facebook and Google continue to dominate the area and have set up a \"new global public square\" of ideas and engagement.</p><p>The report argues that opting in and utilizing the social media landscape has become a double-edged sword for users of the two platforms. As lives become increasingly intertwined and dependent on Facebook and Google's technologies, users are forced to pay for these \"free\" services with their intimate personal data, which is constantly tracked and collected.</p><p>\"The Internet is vital for people to enjoy many of their rights, yet billions of people have no meaningful choice but to access this public space on terms dictated by Facebook and Google,\" Naidoo said.</p><p>\"To make it worse this isn't the Internet people signed up for when these platforms started out. Google and Facebook chipped away at our privacy over time. We are now trapped. Either we must submit to this pervasive surveillance machinery - where our data is easily weaponized to manipulate and infuence us - or forego the benefts of the digital world. This can never be a legitimate choice. We must reclaim this essential public square, so we can participate without having our rights abused.\"</p><p>The Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which private information from Facebook users was harvested and then used by Ted Cruz's presidential campaign, shows that information mined for nefarious purposes is the same data used to generate personalized advertisement experiences by Face-book and Google. The companies' complex algorithms exist to aid advertisers in strategically marketing users.</p><p>Personalization also means the catering of users' experiences towards their ideological interests. The report fnds that Facebook and Google's algorithms are designed to \"nudge people towards particular outcomes based on an individual's unique personal characteristics.\"</p><p>These algorithms are said to take away personal autonomy through distraction and constant bombardment and manufacture actions and beliefs in such a way that they pose a threat to people's right to think freely without coercion.</p><p>As such, Amnesty International has called for a \"new Internet\" in which governments take action to overhaul the surveillance-based business model and protect us from corporate human rights abuses by enforcing robust data protection laws and effective regulation of Big Tech in line with human rights law.</p><p>\"Facebook and Google must not be allowed to dictate how we live online,\" Naidoo said. \"These companies have chosen a specifc surveillance-business model that impacts on privacy, freedom of expression and other human rights. The technology behind the Internet is not incompatible with our rights, but the business model Facebook and Google have chosen is.\"</p><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has continuously insisted, most recently in front of a U.S. Congressional committee, that the data is collected and mined and sold to advertisers to pay towards the company's operating budget and for its profts. He has stated that collecting users' personal data is the only way to keep the social media service free.</p><p>Google and Facebook chipped away at our privacy over time. We are now trapped.

Researchers warn that this centralization and subsequent sale of personal data amounts to a direct threat on rights of privacy, freedom of opinion and expression, freedom of thought and the right to equality and non-discrimination.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Google and Facebook dominate our modern lives - amassing unparalleled power over the digital world by harvesting and monetizing the personal data of billions of people,\" said Kumi Naidoo, secretary general of Amnesty International. \"Their insidious control of our digital lives undermines the very essence of privacy and is one of the defning human rights challenges of our era.</p><p>\"To protect our core human values in the digital age - dignity, autonomy, privacy - there needs to be a radical overhaul of the way Big Tech operates, and to move to an Internet that has human rights at its core,\" he added.</p><p>The report contends that Google and Facebook have established dominance over the primary channels that most of the world, outside of China, relies on to realize their rights online.</p><p>The various platforms they own, including Facebook, Instagram, Google Search, YouTube and WhatsApp, facilitate the ways people seek and share information, engage in debate and participate in society. Google's Android also underpins most of the world's smartphones.</p><p>It highlights that though other big tech companies like Amazon and Apple hold a signifcant share of the personalized information market, Facebook and Google continue to dominate the area and have set up a \"new global public square\" of ideas and engagement.</p><p>The report argues that opting in and utilizing the social media landscape has become a double-edged sword for users of the two platforms. As lives become increasingly intertwined and dependent on Facebook and Google's technologies, users are forced to pay for these \"free\" services with their intimate personal data, which is constantly tracked and collected.</p><p>\"The Internet is vital for people to enjoy many of their rights, yet billions of people have no meaningful choice but to access this public space on terms dictated by Facebook and Google,\" Naidoo said.</p><p>\"To make it worse this isn't the Internet people signed up for when these platforms started out. Google and Facebook chipped away at our privacy over time. We are now trapped. Either we must submit to this pervasive surveillance machinery - where our data is easily weaponized to manipulate and infuence us - or forego the benefts of the digital world. This can never be a legitimate choice. We must reclaim this essential public square, so we can participate without having our rights abused.\"</p><p>The Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which private information from Facebook users was harvested and then used by Ted Cruz's presidential campaign, shows that information mined for nefarious purposes is the same data used to generate personalized advertisement experiences by Face-book and Google. The companies' complex algorithms exist to aid advertisers in strategically marketing users.</p><p>Personalization also means the catering of users' experiences towards their ideological interests. The report fnds that Facebook and Google's algorithms are designed to \"nudge people towards particular outcomes based on an individual's unique personal characteristics.\"</p><p>These algorithms are said to take away personal autonomy through distraction and constant bombardment and manufacture actions and beliefs in such a way that they pose a threat to people's right to think freely without coercion.</p><p>As such, Amnesty International has called for a \"new Internet\" in which governments take action to overhaul the surveillance-based business model and protect us from corporate human rights abuses by enforcing robust data protection laws and effective regulation of Big Tech in line with human rights law.</p><p>\"Facebook and Google must not be allowed to dictate how we live online,\" Naidoo said. \"These companies have chosen a specifc surveillance-business model that impacts on privacy, freedom of expression and other human rights. The technology behind the Internet is not incompatible with our rights, but the business model Facebook and Google have chosen is.\"</p><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has continuously insisted, most recently in front of a U.S. Congressional committee, that the data is collected and mined and sold to advertisers to pay towards the company's operating budget and for its profts. He has stated that collecting users' personal data is the only way to keep the social media service free.</p><p>Google and Facebook chipped away at our privacy over time. We are now trapped.
