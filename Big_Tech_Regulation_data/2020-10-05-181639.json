However, a review of tax documents from other organizations shows that in 2018 it received more than $1.4 million from The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), the drug industry's top lobbying group. In 2017 it received $1.3 million from PhRMA. Merck and Genentech are both members of PhRMA.The nonprofit also received $519,000 in 2018 from the Partnership for America's Health Care Future (PAHCF), a coalition of pharmaceutical, health insurance, hospital groups formed to fight single-payer and public-option health care proposals. </p><p>PAHCF members include PhRMA and another drug industry trade group, the Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO).Two Center Forward board members are lobbyists for PhRMA. Elizabeth Greer and Cindy Brown, both employed at Forbes Tate Partners,reported[2]lobbying Congress for PhRMA as recently as the third quarter of 2019 on issues like pharmaceutical drug prices, drug importation, data exclusivity periods for drugs in the proposed United StatesMexico Canada trade agreement, and more.Greer and Brown are both also registered as lobbyists for Merck and Genentech's parent company, Roche Holding, as well as PAHCF.House ethicsrules[3]limit House staffers' ability to accept travel for multiday trips from entities, including nonprofits, that retain or employ registered lobbyists. However, because Center Forward's lobbyist board members are not considered employees of the organization, the trip likely does not violate the rules.The 13 staffers who took the trip are legislative directors and policy advisers from both Republican and Democratic offices, and six of them work for members who serve on theHealth Subcommittee[4]of the Energy and Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over pharmaceutical research and development and the regulation of drugs and medical devices. Center Forward paid approximately $1,500 per staffer for food, travel, and accommodation expenses.During their visit, the staffers stayed at the International Mark Hopkins Hotel in Nob Hill, an upscale San Francisco neighborhood. The hotel's penthouse restaurant, Top Of The Mark, offers views of the city skyline and the Bay and Golden Gate Bridges, with a farm-to-tablemenu[5]of small-bites andhouse cocktails[6].The two-day event, called the 'Center Forward Innovation Conference,' appears to have been kept under wraps. Center Forward's website and social media accounts do not contain any mention of the event and it does not appear that any of the staffers who attended or their employers made any information about the event public.According to a tripitinerary[7]reviewed by Sludge, Center Forward kicked off the first day at the South San Francisco campus of drug company Genentech, where attendees met with the company's chief executive officer, Alexander Hardy. After having lunch with Hardy, they moved on to a discussion on innovation in pricing and care delivery methods with Genentech's senior vice president of managed care and customer operations Marc Watrous.The staffers then met with Rhona O'Leary, Genentech's global head of portfolio and product development strategy, to 'dive into how therapeutic decisions are made, the research process that can bring treatments to patients, and the types of cures we can expect to see over the next several decades.'One of PhRMA's chief talking points against H.R. 3, a bill before Congress this week that would allow the government to negotiate prices with drug companies, is that it would decrease the profit incentive for the companies to invest in research and development process needed to create new medicines. The Congressional Budget Office's preliminary analysis of the bill predicted that the lower drug prices resulting from the bill would reduce new approved drugs by about 5% over the next ten years. Politifact rated PhRMA's claims about the bill as 'mostly false,'[8]quoting a health policy expert, 'there is a good reason to believe that the drugs you would lose are those that have the smallest benefit and highest price tag.'In the third quarter of 2019, Genentech reported spending $2.6 million on lobbying the House of Representatives and other federal government bodies on a range of issues including 'issues relating to drug pricing.' PhRMA has reported spening $22.7 million on lobbying the federal government so far this year.Following their time at Genentech, the staffers visited the offices of drug company Merck, another PhRMA member, where they heard from three executives on 'the process of getting a treatment from introductory research all the way to the doctor's office.'Center Forward's healthcare program coordinator, Kaitlyn Lane, whose email is provided as the organizational contact on the travel disclosures, did not respond to a request for comment. Meeting With Big Tech On the second day of the trip, Center Forward took the staffers to 1 Hacker Way in Menlo Park to meet with executives at Facebook and discuss issues that are the subject of legislative discussions in Congress. Among the issues covered was Bitcoin and blockchain in a discussion with Facebook's head of payments policy Leena Im. Facebook is pursuing a blockchain-based payment system called Libra that has recently been the subject of congressional scrutiny, including by representatives whoown Facebook stock[9].Facebook retains another lobbying group that employs a Center Forward board member. According to areport[10]by Corporate Europe, Facebook has paid at least \u20ac300,000 to FTI Consulting, a D.C. firm that counts among its lobbyists former Rep. Bud Cramer (D-Ala.), the chairman of Center Forward's board. After retiring from a safe seat in Congress in 2009, Cramerjoined[11]lobbying firm Wexler ...lker, before moving in 2014 to FTI Government Affairs.In the afternoon, the staffers headed to Apple's offices in Cupertino where they met with executives to discuss the company's health care technology and the techniques the company uses to protect its users' data. The third day of the trip included a visit to the offices of Uber, where staffers heard from the company's communications lead about transportation infrastructure issues and its general counsel about 'how employers and employees are adapting to new types of work.'Center Forward has anaffiliated political action committee[12]that is funded primarily by contributions from its nonprofit arm. In the 2017-18 election cycle, Center Forward's PAC gave $200,000 to two organizations supporting centrist Democrats, Blue Dog PAC and New Democrat Coalition, and made $1.2 million worth of federal independent expenditures supporting moderate Democrats' elections.The staffers who went on the trip are Elizabeth Allen, senior health policy adviser for Health Subcommittee Ranking Member Rep. Michael Burgess (R-Texas); Jimmy Ballard, legislative director for Rep. Rodney Davis (R-Ill.); Kevin Daswon, legislative assistant for Rep. Mike Kelly (R-Pa.); Liana Guerra, deputy chief of staff for Rep. Darren Soto (D-Fla.); Ben Jackson, Legislative Director for Rep. Lizzie Fletcher (D-Texas); Travis Krogman, legislative director for Rep. Annie Kuster (D-N.H.); Brian Looser, legislative director for Rep. John Shimkus (R-Ill.); Janell McClure, legislative director for Rep. Collin Allred (D-Texas); Kelly Nickel, senior policy adviser for Rep. Kurt Shrader (D-Ore.); Dao Nguyen, senior policy adviser for Blue Dog Coalition Co-Chair Rep. Stephanie Murphy (D-Fla.); Zachary Ostro, legislative director for Rep. Robin Kelly (D-Ill.); Ted Steinberg, legislative assistant for Rep. Brendan Boyle (D-Pa.); and Sophie Trainor, deputy chief of staff and legislative director for Rep. Brett Guthrie (R-Ky).

Then on the same day CNBC[4] reported the introduction of a bipartisan Senate bill[5] 'that would funnel $100 million to develop U.S. manufacturing of drugs'. The bill's sponsors\u2014Sens. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) and Bob Menendez (D-NJ)\u2014are 'concerned about possible drug shortages amid the coronavirus outbreak'. According to CNBC: About 72% of manufacturers of pharmaceutical ingredients supplying the U.S. are overseas, including 13% in China, according to FDA testimony last year. That could make U.S drug companies vulnerable to shortages if COVID-19 forces factories to shutter and shipments to the United States to stall, experts have warned. </p><p>This bill 'is at least the third legislative proposal addressing the issue'. The other two measures are also bipartisan in nature, suggesting broad support for incentivizing, and in some cases forcing[6], a return of pharma to the United States. U.S. legislators are not just concerned about pharma offshoring generally, but about China specifically. Introducing the Pharmaceutical Independent Long-Term Readiness Reform Act[7], Rep. Vicky Hartzler (D-MO) bluntly stated: China having control over the production of our military's medicine poses a grave national security threat. Not only does it open the possibility of them deliberately manipulating our servicemember's medical regimens to cause physical harm, but the Chinese government's lack of proper oversight and regulatory standards on prescription drugs is also deeply alarming to me. We need to ensure that our military's medicine is American-made. The bill's cosponsor, Rep. John Garamendi (R-CA), piled on. Right now, China has the ability to attack the United States without firing a single shot by poisoning our servicemembers' medicines or cutting off their supply. The Chinese government is the principal developer of generic prescriptions, which account for approximately 90 percent of pharmaceuticals. China's chokehold on the global pharmaceutical market leaves our servicemembers and our nation vulnerable to attack. We need to reinvigorate the United States industrial base to produce generic medicines and antibiotics domestically. I know from conversations with Puerto Rican business leaders that they are gearing up to take advantage of the opportunities. But whether a considerable part of any repatriated pharma production ends up in Puerto Rico specifically is beside the point. In fact, Sen. Menendez is hoping that with its 'leadership in the life sciences industry and institutes of learning', his home state of New Jersey[8] 'can lead the way and make a difference'. What matters is that there will be enormous pressure for U.S. pharma to come back home, powered by national security concerns. And as we discussed in our post earlier this week onforced labor in China[9], pharma is likely just be the beginning[10].

Not accepting cash can speed up lines and make life easier for card-carrying consumers. But a backlash has grown, as the cashless trend leaves out lower-income customers who may not have a bank account. </p><p>Massachusetts and Philadelphia have already banned stores from rejecting cash as payment, and New York City and New Jersey are considering similar measures. This could affect the growth of Amazon[2]'s physical stores, which do not accept cash. Cashless stores are becoming controversial. Stores that do not accept cash are on the rise, from quick-service lunch spots to Amazon's physical stores. Not accepting cash can speed up lines or eliminate them altogether, making life easier for card-carrying consumers. Not everybody is on board with this cashless utopia, however. Backlash has started, as the cashless trend leaves out lower-income customers who may not have a bank account. As of last year, an estimated 15.6 million people in the US[3] do not have a bank account. Philadelphia recently banned stores from choosing not to accept cash. \"Most of the people who don't have credit tend to be lower income, minority, immigrants. It just seemed to me, if not intentional, at least a form of discrimination,\" Philadelphia City Councilman William Greenlee told the Wall Street Journal[4]. Massachusetts has already banned stores from rejecting cash as payment. Lawmakers in New York City and New Jersey are considering similar measures. A ban like this will predominantly affect chic lunch spots like Sweetgreen, but also Amazon's nascent physical store footprint. None of Amazon's stores accept cash unless required by law. Read more: Amazon is closing all 87 of its pop-up stores, reportedly laying off all employees[5] In fact, the whole point of Amazon Go, the chain's tech-powered cashierless convenience store, is that there's no need to pay a cashier. Customers can just swipe their app and go. The store's cameras and sensors will see what you take and charge you accordingly. An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment to Business Insider. Amazon had reportedly expressed concern about the law in Philadelphia, telling the city's department of commerce \"several times\" that it would not open an Amazon Go store in the city if the law passed, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer[6]. The new law does allow for a store to use only app-based transactions, but only if a paid membership is required to shop there. You don't need a paid Prime membership to shop at Amazon's Go stores \u2014 only an Amazon account \u2014 eliminating the potential for a loophole.NOW WATCH: Fewer Americans are celebrating

As the author James Barrat put it, a superhuman intelligence, equipped with the ability to learn but without the ability to empathise, might well be Our Final Invention.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Even if the machines are not going to kill us, there are plenty of reasons to worry that AI will be used for ill as well as for good, and that advances in the field are coming faster than our ability to think through the consequences.</p><p>Between facial recognition and autonomous drones, AI's potential impact on warfare is already obvious, stirring employee concern at Google and other pioneers in the field. Faced with an internal revolt, Google last year said it would drop much of its work for the Pentagon and withhold AI technology that could be used for weapons. That may restore harmony at the Googleplex, but it is hardly likely to end the AI arms race. Russian President Vladimir Putin puts it this way: \"Whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world.\"</p><p>Other fears include whether AI algorithms are reinforcing racial stereotypes, gender biases and other prejudices as a result of a lack of diversity among scientists in the field - and of what happens to society when robots can do most jobs. All of which is to say promoting debate on the ethics and consequences of AI, and nudging the science, business and regulation of AI in the right direction, seems a worthy use of philanthropic dollars. It is also fascinating - an often underestimated reason for picking a philanthropic cause.</p><p>Explaining his \u00a3150m Oxford university gift, part of which will go to creating an Institute for Ethics in AI, Stephen Schwarzman, founder of private equity house Blackstone, said in June he wanted \"to be part of this dialogue, to try to help the system regulate itself so innocent people who are just living their lives don't end up disadvantaged. If you start dislocating people, and your tax revenues go down, your social costs go up, your voting patterns change... you could endanger the underpinnings of liberal democracies.\" Last year he wrote an even bigger cheque to Massachusetts Institute of Technology to create a new centre for AI research.</p><p>Those donations together make Schwarzman probably AI's largest donor. Pierre Omidyar, founder of eBay, Nicolas Berggruen, the financier once known as the \"homeless billionaire\" before he settled in Los Angeles, and LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman are among the others. In this field, however, there is a limit to the power of philanthropy.</p><p>Hoffman is the biggest backer of OpenAI, a hugely ambitious project founded in San Francisco by Musk - before he left, citing conflicts of interest as Tesla boosts the autonomous capabilities of its cars. OpenAI was set up as a nonprofit with the aim of building a neural network the size of a human brain - a so-called artificial general intelligence - making its work open source so that it would be a blueprint for the safe and ethical development of AI. But that put OpenAI in direct competition with big tech companies, which have the resources to pay for scientific talent and computing power.</p><p>It switched to a for-profit structure last year, saying it needed billions of dollars in investment, and this summer it announced it was aligning itself with Microsoft, which is putting in $1bn (\u00a3811m) to help OpenAI to pay for computing services from Azure, Microsoft's cloud. In the field of AI, charitable dollars seem best channelled to the ethical rather than the technological debate.</p><p>Berggruen, whose ventures include a $1m annual prize for philosophy, sounds like he is having the most fun. The Berggruen Institute's \"Transformations of the Human\" project places philosophers and artists in key research sites to foster dialogue with technologists, to \"contribute to both human and non-human flourishing\".</p><p>When it comes to philanthropy, robots may need support, too.</p><p>ARTICLE REPUBLISHED FROM THE FINANCIAL TIMES</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IINDUK-INMLMMGLSTRY000032620079-ARTICLE-TEXT-1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IINDUK2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X09-3241-JCS0-D033-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">379735</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"720\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Independent Print Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>i-Independent Print Ltd</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"17013\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Second Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 6, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>CC000581R</classCode><className>TESLA AS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>NAICS334220 RADIO &amp;

Faced with an internal revolt, Google last year said it would drop much of its work for the Pentagon and withhold AI technology that could be used for weapons. That may restore harmony at the Googleplex, but it is hardly likely to end the AI arms race. Russian President Vladimir Putin puts it this way: \"Whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world.\"</p><p>Other fears include whether AI algorithms are reinforcing racial stereotypes, gender biases and other prejudices as a result of a lack of diversity among scientists in the field - and of what happens to society when robots can do most jobs. All of which is to say promoting debate on the ethics and consequences of AI, and nudging the science, business and regulation of AI in the right direction, seems a worthy use of philanthropic dollars. It is also fascinating - an often underestimated reason for picking a philanthropic cause.</p><p>Explaining his \u00a3150m Oxford university gift, part of which will go to creating an Institute for Ethics in AI, Stephen Schwarzman, founder of private equity house Blackstone, said in June he wanted \"to be part of this dialogue, to try to help the system regulate itself so innocent people who are just living their lives don't end up disadvantaged. If you start dislocating people, and your tax revenues go down, your social costs go up, your voting patterns change... you could endanger the underpinnings of liberal democracies.\" Last year he wrote an even bigger cheque to Massachusetts Institute of Technology to create a new centre for AI research.</p><p>Those donations together make Schwarzman probably AI's largest donor. Pierre Omidyar, founder of eBay, Nicolas Berggruen, the financier once known as the \"homeless billionaire\" before he settled in Los Angeles, and LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman are among the others. In this field, however, there is a limit to the power of philanthropy.</p><p>Hoffman is the biggest backer of OpenAI, a hugely ambitious project founded in San Francisco by Musk - before he left, citing conflicts of interest as Tesla boosts the autonomous capabilities of its cars. OpenAI was set up as a nonprofit with the aim of building a neural network the size of a human brain - a so-called artificial general intelligence - making its work open source so that it would be a blueprint for the safe and ethical development of AI. But that put OpenAI in direct competition with big tech companies, which have the resources to pay for scientific talent and computing power.</p><p>It switched to a for-profit structure last year, saying it needed billions of dollars in investment, and this summer it announced it was aligning itself with Microsoft, which is putting in $1bn (\u00a3811m) to help OpenAI to pay for computing services from Azure, Microsoft's cloud. In the field of AI, charitable dollars seem best channelled to the ethical rather than the technological debate.</p><p>Berggruen, whose ventures include a $1m annual prize for philosophy, sounds like he is having the most fun. The Berggruen Institute's \"Transformations of the Human\" project places philosophers and artists in key research sites to foster dialogue with technologists, to \"contribute to both human and non-human flourishing\".</p><p>When it comes to philanthropy, robots may need support, too.</p><p>ARTICLE REPUBLISHED FROM THE FINANCIAL TIMES</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IINDUK-INMLMMGLSTRY000032619901-ARTICLE-TEXT-1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IINDUK2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X09-3231-JCS0-D53H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">379735</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"720\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Independent Print Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>i-Independent Print Ltd</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"17013\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 6, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>CC000581R</classCode><className>TESLA AS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>NAICS334220 RADIO &amp;

In 2017, UK the market was estimated to be worth \u00a311.55billion, of which Googleand Facebookcombined earned around 54 per cent. [item name=video id=3360284 style=2 /]It comes after Mr Hammond commissioned a report led by Harvard University Professor Jason Furman, former chief economic adviser to Barack Obama, who recommended a host of changes to the way individual consumers use digital platforms, including being able to transfer images and data between competing apps.The report also urges the biggest firms to agree to a new code of conduct to promote competition and avoid the need to end monopolies by breaking those companies up. It is unclear which firms would be considered 'tech giants' outside of the big six - Google, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, Netflix and Amazon - but it will focus on social media and aggregation websitesIt is understood an independent regulator would be set up to police the code and it will have powers to enforce rules, such as fines, although the exact punitive measures have not been decided yet. </p><p>Prof Furman's report comes a month after the Cairncross Review into the sustainability of journalism in the UK, which also recommended its own code of conduct to prevent tech firms from having too large a share of advertising revenue. Chancellor Philip Hammond, pictured giving the Spring Statement, has called for an urgent review of the digital advertising market by the Competition and Markets AuthorityMeanwhile a review commissioned by Mr Hammond, pictured today left, has urged the UK Government to introduce a new code of conduct for large technology firms that promotes competition and also gives consumers more control over their data. It was led by Harvard University Professor Jason Furman, rightAmong the key findings were: <list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>A code of conduct agreed between Big Tech firms to give users fair access to their services and not penalise them for using alternative platforms, enforceable by fines,</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Allowing users to transfer pictures, message archives and other data between competing platforms,</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Give consumers the ability to connect with each other between different apps such as Facebook's WhatsApp to Apple's iMessage,</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Increase scrutiny on mergers and review past takeovers such as Facebook's acquisition of Instagram.</p></bodyText></listItem></list>Mr Hammond will now consider the proposals with a response due in the summer.It comes after months of criticism aimed at major tech platforms amid claims they have too much power over advertisers, are misusing personal data, not doing enough to prevent child exploitation and being used to spread misinformation to influence political campaigns.Report calls for review of digital advertising market   The Furman Review has urged the Competition and Markets Authority to launch a probe into the digital advertising market amid concerns Googleand Facebookhave too large a share of revenue.In 2017, UK digital advertising spend was estimated to be worth \u00a311.55 billion, of which Googleand Facebookcombined earned around 54 per cent. Last month's Cairncross Review said the two sites domination of the market made it hard for traditional publishers and newspapers to survive in modern journalism. The Furman Review has called for an investigation claiming domination of the market could harm businesses and consumers alike.The report said: 'A lack of effective competition in the digital advertising market may lead to harm for consumers and businesses, for example through higher prices for advertisers, higher prices for consumers for goods and services that use digital advertising if these costs are passed through.'It added: 'It is clear that the market is opaque, with limited information disclosed either at an aggregate or an individual level. 'A thorough investigation of its workings, encompassing the entire value chain, would be helpful in either identifying any valid grounds for concern about effective competition, or dispelling the mistrust that exists.' The CMA said it is considering launching a probe but claimed its ability to start an investigation was hampered by Brexit.A spokesman said: 'The CMA has also been considering whether to undertake work in the digital advertising market, as recommended today by the panel's report. However, its ability to launch new projects is heavily dependent on the outcome of EU Exit negotiations.' Calls have recently been made to break up Googleto 'create a competitive environment for search engines' and concerns have also been raised over Apple and Amazon from their domination of their markets to the amount of corporation tax they pay.But Prof Furman stopped short of calling for these firms to be broken up into separate companies, claiming it would make things 'more uncertain and potentially risky'. The review urged the Chancellor to back up these proposals with legislation to ensure the new rules are followed and set an example to the rest of the world.Prof Furman said: 'These policies would create substantial benefits for UK consumers, businesses trying to start up and scale up in the UK, and greater predictability for the major digital companies. 'Effective implementation in the UK could also serve as a model for the many governments around the world wrestling with these same questions.' He added: 'The digital sector has created substantial benefits but these have come at the cost of increasing dominance of a few companies which is limiting competition and consumer choice and innovation.'Some say this is inevitable or even desirable. I think the UK can do better.'The Chancellor, Philip Hammond, was right to recognise there is a better way than just continuing with the status quo.'My panel is outlining a balanced proposal to give people more control over their data, give small businesses more of a chance to enter and thrive, and create more predictability for the large digital companies.'These recommendations will deliver an economic boost driven by UK tech start-ups and innovation that will give consumers greater choice and protection.'The review also recommends changes to merger rules so that the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is better equipped to stop mergers that are considered likely to damage future competition or consumer choice.In addition, it calls for the introduction of powers that would force large companies to open up to smaller firms by providing access to certain data, where doing so would not affect user privacy.It said if the proposals were adopted it could help boost the economy by encouraging the development of new platforms alongside established names.[related]In response, Mr Hammond said: 'The UK leads the world in embracing technology and the opportunities it delivers for people.'Competition is fundamental to ensuring the market works in the interest of consumers, but we know some tech giants are still accumulating too much power, preventing smaller businesses from entering the market.'The work of Jason Furman and the expert panel is invaluable in ensuring we're at the forefront of delivering a competitive digital marketplace.What is the Cairncross Review? Prof Furman's report comes a month after the Cairncross Review into the sustainability of the Press in Britain and whether there is too much domination of advertising revenue by tech giants.The review, led by former journalist and academic Dame Frances Cairncross, also said news aggregation sites including Googleand Facebookhad an 'obligation' to provide users with quality news to improve levels of trust in content.It said that the power of online platforms like Googleand Facebookcaptured the majority of online advertising revenues, making it hard for traditional publishers, such as newspapers, to compete effectively. To remedy this, the Cairncross Review also recommended a new code of conduct be created to 'level the playing field'.This code would be overseen by a regulator to ensure platforms do not impose their own advertising software on news publishers and would make firms be more transparent on their share of online advertising revenue and pledge to work together on how best to present news on the web.The review concluded that after evidence of 'market failure' in the supply of public interest news, Government intervention may be the only solution.'I will carefully examine the proposals put forward by the panel before responding later this year, setting out how the Government will implement the changes needed to ensure our digital markets are competitive and consumers get the level of choice they deserve.'Damian Collins MP, chairman of the House of Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) select committee also backed calls for tighter regulation.'I welcome the publication of Professor Furman and his expert panel's report on unlocking digital competition.'Its central conclusions that digital markets only work well if they are supported with strong pro-competition policies, corroborates a number of the findings of my committee's report into disinformation and 'fake news' published in February,' he said.'It is clear that a strong code of ethics is needed to regulate online platforms, and I agree with the report's conclusion that the proposed code of competitive conduct is complementary with the code of ethics suggested by my committee.'We welcome the measures put forward to tackle anti-competitive practices and bullying tactics by market leaders.'This comes at a critical moment ahead of the beginnings of regulation from Government to rein in the powers of the tech companies.'I agree with the report that common data standards, including around the treatment of inferred data, should be set.'My committee was concerned by the treatment of inferred data by large tech companies such as Facebook, and it is essential that the Government acts to protect consumers.'The report is right to highlight that United Kingdom has the opportunity to lead by example in the area of digital regulation. Mr Hammond, pictured in Downing Street today ahead of the Spring Statement, welcomed the report and said he would review the recommendations before deciding whether to implement changes in the UK later this year'With a history of fair and robust regulation, and with the largest tech sector in Europe, the UK is uniquely placed to set world-leading standards in the digital arena.'Through the formation of the International Grand Committee it has already been demonstrated that other nations are ready to work with us to tackle the plethora of challenges presented by social media platforms.'Later this month, a government white paper on online harms is expected to be published, which is likely to include some proposals for new regulation on social media platforms and internet companies.What is the new code of conduct?   The Furman report has suggested a new code of conduct to be agreed between major tech firms. It is currently unknown which firms would be subject to the code, how it would be enforced or what punitive measures would be.But the principles have been laid out in the report and, if approved, businesses would have to:<list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Ensure users have access to platforms on a fair, consistent and transparent basis,</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Be provided with rankings and reviews of apps on a fair, consistent and transparent basis</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Be not unfairly restricted from, or penalised for, using alternative platforms.</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>Prof Furman's report comes a month after the Cairncross Review into the sustainability of the Press in Britain and whether there is too much domination of advertising revenue by tech giants.</p><p>The review, led by former journalist and academic Dame Frances Cairncross, also said news aggregation sites including Googleand Facebookhad an 'obligation' to provide users with quality news to improve levels of trust in content.</p><p>It said that the power of online platforms like Googleand Facebookcaptured the majority of online advertising revenues, making it hard for traditional publishers, such as newspapers, to compete effectively. </p><p>To remedy this, the Cairncross Review also recommended a new code of conduct be created to 'level the playing field'.</p><p>This code would be overseen by a regulator to ensure platforms do not impose their own advertising software on news publishers and would make firms be more transparent on their share of online advertising revenue and pledge to work together on how best to present news on the web.</p><p>The review concluded that after evidence of 'market failure' in the supply of public interest news, Government intervention may be the only solution. </p><p>It also recommended the creation of a new institute of public interest news, along the lines of the Arts Council, to channel a combination of public and private finance into those parts of the industry deemed most worthy of support.</p><p>Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright welcomed the review's findings, saying that while some could be acted on immediately, others would require 'further careful consideration' with interested parties on the way forward. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAILON-52552127</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAILON2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMK-YF21-JCJY-G3S4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397135</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2334\"/><timeReceived>11:18 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

He started by cutting growth forecasts for the year to 1.2% but said that borrowing this year it will be 1.1% of GDP, 3bn lower than forecast at the Autumn Budget. He also said that assuming a Brexit deal is agreed and uncertainty lifted, he will launch a 'full three-year spending review' before the summer break. While there won't be much in the Spring Statement that comes as a surprise for the tech sector, Hammond did comment on the six month review of the sector published today, concluding that tech giants such as Google and Facebook should face greater competition. </p><p>He said that initially he will ask the Competition and Markets Authority to undertake a market study of the digital advertising market as soon as possible. 'The UK will remain a great place to do digital business but it will be a place where successful global tech giants pay their fair share where competition policy works in consumers' interests and where the public are protected from online harms,' he said. Ruth Manielevitch, VP global business development at Taptica, said: 'The UK government is under more pressure than ever to control the power of the big tech giants. 'Since GDPR came into force, there has been a number of high profile fines for both Google and Facebook, as concerns grow among consumers over the use of data and their privacy online. With this in mind, there is a growing appetite for regulation of the big tech giants. UK SMEs are biggest online 3D printing users in EU 'We've seen that self-regulation does not work, and enormous fines can seem redundant when taking into consideration the huge scale of these businesses and their various revenue streams. 'In order to regulate big tech, the UK government should introduce a regulatory watchdog. This could be introduced in the form of an ombudsman, which already exists in the UK for other industries, with the responsibility to protect consumers and keep unfair practices in check.' R...unding The 2018 Budget included additional support for cutting-edge science and technologies that the Chancellor said will transform the economy, create highly skilled jobs, and boost living standards across the UK. Today the Chancellor committed to funding the Joint European Torus programme in Oxfordshire as a wholly UK asset in the event the Commission does not renew the contract, giving the experts working at the facility certainty to continue their ground-breaking fusion energy research. B2B lending platform secures 2m investment He also invested 81m in Extreme Photonics (state-of-the-art laser technology) at the UK's cutting-edge facility in Oxfordshire; committed 45m for Bioinformatics research in Cambridge; and announced 79m funding for a new supercomputer in Edinburgh - five times faster than existing capabilities - whose processing power will 'contribute to discoveries in medicine, climate science and aerospace, and build on previous British breakthroughs including targeted treatments for arthritis and HIV'. Tim Mills, management director of the Angel CoFund, welcomed this focus on tech. He said: 'Regardless of what happens next in the Brexit process, innovation in science and technology has always been a fundamental pillar of the UK economy and is likely to be more important than ever before going forward. 'The funding for scientific research that the Treasury has promised as part of the Industrial Strategy will go towards state-of-the-art laser technology, supercomputers, medical breakthroughs and more. What is important to remember is that each of these is pushing a frontier that British businesses can then capitalise on the create new, cutting-edge products and technologies that will allow the UK to continue complete on the world stage. 'What's also significant is that these funds are not just localised to London. In the absence of EU funding, it is more important than ever for investment to be evenly spread throughout the UK, to stimulate economic development throughout the country. Increased investment into R...nd measures like exempting PHD positions from visa caps will result in long-term returns for the UK, in terms of productivity, wages and jobs.' UK ranks third for innovation, disruption and technology Peter Finnie, partner at IP law firm Gill Jennings ...ery LLP, agreed but said we mustn't get too far ahead of ourselves. 'While the announcement of a 200m government injection into UK innovation appears promising for the science and technology sectors, in the wake of Brexit the funding hasn't yet been packaged up with all the detail that will encourage R... he said. 'While it's promising to see the EU Framework Programme funding and grants mirrored by the UK government, we shouldn't get ahead of ourselves until we see that the existing funding is matched or even exceeded. 'It is important that this cash injection from the Treasury into scientific research is rewarded with a return of investment for the UK economy. For this to happen, some of the funding needs to be directed towards converting pure research into commercial products and new tech enterprises. Joint development with industry should be encouraged to ensure that commercial opportunities are realised as much as possible.' Brexit Of course, nothing could be said without caveats about the impact of Brexit. Djalal Lougouev, CFO and co-founder of Ometria, said: 'With MPs yet to agree upon a Brexit deal and the vote to prevent a no deal set for tonight, the technology community, particularly tech startups and SMEs, will continue to be cautious while economic uncertainty is still rife. 'The UK tech sector continues to grow and is currently expanding 2.5 times faster than the overall economy. The UK also remains Europe's primary investment destination for venture capitalists, showing that even during slow economic periods and uncertainty this country is still a fertile environment for business. However, the government's proposed 'digital tax' on online retail is perplexing. 'The government should focus on encouraging growth rather than punishing the most innovative businesses for offering customers convenient ways of shopping. In a digital world, this only serves to pander to the old standards of bricks and mortar retail that aren't resonating with consumers like they used to. 'The government's focus in the Spring Statement today should have been on retaining the UK's status as a hotbed for innovative tech businesses - especially in AI - so as to continue encouraging investment in the future. 'My real concern though is that Brexit may disrupt how businesses process data. I welcome the Chancellor's announcement that the government intends to allow consumers to have more control of their data, recognising that there will be a consumer backlash against huge companies owning and controlling that data, but I fear it's a distraction from the real issues we have at hand. 'I can't overstate the impact Brexit may have on innovation. Cross-border data flows are the single most important way we as a nation can continue to innovate and compete on a global stage. With 75% of our data flows coming from EU countries and services accounting for 44% of our exports, data is a vital currency for modern business, and without freedom of data movement the UK won't be the tech hub the government wants the country to be.' David Blair, global CEO of FITCH, believes the government needs to focus on encouraging business growth and development over the long-term. He said: 'With Britain's exit from the EU just a fortnight away, we're faced with concern over the economic health of the nation with 'No-Deal' still hanging over us. We can blame Brexit all we like for the bleak outlook, but for stable economic growth the government needs to focus on long-term measures which encourage investment and innovation in this country. 'We've already seen big brands like Nissan, Dyson and Sony up sticks and move all or parts of their operations out of the UK in order to futureproof their businesses. What is the government doing to create an infrastructure that encourages progress and growth in the UK beyond Brexit? 'The reason companies are moving operations East is because emerging markets provide an inspiring technological framework for forward-thinking businesses to operate in. The government had the option to use Brexit as an opportunity to shape Britain as a global economic powerhouse, with grand ambitions befitting a nation that produced the likes of Isambard Kingdom Brunel. Instead, it opted for the kind of compromise, fear and general incompetence that has become 'business as usual' for Western governments. 'When it comes to innovation, emerging markets provide the framework we should be applying for Britain's emerging brands.' </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-TECN1318001552489564515251764100205</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TECN-131800</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMN-3NT1-JCMN-Y1B0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1489\"/><timeReceived>3:06 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>UKTN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 13, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

She said: \"It may be legal, but it is not moral, especially when the company depends on so many public services funded by the taxpayer.\"</p><p>Meg Hillier, Labour chairwoman of the public accounts committee, added: \"<person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>paltry UK tax bill underlines the unfairness of the current tax system, which allows multinational digital giants to use every loophole to reduce their bill while bricks-and- mortar high-street businesses are hit hard. We need to see a real step change in how tax is levied from business.\"</p><p>Accounts filed at Companies House show that <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>UK Limited posted a rise in revenue to \u00a31.27 billion in the UK last year, but its pre-tax profits of \u00a362.8 million, up from \u00a358.4 million the year before, were reduced by \"cost of sales\" of \u00a3758.7 million and \"administrative expenses\" of \u00a3444.5 million.</p><p>It meant that <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>paid corporation tax of \u00a315.8 million, up from \u00a35.1 million. Its net tax was \u00a37.4 million, however, after it received \u00a38.4 million in tax credits from employee shares awards.</p><p>The Conservative MP Nicky Morgan pledged that the Treasury committee, of which she is chairwoman, would \"keep a close watch on developments on the taxation of digital companies\".</p><p>Prem Sikka, emeritus professor of accounting at the University of Essex and an adviser to the Commons' work and pension select committee, said: \"The key question is what is the company's taxable profit in the UK? . . . It seems to me that HMRC needs to be asking questions about the 4.9 per cent operating profit margin declared in the UK compared with nearly 50 per cent shown in the US accounts. What is the economic basis of such enormous differences?\"</p><p><person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>argued that it had made significant investments in Britain over the past couple of years. The company said that it was preparing to employ about 2,300 people in Britain by the end of the year and was doubling its office space in London, with the \"capacity for more than 6,000 workstations by 2022\".</p><p>A spokesman added: \"We have also changed the way we report tax so that revenue from customers supported by our UK teams is recorded in the UK and any taxable profit is subject to UK corporation tax.\"</p><p>The government declined to comment on <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>but a spokesman issued a warning. \"While the UK has led the way internationally to ensure companies change their behaviour and pay the right amount of tax, the international tax system needs to be rebalanced and modernised to ensure it's fair for all businesses,\" he said.</p><p>\"If we can't get international engagement to do this we may have to look at temporary tax measures on digital businesses to level the playing field and ensure multinationals pay their fair share towards vital public services like schools and hospitals.\"</p><p>The dispute came as it emerged that the tax affairs of another US technology business were facing scrutiny. The holiday lettings site Airbnb admitted that it had been contacted by HM Revenue &amp; Customs \"regarding the application of tax laws or regulations\" affecting its business. It added that some of these matters \"may result in litigation\".</p><p>The company paid less than \u00a3600,000 in corporate tax in Britain last year, with profits channelled through its headquarters in Ireland. A spokesman said: \"As with many other companies, these are routine checks and we are working closely with HMRC.\"</p><p>John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: \"The Tories are letting large multinationals get away without paying their fair share of tax. Philip Hammond has let <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>off the hook.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-48076791</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TFG-7791-F021-631S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"816\"/><timeReceived>12:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 9, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

The world of payments has become increasingly exciting, so it is very good to be here today to share in that excitement. This morning I would like to speak about the shift towards electronic payments; or as the title of my remarks says, the journey towards a near cashless payments system. For some decades, people have been speculating that we might one day go cashless - that we would no longer be using banknotes for regular payments and that almost all payments would be electronic. So far, this speculation has been exactly that - speculation. </p><p>But it looks like a turning point has been reached. It is now easier than it has been to conceive of a world in which banknotes are used for relatively few payments; that cash becomes a niche payment instrument. Given this, I would like to structure my remarks around three broad points. The first is that the shift to electronic payments is occurring quite quickly and it is likely to continue. This shift is a positive development that should promote our collective welfare. The second is that if we are to realise the benefits of moving to a near cashless payments system, the electronic system needs to offer the functionality, safety and reliability that people require. People need to have confidence that the electronic payment system will be operating when they want to make their payments and that it will deliver the payment services that they need. The third point is that as we undertake this journey towards a near cashless payment system, there will be a greater focus on the cost of electronic payments. If almost all payments are electronic, then the cost of making these payments matters more than it used to. The electronic system needs to be as efficient as it can be and to be characterised by strong competition. In my view, there is further work to be done here. 1. The Shift to Electronic Payments The Reserve Bank conducts regular surveys of how Australians make their payments. The next survey will be undertaken in 2019. Until then, perhaps the best illustration of the declining use of cash for transactions is the sharp decline in the number and value of cash withdrawals through ATMs (Graph 1). Around the turn of decade, Australians went to an ATM, on average, around 40 times per year. Today, we go to an ATM around 25 times a year and the downward trend is likely to continue.At the same time as the use of cash for payments has been declining, the number of electronic transactions has been growing strongly (Graph 2). Today, Australians make, on average, nearly 500 electronic payments a year, up from around 100 per year around the turn of the century.New payment technologies are being developed that will further encourage this shift to electronic payments. Perhaps the most significant of these is the New Payments Platform, which has made it possible for people to make real-time person-to-person payments without using banknotes. A range of payment apps are also under development that would have the same effect. So the direction of change is clear. There also continues to be a decline in the use of cheques (Graph 3).1 In the mid 1990s, Australians, on average, made around 45 cheque payments per year. Today, we make around three per person. Given this trend is likely to continue, it will be appropriate at some point to wind up the cheque system, given the high fixed costs involved in operating the system. We have not reached that point yet, but it may not be too far away. Before we do, it is important that alternative payment methods are available. Progress has been made on this front, but more is required.So there is an apparent paradox between the declining use of cash and the rising value of banknotes on issue. The main explanation is that some people, including non-residents, choose to hold a share of their wealth in Australian banknotes. The opportunity cost of doing this is less than it used to be because of the low level of interest rates. While it is difficult to predict the future, I expect that banknotes will remain part of our payments system for some time to come. In some situations, paying with banknotes is quicker and more convenient than paying electronically, although this advantage is less than it once was. Some people also simply prefer paying in cash - our 2016 survey indicated that around 14 per cent of Australians had a preference for using cash as a budgeting tool. Banknotes also allow payments to be made anonymously in a way that is not possible in systems that leave an electronic fingerprint. This privacy aspect is valued by some people. In some circumstances this desire for privacy is entirely legitimate, but in others it has more to do with tax evasion and illegal activities. Perhaps a more important source of ongoing demand is the fact that using cash does not require the internet to be up, electricity to be working and the banks' systems to be operational. Banknotes are therefore an important emergency or back-up payment instrument. They are particularly useful in the event of natural disasters or failure of the electronic system. Perhaps one day the various systems will be so reliable that a backup will not be needed, but that day still seems some way off. Overall, the shift to electronic payments that is occurring makes a lot of sense - it is similar to other aspects of our lives where things that used to be physical have been supplemented with, or replaced by, technology. This shift is likely to promote our collective welfare. I say that even though the Reserve Bank is the producer of banknotes and earns significant income, or as it's known, seigniorage, for the taxpayer from their use. The greater use of electronic payments can bring efficiency benefits, with lower costs and more functionality and choice for users. One example of this is the reduced tender time involved in card transactions due to contactless technology. There are also non-trivial production and distribution costs involved in the cash system. Some of these are fixed costs, so the average cost of cash transactions is likely to rise as the volume of cash transactions falls. Looking ahead, there is also more limited scope for fundamental innovation in the cash system compared with the scope for dynamic innovation in electronic payments. So this journey is in our national interest. 2. Functionality, Safety and Reliability I would now like to discuss three interrelated factors that will influence how quickly we undertake that journey. These are: the functionality offered by the electronic system; the safety of that system, and the reliability of that system. The other factor that is also relevant is cost, and I will touch on this a little later. Functionality The rapid adoption of contactless payments in Australia shows that Australians change how they pay quite quickly when new functionality is offered. Contactless card payments were slow to take off but once critical mass was established, they grew very quickly. In our 2013 consumer payment study they accounted for around over 20 per cent of point of sale card payments; three years later they accounted for over 60 per cent. So the functionality of the electronic payments system is key. The development of the electronic payment system took a major step forward earlier this year with the launch of the New Payments Platform (NPP). This system allows people to make payments 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, using just a simple identifier such as a mobile phone number or an email address. It also allows a lot of information to accompany the payment. I expect that over time this extra functionality will further reduce the use of cash in the economy and also improve the efficiency of the electronic system. The number of transactions through the NPP is steadily increasing (Graph 5). After a relatively low-key start, there are now around 400,000 NPP transactions per day. Over 2 million PayIDs have also been registered, and we expect further growth as the banks continue to roll out services to their customers.The concept behind the NPP is that so-called 'overlay' services are developed, and that these overlay services offer new functionality that utilise the real time capability of the NPP. The first overlay service provides for a basic account-to-account payment. Among the subsequently planned overlay services are ones that will allow someone to send a request to pay, perhaps to a friend for their share of a meal out. Another overlay service would allow a link to a document to be sent with a payment; this could be a payslip or a detailed record of the transaction. It was originally anticipated that these two overlay services would be up and running not long after the NPP launch. Unfortunately, this timeline has slipped. A number of the major banks have also been slower than was originally expected to roll out NPP functionality to their entire customer bases. This is in contrast to the capability offered by smaller financial institutions, which from Day 1 were able to provide their customers with NPP services. Given the slow pace of roll-out by the banks, and the prospect of delays for additional overlay services, I recently wrote to the major banks on behalf of the Payments System Board seeking updated timelines and a commitment that these timelines will be satisfied. It is important that these commitments are met. It is worth observing that in other countries where banks have been slow to develop payment applications that meet the needs of the public, other possibilities emerge. China is perhaps the best example of this, with the emergence of QR-code-based payments. I expect that the NPP infrastructure will be the backbone of our electronic payments system for many years to come. But for this to be the case, the system will need to provide the functionality that people require, and it will need to do this on a timely basis. There are a range of fintech firms that are excited by the capabilities offered by the NPP and the potential for it to be used for innovative payment solutions. In October, the RBA issued a consultation paper seeking views on the functionality and access arrangements for the NPP. In particular we are interested in views on whether the various ways of accessing the NPP, and their various technical and eligibility requirements, are adequate for different business models. A topic that I get asked about from time to time is whether the functionality of the electronic system would be enhanced by the RBA issuing an electronic version of the Australian dollar, an eAUD. I spoke about this issue at this conference last year, concluding that we did not see a public policy case for moving in this direction at the time. In particular, it is not clear that RBA-issued electronic banknotes would provide something that account-to-account transfers through the banking system do not, particularly with the emergence of the NPP. Another important consideration was the implications for financial stability. A year on, our views have not changed. Security A second important influence on the rate at which we shift to a more electronic payments system is the public's confidence in the security of the system. Given this, a recent focus of the Payments System Board has been the high and increasing level of fraud in card-not-present transactions (Graph 6). Card-not-present fraud rose by 15 per cent in 2017 and now represents 87 per cent of total scheme card fraud losses.2 In contrast, the industry has had successes in addressing card-present fraud, with the introduction of chip technology and the switch to PINs. Despite this, growth in e-commerce activity has provided new opportunities for would-be fraudsters.The Payments System Board identified the rise in card-not-present fraud as a priority for the industry. In August this year, the Board was pleased to welcome AusPayNet's publication of a draft industry framework to mitigate card-not-present fraud, and supports continued collaboration on this issue. A separate but not unrelated priority for the industry is to progress work on digital identity. This is another area where barriers to effective coordination can arise. I am pleased that AusPayNet is undertaking work here, under the auspices of the Australian Payments Council. Digital identity is likely to become increasingly important as more and more activity takes place online. The RBA is highly supportive of industry collaboration on this issue and views it as important that substantive progress is made. More broadly, individuals, businesses, governments and financial institutions all need to be aware of cyber risks. In the RBA's most recent Financial Stability Review we noted the increasing sophistication of cyber attacks and that regulatory authorities have increased their focus on cyber issues. Reliability A third factor is the confidence that people have that they will be able to use the electronic system when they need to make their payments. As I noted earlier, people will still want to hold and use banknotes if they can't be sure that the electronic system will be available when they need it. In our consumer payments survey in 2016, we asked people about why they held cash in places outside of their wallet. The most common response, from nearly half of respondents, was that it was for emergency transaction needs. Over recent times, there have been a number of serious operational incidents that have interrupted the payments system. On some occasions these have been caused by problems with the telecommunications companies and at other times by problems at the banks. An operational incident at the RBA in August as a result of problems with a routine fire test also saw a number of RBA core systems unavailable for some hours, including the Fast Settlement Service supporting the NPP. We all need to do better here. As we rely less on cash, outages affecting retail transactions can have a significant impact on businesses and individuals. So continued effort needs to be made by all participants in the payments system to reduce operational problems. If this does not happen, then it is possible that the Payments System Board could consider setting some standards. 3. Increased focus on Cost and Competition My third broad point is about the cost of electronic payments and the importance of competition. As we move to a predominantly electronic world, there will be more focus on the cost of operating the electronic payments systems and how those costs are allocated between those making and receiving payments. Looking forward, I expect that over time the cost of electronic payments will decline further, due to both advances in technology and economies of scale. Even so, there are significant costs to operate the electronic systems, including costs for front- and back-end systems to maintain accounts, and to deliver functionality and convenience to users, as well as costs in preventing fraud and ensuring resilience. How these costs are managed and who pays for them will have a significant bearing on the efficiency of the overall system. In terms of card payments, merchants in Australia currently pay less than merchants in many other countries. The comparison with the United States is particularly stark (Graph 7). For credit cards, Australian merchants, on average, pay 0.8 per cent of the transaction value for Mastercard/Visa transactions. In the United States the figure is much higher at around 2.2 per cent. There are also differences in the cost of debit cards and American Express cards between the two countries.The main reason for the lower merchant costs in Australia is our lower interchange fees. These fees were reduced in Australia as a result of regulation by the Reserve Bank commencing in 2003. The RBA's reforms reduced average interchange fees in the Mastercard and Visa systems by around 45 basis points. This has been reflected in merchant service fees; indeed, these merchant fees have fallen by somewhat more than the cuts to interchange, likely reflecting an increased focus on card acceptance costs by merchants (Graph 8). In addition, as a result of competitive pressure, including from the removal of no-surcharge rules, fees on American Express and Diners Club have also fallen over time.Notwithstanding the reduction in interchange fees, these fees still represent, on average, around 60 per cent of the total merchant service fee on credit cards. So they remain an important part of the total cost to merchants. Conversely, these fees mean that the cardholder's bank gets paid each time the card is used. This has meant that the cost to consumers of using these cards is often low; in some cases, cardholders are actually subsidised to use their card, through reward points and/or interest-free credit. The subsidy is provided by the cardholder's bank, but ultimately paid for by the merchant. The close link between interchange and merchant costs means that there continues to be significant focus on interchange and its implications for the distribution of costs between merchants and consumers. For example, there have been recent recommendations from the Black Economy Taskforce and the Productivity Commission for the Reserve Bank to consider regulatory action to lower, or even ban, interchange fees. The Payments System Board will again examine the arguments for lower interchange fees when it next conducts a formal review of the card payments system. On the competition front, one area that merits close attention is the market for acquiring services. This has come into sharper focus as a result of concerns about the costs to merchants in the debit card system, where most cards allow for transactions to be processed by either of the two networks enabled on the card. The longstanding view of the Payments System Board has been that merchants should at least have the choice of sending the debit payment through the lower cost system, whether that be eftpos or the international scheme. For merchants to be able to do this though, acquirers need to offer terminals and technical systems enabled to allow least-cost routing. Some acquirers have already completed the necessary work and are attracting new merchants. Others, including the major banks, made commitments earlier in the year regarding the timetable for this work to be completed. Partly on the basis of those commitments, the Payments System Board made a decision not to regulate. Since then, I regret to say there has been slippage by some, who have cited technical problems. It is important that the banks get back on track here. A failure to deliver on commitments or to provide the payment services that the community needs will inevitably lead to calls for further regulation. 4. Looking ahead Looking beyond interchange and acquiring competition, new technologies open up the prospect of new payment options developing. Recently, there has been much discussion on the role that so-called 'Big Tech' firms might eventually play. These firms have potential advantages over existing providers of payments services. In some cases, their technology and systems are more flexible, they have a greater ability to use and process information, they have well established networks which they can leverage and they are often better at interacting with their users and customers. Given this, one scenario is that these firms become significant players in the payments industry. They might be able to do this through developing new payment applications that provide a commercial return, not through charging for payment services, but by commercialising the value of the information that they obtain as a by-product of offering these services. If this scenario were to play out, it could significantly change the payments landscape, providing both merchants and consumers new payment options at low monetary cost. At the same time though it would raise a number of important issues related to data privacy, ownership and security. The probability of Big Tech firms entering the payments arena is higher if merchants and consumers feel that the existing payment systems do not offer them the services they need and/or the prices that are being charged are too high. As I noted earlier, where banks have been slow to respond, other payment applications have emerged. This scenario highlights a broader point. The way that people are charged for payments is complex and is changing: among other things, it is influenced by interchange fees, how the value of information is commercialised, and commercial pressures on banks. It is difficult to predict how things will ultimately play out, but these are issues the Payments System Board continues to keep a close eye on. 5. Summing Up To conclude, I expect the shift to electronic payments will continue. The issues of functionality, security and reliability, and cost are central to the development of the system. The Payments System Board will be keeping a close eye on these issues. While I have talked about a near cashless payments system, I want to emphasise that we don't yet envisage a world without banknotes. The RBA is committed to providing cash consistent with demand by users and to support its distribution. Our development of the Next Generation Banknote series is a clear commitment to ensuring that cash continues to have public confidence and to meet the needs of the community. The launch of the NPP this year was a big step forward for the industry and a credit to all of the staff at participating organisations who worked hard over the life of the project to bring it to fruition. As I mentioned, there are some key things that need to be done for the full benefits of the NPP to be available to end-users, but I am optimistic that these can be achieved and this new infrastructure can provide great functionality for Australia.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS1129052I</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TV6-0XX1-JDG9-Y3BG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3666\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 27, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The bill looks to raise 29 billion pesos (US$571 million) by imposing a value added tax on digital services provided in the Philippines, a key growth area for e-commerce transactions as its people are among the world's heaviest users of social media. \"We spent to fight COVID-19 and we need more to continue fighting it and recover,\" Congressman Joey Salceda, the Bill's principal author, told Reuters. </p><p>\"It sends a strong signal to the world that the Philippines is ready for the digital transformation.

But it may take a while before the proposal is scheduled for debate, as lawmakers are busy deliberating on an economic stimulus package to jumpstart the Philippine economy, ravaged by pandemic-induced lockdowns. Google, Netflix, and Spotify were not immediately available for comment. Facebook declined to comment. The Philippines has recorded 13,434 virus infections, including 846 deaths and 3,000 recoveries, and has run nearly 208,000 tests among its population of more than 107 million. Last week, neighbouring Indonesia announced plans for VAT of 10per cent on digital products from July, to boost revenues amid the pandemic. Southeast Asian regulators held talks last year on a region-wide effort to tax tech giants more.

The Bill...</p><p>MANILA (Reuters): A proposed Bill that will allow the Philippines to tax tech giants like Facebook, Alphabet's Google and YouTube, and Netflix, moved a step closer to becoming a law after a lower house committee approved it on Wednesday (July 29).    The Bill, which aims to raise 29 billion pesos (US$590 million) to help fund government measures to fight the coronavirus, follows similar plans by other South-east Asian countries to generate revenues from the most popular digital services.    \"If brick-and-mortar establishments, which are the hardest-hit by the pandemic, have to pay VAT, the giants of e-commerce should not be exempt,\" Congressman Joey Salceda, the Bill's principal author, said in a statement.    The Bill proposes value-added tax of 12 per cent on digital services. It still needs to clear the lower chamber and a similar Bill has been submitted to the Senate.    Starting next year, Salceda said, funds raised from new taxes would also be used to finance digital programmes such as a national broadband project and digital learning, to fill the education gap caused by school closures due to the virus.    The Philippines is a growth area for big tech firms, with Filipinos among the heaviest social media users in the world.    Facebook, Google, YouTube, Netflix, Spotify and Alibaba's Lazada did not immediately respond to requests for comment.    Tech giants are increasingly facing tougher fiscal regimes in South-east Asia, whose regulators held talks last year on a region-wide effort to tax tech giants more.    In May, Indonesia announced plans for VAT of 10 per cent on digital products to boost revenues amid the pandemic.    Thailand in June approved a draft Bill requiring foreign digital service providers to pay VAT of 7 per cent.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42710603746</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G3-GFX1-F07F-8353-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"338\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>TheStar.com.my</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 29, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The Bill, which aims to raise 29 billion pesos (US$590 million) to help fund government measures to fight COVID-19, follows similar plans by other Southeast Asian countries to generate revenues from the most popular digital services. \"If brick-and-mortar establishments, which are the hardest-hit by the pandemic, have to pay VAT, the giants of e-commerce should not be exempt,\" Congressman Joey Salceda, the Bill's principal author, said in a statement. The bill proposes value-added tax of 12 per cent on digital services. </p><p>It still needs to clear the lower chamber and a similar bill has been submitted to the Senate. Starting next year, Salceda said, funds raised from new taxes would also be used to finance digital programmes such as a national broadband project and digital learning, to fill the education gap caused by school closures due to the coronavirus. The Philippines is a growth area for big tech firms, with Filipinos among the heaviest social media users in the world. Facebook, Google, Youtube, Netflix, Spotify and Alibaba's Lazada did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Tech giants are increasingly facing tougher fiscal regimes in Southeast Asia, whose regulators held talks last year on a region-wide effort to tax tech giants more. In May, Indonesia announced plans for VAT of 10 per cent on digital products to boost revenues amid the pandemic. Thailand in June approved a draft Bill requiring foreign digital service providers to pay VAT of 7 per cent - Reuters/zl</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-12972916</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G2-6RD1-DYWP-R4J8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"290\"/><timeReceived>7:20 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MCN International Pte Ltd.

The bill, which aims to raise 29 billion pesos ($590 million) to help fund government measures to fight the coronavirus, follows similar plans by other Southeast Asian countries to generate revenues from the most popular digital services.    \u201cIf brick-and-mortar establishments, which are the hardest-hit by the pandemic, have to pay VAT, the  giants  of e-commerce should not be exempt,\u201d Congressman Joey Salceda, the bill\u2019s principal author, said in a statement.    The bill proposes value-added tax of 12% on digital services. It still needs to clear the lower chamber and a similar bill has been submitted to the Senate.    Starting next year, Salceda said, funds raised from new taxes would also be used to finance digital programmes such as a national broadband project and digital learning, to fill the education gap caused by school closures due to the virus.    The  Philippines  is a growth area for big  tech  firms, with Filipinos among the heaviest social media users in the world.    Facebook, Google, Youtube, Netflix, Spotify and Alibaba\u2019s Lazada did not immediately respond to requests for comment.    Tech  giants  are increasingly facing tougher fiscal regimes in Southeast Asia, whose regulators held talks last year on a region-wide effort to tax  tech  giants  more.    In May, Indonesia announced plans for VAT of 10% on digital products to boost revenues amid the pandemic.    Thailand in June approved a draft bill requiring foreign digital service providers to pay VAT of 7%.

It will boost Oracle, the number two software firm, by giving it the popular Java programming language and Solaris operating software for computer servers.\"The acquisition of Sun transforms the IT industry, combining best-in-class enterprise software and mission-critical computing systems,\" Oracle's chief executive Larry Ellison said in a statement. </p><p><br/>\"Oracle will be the only company that can engineer an integrated system    applications to disk    where all the pieces fit and work together so customers do not have to do it themselves,\" he said.Sun chairman Scott McNealy hailed the merger as \"an industry-defining event.\"Company officials said Sun's board of directors have unanimously approved the deal which is expected to close this year pending approval from the company's stockholders and federal regulators.Sun is known for its open-source software program such as OpenOffice.org, OpenSolaris and Java, and was involved in efforts to build a network computer that would use alternatives to Microsoft's operating systems.<br/>Ltd.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUCLID-1143140</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUCLID2009</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7VM0-STY0-YBWY-S50G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">343637</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"210\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 TendersInfo - Euclid Infotech Pvt.

The minimum investment to participate is $200. This affordable investment entry point will allow the general public, potential future users, businesses and platforms to join us to help build a new and incredible online mobile community which rewards those who participate.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The company intends to use the capital raised from the IPO to continue developing the world's first Rewards-Based OS, its search portal PhindNow(TM)\ufe0f, as well as integrated retail, social media, video, streaming and messaging platforms beginning with its first social media and video sharing platforms Phriendle(TM)\ufe0f and Piccial(TM)\ufe0f. In addition, Phinge looks to continue the development of its state-of-the-art mobile hardware and hybrid devices like PHONEBOOK(TM)\ufe0f and cutting edge mobile and computer product lines like DUO(TM)\ufe0f and FUTURE(TM)\ufe0f.</p><p>We intend Phinge to be a true community where everyone has the opportunity to be rewarded for doing things they already do on mobile devices each day. From work, play, and social interactions to networking, entertainment, and travel, Phinge believes users and businesses alike should share in the revenues. \u00a0In perhaps the biggest change to social media ever, Phinge looks to reward its users when they make recommendations and share posts, pictures, videos, and more. \u00a0When friends or others interact with user recommendations and purchase goods and services associated with them, our users will get rewards from any revenue they help to generate. \u00a0These rewards will be collected and stored on future Phinge mobile devices, and will spend like real cash at any of our partner merchants, businesses or platforms. It makes perfect sense, right? Why shouldn't the individual promoting something to friends and followers through recommendations or sharing get a reward? Moreover, Phinge will offer rebate rewards to users when they shop through our platforms and with participating merchants. This is a true game-changer.</p><p>Currently big tech and social media companies bombard users with the endless unwanted clutter of continuous advertising. No longer will users, consumers and businesses have to accept aggressive advertising or have their personal data and privacy compromised, disseminated or sold to third parties. Users today have been told that such things are the price for the \"privilege\" of using these current social media sites, apps, and platforms. Well this will no longer be the case. \u00a0Through Phinge, users will have more choice and control than ever before.</p><p>Phinge will be business-friendly and supportive, giving all merchants an equal playing field and the ability to advertise without upfront fees. \u00a0Through its groundbreaking Rewards-Based OS, future mobile devices and social media apps like Piccial(TM)\ufe0f, Phriendle(TM)\ufe0f, and our search portal PhindNow(TM)\ufe0f, businesses will have the option to advertise to Phinge users and businesses free of charge, eliminating the biggest cost and barrier facing new startups and companies today. \u00a0Businesses will only pay a percentage of the sale of their goods or services at the time of purchase through our platforms and our mobile devices. \u00a0This will be a truly unprecedented benefit to assist new start-ups, entrepreneurs, influencers, emerging musicians, artists and others.</p><p>Phinge through its application programming interface (API) will allow app developers to make their apps seamlessly rewards-based on our platforms and mobile devices, and instantly available to all of our users. Users will earn rebates and can also redeem their rewards instantly the same as cash with any of our participating partners, app developers, companies and businesses. This will help drive new customers and revenue to those selling within our collaborative community.</p><p>Phinge believes in giving back to local communities and organizations as well. Through Phinge Giving(TM)\ufe0f, a portion of company profits will be donated to approved local charities in Phinge users' own hometowns and communities. \u00a0Users can even select which charities they would like to see benefit.</p><p>Phinge will be launching many more rewards-based platforms in the future including Phreeviews(TM)\ufe0f, the only integrated rating and review platform that will reward users when other users or random consumers dine, shop or purchase sports and theatre tickets, or goods and services based on their reviews and recommendations of those businesses.</p><p>Phinge believes that together we can change the future of technology for the better. We invite you to visitphinge.com/investor-relations.htmlto explore our exciting vision for a Rewards-Based mobile future and this unique potential investment opportunity. \u00a0We look forward to welcoming you to our community. Together we can build and experience the mobile world we want to work, play and thrive in.</p><p>Press <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:Contactinfo@phinge.com\">Contactinfo@phinge.com</email></p><p>FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS</p><p>This press release may include ''forward-looking statements.''

The minimum investment to participate is $200. This affordable investment entry point will allow the general public, potential future users, businesses and platforms to join us to help build a new and incredible online mobile community which rewards those who participate.  The company intends to use the capital raised from the IPO to continue developing the world's first Rewards-Based OS, its search portal PhindNow\u2122\u00b8\ufffd, as well as integrated retail, social media, video, streaming and messaging platforms beginning with its first social media and video sharing platforms Phriendle\u2122\u00b8\ufffd and Piccial\u2122\u00b8\ufffd. In addition, Phinge looks to continue the development of its state-of-the-art mobile hardware and hybrid devices like PHONEBOOK\u2122\u00b8\ufffd and cutting edge mobile and computer product lines like DUO\u2122\u00b8\ufffd and FUTURE\u2122\u00b8\ufffd.  We intend Phinge to be a true community where everyone has the opportunity to be rewarded for doing things they already do on mobile devices each day. From work, play, and social interactions to networking, entertainment, and travel, Phinge believes users and businesses alike should share in the revenues. </p><p> In perhaps the biggest change to social media ever, Phinge looks to reward its users when they make recommendations and share posts, pictures, videos, and more.  When friends or others interact with user recommendations and purchase goods and services associated with them, our users will get rewards from any revenue they help to generate.  These rewards will be collected and stored on future Phinge mobile devices, and will spend like real cash at any of our partner merchants, businesses or platforms. It makes perfect sense, right? Why shouldn't the individual promoting something to friends and followers through recommendations or sharing get a reward? Moreover, Phinge will offer rebate rewards to users when they shop through our platforms and with participating merchants. This is a true game-changer.  Currently big tech and social media companies bombard users with the endless unwanted clutter of continuous advertising. No longer will users, consumers and businesses have to accept aggressive advertising or have their personal data and privacy compromised, disseminated or sold to third parties. Users today have been told that such things are the price for the \"privilege\" of using these current social media sites, apps, and platforms. Well this will no longer be the case.  Through Phinge, users will have more choice and control than ever before.  Phinge will be business-friendly and supportive, giving all merchants an equal playing field and the ability to advertise without upfront fees.  Through its groundbreaking Rewards-Based OS, future mobile devices and social media apps like Piccial\u2122\u00b8\ufffd, Phriendle\u2122\u00b8\ufffd, and our search portal PhindNow\u2122\u00b8\ufffd, businesses will have the option to advertise to Phinge users and businesses free of charge, eliminating the biggest cost and barrier facing new startups and companies today.  Businesses will only pay a percentage of the sale of their goods or services at the time of purchase through our platforms and our mobile devices.  This will be a truly unprecedented benefit to assist new start-ups, entrepreneurs, influencers, emerging musicians, artists and others.  Phinge through its application programming interface (API) will allow app developers to make their apps seamlessly rewards-based on our platforms and mobile devices, and instantly available to all of our users. Users will earn rebates and can also redeem their rewards instantly the same as cash with any of our participating partners, app developers, companies and businesses. This will help drive new customers and revenue to those selling within our collaborative community.  Phinge believes in giving back to local communities and organizations as well. Through Phinge Giving\u2122\u00b8\ufffd, a portion of company profits will be donated to approved local charities in Phinge users' own hometowns and communities.  Users can even select which charities they would like to see benefit.  Phinge will be launching many more rewards-based platforms in the future including Phreeviews\u2122\u00b8\ufffd, the only integrated rating and review platform that will reward users when other users or random consumers dine, shop or purchase sports and theatre tickets, or goods and services based on their reviews and recommendations of those businesses.  Phinge believes that together we can change the future of technology for the better. We invite you to visit phinge.com /investor-relations.html to explore our exciting vision for a Rewards-Based mobile future and this unique potential investment opportunity.  We look forward to welcoming you to our community. Together we can build and experience the mobile world we want to work, play and thrive in.

The minimum investment to participate is $200. This affordable investment entry point will allow the general public, potential future users, businesses and platforms to join us to help build a new and incredible online mobile community which rewards those who participate.</p><p><br/><br/>The company intends to use the capital raised from the IPO to continue developing the world's first Rewards-Based OS, its search portal PhindNow\u2122\ufe0f, as well as integrated retail, social media, video, streaming and messaging platforms beginning with its first social media and video sharing platforms Phriendle\u2122\ufe0f and Piccial\u2122\ufe0f. In addition, Phinge looks to continue the development of its state-of-the-art mobile hardware and hybrid devices like PHONEBOOK\u2122\ufe0f and cutting edge mobile and computer product lines like DUO\u2122\ufe0f and FUTURE\u2122\ufe0f.<br/><br/>We intend Phinge to be a true community where everyone has the opportunity to be rewarded for doing things they already do on mobile devices each day. From work, play, and social interactions to networking, entertainment, and travel, Phinge believes users and businesses alike should share in the revenues. In perhaps the biggest change to social media ever, Phinge looks to reward its users when they make recommendations and share posts, pictures, videos, and more. When friends or others interact with user recommendations and purchase goods and services associated with them, our users will get rewards from any revenue they help to generate. These rewards will be collected and stored on future Phinge mobile devices, and will spend like real cash at any of our partner merchants, businesses or platforms. It makes perfect sense, right? Why shouldn't the individual promoting something to friends and followers through recommendations or sharing get a reward? Moreover, Phinge will offer rebate rewards to users when they shop through our platforms and with participating merchants.This is a true game-changer.<br/><br/>Currently big tech and social media companies bombard users with the endless unwanted clutter of continuous advertising. No longer will users, consumers and businesses have to accept aggressive advertising or have their personal data and privacy compromised, disseminated or sold to third parties. Users today have been told that such things are the price for the \"privilege\" of using these current social media sites, apps, and platforms. Well this will no longer be the case. Through Phinge, users will have more choice and control than ever before.<br/><br/>Phinge will be business-friendly and supportive, giving all merchants an equal playing field and the ability to advertise without upfront fees. Through its groundbreaking Rewards-Based OS, future mobile devices and social media apps like Piccial\u2122\ufe0f, Phriendle\u2122\ufe0f, and our search portal PhindNow\u2122\ufe0f, businesses will have the option to advertise to Phinge users and businesses free of charge, eliminating the biggest cost and barrier facing new startups and companies today. Businesses will only pay a percentage of the sale of their goods or services at the time of purchase through our platforms and our mobile devices. This will be a truly unprecedented benefit to assist new start-ups, entrepreneurs, influencers, emerging musicians, artists and others.<br/><br/>Phinge through its application programming interface (API) will allow app developers to make their apps seamlessly rewards-based on our platforms and mobile devices, and instantly available to all of our users. Users will earn rebates and can also redeem their rewards instantly the same as cash with any of our participating partners, app developers, companies and businesses. This will help drive new customers and revenue to those selling within our collaborative community.<br/><br/>Phinge believes in giving back to local communities and organizations as well. Through Phinge Giving\u2122\ufe0f, a portion of company profits will be donated to approved local charities in Phinge users' own hometowns and communities. Users can even select which charities they would like to see benefit.<br/><br/>Phinge will be launching many more rewards-based platforms in the future including Phreeviews\u2122\ufe0f, the only integrated rating and review platform that will reward users when other users or random consumers dine, shop or purchase sports and theatre tickets, or goods and services based on their reviews and recommendations of those businesses.<br/><br/>Phinge believes that together we can change the future of technology for the better. We invite you to visit phinge.com/investor-relations.html to explore our exciting vision for a Rewards-Based mobile future and this unique potential investment opportunity. We look forward to welcoming you to our community. Together we can build and experience the mobile world we want to work, play and thrive in.<br/><br/>Press Contact<br/><br/>FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS<br/><br/>This press release may include 'forward-looking statements.'

Now we have a full-fledged academic study ('Dark Patterns at Scale[2]') that quantifies the number of sites that use dark patterns, and puts some rigor into the definitions and example. I'm going to start with the original literature, where I'll define terms, then summarize the study, and then briefly look at legislation introduced in the Senate (the 'DETOUR' Act) to which the new study should lend support. The term 'dark pattern' was coined by independent user experience consultant in Brignull 2010; he set up the 'Dark Patterns[3]' website to present a classification and present examples. </p><p>His definition: Dark Patterns are tricks used in websites and apps that make you do things that you didn't mean to, like buying or signing up for something.[1] As a sidebar, the EIT Lab[4] ('European IT Law by Design', at the University of Louvain) gives a somewhat more evolved definition: Dark patterns are choice architectures used by many websites and apps to maliciously nudge users towards a decision that they would not have made if properly informed. Such deceptive that exploit individuals' heuristics and cognitive biases (e.g. interfaces designed to hide costs until the very end of the transaction, services and products added to the consumer's basket by default, etc.) are already well-known and sanctioned in the consumer protection domain. Regrettably, dark patterns have become widespread also in the area of data protection, where users are de facto forced to accept intrusive privacy settings, because of the way the information is framed and privacy choices presented by website's operators. When users are tricked by design not only they can be harmed but also their trust in the digital market is likely to be affected. Dark patterns are therefore posing an additional challenge to data protection law, that needs to be addressed in an interdisciplinary way. I like the introduction of 'choice architectures,' because that would make dark patterns a sort of bent nudge theory[5], assuming nudge theory is not itself bent.) End sidebar. In 2011, Brugnell expanded on his ideas at the A List Apart[6] webzine, writing[7]: Let's continue a while as evil web designers: perhaps you've never thought about it before but all of the guidelines, principles, and methods that ethical designers use to design usable websites can be easily subverted to benefit business owners at the expense of users. It's actually quite simple to take our understanding of human psychology and flip it over to the dark side. Let's look at some examples:Take the second example, 'People stick to the defaults.' (Brugnell calls this a psychological insight, but I think the term of art is 'cognitive bias.') As a Mac user I was long ago trained \u2014 because the Apple Human Interface Guidelines were ethical \u2014 to go into any new software and adjust the user preferences because software works for me, not the other way round. However, if I were not a suspicious old codger, I wouldn't have gone into the settings of my horrid Android phone (sorry), and turned off of the default stupidity and exploitation as I possibly could. (Sadly, in order to do that, I had to give the phone company an email account \u2014 a burner, naturally \u2014 which a fine example of the 'forced enrollment' dark pattern, identified in the 'Dark Patterns at Scale' study). Importantly, firms don't create dark patterns out of the sheer desire to be evil \u2014 leaving Facebook and Uber aside, of course \u2014 but for profit. Brugnell goes on: [Business] can become accustomed to the resultant revenue, and unlikely to want to turn the tap off. Nobody wants to be the manager who caused profits to drop overnight because of the 'improvements' they made to the website. An example of a dark pattern (Brugnell calls this 'Friend Spam[8]') at the user interface level comes from LinkedIn. Here's the tricky screen:Tricked user Dan Schlosser[9] explains: LinkedIn asks you to 'Get started by adding your email address.' There is a note explaining what this button does, but because it is put in light gray text next to a bold blue 'Continue' button, they get most people to blindly click ahead. This is definitely a dark pattern. In fact, it's really a lie. This page is not for 'adding your email address,' it's for linking address books. BWA-HA-HA-HA! You think you're just signing up, but you're giving LinkedIn your entire address book! (And constructing LinkedIn's equivalent of Facebook's social graph. To be fair, LinkedIn was fined for this and dropped the practice). But dark patterns can also be devised at a level far above buttons in the user interface, at the site level, or even at the level of the internet at a whole, as TurboTax shows. From Pro Publica, 'Here's How TurboTax Just Tricked You Into Paying to File Your Taxes[10]', the background: Intuit and other tax software companies have spent millions lobbying to make sure that the IRS doesn't offer its own tax preparation and filing service. In exchange, the companies have entered into an agreement with the IRS to offer a 'Free File' product to most Americans \u2014 but good luck finding it. It's a long article, because it details the really extravagant lengths that TurboTax went to, to stick their hand into your pocket. They made it impossible to get to the real free site from the paid site.They invented a fake 'free' site that was confusingly similar to the real free site, but was not free. Then they made sure that the fake site came up first in Google searches, and the real free site was buried. If you knew what you were looking for, you could Google for the real free site. Going there, this dialog would appear:Another Google search brought them to a page with two options: 'See If You Qualify' and 'Start for Free.' The 'Start for Free' link brought them back to the version of TurboTax where they had to pay, but the 'See If You Quality' link finally took them to the real Free File program. BWA-HA-HA-HA! It's GENIUS! (And an entire web development team and its managers were paid quite well to implement this crooked scheme, too. Intuit is, of course, located in Mountain View, California.) So, with those definitions and examples under our belt, we can turn to Arunesh Mathur, Gunes Acar, Michael Friedman, Elena Lucherini, Jonathan Mayer, Marshini Chetty, and Arvind Narayanan, 'Dark Patterns at Scale: Findings from a Crawl of 11K Shopping Websites[11]' (PDF) Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction. November 2019. (Here is mobile-friendly version[12] of the text.) Here is the conclusion: In this paper, we developed an automated techniques to study dark patterns on the web at scale. By simulating user actions on the \u223c11K most popular shopping websites, we collected text and screenshots of these websites to identify their use of dark patterns. We defined and characterized these dark patterns, describing how they affect users decisions by linking our definitions to the cognitive biases leveraged by dark patterns. We found at least one instance of dark pattern on approximately 11.1% [1,254] of the [11K] examined websites. Furthermore, we observed that dark patterns are more likely to appear on popular websites. Finally, we discovered that dark patterns are often enabled by third-party entities, of which we identify 22, two of which advertise practices that enable deceptive patterns. Based on these findings, we suggest that future work focuses on empirically evaluating the effects of dark patterns on user behavior, developing countermeasures against dark patterns so that users have a fair and transparent experience, and extending our work to discover dark patterns in other domains. The 'simulating user actions' part is really amazing and fun stuff. First, they built a crawler to detect shopping sites. Then, they curated the list of URLs the first crawler found, and fed that to a second crawler: capable of navigating users' primary interaction path on shopping websites: making a product purchase. Our crawler aligned closely with how an ordinary user would browse and make purchases on shopping websites: discover pages containing products on a website, add these products to the cart, and check out. They then manually examined the primary interaction paths, curated them for dark patterns, and threw them into buckets. Table I:Table 1 summarizes categories (for example, 'Obstruction'), Type ('Hard to Cancel'), giving a description, quantification of sites and usages, and its place in the author's taxonomy (whether asymmetricak, covert, deceptive, information hiding, or restrictive). Using their categories, I suppose that the LinkedIn example above would be classified as 'Visual Inference,' because users would skip the grey type that explained what the prominent button really did. The TurboTax example would be 'Trick Questions,' because of the deceptive language. Readers, you may test the robustness of these categories and types from your own online shopping experiences, if any. Here is Figure 2, which shows that more popular websites are more likely to use dark patterns:And then, there is 'an ecosystem of third-party entities' that sells dark pattern development:We discovered a total of 22 third-party entities, embedded in 1,066 of the 11K shopping websites in our data set, and in 7,769 of the Alexa top million websites. Many of the third-parties advertised practices that appeared to be\u2014and sometimes unambiguously were\u2014manipulative: '[p]lay upon [customers'] fear of missing out by showing shoppers which products are creating a buzz on your website' (Fresh Relevance), '[c]reate a sense of urgency to boost conversions and speed up sales cycles with Price Alert Web Push' (Insider), '[t]ake advantage of impulse purchases or encourage visitors over shipping thresholds' (Qubit).. In some instances, we found that third parties openly advertised the deceptive capabilities of their products. For example, Boost dedicated a web page\u2014titled 'Fake it till you make it'\u2014to describing how it could help create fake orders. Woocommerce Notification\u2014a Woocommerce[2] platform plugin\u2014also advertised that it could create fake social proof messages: '[t]he plugin will create fake orders of the selected products' Finally, note that the problem may be even worse than the authors describe, because the scope of the study is limited: 1,818 represents a lower bound on the number of dark patterns on these websites, since our automated approach only examined text-based user interfaces on a sample of products pages per website. In other words, if the dark pattern was implemented as a graphic, their crawlers wouldn't catch it. Also, the study would not catch dark patterns above the UI/UX level, as with TurboTax creating an entire fake site, and then gaming Google search to point to it.  Finally, let's turn to S1084, 'Deceptive Experiences To Online Users Reduction Act[13]' (DETOUR Act). Introduced by Senators Mark Warner (D-VA) and Deb Fischer (R-NE), the original co-sponsor, it sadly has gained no additional co-sponsors. (Senator Josh Hawley[14] (R-MO) is also toiling in the same vineyard with the Social Media Addiction Reduction Technology (SMART) Act.) Warner's bill has a behavioral or psychological research component, but here is the section relevant to dark patterns:SEC. 3. UNFAIR AND DECEPTIVE ACTS AND PRACTICES RELATING TO THE MANIPULATION OF USER INTERFACES. (a) Conduct Prohibited.\u2014 (1) IN GENERAL.\u2014It shall be unlawful for any large online operator\u2014 (A) to design, modify, or manipulate a user interface with the purpose or substantial effect of obscuring, subverting, or impairing user autonomy, decision-making, or choice to obtain consent or user data; (B) to subdivide or segment consumers of online services into groups for the purposes of behavioral or psychological experiments or studies, except with the informed consent of each user involved; or (C) to design, modify, or manipulate a user interface on a website or online service, or portion thereof, that is directed to an individual under the age of 13, with the purpose or substantial effect of cultivating compulsive usage, including video auto-play functions initiated without the consent of a user. Gizmodo[15] describes the bill as follows: According to ZDNet[16], practices that could be targeted under the bill include suddenly interrupting tasks unless users hit consent buttons, setting 'agree' as the default option for privacy settings, and creating convoluted procedures for users to opt-out of data collection or barring access 'until the user agrees to certain terms.' In other words, this would radically change how a handful of massive companies whose entire business model relies on monetizing troves of user data operate.  'Any privacy policy involving consent is weakened by the presence of dark patterns. These manipulative user interfaces intentionally limit understanding and undermine consumer choice. Misleading prompts to just click the 'OK' button can often transfer your contacts, messages, browsing activity, photos, or location information without you even realizing it,' Fischer added. 'Our bipartisan legislation seeks to curb the use of these dishonest interfaces and increase trust online.'As we have seen, Fischer is quite correct. The industry critique[17] I have found focuses, tellingly, not on the patterns themselves, but on the definition of 'large online operator'. Will Rinehart of the American Action Forum:While the Act's goals are laudable, it suffers from a crippling fault: ambiguity. Its broad language would give the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) legal space to second guess every design decision by online companies, and, in the most expansive possible reading, it would make nearly all large web sites presumptively illegal.You say 'make nearly all large web sites presumptively illegal' like that's a bad thing!  The Act defines large online operators as any online service with more than 100 million 'authenticated users of an online service in any 30 day period' that is also subject to the jurisdiction of the FTC. Conspicuously, the Act doesn't define what constitutes an 'authenticated user,' which is important for understanding its scope. If authenticated user means that a site must have user profiles, then Google wouldn't be included at all because it doesn't require users to create a profile. Furthermore, if these 100 million users all had to be in the United States, then only Facebook, Instagram, and Facebook Messenger would be regulated because only these sites hit the threshold. So strike out 'authenticated.' Or are only authenticated users entitles to avoid trickery? The critique also urges that (tl;dr) 'manipulation of user interfaces' is good, actually, and everybody does it, but I would urge that legislators crafting the bill simply talk to Mathur, Acar, Friedman, Lucherini, Mayer, Chetty, and Narayanan to find out what businesses do and do not do, and what is deceptive and what is not; in essence, Rinehart's idea is that consumer fraud is indistinguishable from normal business practice in the digital realm. I don't think the country has yet fallen that low.* * *Oh, the phishing equilibibrium part: I don't want to become tedious by constantly hammering Akerloff and Shiller's long definition[3], so I'll use my 'on a postcard' version[18]: 'If fraud can happen, it will already have happened.' It's hard to think of a better example of this principle than dark patterns. The fact that there's an entire ecosystem of third parties that supports scamming the users makes the entire situation all the more disgusting. NOTES [1] Akerlof and Shiller give an operational definitition of the outcome of a phishing equilibrium for users: '[M]aking decisions that NO ONE COULD POSSIBLY WANT' (caps in original); for example, retaining your subscription when you meant to cancel it. [2] One might wonder if Adobe's hilarious 'Woo Woo' video is a sly insider reference:[embedded content][3] From NC, 'Angling for Dollars: A Review of Akerlof and Shiller's Phishing for Phools[19]'  The fundamental concept of economics is the notion of market equilibrium. For our explanation, we adapt the example of the checkout lane at the supermarket. When we arrive at the checkout at the supermarket, it usually takes at least a moment to decide which lane to choose. This decision entails some difficulty because the lines are \u2014 as an equilibrium \u2014 of almost the same length. This equilibrium occurs for the simple and natural reason that the arrivals at the checkout are sequentiallly choosing the shortest line. The principle of equilibrium, which we see in the checkout lanes, applies to the economy much more generally. As businesspeople choose what line of business to undertake \u2014 as well as where they expand, or contract, their existing business \u2014 they (like customers approaching checkout) pick off the best opportunities. This too creates an equilibrium. Any opportunities for unusual profits are quickly taken off the table, leading to a situation where such opportunities are hard to find. This principle, with the concept of equilibrium it entails, lies at the heart of economics. The principle also applies to phishing for phools. That means that if we have some weakness or other \u2014 some way in which we can be phished for fools for more than the usual profit \u2014 in the phishing equilibrium someone will take advantage of it[2]. Among all those business persons figuratively arriving at the checkout counter, looking around, and deciding where to spend their investment dollars, some will look to see if there are unusual profits from phishing us for phools. And if they see such an opportunity for profit, that will (again figuratively) be the 'checkout lane' they choose. And economies will have a 'phishing equilibrium,' in which every chance for profit more than the ordinary will be taken up.'Every' really meaning every. To put the idea in simpler terms with a more limited use case: 'If fraud can happen, it will already have happened.' <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2019/08/phishing-equilibria-in-e-commerce-shopping-sites-and-dark-patterns.html?utm_source=feedburner..._medium=feed..._campaign=Feed:+NakedCapitalism+%28naked+capitalism%29#\">https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2019/08/phishing-equilibria-in-e-commerce-shopping-sites-and-dark-patterns.html?utm_source=feedburner..._medium=feed..._campaign=Feed:+NakedCapitalism+%28naked+capitalism%29#</url> This entry was posted in Banana republic[20], Free markets and their discontents[21], Guest Post[22], Ridiculously obvious scams[23] on August 18, 2019[24] by Lambert Strether[25].  About Lambert StretherReaders, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism ('Because markets'). I don't much care about the 'ism' that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don't much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue \u2014 and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me \u2014 is the tens of thousands of excess 'deaths from despair,' as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics \u2014 even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton's wars created \u2014 bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow \u2014 currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press \u2014 a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let's call such voices 'the left.' Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn't allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I've been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it.

Frank[1] A recent investigation by Motherboard revealed that phone carriers were selling customer location data to third parties[2] and some of had ended up on the black market.On Tuesday, Motherboard revealed[3] that T-Mobile, AT...and Sprint were all selling their customers' phone location data that ultimately ended up in the hands of bounty hunters, as well as people unauthorized to handle it at all. We found this by purchasing the capability to locate a phone from the black market for just $300. In response, several senators called[4] for the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to investigate, and brought up the prospect of greater regulation of the telecommunications industry.Since publicizing this:Now, AT...ays it is stopping the sale of all location data to so-called location aggregators, companies that sit in the supply chain between the telcos and clients, and which play a vital role in having that data trickle down to end users. [] In several different tweets posted after Motherboard's investigation, T-Mobile CEO John Legere reiterated that the company is also going to cut off all location aggregators[5], and that T-Mobile plans to have finished that process in March. </p><p>Of course, skepticism remains. Statements made by Senator Ron Wyden include:'For the second time in six months, carriers are pledging to stop sharing American's location with middlemen without their knowledge. I'll believe it when I see it. Carriers are always responsible for who ends up with their customers data\u2014it's not enough to lay the blame for misuse on downstream companies,' Wyden said in a statement. He added 'The time for taking these companies at their word is long past - Congress needs to pass strong legislation to protect Americans' privacy and finally hold corporations accountable when they put your safety at risk by letting stalkers and criminals track your phone on the dark web.'Right on, Ron. But this is obvious to almost everyone now. How about sticking your neck out like Senators Richard Blumenthal[6] (CT) and Patrick Colbeck[7] (MI) who have already asked Congress[8] to protect Americans and the environment[9] from corporations including AT...0] that have been forcing risky[11] technology and infrastructure[12] on the public via the 'Race for 5G[13],' 'Internet of Things[14] (IoT), 'Smart Cities[15],' Utility 'Smart' Meters[16], Artificial Intelligence (AI), Automated Vehicles[17] (AV), and more[18].Download Your First Issue Free!

Decades of research[20] have already proven that exposure to all sources[21] of cell phone[22] and wireless[23] WiFi radiation is harmful[24] to humans, animals[25], and nature[26]. This includes 5G[27]. Legislation and guidelines[28] for wireless devices and infrastructure[29] are 20+ years old. They don't apply[30] to how we use[31] or are exposed to this technology today. Senator Sherrod Brown[32] also recently accused Congress of not upholding antitrust[33] issues with Big Tech. This reality grows more obvious to everybody every single day. However, it hasn't stopped the unwanted and unnecessary installation of dangerous and risky devices[34] and infrastructure on homes and throughout U.S. communities[35] - DESPITE WIDESPREAD CONCERN[36], OPPOSITION, and of course, RESEARCH PROVING HARM.[37]Activist Post Daily NewsletterSubscription is FREE and CONFIDENTIAL Free Report: How To Survive The Job Automation Apocalypse with

After Sending over 1 million Patriotic-Themed Messages, the Trump Campaign's Text Messaging Program was taken Offline by Anti-Spam Monitors. It raised Alarms about whether the Initiative will face Roadblocks in the Run-Up to the Election.Trump Son-in-Law, Jared Kushner, a White House Senior Adviser who wields Vast Control over the President's Political Apparatus, quickly reached out to Verizon and T-Mobile Executives to Inquire about Initiating Communication between the campaign and the Companies in hopes of Fixing the Problem.It took Five days to Resolve the Shutdown, leading Republicans to worry the same thing could happen this Fall as the President urges his Supporters to Vote, when the stakes will be much higher.People familiar with the Chain of Events said Verizon, T-Mobile, and AT&amp;#38;T, flagged Potential Regulatory Problems with the Peer-to-Peer Messaging Operation, which differs from Robo-Texting in that Texts are sent Individually, as Opposed to a Mass Blast. </p><p>But it looked like it was Violating, by Not having an Opt-Out Options and needed an Acknowledgment to Send. But within Trump's orbit, the Episode has further Fueled Suspicions that Big Tech Companies are looking to Influence the Election. In recent weeks, the President has accused Twitter and Facebook of Censoring Conservative Voices and Son Donald Trump Jr. has Alleged that Gmail is sending Re-Election Campaign Emails to Spam Folders.'They're all working to get out the vote, so to see telecom come down and prevent any campaign or organization from getting out the vote is troubling.\" Tim Cameron, a Digital Strategist who has worked for the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC).'A campaign's email and text messaging list are some of the most important assets they have in 2020,' said Eric Wilson, a Republican Digital Strategist who worked on Marco Rubio's 2016 Presidential Campaign, adding that it was 'really very concerning to see that such a significant issue happened and to see that it wasn't resolved in a timely manner.'People Close to Verizon, T-Mobile, and AT&amp;#38;T, said the Decision was Not made by them, but rather by Third-Party Administrators they Employ to Monitor Text Messaging and Protect Consumers from Spamming. They strenuously Denied that there was any Partisan Intent and say they were merely following Guidelines conveyed by the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association (CTIA), a Trade Group that represents Mobile Phone Companies.The Organization said in a Statement, 'We expect all senders \u2014 whether airlines, schools, banks or campaigns \u2014 to include clear opt-out language and gain prior consent before sending a text. These simple steps help protect consumers from spam and maintain text messaging as a trusted medium for everyone,'.Democrats also use text messaging in their campaigns, but the digitally focused Trump reelection effort is particularly emphasizing it. It has spent the past few years harvesting cellphone numbers, including from attendees to the president's trademark rallies. The onset of the coronavirus pandemic has ensured that voter outreach will be more digital \u2014 and text message-centered \u2014 than usual.This month's Operation was intended as a Dry Run to determine whether the Texting Program would run into Problems, and to Avoid reprising Mitt Romney's Election Day Experience in 2012, when his lightly Tested Voter Turnout Program Crashed as People headed to the Polls. Come Fall, the Trump Political Apparatus is looking to Send Tens of Millions of Messages to Supporters prodding them to Vote.The Problem was eventually Ironed-Out after a Series of Conversations with the Wireless Companies and their Third-Party Administrators. But the Damage was already done. The Independence Day Message was Get-Out-the-Vote-Themed, but the Resulting Shutdown of the Campaign's Texting Infrastructure also hampered Donor Outreach.The Trump Campaign has previously faced Pushback over its Text Messaging Tactics. Three Minnesotans have filed a Lawsuit alleging the Re-Election effort sent Text Messages without Receiving Consent. A Federal Judge, last month, Denied the Campaign's Motion to Dismiss the Case. The Legal Wrangling centers on a 1991 Federal Law which aims to Shield Consumers from a Deluge of Unwanted Robocalls and Texts.But Changing Technology has created Ambiguities around the Statute's Requirements, and Businesses with an interest in reaching out to People via Text have called on the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to provide Greater Clarity. More recently, the FCC has Ruled that Peer-to-Peer Texting does Not Require Consent, as long as Texts are sent Individually and Not by Auto-Dial or Robo-Dial Phone Calls.'Peer-to-peer texting has quickly become a critical tool for Republicans and Democrats. Both sides agree, it's going to lead to more Americans voting, a great thing for our country,' said Gary Coby, the Trump Campaign's Digital Director. 'There is bipartisan commitment to continue working with mobile carriers and the entire mobile messaging industry to ensure the channel remains open and secure.'NYC Wins When Everyone Can Vote!

These ASCAP songwriters highlighted the importance of updating a long-outdated consent decree with the Department of Justice, which was originally established in 1941 and last updated in 2001. In the United States, royalties from the performance of musical compositions are collected and distributed by the Performing Rights Organizations (PROs), of which ASCAP is one. The latest version of the decree went into force before the iPod hit the masses, and, more importantly, Spotify and Pandora started their streaming services. Under this system, songwriters get paid a fraction of a penny with each stream.Progress for an update to the decree has been slow-going as songwriters battle decades of outdated legislation, lobbyists for streaming services like Pandora and Spotify, and the stereotype that professionals within the music industry lead a jet-set lifestyle. 'I think that people think if you're on television and if you're on stage and if you're on the Grammys, that you're rich,\" said R...inger Brian McKnight. \"That's not the case. We're not saying we want to be rich but we want something that's fair, and right now, it's just not fair.' Songwriter Brett James, who has written songs for artists including Taylor Swift, Kelly Clarkson, Carrie Underwood, and Tim McGraw stated, 'American songwriters, especially the non-performers who we are representing now ... we're a pretty small group. If you take all the professional American songwriters that actually make a true living at it you could probably stick them in a third of the Google building. Therein lies the challenge, because big tech is not a fan of paying content creators.' To give an example of how poorly songwriters are paid for their craft through streaming, James continued 'I did a song with Kenny Chesney called 'When the Sun Goes Down.' It was number 1 in country radio and it received 45 million streams on Pandora and my share was $1,200.' For those of you at home doing the math, that equals 0.00002667 cents per stream. ASCAP Foundation President Paul Williams remains determined to make change happen. 'The needs we have are immediate,' said Williams. 'When three-fourths of our income as music creators is regulated by the government, operated by a consent decree that was created in 1941, we're in trouble. We want everybody to roll up and say 'Yes, this is something that will make a difference in songwriters' lives.''

Luxury glass high-rises and tech offices have gone up, and new tech sprouting up on city streets has become so common that an office devoted to regulating emerging technologies[2] is set to launch. Here's how some parts of the city have transformed since 2010. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[3] A lot has changed in San Francisco since 2010. Ridesharing cars and e-scooters moved in[4], robots started roaming the streets, and Twitter[5] and Uber[6] planted their global headquarters in the city instead of down south in the Valley like their tech-giant counterparts. </p><p>Luxury glass skyscrapers[7] have been erected, and more tech offices have sprouted up. And perhaps nothing has shifted the cityscape as visibly as Salesforce Tower; the high-rise that houses the cloud-software giant now appears in the distance behind the most iconic views of the city. The omnipresent tower is emblematic of big tech's growth within San Francisco in the past decade as tech companies and workers have continuously filed into city limits. The tech invasion has visibly choked much of the bohemian spirit out of the city[8], with decades-old music stores closing and artists being driven out. Tech money has even enabled projects in the city to come to fruition \u2014 the Golden State Warrior's $1.4 billion world-class sports arena, for example, wouldn't have seen the light of day without big tech bucks.[9] Here's how some parts of San Francisco have changed within the last 10 years and what that means for the city. The city skyline was void of the imposing Salesforce Tower in 2013, which was when construction began.

Salesforce Tower, the mixed-use high-rise at 181 Fremont, the infamously sinking Millennium Tower, the Golden State Warriors' Chase Center, and the city's $2.2 billion Salesforce Transit Center are just some of the new developments built in the past decade. Here's how they've impacted the city. </p><p>Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[1] San Francisco saw a number of new buildings this past decade \u2014 and most are linked to the region's tech boom. A 2013 photo of the city's skyline is void of Salesforce Tower's imposing figure. In 2019, it stands high and proud well above the well-known Transamerica Pyramid, beating out the 50-year-old building as the city's highest building. And other additions to the city, like ultra-luxury condo high-rises and a $1.4 billion world-class sports center backed by Silicon Valley tech money, show just how integrated big tech has become into the fabric of the cityscape and its infrastructure. Unsurprisingly, most of the buildings on this list are in the city's East Cut neighborhood.[2] This is where a high concentration of condo high-rises and tech offices \u2014like Salesforce, Facebook, Google, and Slack \u2014 have set up shop. The neighborhood also sits within District 6, a district that has seen 60% of the city's housing development in the past decade amidst San Francisco's notoriously stringent zoning restrictions. Here's how some of the buildings built in the last decade have impacted San Francisco. It's difficult not to start off with San Francisco's $1 billion Salesforce Tower. The imposing tower makes quite a statement in the skyline. Ben Margot/APSource: Business Insider[3]Construction on the tower in the heart of downtown commenced in 2013. Eric Risberg/APSource: San Francisco Chronicle[4]When it was finished in 2017, it beat San Francisco's beloved Transamerica Pyramid Building as the tallest building in the city.

Under the new leadership, are they going to take a harder look at all of these businesses and start to try to focus more on ones that provide growth,\" said Daniel Morgan, a portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company, which owns Alphabet shares worth over $100 million (\ufffd76m). \"That would add an extra excitement about the stock.\"</p><p>Alphabet's Other Bets division, which includes those ventures, had an operating loss of $3.4 billion (\ufffd2.6bn) last year, compared to a $36.5bn (\ufffd27.7bn) operating profit delivered by Google. Pichai now faces the challenge of balancing the potential benefit of bold yet uncertain bets about future technology with their short-term costs.</p><p>Investments in Other Bets have already been cut over the last two years, as Alphabet pushes more money into Google's cloud computing and consumer hardware businesses. Pichai could continue that trend, analysts said.</p><p>\"I don't think this means they're going to discard their other bets. I think they will continue to explore other potential business opportunities, but those may be under greater scrutiny,\" said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments LLC, which holds shares of Alphabet on behalf of its clients.</p><p>Known for his Lanvin sneakers and easygoing style, Pichai steps into his new role as antitrust enforcers in Washington, Brussels and elsewhere are stepping up their scrutiny of Google, which is the internet's dominant search engine and the maker of the leading Android mobile operating system.</p><p>The company has also been in the crosshairs over how it manages \"hate speech\" and extremist content online, and how it deals with children's privacy on its YouTube video service.</p><p>Recently, its employees organised to protest against what some claimed was a lack of corporate action on sexual harassment by executives, as well as Google's dealings with the US military and border security authorities.</p><p>When Google dropped out of bidding for a massive military cloud computing contract, it faced criticism for being unpatriotic, and Pichai appeared to ease tensions with a fence-mending visit with US president Donald Trump.</p><p>Last December, Pichai kept calm while testifying in Congress as he parried US lawmakers over complaints of political bias and intrusive data collection.</p><p>\"We build our products in a neutral way,\" Pichai said in one exchange.</p><p>Avi Greengart, of the research consultancy Techsponential, said of Pichai: \"His temperament seems very calm and measured, but I don't think that is the reason he is getting the top position.\"</p><p>Greengart said Pichai was selected to be the public face of the larger company for several reasons, with Page and Brin fading into the background.</p><p>\"As the big tech companies get in the crosshairs, you need someone who is willing to sit in that seat, and I don't think Sergey and Larry were all that interested,\" he said.</p><p>Greengart said putting Pichai in charge of both Alphabet and Google may also be an acknowledgment that the 2015 reorganisation was a mistake and that the various operations need to be more tightly integrated.</p><p>He added that Pichai has been effective in helping Google's hardware efforts, especially with its digital home products, which could help reduce its dependence on online advertising.</p><p>\"It does seem clear that hardware end-points are a big part of his Google strategy,\" Greengart said.</p><p>Born in the southern India city of Chennai, Pichai studied engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) in Kharagpur before heading to the US.</p><p>After leaving India, he earned a degree in engineering and materials science at Stanford University and a master's in business administration at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.</p><p>Pichai's low-key style has kept him out of the public limelight. With interests in football and cricket, he is married to a fellow IIT student, Anjali Pichai, with whom he has two children.</p><p>He joins a long list of India-born CEOs of major global companies.</p><p>Among the most notable are Hyderabad-born Satya Nadella of Microsoft, Rajeev Suri of Nokia, Shantanu Narayen of Adobe and, until her departure last year, Indra Nooyi at PepsiCo.</p><p>Manu Kumar Jain, the Indian-born vice-president of Chinese tech firm Xiao-mi, welcomed the news.</p><p>\"From learning alphabets in Jawahar Vidyalaya to leading \"#Alphabet\" one of the most valued tech companies. Congratulations @sundarpichai. You are an inspiration to all,\" Jain tweeted.</p><p>Indian billionaire Anand Mahindra, whose business empire spans everything from cars to real estate, congratulated Pichai, joking that India's \"most robust export product is probably the 'Global CEO!'

Under the new leadership, are they going to take a harder look at all of these businesses and start to try to focus more on ones that provide growth,\" said Daniel Morgan, a portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company, which owns Alphabet shares worth over $100 million (\ufffd76m). \"That would add an extra excitement about the stock.\"</p><p>Alphabet's Other Bets division, which includes those ventures, had an operating loss of $3.4 billion (\ufffd2.6bn) last year, compared to a $36.5bn (\ufffd27.7bn) operating profit delivered by Google. Pichai now faces the challenge of balancing the potential benefit of bold yet uncertain bets about future technology with their short-term costs.</p><p>Investments in Other Bets have already been cut over the last two years, as Alphabet pushes more money into Google's cloud computing and consumer hardware businesses. Pichai could continue that trend, analysts said.</p><p>\"I don't think this means they're going to discard their other bets. I think they will continue to explore other potential business opportunities, but those may be under greater scrutiny,\" said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments LLC, which holds shares of Alphabet on behalf of its clients.</p><p>Known for his Lanvin sneakers and easygoing style, Pichai steps into his new role as antitrust enforcers in Washington, Brussels and elsewhere are stepping up their scrutiny of Google, which is the internet's dominant search engine and the maker of the leading Android mobile operating system.</p><p>The company has also been in the crosshairs over how it manages \"hate speech\" and extremist content online, and how it deals with children's privacy on its YouTube video service.</p><p>Recently, its employees organised to protest against what some claimed was a lack of corporate action on sexual harassment by executives, as well as Google's dealings with the US military and border security authorities.</p><p>When Google dropped out of bidding for a massive military cloud computing contract, it faced criticism for being unpatriotic, and Pichai appeared to ease tensions with a fence-mending visit with US president Donald Trump.</p><p>Last December, Pichai kept calm while testifying in Congress as he parried US lawmakers over complaints of political bias and intrusive data collection.</p><p>\"We build our products in a neutral way,\" Pichai said in one exchange.</p><p>Avi Greengart, of the research consultancy Techsponential, said of Pichai: \"His temperament seems very calm and measured, but I don't think that is the reason he is getting the top position.\"</p><p>Greengart said Pichai was selected to be the public face of the larger company for several reasons, with Page and Brin fading into the background.</p><p>\"As the big tech companies get in the crosshairs, you need someone who is willing to sit in that seat, and I don't think Sergey and Larry were all that interested,\" he said.</p><p>Greengart said putting Pichai in charge of both Alphabet and Google may also be an acknowledgment that the 2015 reorganisation was a mistake and that the various operations need to be more tightly integrated.</p><p>He added that Pichai has been effective in helping Google's hardware efforts, especially with its digital home products, which could help reduce its dependence on online advertising.</p><p>\"It does seem clear that hardware end-points are a big part of his Google strategy,\" Greengart said.</p><p>Born in the southern India city of Chennai, Pichai studied engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) in Kharagpur before heading to the US.</p><p>After leaving India, he earned a degree in engineering and materials science at Stanford University and a master's in business administration at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.</p><p>Pichai's low-key style has kept him out of the public limelight. With interests in football and cricket, he is married to a fellow IIT student, Anjali Pichai, with whom he has two children.</p><p>He joins a long list of India-born CEOs of major global companies.</p><p>Among the most notable are Hyderabad-born Satya Nadella of Microsoft, Rajeev Suri of Nokia, Shantanu Narayen of Adobe and, until her departure last year, Indra Nooyi at PepsiCo.</p><p>Manu Kumar Jain, the Indian-born vice-president of Chinese tech firm Xiao-mi, welcomed the news.</p><p>\"From learning alphabets in Jawahar Vidyalaya to leading \"#Alphabet\" one of the most valued tech companies. Congratulations @sundarpichai. You are an inspiration to all,\" Jain tweeted.</p><p>Indian billionaire Anand Mahindra, whose business empire spans everything from cars to real estate, congratulated Pichai, joking that India's \"most robust export product is probably the 'Global CEO!'

The CEOs of Facebook, Amazon.com Inc, Alphabet's Google and Apple, are set to speak before the House Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel on July 27. They will present their testimonies virtually, according to sources familiar with their plans.  The panel is questioning the companies as part of its probe into whether they actively work to harm and eliminate smaller rivals, while not always making the best choices for their customers.  The high-profile hearing, which will bring together Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Apple's Tim Cook and Google's Sundar Pichai, will be a key moment in the growing backlash against Big Tech in the United States and is likely to set up a face-off between the executives and skeptical lawmakers from both parties.  Many tech lobbying groups say the hearing is unlikely to address core antitrust issues or bring new information to the table, however.  Apple is likely to be quizzed about the way it manages its app store after facing criticisms it hurts newcomers. Apple told Reuters it will argue it does not have controlling market share for apps. The iPhone maker views its store as a feature designed to ensure the security and reliability of its phones.  Apple will address issues such as the approval process for the app store - long a sore point with developers who have said their apps are held up without warning - and allegations it does not share key functions such as data about the phone's location.  The other companies will also contend they still face plenty of competition.  A source said Amazon's Jeff Bezos is likely to talk about the options consumers have for online purchases and how the coronavirus pandemic has boosted e-commerce overall - including for large retail rivals such as Walmart.  He is also expected to talk about small sellers on its third-party marketplace platform and \"how they have continued to thrive despite competition from Amazon,\" the source added. Amazon has come under scrutiny on how it uses data from small sellers to benefit its own business.  Bezos could also address allegations the company took advantage of the pandemic by limiting inventory sold by small sellers but will stay away from bringing up contentious issues such as the conversation around breaking up the company, the source said.  Facebook's Zuckerberg will follow a similar tack, another source said. He is expected to argue that the company has strong competitors, including Google and Amazon on the advertising side and Twitter and TikTok in social media.  Zuckerberg is expected to renew Facebook's call for government regulation in areas such as harmful content in social media, election integrity, and privacy - areas where the company has been criticized.  Details of Google's likely arguments were not available. But in recent weeks the firm has published blog posts and a white paper asserting that it still faces plenty of competition and that the fees it charges ad buyers and sellers are justified.  Amazon, Facebook and Google declined comment.  \"There's not much tech CEOs can do to appease anti-tech critics... this hearing is not about finding truth but creating news stories,\" said Carl Szabo, vice president and general counsel at industry lobby group NetChoice.  Some industry observers disagreed.  The U.S. does not have regulations to deal with the practices employed by large tech companies and the hearing is a key step in that direction, Dipayan Ghosh, a fellow at the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School said during an interview organized by the Capitol Forum.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42684527660</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60FC-2P01-F07F-84YX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"688\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Deccan Herald</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 25, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

And yet, the former University of Manitoba grad is considered among the most respected behavioural economists on the planet, having worked with Richard Thaler and Meir Statman.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">If those names don\u2019t ring a bell, either, don\u2019t worry. Just know they are well-known among financial analysts, economists and others with an interest in the business of capitalism.</p><p>Today, Prof. Shefrin is the Mario Belotti Chair to the department of finance at Santa Clara University\u2019s Leavey School of Business. He\u2019s also a frequent contributor in the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Wall Street Journal</emphasis> and the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">New York Times</emphasis>, and the author of critically lauded books focused on explaining our brains on stocks \u2014 most notable among them is <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Beyond Greed and Fear: Understanding Behavioral Finance and the Psychology of</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Investing</emphasis>, first published 20 years ago.</p><p>In town recently to speak to the local chapter of the Chartered Financial Analysts Society (CFA), Shefrin talked a little bit about his affinity for his hometown and a lot about his take on the business of stock analysis. After all, that\u2019s what drew about 100 of the city\u2019s investment analysts to the luncheon at the RBC Convention Centre earlier this month.</p><p>As the headline states, Shefrin argues drugs and stocks share much in common in how they affect the brain.</p><p>But before he made that argument, he likened stock analysis to beauty contests, a comparison first used by John Maynard Keynes, likely the one economist you remember learning about in high school. Keynes is renowned for his theory of \u201cpriming the pump\u201d of the economy. It\u2019s one of the most widely embraced economic concepts of our day, calling for government intervention to re-inflate the economy during a recession with stimuli like cutting taxes, lowering interest rates and increasing spending.</p><p>But Shefrin contends Keynes was also a \u201csuperb behavioural economist\u201d long before behavioural economics was even a thing in academia.</p><p>\u201cHe used the word \u2018sentiment,\u2019 which is what we use widely today\u2026 and he talked about \u2018excessive optimism\u2019\u2026 \u2018overconfidence\u2019 and its impact on financial markets.\u201d</p><p>Keynes also compared stock market investing to a beauty contest, in which the winners are not chosen based on objective, or even subjective, criteria. Rather, the winners merely receive the most votes. Similarly, successful stock-picking really boils down to a popularity contest.</p><p>\u201cInvestors don\u2019t use discounted cash flow to try to figure out what companies are intrinsically worth,\u201d Shefrin told the audience. \u201cThey try to figure out what other investors are most likely to think is a good company.\u201d</p><p>This presents obvious dangers: like buying a popular stock with a soaring stock price that suddenly becomes unpopular and plummets in value. The FAANGs \u2014 Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google \u2014 are potentially these investments. They\u2019re very popular and very profitable \u2014 but for how long?</p><p>Presumably, this is where sell-side analysts help. They write stock reports widely used by investment advisers and portfolio managers. But Shefrin argues these professionals can be vulnerable to getting caught up in beauty contests too, only in a different way.</p><p>You\u2019d think they wouldn\u2019t. Analysts crunch numbers generated by financial reports. They pore over past and present data to predict future performance. Plenty of math is involved. And yet, that doesn\u2019t mean the numbers they produce necessarily always add up upon closer scrutiny, he said.</p><p>At the CFA talk, Shefrin used discounted free cash flows, which analysts come up with for long-term forecasts, to support his argument. Cash flow is a little like profit, only much more instructive. The more cash flow a company generates, the faster it can grow, because cash helps firms buy more property, hire new workers, increase research and development and launch bigger, better marketing campaigns. Ultimately, strong cash flows, growing over time, help companies compete \u2014 and hopefully win more market share. But Shefrin argued many analysts \u2014 even the best \u2014 can be too optimistic about companies\u2019 long-term ability to grow cash flows and maintain competitiveness.</p><p>A denizen of Silicon Valley, he chose big tech stocks to demonstrate how analysts predict these firms\u2019 ability to generate free cash flow and grow over the long term. He notes that analyst predictions often ignore that, at some point, even the best companies with strong competitive advantages will lose their magic.</p><p>\u201cThe rest of the world is smart enough that, unless you\u2019re protected by a patent, the military or something... non-competitive, competition will erode your profits.\u201d</p><p>Some companies can maintain their advantage and continue to grow at a rapid pace. But these are the exceptions.</p><p>Otherwise, \u201cit\u2019s like assuming that all children can be above average and none can be below average,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, that\u2019s impossible.\u201d</p><p>So, why do seemingly rational analysts make what appear to be irrational predictions?</p><p>Shefrin argues analysts are people, too. As such, they can be swept up in the popular mythology of a hot stock.</p><p>But while the beauty contest metaphor is part of the story, it\u2019s not the whole story.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a drug dealer metaphor that goes along.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s more than just a metaphor.

And yet, the former University of Manitoba grad is considered among the most respected behavioural economists on the planet, having worked with Richard Thaler and Meir Statman.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">If those names don\u2019t ring a bell, either, don\u2019t worry. Just know they are well-known among financial analysts, economists and others with an interest in the business of capitalism.</p><p>Today, Prof. Shefrin is the Mario Belotti Chair to the department of finance at Santa Clara University\u2019s Leavey School of Business. He\u2019s also a frequent contributor in the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Wall Street Journal</emphasis> and the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">New York Times</emphasis>, and the author of critically lauded books focused on explaining our brains on stocks \u2014 most notable among them is <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Beyond Greed and Fear: Understanding Behavioral Finance and the Psychology of</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Investing</emphasis>, first published 20 years ago.</p><p>In town recently to speak to the local chapter of the Chartered Financial Analysts Society (CFA), Shefrin talked a little bit about his affinity for his hometown and a lot about his take on the business of stock analysis. After all, that\u2019s what drew about 100 of the city\u2019s investment analysts to the luncheon at the RBC Convention Centre earlier this month.</p><p>As the headline states, Shefrin argues drugs and stocks share much in common in how they affect the brain.</p><p>But before he made that argument, he likened stock analysis to beauty contests, a comparison first used by John Maynard Keynes, likely the one economist you remember learning about in high school. Keynes is renowned for his theory of \u201cpriming the pump\u201d of the economy. It\u2019s one of the most widely embraced economic concepts of our day, calling for government intervention to re-inflate the economy during a recession with stimuli like cutting taxes, lowering interest rates and increasing spending.</p><p>But Shefrin contends Keynes was also a \u201csuperb behavioural economist\u201d long before behavioural economics was even a thing in academia.</p><p>\u201cHe used the word \u2018sentiment,\u2019 which is what we use widely today\u2026 and he talked about \u2018excessive optimism\u2019\u2026 \u2018overconfidence\u2019 and its impact on financial markets.\u201d</p><p>Keynes also compared stock market investing to a beauty contest, in which the winners are not chosen based on objective, or even subjective, criteria. Rather, the winners merely receive the most votes. Similarly, successful stock-picking really boils down to a popularity contest.</p><p>\u201cInvestors don\u2019t use discounted cash flow to try to figure out what companies are intrinsically worth,\u201d Shefrin told the audience. \u201cThey try to figure out what other investors are most likely to think is a good company.\u201d</p><p>This presents obvious dangers: like buying a popular stock with a soaring stock price that suddenly becomes unpopular and plummets in value. The FAANGs \u2014 Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google \u2014 are potentially these investments. They\u2019re very popular and very profitable \u2014 but for how long?</p><p>Presumably, this is where sell-side analysts help. They write stock reports widely used by investment advisers and portfolio managers. But Shefrin argues these professionals can be vulnerable to getting caught up in beauty contests too, only in a different way.</p><p>You\u2019d think they wouldn\u2019t. Analysts crunch numbers generated by financial reports. They pore over past and present data to predict future performance. Plenty of math is involved. And yet, that doesn\u2019t mean the numbers they produce necessarily always add up upon closer scrutiny, he said.</p><p>At the CFA talk, Shefrin used discounted free cash flows, which analysts come up with for long-term forecasts, to support his argument. Cash flow is a little like profit, only much more instructive. The more cash flow a company generates, the faster it can grow, because cash helps firms buy more property, hire new workers, increase research and development and launch bigger, better marketing campaigns. Ultimately, strong cash flows, growing over time, help companies compete \u2014 and hopefully win more market share. But Shefrin argued many analysts \u2014 even the best \u2014 can be too optimistic about companies\u2019 long-term ability to grow cash flows and maintain competitiveness.</p><p>A denizen of Silicon Valley, he chose big tech stocks to demonstrate how analysts predict these firms\u2019 ability to generate free cash flow and grow over the long term. He notes that analyst predictions often ignore that, at some point, even the best companies with strong competitive advantages will lose their magic.</p><p>\u201cThe rest of the world is smart enough that, unless you\u2019re protected by a patent, the military or something... non-competitive, competition will erode your profits.\u201d</p><p>Some companies can maintain their advantage and continue to grow at a rapid pace. But these are the exceptions.</p><p>Otherwise, \u201cit\u2019s like assuming that all children can be above average and none can be below average,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, that\u2019s impossible.\u201d</p><p>So, why do seemingly rational analysts make what appear to be irrational predictions?</p><p>Shefrin argues analysts are people, too. As such, they can be swept up in the popular mythology of a hot stock.</p><p>But while the beauty contest metaphor is part of the story, it\u2019s not the whole story.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a drug dealer metaphor that goes along.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s more than just a metaphor. There\u2019s science behind this comparison.</p><p>The highs and lows associated with investing involve the same chemical mechanisms in the brain as drugs.

Although this was an existing trend it has been accelerated over the past few months and this has been reflected in the share prices of many tech-based companies. So this sector, which even prior to the coronavirus outbreak had high valuations, is arguably looking even more expensive. For example, the Investment Association (IA) Technology and Telecommunications sector average total return over the year to 25 June was of 29.72 per cent, compared with 5.77 per cent for MSCI World index,according to FE Analytics. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But although technology shares look more expensive than at the start of the year it doesn't necessarily mean that you should avoid or reduce exposure to this sector.</p><p>As we enter a global recession the need for companies to reduce costs should accelerate the move to cheaper and more productive ways of working via technologies such as cloud, software as a service, robotics and cyber security. Technology is also likely to play an integral role in many aspects of life in the future. David Coombs, head of multi asset at asset manager <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rathbonefunds.com/&#34; title=&#34;\">Rathbones</url> says that the acceleration of companies to the cloud over the past two months has been \"huge\" as firms adapt to remote working, and these technological adoptions are not likely to be reversed. He has a bias to software companies within the funds he runs and thinks there are some great opportunities in the medical technology space. He adds that technology \"will be the leading sector over the next three to five years, and that is pretty consensual.\"</p><p>However, Mr Coombs also points out that technology stocks are likely to be volatile with intermittent price corrections. They have been very much in favour over the past decade and this has helped technology funds outperform broader indices. However, if any global economic recovery is faster than expected, and interest rates and inflation pick up, cyclical companies such as banks and energy firms could outperform technology stocks.</p><p>And the technology companies which do best change frequently. For example, the big tech names of the late 1990s during the dotcom bubble such as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rathbonefunds.com/&#34; title=&#34;\">IBM</url> (US:IBM),       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rathbonefunds.com/&#34; title=&#34;\">Intel</url> (US:INTC) and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rathbonefunds.com/&#34; title=&#34;\">Cisco Systems</url> (US:CSCO) are not the dominant players they once were, while Lucent has been taken over. </p><p>However, if you are seeking growth, have a long-term investment horizon and can tolerate volatility, you could include an allocation to technology stocks in your portfolio. Ben Yearsley, director at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rathbonefunds.com/&#34; title=&#34;\">Shore Financial Planning</url>, says technology funds could account for \"at least 10 per cent of a portfolio, if not more [because tech] isn't going away.\"</p><p>Mr Coombs, meanwhile, says investors could have 20 to 25 per cent of the equity portion of their portfolios in technology stocks.</p><p>But be clear on how much exposure to technology you already have before investing in a dedicated sector fund. For example, a global equity fund might have up to 30 per cent of its assets invested in technology companies. Tech funds also tend to be largely invested in the US, so if you already hold a broad US equities fund make sure that adding a tech fund wouldn't mean you end up with more exposure to this sector than you want. Technology funds may also have exposure to Asia, so see how much exposure to technology any broad Asian equity funds you already hold have.</p><p>                     Problems with passive exposure                   </p><p>Also check that the technology fund you are thinking of investing in offers exposure to the areas that you want. For example, the two main technology sub sectors used to be software and hardware, and key companies in these areas included IBM and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rathbonefunds.com/&#34; title=&#34;\">Hewlett Packard</url> (US:HPE) - 20th century stalwarts. But now technology includes a much broader range of sub sectors and, for example, many technology funds hold companies that service the entertainment, retail and healthcare sectors, if their products or services are driven by technology. </p><p>This is particularly an issue if you decide to invest in technology via a passive fund. Index providers <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rathbonefunds.com/&#34; title=&#34;\">S&amp;P Global</url>and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rathbonefunds.com/&#34; title=&#34;\">MSCI</url> base their sector classifications on the      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rathbonefunds.com/&#34; title=&#34;\">Global Industry Classification Standard</url> (GICS). So when this changed in September 2018 S&amp;P and MSCI indices' sectors changed accordingly and some of the stocks in them changed sectors.</p><p>For example, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rathbonefunds.com/&#34; title=&#34;\">Facebook</url> (US:FB),       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rathbonefunds.com/&#34; title=&#34;\">Twitter</url> (US:TWTR),       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rathbonefunds.com/&#34; title=&#34;\">Alphabet</url> (US:GOOGL) and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rathbonefunds.com/&#34; title=&#34;\">Baidu</url> (US:BIDU) moved out of the Information Technology sector into the newly formed Communications Services sector.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rathbonefunds.com/&#34; title=&#34;\">Netflix</url> (US:NFLX) was also moved into this new sector, having previously been classified as a Consumer Discretionary stock.</p><p>But <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rathbonefunds.com/&#34; title=&#34;\">Amazon</url> (US:AMZN) remains in the Consumer Discretionary sector alongside companies such as       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rathbonefunds.com/&#34; title=&#34;\">Nike</url> (US:NKE),       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rathbonefunds.com/&#34; title=&#34;\">McDonalds</url> (US:MCD) and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rathbonefunds.com/&#34; title=&#34;\">Tesla</url> (US:TSLA). This is despite Amazon's cloud computing service,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rathbonefunds.com/&#34; title=&#34;\">AWS</url>, being one of the largest players in this area.</p><p>So a technology sector exchange traded fund (ETF) could fail to provide broad access to the technology theme.</p><p>\"I am not a big fan of passive sector funds or sector ETFs because they tend to be difficult to diversify and very volatile,\" says Peter Sleep, senior portfolio manager at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rathbonefunds.com/&#34; title=&#34;\">Seven Investment Management</url>.</p><p>He points out that active funds which conform to European legislation known as Undertakings for the collective investment in transferable securities (Ucits) would not be allowed to have this level of concentration. </p><p>\"It would breach the 5:10:40 Ucits diversification rule - the top 10 stocks of a fund [which account for more than 5 per cent of a fund's assets] cannot add up to more than 40 per cent of the total fund,\" explains Mr Sleep.</p><p>This diversification rule was instigated by regulators to protect investors, but passive funds such as ETFs can have higher concentration levels because the Ucits rules make an exception for index trackers.</p><p>He highlights<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rathbonefunds.com/&#34; title=&#34;\">iShares S&amp;P 500 Information Technology Sector UCITS ETF</url> (IITU) which had about 22 per cent of its assets in       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rathbonefunds.com/&#34; title=&#34;\">Microsoft</url> (US:MSFT) and 19.5 per cent       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rathbonefunds.com/&#34; title=&#34;\">Apple</url> (US:AAPL), as of 25 June. Its third largest holding is       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rathbonefunds.com/&#34; title=&#34;\">Visa</url> (US:V) in which it has 5 per cent of its assets.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rathbonefunds.com/&#34; title=&#34;\">iShares S&amp;P 500 Communication Sector UCITS ETF</url> (IUCM) had about 19 per cent of its assets in Facebook and 30 per cent in Alphabet, and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rathbonefunds.com/&#34; title=&#34;\">iShares S&amp;P 500 Consumer Discretionary Sector UCITS ETF</url> (ICDU) had about 35 per cent of its assets in Amazon, as of 25 June.</p><p>However, if you are comfortable with taking the risk of being very concentrated in certain companies, an ETF which tracks a technology index is a low cost and easy way to get exposure to this sector. And if you want exposure to a specific sub sector of technology you can do this via ETFs.</p><p>For example, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rathbonefunds.com/&#34; title=&#34;\">iShares Automation &amp; Robotics UCITS ETF</url> (RBTX) tracks iStoxx FactSet Automation &amp; Robotics index which includes companies based on how much revenue they derive from these industries. It has an ongoing charge of 0.4 per cent.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rathbonefunds.com/&#34; title=&#34;\">WisdomTree Cloud Computing UCITS ETF</url> (KLWD) tracks BVP Nasdaq Emerging Cloud Index which is composed of companies that derive the majority of their revenues from software products via a cloud delivery or cloud economic model. It also has an ongoing charge of 0.40 per cent. </p><p>But before investing in any technology ETF make sure you know which index it tracks and what weightings this has to the companies in it.</p><p>                     Active funds for tech exposure                   </p><p>If you want broad and diversified exposure to technology companies you might be better off investing in an active fund. The open-ended ones have to comply with UCITS diversification rules, and active funds do not aim to replicate indices. Also, as their managers can decide which companies count as technology companies, active funds have a wider universe to invest in than many ETFs. But when choosing an active technology fund, make sure it is well diversified, as this is a high risk and volatile sector and being well spread can dilute some of this risk.</p><p>Darius McDermott, managing director at research company <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rathbonefunds.com/&#34; title=&#34;\">FundCalibre</url>, suggests       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rathbonefunds.com/&#34; title=&#34;\">AXA Framlington Global Technology</url> (GB00B4W52V57) which he says has \"consistently been an excellent performer.\" The fund held 66 stocks at the end of May, and had about 30 per cent of its assets in software companies and 16 per cent in semiconductor companies. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rathbonefunds.com/&#34; title=&#34;\">Polar Capital Technology Trust</url> (PCT) run by Ben Rogoff , and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rathbonefunds.com/&#34; title=&#34;\">Polar Capital Global Technology Fund</url> (IE00B42W4J83) run by Mr Rogoff and Nick Evans, have both performed well. They have made similar returns to each other over three and five years but the trust has made a better share price total return over 10 years.</p><p>They have seven top 10 holdings in common, though the open-ended fund has 78 holdings and the investment trust has 108.</p><p>Polar Capital Technology Trust has an ongoing charge plus performance fee of 1.33 per cent. Polar Capital Global Technology Fund has an ongoing charge of 1.14 per cent and can levy a performance fee of 10 per cent of the out performance of Dow Jones Global Technology index. However, no performance fee was charged during 2019.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rathbonefunds.com/&#34; title=&#34;\">Allianz Technology Trust</url> (ATT) has also made strong long-term returns. About 90 per cent of its assets are invested in North America and it had 71 holdings at the end of May. Its three largest holdings are Apple, Microsoft and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rathbonefunds.com/&#34; title=&#34;\">CrowdStrike</url> (US:CRWD). It's ongoing charge is 0.92 per cent and although it can levy a performance fee did not do this in 2019. However, in 2018 the performance fee took its ongoing charge up from 0.91 per cent to 2.05 per cent.</p><p>If you feel that a dedicated technology fund is too high risk an option for you, or you have a small portfolio and do not want a large concentration of it in a single sector fund, you could also get exposure to technology stocks via a global fund with a heavy weighting to this sector. </p><p>Mr McDermott suggests <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rathbonefunds.com/&#34; title=&#34;\">Baillie Gifford Global Discovery</url> (GB0006059330) which aims to outperform S&amp;P Global Small Cap index, as stated in sterling, by at least 2 per cent a year over rolling five-year periods.

Although this was an existing trend, it has been accelerated over the past few months and this has been reflected in the share prices of many tech-based companies. So this sector, which even prior to the coronavirus outbreak had high valuations, is arguably looking even more expensive. For example, the Investment Association (IA) Technology and Telecommunications sector average total return over the year to 29 June was 19 per cent, compared with 6 per cent for MSCI World index.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But although technology shares look more expensive than at the start of the year it doesn't necessarily mean that you should avoid or reduce exposure to this sector.</p><p>As we enter a global recession the need for companies to reduce costs should accelerate the move to cheaper and more productive ways of working via technologies such as cloud, software as a service, robotics and cyber security. Technology is also likely to play an integral role in many aspects of life in the future. David Coombs, head of multi asset at asset manager Rathbones says that the acceleration of companies to the cloud over the past two months has been \"huge\" as they adapt to remote working, and these technological adoptions are not likely to be reversed. He has a bias to software companies within the funds he runs and thinks there are some great opportunities in the medical technology space. He adds that technology \"will be the leading sector over the next three to five years, and that is pretty consensual\".</p><p>However, Mr Coombs also points out that technology stocks are likely to be volatile with intermittent price corrections. They have been very much in favour over the past decade and this has helped technology funds outperform broader indices. However, if any global economic recovery is faster than expected, and interest rates and inflation pick up, cyclical companies such as banks and energy companies could outperform technology stocks.</p><p>Historically, technology leadership has proved to be quite dynamic. The big tech names of the late 1990s during the dotcom bubble, such as IBM (US:IBM), Intel (US:INTC) and Cisco Systems (US:CSCO), are not the dominant players they once were, while Lucent has been taken over.</p><p>However, if you are seeking growth, have a long-term investment horizon and can tolerate volatility, you could include an allocation to technology stocks in your portfolio. Ben Yearsley, director at Shore Financial Planning, says technology funds could account for \"at least 10 per cent of a portfolio, if not more [because tech] isn't going away\".</p><p>Mr Coombs, meanwhile, says investors could have 20 to 25 per cent of the equity portion of their portfolios in technology stocks. But be clear on how much exposure to technology you already have before investing in a dedicated sector fund. For example, a global equity fund might have up to 30 per cent of its assets invested in technology companies. Tech funds also tend to be largely invested in the US, so if you already hold a broad US equities fund make sure that adding a tech fund wouldn't mean you end up with more exposure to this sector than you want. Technology funds may also have exposure to Asia, so see how much exposure to technology any broad Asian equity funds you already hold have.</p><p>Problems with passive exposure Also check that the technology fund you are thinking of investing in offers exposure to the areas that you want. For example, the two main technology sub sectors used to be software and hardware, and key companies in these areas included IBM and Hewlett Packard (US:HPE) - 20th century stalwarts. But now technology includes a much broader range of sub sectors and, for example, many technology funds hold companies that service the entertainment, retail and healthcare sectors, if their products or services are driven by technology.</p><p>This is particularly an issue if you decide to invest in technology via a passive fund. Index providers S&amp;P Global and MSCI base their sector classifications on the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS). So when this changed in September 2018 S&amp;P and MSCI indices' sectors changed accordingly and some of the stocks in them changed sectors.</p><p>For example, Facebook (US:FB), Twitter (US:TWTR), Alphabet (US:GOOGL) and Baidu (US:BIDU) moved out of the Information Technology sector into the newly formed Communications Services sector. Netflix (US:NFLX) was also moved into this new sector, having previously been classified as a Consumer Discretionary stock.</p><p>But Amazon (US:AMZN) remains in the Consumer Discretionary sector alongside companies such as Nike (US:NKE), McDonald's (US:MCD) and Tesla (US:TSLA). This is despite Amazon's cloud computing service, AWS, being one of the largest players in this area.</p><p>So a technology sector exchange traded fund (ETF) could fail to provide broad access to the technology theme.</p><p>\"I am not a big fan of passive sector funds or sector ETFs because they tend to be difficult to diversify and very volatile,\" says Peter Sleep, senior portfolio manager at Seven Investment Management.</p><p>He points out that active funds that conform to European legislation known as 'undertakings for the collective investment in transferable securities' (Ucits) would not be allowed to have this level of concentration.</p><p>This diversification rule was instigated by regulators to protect investors, but passive funds such as ETFs can have higher concentration levels because the Ucits rules make an exception for index trackers.</p><p>He highlights iShares S&amp;P 500 Information Technology Sector UCITS ETF (IITU), which had about 22 per cent of its assets in Microsoft (US:MSFT) and 19.5 per cent in Apple (US:AAPL), as of 25 June. Its third largest holding is Visa (US:V), in which it has 5 per cent of its assets. iShares S&amp;P 500 Communication Sector UCITS ETF (IUCM) had about 19 per cent of its assets in Facebook and 30 per cent in Alphabet, and iShares S&amp;P 500 Consumer Discretionary Sector UCITS ETF (ICDU) had about 35 per cent of its assets in Amazon, as of 25 June.</p><p>However, if you are comfortable with taking the risk of being very concentrated in certain companies, an ETF that tracks a technology index is a low-cost and easy way to get exposure to this sector. And if you want exposure to a specific sub-sector of technology you can do this via ETFs.</p><p>For example, iShares Automation &amp; Robotics UCITS ETF (RBTX) tracks iStoxx FactSet Automation &amp; Robotics index, which includes companies based on how much revenue they derive from these industries. It has an ongoing charge of 0.4 per cent.</p><p>'If you want broad and diversified exposure to technology companies you might be better off investing in an active fund' WisdomTree Cloud Computing UCITS ETF (KLWD) tracks BVP Nasdaq Emerging Cloud Index, which is composed of companies that derive the majority of their revenues from software products via a cloud delivery or cloud economic model. It also has an ongoing charge of 0.40 per cent.</p><p>But before investing in any technology ETF make sure you know which index it tracks and what weightings this has to the companies in it.</p><p>Active funds for tech exposure If you want broad and diversified exposure to technology companies you might be better offinvesting in an active fund. The open-ended ones have to comply with Ucits diversification rules, and active funds do not aim to replicate indices. Also, as their managers can decide which companies count as technology ones, active funds have a wider universe to invest in than many ETFs. But when choosing an active technology fund, make sure it is well diversified, as this is a high-risk and volatile sector and being well spread can dilute some of this risk.</p><p>Darius McDermott, managing director at research company FundCalibre, suggests AXA Framlington Global Technology (GB00B4W52V57), which he says has \"consistently been an excellent performer.\" The fund held 66 stocks at the end of May, and had about 30 per cent of its assets in software companies and 16 per cent in semiconductor companies.</p><p>Polar Capital Technology Trust (PCT), run by Ben Rogoff, and Polar Capital Global Technology Fund (IE00B42W4J83), run by Mr Rogoffand Nick Evans, have both performed well. They have made similar returns to each other over three and five years, but the trust has made a better share price total return over 10 years.</p><p>They have seven top 10 holdings in common, although the open-ended fund has 78 holdings and the investment trust has 108.</p><p>Polar Capital Technology Trust has an ongoing charge plus performance fee of 1.33 per cent. Polar Capital Global Technology Fund has an ongoing charge of 1.14 per cent and can levy a performance fee of 10 per cent of the outperformance of Dow Jones Global Technology index. However, no performance fee was charged during 2019.</p><p>Allianz Technology Trust (ATT) has also made strong long-term returns. About 90 per cent of its assets are invested in North America and it had 71 holdings at the end of May. Its three largest holdings are Apple, Microsoft and CrowdStrike (US:CRWD).

Although they reinforce the idea that the main thing is to move towards a progressive tax system, but in the face of enormous inequalities, they support the installation of wealth taxes.<br/>In addition, they consider that the coronavirus exposed several weaknesses of the global economic model, which is reflected from the difficulties of rich countries in obtaining masks, to the inability to comply with quarantines in poor countries.<br/>Regarding the coming election process in the United States, the two are more hopeful in the future with Joe Biden as president.<br/>Thomas Piketty, author of \"Capital in the 21st Century\"<br/>\"The idea of taxes on the richest is important, especially when big fortunes are growing much faster than the economy.\"<br/>\"On big tech, it's clear you can't give as much power to one or two firms. It makes sense to break these monopolies in several entities or to have strong public regulation over what they may or may not do.\"<br/>\"We run the risk of making the same mistakes from 2008-2012, that is, using monetary policy to boost stock market and real estate prices, benefiting those who already own many assets and increasing inequality.\"<br/>\"The world urgently needs to develop a safety net system. If there is a blockade in India or West Africa and people have no minimum income, they will go out looking for work and food.\"<br/>\"In this crisis we learned that the care system is not as good as we thought. In France we were surprised to see that there were not enough masks even six months from the pandemic.\"<br/>\"Six months ago it was unthinking for the EU to borrow EUR 400 billion to distribute in national budgets.\"<br/>\"(Europeans with Biden) would have the possibility to resume a normal relationship with the US.\"<br/>Joseph Stiglitz, Nobel Prize in Economics<br/>\"Wealth taxes are a good idea (...) But we cannot forget that in many countries there is a regressive tax system, so imposing a wealth tax does not replace the elimination of system deficiencies.\"<br/>\"In the 1970s I said in a scientific paper that that (maximizing the value of market stocks) would not lead to social welfare and 40 years later my formulations triumphed.\"<br/>\"There are huge deficiencies in our market economy that were exposed by covid, which in some ways relate to the lack of diversification and resilience of global supply chains.\"<br/>\"(In the U.S.) they decided to act under the belief that it would be a short-term interruption. The economic plan was made on a \"V\" recovery scenario and that was always a fantasy.\"<br/>\"The U.S. is one of the few countries that does not recognize access to health as a human right. In our country there are large sectors that do not have that access because they are poor.\"<br/>\"The experiences of Sars or Ebola motivated the creation of an agency to see the risk of pandemics, whichwas dismantled under the Trump administration.\"<br/>\"Biden has a progressive agenda that wants to make the economy work better (...) He's in line with what most people want.\"<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-14365298</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60TN-JDM1-DY1R-B0XM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"545\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 11, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Econom\u00eda </className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DLA3</classCode><className>ECONOMICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp;

Maine Senate candidate has big overhaul plan for Big Tech</p><p>For all the current scrutiny Capitol Hill has placed on Silicon Valley, the average member of Congress -- aged 58 in the House and 63 in the Senate -- still appears uninformed when tasked with questioning Big Tech executives on issues such as data privacy, online disinformation and artificial intelligence.</p><p>And though recent elections have ushered in a handful of tech-savvy lawmakers, such as Rep. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, rarely have candidates made technology policy a keystone of their campaigns.</p><p>But Ross LaJeunesse, 50, a disenchanted former Google executive and one of the Democrats vying for the chance to unseat Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, is seeking to change that.</p><p>\"Congress has not only neglected its oversight of tech companies, it has neglected its responsibility to ensure that the benefits of technology and the digital economy reach all Americans,\" LaJeunesse wrote in a blog post on Medium last week. \"For too long, tech companies have lobbied their friends in Congress to avoid meaningful regulation and oversight.\"</p><p>A detailed, 10-point \"tech reform\" agenda released by LaJeunesse's campaign last week covers a wide range of technology issues currently being debated in Congress, such as data privacy, cybersecurity and election security, facial recognition and net neutrality.</p><p>LaJeunesse also wants to ensure that tech companies \"uphold and promote human and civil rights.\" Formerly Google's global head of international relations, he left the company in 2019 after learning it was developing a search engine, Dragonfly, that could be deployed in China because it conformed to the government's censorship regulations. (Google says it has since abandoned the project.)</p><p>\"We need people in government who understand tech,\" LaJeunesse told The New Yorker last month. \"Government regulation is the answer because the minute that [Google chief executive Sundar Pichai] had to testify about Dragonfly, that's when Dragonfly was dead.\"</p><p>Read my full report on LaJeunesse's tech reform agenda here. </p><p>2. Pentagon announces list of principles for artificial intelligence programs</p><p>The Pentagon on Monday announced that it was adopting a set of principles that would guide its pursuit of artificial intelligence tools for military uses. The five principles include:</p><p>   *</p><p>Responsible development of technologies by defense personnel and their contractors.</p><p>   *</p><p>Deliberate steps to minimize bias in artificial intelligence capabilities.</p><p>   *</p><p>Methods and processes that are auditable and transparent with sufficient documentation.</p><p>   *</p><p>Reliable approaches that include testing and assurance for defined uses of technology.</p><p>   *</p><p>Ensuring that technologies are governable so that any unintended consequences can be detected, and deployed systems can be terminated if they behave outside known limits.</p><p>The principles stem from recommendations made by the Defense Innovation Board in October.</p><p>\"Although technology changes, the Department's commitment to the Constitution, the Law of War, and the highest standards of ethical behavior does not,\" Defense Secretary Mark Esper said in a letter addressed to top military officials. \"I reaffirm that the Department will use artificial intelligence consistent with applicable domestic and international law, in particular the law of war.\"</p><p>Dana Deasy, the Pentagon's chief information officer, and officials at the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center will be responsible for making sure the department adheres to the principles, the Pentagon said in a statement.</p><p>-- Gopal Ratnam</p><p>3. Census Bureau's 2020 software systems switch worries IT experts</p><p>The Census Bureau shook up a major aspect of the 2020 census when it swapped out its online software just weeks before the count begins. But the agency insists the change won't present the risks technology specialists and government watchdogs fear, my colleague Michael Macagnone writes.</p><p>The agency made the change after testing revealed that its in-house online response tool, called Primus, handled a large volume of responses better than one built by contractor Pegasystems Inc. It plans to use the census-built system when the count starts next month. </p><p>The Census Bureau built the system to have the ability to switch between the two from the beginning, according to Michael Thieme, the bureau's assistant director for decennial census programs. \"We built one and the cost of building a backup is always justified in the largest peacetime civilian deployment in the country,\" he said.</p><p>Thieme said in an interview that the agency will still use the Pegasystems tool to handle the telephone response to the census, which has a much lower anticipated load. He emphasized that both systems could handle several times more concurrent users than the agency anticipates will respond at once.</p><p>\"There is nothing thrown away here, nothing wasted here. There is a change of position in the lineup,\" Thieme said. But the switch has prompted concerns from the Government Accountability Office and others over the risks related to conducting the first census that will rely on an online count. </p><p>Nick Marinos, a director in GAO's information technology and cybersecurity team, told CQ Roll Call that the Census Bureau's decision to switch between online response tools reveals the time crunch facing the agency. GAO had added census preparations to its 2017 \"high-risk list\" of government programs or operations vulnerable to mismanagement, citing technology issues as a major factor.</p><p>\"In an ideal world it would have been better to have identified that earlier,\" Marinos said of the contractor tool.</p><p>The Commerce Department's inspector general has found fault with several steps the agency took in preparation for the count, and has outstanding audits for several aspects of census IT systems. GAO also has issued several reports that highlighted risks facing census preparations, and Marinos said the agency will keep a close eye on the new procedure.</p><p>\"We see a lot of risk there but they have committed to this, so that is what we are going to be tracking,\" Marinos said. </p><p>Read Michael's full report on Census Bureau's software here. </p><p>4. Judge rules Congress can bar Huawei from federal contracts</p><p>A federal judge in Texas has ruled that a law prohibiting government agencies from buying equipment or services from Chinese telecommunications company Huawei or from companies that use its services or equipment doesn't violate the Constitution, my colleague Mark Bocchetti writes.</p><p>Judge Amos Mazzant, in a February 18 ruling, upheld a motion by government lawyers to dismiss Huawei's challenge because the law falls short of the \"historical meaning\" of legislative punishment, which he identified as an \"impermissible, legislative brand of infamy and disloyalty\" more applicable in cases involving individuals and not corporations.</p><p>Huawei had filed a challenge alleging that Section 889 of the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal 2019 (PL 115-232), enacted in August 2018, imposed a \"bill of attainder\" on both Huawei and ZTE Corp. by legislatively determining guilt and punishing the companies without judicial trial.</p><p>But Mazzant wrote that the decision of Congress to exclude both Huawei and ZTE from certain types of federal contracting \"represents no more than a customer's decision to take its business elsewhere.\" The judge quoted from a decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in a 2018 decision upholding similar action against Russian anti-virus provider Kaspersky Lab.  </p><p>Nor did the law impose an employment bar on Huawei, a second historical punishment that would be present in a bill of attainder, the judge wrote.</p><p>\"Huawei is not barred from participation in its chosen profession,\" Mazzant wrote. \"Huawei itself claims that it is a 'global leader in information and communications technology products and services.' Aside from federal agencies, 'all other individuals and companies in the universe remain free to buy and use [Huawei] products.'\"</p><p>Read Mark's full report on the Huawei ruling here. </p><p>SCHEDULES</p><p>Check out CQ Roll Call's up-to-date daily schedule of congressional hearings and more.

Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome. For those of you that don't know me, my name is James Garner. I joined Ping An Group right at the beginning of this year as Chief Strategist and Head of Investor Relations. I've been an outside observer of Ping An Group for over 8 years. But that said, since joining, I've come to understand many misunderstandings that the financial community have about our group and the way it's run, which gradually we are correcting.</p><p>The thing, however, that shocked me the most positively since I joined was the scale and the sophistication of our technology. So I would actually go so far as to say, I believe Ping An Group is genuinely one of the most technologically advanced financial institutions in the world. So today, it's with great pressure that we have with us Jessica Tan and key members of her team unveiling what they have built on the technology front over the last 6 years, which goes far beyond Lufax, which of course, we are very proud of.</p><p>For those that don't know, Jessica Tan is one of the most senior executives at Ping An Group and the key architect of the technology buildout which we are unveiling today. And I stress the word unveiling, because I do not believe many investors and analysts here today or in our webcast really know what we have done. And I can say this with confidence for the simple reason that we have actually chosen not to externally communicate on it. So what we're going to talk about today is not some new strategy, it's actually what the group has been executing on for the last 5 or 6 years, but we haven't told you.</p><p>So in terms of today, Jessica is going to kick off the event with a 30-minute presentation. We'll take a short break, because there's is a lot to digest. And then we'll have presentations from Ericson Chan, who is the CEO of Ping An Tech, and Ricky Ou, who is the Chief Product Officer of Ping An Tech. Expect the presentations will last for about 1 hour 20 minutes in total. We'll take another short break, and then we'll go straight into Q&amp;A.</p><p>So with my job done and without further ado, I'll hand you over to our tech guru, Jessica Tan, which is obviously the reason you're here today. So Jessica, thank you.</p><p>SIN YIN TAN, CHIEF OPERATION OFFICER, CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER AND EVP, PING AN INSURANCE (GROUP) COMPANY OF CHINA, LTD.: Hi, good afternoon, everyone. My name is Jessica, and welcome to our discussion today. As James mentioned, very proud to share with you what we've done over the past 5 years. This is something that we believe technology is a core backbone of Ping An Group. It's something that we power not just our core businesses, but has been the source of innovation for many of our new businesses, of which Lufax and Good Doctors are one of many.</p><p>So I'll start off with this: everyone -- everything we do is focused on our mission. We want to be the -- we are the largest diversified owner. We want to be the world-leading personal financial services provider. You've seen our 2016 financial performance, very solid revenue profit. And I think we're proud to say that for every customer for our owners we've earned $312 profit. We've also had huge growth as you've seen from our 2016 report. In terms of assets, in terms of scale of our financial services customers, we've also grown very rapidly unlike some of the financial services institution where the Internet users are a fraction -- maybe 1/3 of their total customer base. We've gone the inverse. You see that our Internet user base is almost 3x our financial services customers, and many of which are on our app. And this is a transformation, as James mentioned, that we've been consistently building over 5 years.</p><p>Of course -- and you know our ranking. I'll not dwell much on it. But how do we do this? How do we think about doing this? And this is something that I want to share with you today. We really think about it in 2 focus. I think you've always seen that of our core businesses -- in our core traditional businesses, we have our banking, insurance, asset management. And then over the past 5 years, we really created a new set of pillars, what I'll call our new businesses, over 4 ecosystems. And the way we think about our 4 ecosystems is the following: we actually went -- and we believe that financial services will really change in the way that it's been provided to people over the next 10 -- 5, 10 years. And we believe that financial services should not be bought as a product. We believe financial services should actually be integrated with everyday aspects of your life.</p><p>So we actually look in a very systematic fashion at each of the industries that we think are most relevant, not just from a GDP standpoint, but also from a individual standpoint. So as you can see here, we think that 4 sectors are most relevant for us and for our customers, all right, financial services itself, real estate, auto and health. We think that it's important to the individuals themselves and to the economy. And therefore, 5, 6 years ago, we then created everything around these 4 ecosystems. And here this is what I want to share with you, really the -- everyone knows about our left-hand side of story in the house, which is really our core businesses. You know our stellar track record in each of our businesses. But I want to share more about -- on the right-hand side of our businesses today and the underlying technology backbone that powers the entire group.</p><p>On the right-hand side, this is how we think about this, right. I mentioned, it's really about ecosystem. In each of these 4 ecosystem, our thinking is really how do we to take the technology, and how do we embed financial services into each of these ecosystems so that we can make the lives of the consumers easier so they can work together with the rest of the providers in this ecosystem. So I'll use financial services ecosystem as a start today, just so everyone understands how we think about it.</p><p>So traditional financial services institution are traditionally very asset heavy. And so we think about really financial services in a very simplified manner as one in which intermediate between assets and funds, right? And we think about the different business models like traditional businesses. Essentially, they do the business themselves, so they will actually have capital themselves to intermediate between the 2 providers.</p><p>Lufax for us was the very first company that we incubated to do -- in marketplace. And idea, as everyone know and many of you are familiar with our Lufax is the marketplace whereby we try to get buyers and sellers have access on our platform, so that is a marketplace that can sell much more efficiently. And we, as a platform provider, use our technology, use our risk, so we have our KYC and our KYP to better assess the needs of the customer and the needs of the product providers and do the matching, right? That's really what the open marketplace is. But not many know that beyond Lufax, over the years we've incubated yet another company, we call OneConnect. And we think this is an even newer evolution of the model, is an even asset lite, it's a pure technology FinTech open platform model, whereby we -- already serves about 200 banks and 2,000 nonbank financial institutions and purely using our technology. And that for us is a breakthrough. It's a breakthrough whereby we created a business purely based on the strengths of our technology. And we believe just as how the technologies have helped our core business grown very successfully, we think that we can also offer it to the rest of the 2,000-over institutions in the financial services ecosystem and help them make their business better. So Lufax, everyone is very familiar with. Everyone might ask me very complicated, legal and organizational structure of Lufax. But in its essence, it's really about an online matching platform, right? So you hear very much what our Lufax cliques will mention, the know your customer and know your products. And in the essence that's what it does, right, which we spend a lot of time investing over the past 6 years, technology about better assessing customer needs be it retail institutional investors and the product. What kind of products, what are risk rating then to do matching? This is the heart of what Lufax does.</p><p>Something a little bit less known about Lufax. Actually, last month, along with our Chairman, I was in Nanning, right, a small -- quite a small city within China. But one of the innovations that we've taken now and applied the same concept is actually helping the government manage the asset liability. So if you look in the local Chinese press, you'll see that the entire Nanning government's finances and over 200 companies which are state-owned within Nanning, their asset liability was actually run on our cloud platform. This is a -- something that Lufax can constantly reinventing itself. We want to use the same things that we've been doing on the online matching market dimension. And we will like to try using that to help the government manage the finances. So it was really cool, the facility of Nanning. We actually had the first online whereby the government actually issued one of the -- that online was an auction, it was a blind auction. We were able to help then reduce the financing cost by 14 bps in that transaction. And we're really very proud of this new invention, and we hope that we can continue to do so for other governments.</p><p>I want to then move on to OneConnect. This is perhaps -- we've publicized much less. This is -- the idea was really simple. We want to take what we have been using over the past 30 years, technology that we've -- helped our own core business, and we want to do it to the entire financial services ecosystem. As you can see, the financial services ecosystem is -- (foreign language), just RMB 200 trillion in assets, and we are only RMB 6 trillion to RMB 7 trillion assets, so we want to do the whole market, so we started the banks. Banks has -- owns -- has about 87% of the assets and profits in the whole of the China financial services market, and then we created something called a bank connect 3 years ago. And we started off with just 1 bank, a little bank called Taizhou Bank and they really tried to help it. And then today, we have about 200 over banks and 2,000 nonbanks using the platform. And the idea is really simple. We created this whole FinTech layer where we connect to each of these bank's core systems platform. And then on top of it, they can run -- we'll run the white label apps for them. We'll run their SME loans. They will go through our platform. We help them assess the risk. And they can do interbank trading.</p><p>So for example, last year alone, we just -- we had RMB 1 trillion in interbank trading on this platform. Right now, another example, we have Bank of Shanghai, which is very large bank. I think it's one of the top 3 banks in Shanghai of RMB 1 trillion in assets. Their entire direct banking mobile runs on our platform. They will actually pay us, whereby we will run and acquire customers, and we'll do promotions, everything for them. So this is something that we're very excited, because we find that if technology can help our own businesses, we can also help the remaining of the financial services sector.</p><p>So this is a little bit what we offer. We usually don't share with the public. And I think James say that, we feel really bad at IR, so he specially organized this for us. We've been mostly talking about this to our banking and nonbank institutions. But essentially, what we help them to do is that we help them to do their retail banking. As you know, a lot of the -- there's about 600 small, medium banks in China, which constitute about 40% of the RMB 200-over trillion in assets. And a lot of them are in little cities or provinces. They may not have access to a lot of the technology or the talents that they have. So -- and in retail, given the entire banking pressure they are on, we help them basically do the entire digital banking, right? So they can even tailor. They don't have to change any of their core banking platform, we can tailor various structured products for them. We'll help them develop their own online loan products and all of these just for a fee, right? They're going to have to invest heavily into their own systems. They can be online within 1 to 2 months.</p><p>We'll also do their loans. As you know, SME lending is a huge sector and a huge source of the growth in China. There's about CNY 20 trillion in SME loans by these small, medium banks in China every year. And you need -- it's a very face -- very people-intensive, very face-to-face kind of business, and we provide a platform, it is actually there's some Blockchain involved in it, whereby, we help them get real time information about their individual SMEs and can help them better access, and then we charge them a fee for it. And then as I said, the asset -- inter FI asset trading, the small, medium banks every year has bout RMB 650 trillion in trading. But 2/3 of them is actually very inefficient, because a lot of them don't have very nationwide networks. They are not able to -- they go through brokers, right? So they're much higher fee. Going through our platform can help them reduce their financing cost by 5, 10 bps, and they can do it directly with them. It's a fully Blockchain thing. We've actually taken Smart Contract concept, and we've built this where they can issue their own products on Blockchain and then they trade amongst themselves. So far, it has been about RMB 1.3 trillion on our Blockchain asset platform, and we are really excited about that.</p><p>And then one of the things we've taken even one step further, last month -- because we have this alliance about 224 banks with us. Last month, we tried something even more interesting. We said, look, we're too slow and there's too many of you. I mean, we're not enough to tailor everything for you, so we did an open API platform. So last month, we've launched this. We have over 300 APIs. There are standard APIs that they can connect to, and we make that open to them. We already have about 34 banks with their own technology team and their vendors who will develop apps and systems on our platform. And we think that will even accelerate the progress, because it's simply such a huge market. So we're very excited about this kind of new model. This epitomize what our entire group thinks about moving -- our Chairman will like us to move from one where we use -- I don't know how to translate, using capital to make money to something where equally we use technology to make company. I think, we see ourselves not just as a financial services institution, but very much a technology company at heart, and we hope that this is the beginning of how we are thinking about this.</p><p>This is another example. This is a part of our OneConnect platform, one of the modules which is very popular with this. We have many of the -- and we are very glad that many of our global banks, including the likes of HSBC, Standard Chartered, even some of the large banks within China are using our credit bureau. The 85% of the 200 banks and 2,000 FIs that I mentioned use our credit bureau. Just last month alone, we have 88 million enquiries -- loan applications that passes through our credit bureau. And we're very glad because this is something people are using it to base it on their actual loan decision, right? Last year, we have accumulated about 100 million unique borrowers, loan applications coming through us, and we're glad that we're actually helping institutions and helping consumers in that way.</p><p>I want to talk a little bit then to our health ecosystem. Something that we're very excited and very important for our consumers. And the way we think about ecosystem, I think in our previous Investor Day, we shared before. We really think about in the 3Ps way, right? Patient or consumer, because they're not sick yet; providers; and, of course, who is paying for it. And the way we think about this is that, we started off as an insurance company where our strength is really how do you manage health-related cost. But in China, as most of you know, the bulk of the health care cost is actually being borne by the social health insurance. So 6 years ago, actually, we started then offering our services to various individual governments on how to manage their social health reimbursements. Today, I think we have over 280 cities or the likes and increasing by the way, whereby you help them manage their social care -- social health care reimbursements.</p><p>So Xiamen, for example, that's one of the first cities that we did this for. In Xiamen, a population of 6 million people and 10,000 doctors, every time the doctor in the hospital -- when they prescribe something, it will run through by our engine, whereby we determine what's the right level of reimbursement that we should do, what type -- what's the right level of medication that we should have for this particular patient in this particular illness, and that's real time. I think just alone on average for the cities, we're able to help this -- the government reduce about 14% of their costs. I think this is huge impact for them, not just economically, but socially. As you know, we have a aging population in China. The affordability and sustainability of social health insurance is very important, and we think this is -- this will be very helpful for them.</p><p>And then besides on the social health insurance, on the patient side, as many of you in China would know, one of the problems of the health care in China is about having easy access to primary care services, right? Even for flu, often our colleagues will have to take half a day just to go to the hospital for a -- for flu for their kids. So what we started doing is then we created 2 things: we think about having online and off-line. So online was really our Good Doctor, which many of you know about. We are really happy how it's grown. It's only been 3 years, but we have over 150 million users. Every day, we have about 444,000 enquiries on our app. I think that provides -- it shows the need in China for affordable, online, easy primary care questions, right? So usually, they ask simple questions before, then they go to the right doctors.</p><p>Then in the off-line, something perhaps that's less known to the public, we have this Wan Jia (foreign language), whereby we try to also upgrade the capabilities of the clinics. Because, I think there are about 1 million-or-so clinics all over in China, we try to have a platform, just like what we've done for OneConnect, but we've then created something based on the standards, DNV and others to -- whereby we have a technology platform and then it has the right standards about how you should manage your patient, your health records, what's the right level so that you can qualify for the social health insurance reimbursements to better manage the health care. And this is something that we started I think about 2 years ago, and we have about -- 1.5 years ago, and we have about 50,000 clinics right now on our platform. And everything on this is actually on the Ping An Health Cloud. We hope eventually that we'll be able to make an impact in the health care economy whereby individuals can have better access in the integrated health records to them. So everything that we have, we connect it to the health cloud. You as a consumer, if you're in a particular hospital, you can actually ask to request and consolidate your health records across these various providers.</p><p>So this is an example of the social health insurance that we have, and you see this is Xiamen, this is the first one that I mentioned, where even the CIRC President at that time actually went to visit. It's not only helped save costs, but it's also huge improvement in satisfaction, a great service and then we caught a lot of violation.</p><p>We are expanding that actually to not just include social health insurance. In some cities, we're doing a pilot whereby we try to integrate different parts of the city services onto an app for the government. So not just social health care insurance, but we try to do some like their health records, their long-term insurance, public services, various things, and we help the government integrate that into an easy app that the consumers can look into.</p><p>This is our Good Doctor. Many of you know. We've grown very rapidly, now about 1,000 full-time doctors. We work with about 600 -- 60,000 part-time doctors. And every day, we have about 40 -- (foreign language), so that's 430,000 queries. Sorry, I have to keep switching between Chinese, English and so my brain is all fried up. But we think this is really helpful. So not -- at first we started doing a free online enquiries. Last year, we actually started to give cards. We have our health card. You can pay about USD 100, right? And you get about 10, 12 times of free enquiries. Then after that, we'll actually have referrals, whereby work with our preferred network and you can get access. You get 1-hour medicine delivery if you live in some of the cities that we do. So we're building a membership around here.</p><p>This is the clinic, one that I mentioned. That's about 50,000 of them. There's a extra 0 here, I apologize. And this is something that hopefully over the long term is going to be difficult, but we hope to build a good brand of affiliation of clinics that has good standards.</p><p>Then there is 2 I'll just cover very briefly, before we take a short break. There is a auto ecosystem and house, which we also don't spend much time talking about. These are ecosystems that we started to gradually think about. In auto, as some of you may know, we've actually invested in Autohome. Autohome is the largest car portal in China. It has about 76% market share in the market in China. That means every year, there's about 22 million people buying new cars, second-hand cars, 76% of them does it through Autohome. On average, you see that a person who comes here, they'll spend -- someone who wants to buy a car, they spend on average 80 days on our app, our website, looking for the right car that they want and then before they actually go to a preferred dealer through us to buy the car. So we think that it's a wonderful thing, and one of the reason we invest in this because we think there's a lot of synergies for P&amp;C insurance and of course, with our bank. As you know, we are the second-largest car insurer in China. You should -- also know that actually our Ping An Bank is the largest car financing company, both to the dealers as well as the consumers.</p><p>And so we wanted to do something for the car owners. So one of the things that we are gradually building, you see in the Autohome car release is that, not only for the customers we serve them, if you're trying to buy a car through Autohome, but also if you already have a car then through our P&amp;C we have app called Good Car Driver. And then -- we're also then working with our ecosystem partners off-line to use it in platform, so that we can better link the customers to the providers.</p><p>So for example, therefore, that Autohome has announced that they are doing. Last month, Autohome launched this car dealers. There are 29,000 car dealers in China, that's -- so the bulk of the new cars, we work with them, whereby through this they will get better access to the people who want to buy cars. We'll also offer the right financing and insurance through the platform, both for the dealers as well as to the consumers. We also have second-hand cars. Second-hand cars, as you know, in China is still a very underpenetrated market, but it's going to reverse as I just said in the U.S. Actually, there are 4 second-hand cars sold to every new car, we think that's a trend, but it's a very fragmented market, but now we are also trying to build that so that we can have better access to it.</p><p>And then we also have this car components. This is a -- (foreign language) so that's a RMB 400 billion business every year, whereby in parts but a lot of it increasingly is not just through the car manufacturers but is actually through dealers, repair shops. There's about 100,000 repair shops. And this is something that P&amp;C, because we work with all these repair shops, we know exactly the parts, the labor hours of every make across this 100,000 repair shops. Actually, we're now building an open platform whereby people can bid for it. So over time -- this is still in the working stages, but this is something that we think. We have something very interesting in the auto ecosystem, which is a very important part of the economy that over time we hope to solidify.</p><p>And then finally, the housing, real estate. I think this is also a very long-time play, but clearly, that's very important for the economy and the consumer. And here, our approach has really been -- we have 2 companies which is also we don't publicize too much. We have a Ping An Haofang, which really is an online housing portal. And then we have a offline mortgage center, which is called (foreign language). And the idea here is that it is a very fragmented market in China, but we want to work what we work best, which is on financial services.</p><p>A mortgage in China takes more than a month. I mean, I've never bought a house, but at least my colleagues have done, so you have to make multiple trips to the banks to (foreign language) to get it, right? And what we've done really we take how to really streamline a process, the risk assessment so that we can get it fast as now as 4 days. And so we work with the top 100 developers, the top 100 real estate agency in China, and we try to make financing easy for their customers. And that's how we are thinking about it. Again, this is one of the early stages one, and we welcome any comments as well, but we think this will become a very important part going forward.</p><p>So that's really what I wanted to share today at the beginning is really about the right part of our pillar. What I want to impress upon is that we are not just a financial services company, as James mentioned, we are actually very much a technology company. It is actually something that we've been doing consistently over the past 5 to 6 years. The way that we think about technology company is not just for our own consumption, we actually have a very much platform-driven kind of thing, whereby we'll incubate them, we'll put them into ecosystems and we want to share that with the rest of the ecosystem players.</p><p>I wanted to -- we want to take a short break, 10 minutes. And then after which, I wanted to invite my colleagues, Ericson and Ricky, who will share with you the technology backbone, the powers behind both the left and the right pillars that I think will be quite interesting. Actually, there a lot of things in our lab that we usually don't share, but James has said that we got be out there to share. So we're happy when -- it is something new for us. So hopefully you enjoy the rest of the discussion.</p><p>ERICSON CHAN: Hi, everyone. Thank you for being here. I'm Ericson Chan, Head of Ping An Technology. Ping An Technology is one of the subsidiaries of Ping An Group, one of the 28 companies. What we do, we provide IT solutions and services to the whole Group, and in addition to that, we have hundreds of other corporate customers, of which, many of them are insurance company and banks. In that -- beyond that, we also have a very strong research and development institute. The focus is -- obviously, is FinTech. And in addition to FinTech, we focus a lot of our effort recently on artificial intelligence, and I'll like to share a little bit of that today with you.</p><p>Okay. You'll have seen this chart from Jessica earlier. So we, the Orange Foundation, is what we do and support everything for the entire Ping An Group and our customers. So how to make us so successful so far? I think there are 4 key elements that we have been doing: one is that rich scenarios or rich of use case that we have; one is the data that we have been able to leverage; and the speed -- speed of execution, that is very, very paramount to us; and lastly, and as I mentioned, is how we have been leveraging our artificial intelligence, and many of them is developed in-house recently.</p><p>And again, you have seen this chart. I think this is very critical because this is our strategy -- this Ping An Group strategy. So you have seen the financial arms of ours on the -- on your left. And then we have the 4 ecosystems Jessica talked about. And then we have -- you have different technology model, is either Integrated finance plus Internet or Internet plus finance or, I call it, live, like a live tech, which is supporting different elements of the ecosystem. Of course, housing, auto, health care, these are the most critical decision in one's life to make any financial decisions. And one, why we are -- we have so many different scenarios, other than the ecosystem we build, we also have a full license. We have full license of all financial products, so -- which give us the opportunity to serve our customers end to end.</p><p>Okay, I will spend some time here to explain some of the things that Jessica mentioned earlier. One of the key things Jessica mentioned at the beginning is that we have 137 million customer, financial customer, and then we have 376 million online users. That is very, very unusual.</p><p>For most banks or insurance company, you -- how do you acquire customer? You acquire customer by selling a financial product. It could be auto insurance, it could be mortgage, could be credit card. You start with that, and once you get a product sold and you try to service them, when you get a chance to service them, you try to do cross-sell. And then, once you bring in the customer, so you also try to migrate them, so called migration, make them online, right? And most of the banks today, it will be hovering around 30% to 40% of the online user base. Ours is completely different. We have -- we're using a different business model. Ours is 270%. Is fundamentally is different than all the other banks and the insurance company.</p><p>How so? We first provide free service to address our customer pain point. These pain point is part of their daily lives. It could be auto, it could be housing, it could be any aspect of their daily life. So we try to use technology. Of course, without recent development of technology, that's not possible because of the cost. Because now we are leveraging technology, we can provide services to everyone free of charge, no different than a lot of the startup today or Facebook, the one that you're very used to today. We first engage the customer by servicing them before we start to talk about products.</p><p>And this is an example. As you see, the number is 270% of our financial customers are our online users today. So I'll use one of the -- you see some of the screenshots, this is a -- I picked it from my phone, and this is one of the app that Jessica has mentioned before, is called good car driver or good car owner Ping An (foreign language), AVP. This is -- what this app does? This is a one-stop shop for every single thing a car driver or car owner ever needs. It is as simple as, okay, where's your gas station? To how do I do the maintenance of my car? If I need to do maintenance, where can I get a repair shop, a maintenance shop? If you want to read a little bit more about the auto news, it will engage its -- like a Top Gear-ish newsfeed, you can get it. And even one of the most popular functions, that will be managing your traffic ticket, as in China, it is ordeal to manage your traffic ticket. Because sometimes if you register your address wrongly, even if you get a speeding ticket, you might not know. If you don't pay, you get yourself in trouble. So this is an ordeal to manage this in China and this is a pain point, we figure that out. So what we do is -- all you need to do, you don't need to pay anything. And you register your car, and then as soon as -- if you do get a ticket, we will remind you. We will alert you when you need to pay. As soon as you need to pay and you recognize it, if you link to your account, then we will settle the bill for you. So this is a one-stop shop of everything you ever need as a car driver.</p><p>Second screenshot from the right. What is that? I don't know if you can read it from the back, this is -- the map actually is, I'm not too proud of it, is about 2 months ago. I was in a hurry. I need to take my son to play badminton. I was late. So I got out from my home, and you'll see some of the red dot is when I turned the corner a bit too fast. When I -- the orange dot is actually is a little rocket picture, that obviously I was driving a little bit too fast. I was in a hurry. So what it does? It able to capture your driving behavior. Why do we do that? Once you capture driving behaviors, so we can alert you. \"Hey, if you're driving like this, you're wasting gas.\" Wasting gas is wasting money. So we are trying to engage you by helping -- it is no different than many of us, is wearing this kind of wearable device so that you know a bit more about yourself. So you can manage everything a little bit better. But, of course, by doing so, we know you a lot better, at the same time, as a company. So when you do the insurance renewal, so we can rebate or engage you differently. So this is a very different way of trying to engage customer before we talk about products.</p><p>So once we bring in a new customer, how do we -- because we -- Ping An Group is a huge organization, we have all different financial asset class offering. So -- and for example, we have securities, we have trust, we have bank offering credit cards, mortgages. So if -- once you get one of the products, how can we engage you to a different organization? And we have a very, very unique way, that is called Renyimen. So it's like a -- how do you -- it's almost like a teleportation mechanism. Teleportation between one company or one app to another. If you look at the screenshot at the back -- at the bottom, there is some tiles. Regardless which application you're starting with within the Ping An organization, all of them will have this tile Renyimen teleportation mechanism to tailor-made suggest you what you might need else -- what else you might need. So if your car -- have a car insurance with us, at a certain point in time, if you think certain product, like your credit card, it will fit your lifestyle, we will suggest that. It will -- in one of the tiles, and also suggest other services that might address some of your daily pain point and add value to you. So by doing so, we can get cross -- I don't want to use the word, but there is cross-selling. We can use to do a lot more cross-selling between different products. So there's over 100 million customers of ours, when they get onto a app and they were able to use this mechanism, teleport to another area, another company, another app of ours. So we can engage them and then -- with more products and services.</p><p>And in addition, and also you can imagine because of the account structure, it's not -- sometime it's not that simple, by referring you from one entity to another. Therefore, we have another mechanism. It's called master account. So once you tied your primary app with this master account, then you can engage all other products from other app within the entire Group. Make it very seamless, painless. So financial products is painless. That is a new thing. So this is what we have been working on in the last couple of years.</p><p>So in the -- so I'll just talk about how we engage customer differently to bring them in and how we transfer from one entity, one asset class, one product to another. But regardless, which product, which services and the back end, we try to digitize, automate everything possible, and we believe in technology, and this is very fortunate of me to be part of this visionary organization, so we can invest and digitize everything. So from acquisition to service to marketing to product, all the way.</p><p>Risk control. Risk is very important for all financial organization. So regardless as therefore, 2C customer or even 2B customer. I don't have any material, but I can also talk about for 2B customer. Because of our AI model, we even put a lot of engine to find the model, how do you manage risk better on our corporate customer portfolio. So with some of the engine, because we used different data feed and also understand our customer better, we can also control the risk portfolio a lot earlier. We can have an early alert. Instead of a 3 months, it could be 6 months. And the able of alert we can get accurately is 4x before we have this kind of model. So we are digitizing and automating every end from acquisition and risk control.</p><p>So that is covering about the scenarios, the number of use cases that we have. It's very rich. At the same time, once we have all these scenarios, with so many customer, able to use so many different of our apps, then we can understand better, and our data that we have been creating is very, very rich. Regardless it's from the basic information of a customer, sometimes their education level, family, career, of course, investment and consumption and health. So we have a very, very good understanding of our customer. Therefore, we can provide tailor-made bespoke service and products. And with this kind of data, we have a little army of scientists, of 500 data scientists, to try to bring insight and value ultimately to our customers.</p><p>Speed. Speed is very critical, speed to market, speed to provide services to our customer. One of the way, this is the technological way, we have start to build our cloud infrastructure, 2, 3 years ago. As of today, we have already 70% of our own infrastructure is on the cloud. This is by far the highest in all financial institute in China.</p><p>So what does it do? Of course, if your infrastructure is on the cloud, it's more scalable. You can ramp up, ramp down quickly. And even if you have a new product, a new system -- for those who know, in the industry, you need to get production environment ready. Normally, it will take days, probably weeks before you can get a whole new environment ready. With our home-grown cloud technology, it will take us only 150 seconds. If you decided -- if our business decided to have a new product -- financial product. We can start to click it. 150 seconds later, the infrastructure is ready for our coder to start coding.</p><p>In addition to doing coding, the entire SDLC flow, software development lifecycle flow, is automated. By doing so, we're automating testing -- regression testing, we're automating deployment. This is 2.5x faster than before. So as a result, 59% of our software release -- 59% of our software release finish in 14 days from decided, this is a product and service our customer need to the first customer start using it in 14 days. 89% of the software release, we complete in 30 days. This is very important for us. For -- this, obviously, is a very, very fast deployment, speed-to-market for financial institute, but we don't benchmark ourselves against financial institute. We benchmark ourselves with Internet startup. This is the pace we want to deliver, but the quality of service, security of service, then we benchmark ourself against financial institute.</p><p>Lastly, the most exciting, everybody talks about today, is artificial intelligence. We mentioned about cloud. We also focus a bit on the digital, online to off-line, off-line to online. But artificial intelligence is our research and development core today.</p><p>We spend a hefty amount on artificial intelligence. We have 20,000 R&amp;D staff across the whole Group, and many of them has a master and PhD degree. So they are smart. They are very smart. So -- and I'm very, very proud because just this year, we have 1,458 by now -- I'm sure the number is a little bit higher, patent applied. That is #1 in all financial institute in China. So this is to demonstrate how our smart guys are churning out the work and generating value.</p><p>And for those of you interested in the AI, we look at it in 3 categories: perception, prediction and prescription. We engage in all 3 and spend a lot of our time in all 3 categories.</p><p>So what are they? First one, perception. Perception, is basically it means, when I see something, can I make some sense out of it? In this particular case, when I look at you, do I know if you are you? Very simple. I want to make sure if you're you. This is beyond what a FinTech normally has scoped. If you talk about the strict official FinTech scope, this is not in there. It's not -- we do roboadvisory, we do Blockchain, we do peer-to-peer lending, we do mobile payment and wallet. But this is beyond that and this is still, we believe, is core to our business. Because is this important is security and also is great convenience for our customer.</p><p>So very happy that. In June, we have hit world #1 on accuracy, our facial recognition engine, according to the LFW benchmark. In June, we topped the world. That is fantastic, and we just had a celebration party last night. Thank you for the budget, boss. And then -- and 300 million usage. This is only since the beginning of last year. Since beginning of last year, we have 300 million times being used this model. But every time when you use it, the engine will get more -- the model will get more and more accurate. At a peak time, this is a geek number, we was very proud, 30,000 faces we process in a minute.</p><p>And -- so what does it mean? It's very exciting for a techie like myself, but there will be more cases Ricky will explain later on. But I'll highlight just one case, how we have been using it. For example, one of our loan product -- personal loan product (foreign language), it is called iLoan, you have an app on your phone, you download it, you need to -- if you need to apply for loan, you take a few photos of your own ID and some of the supporting document and then you click it, you will engage one of our agents through a video conference as face time as video conference, and we'll start to ask a few questions. While we're asking the questions, we will be able to identify if you're you.</p><p>So surprisingly, you'll think that, that will be quite easy. This is -- I need to quote an example. This is just last night, after the celebration, from Shenzhen coming to Hong Kong, Ricky and I was in the car. And if you know how to cross the border between Shenzhen and Hong Kong, we give the Hong Kong ID and then to the officer. And then you look at it. You look at the ID, you look at your ID a few times, right? And then, look at Ricky -- look at Ricky, 3 times and then, \"Hey, can you take off your glasses?\" And okay. Ricky took off his glasses and look again, \"All right. Good enough.\" Then took another ID. \"Look at me. All right. Hi, Mr. Ricky.\" So this basically, the officer has mixed the 2 ID. And just because he -- you can judge if he looks like me later on. Just because he took off his glasses, then the officer -- okay, that is him. That is me. So this is why we take security very, very seriously. This is why we spend -- the groups invest so much into security like this. We want to not only safeguard our loan portfolio, also want to safeguard your money, right? So this is -- and as a result, 3 minutes. Within 3 minutes, the entire loan process is completed. And we're not only working on a facial recognition just to know you are you. We want to know a bit more, because every face has 44 twitch. That's 44 micro expression. Every micro expression has 5 level of movement. It will generating 19 different emotions. This is what we have been researching. So by doing so, we also can alert, \"Hey, if this customer is happy about our service.\" If they're not happy, you could create some alert to our agents, \"Hey, you better be careful and speak a little bit better.\" So this is not just about security, it's entire customer experience we're embedding into our normal processes that you might not be aware.</p><p>Another perception of AI, voice recognition. Voice recognition is very different. In fact, you -- after we spend some time, voice is even more technologically advanced than face. Order chart, you need to isolate the voice and figure out if this is a voice. Is it recording? Or it's not a recording, and then you need to separate different, because quite often a few people talk at the same time, you need to separate different track and then you draw some different pattern. As a result, now we have developed a voice recognition engine. What this engine -- we've 95% accuracy, and we are trying to make it even higher. And then using different -- we have a fair bit of conversation that used to train our voice recognition engine. So how it works now? Just -- like this. It's not asking you to read any particular script. Like some of the vendor product would do that. We think that is not very natural for the customer. So by speaking like myself right now, 18 seconds of my speech, I will able to identify if you are -- your pattern, your particular pattern. And then the next time when you call in, 10 seconds of your conversation, I can be certain if you are you. So by combining -- what we are doing is, right now is combining facial recognition, voice recognition. That would be a bulletproof to safeguard your financial asset.</p><p>After perception, knowing you are you, then is to do some prediction. So forecast. So this is one of the cases we are -- we have been working on in the last few months, and very proud. It's not just about financial product. This is about health. We have been working with the Chongqing government. Because of our financial -- health insurance, we have enough claims. We know the data of the Chongqing city. So we use the data to create a model so that we know -- we predict, what about in 2 weeks' time, in 4 weeks' time, what kind of illness is coming. Why do we want to do that? Of course, one, is we want to make the public healthier. And we're -- since we're in the health insurance business, and if you have healthier public, it's also -- it is better to our bottom line. So it's a win-win situation of a lot of the things that we have been doing, and would like to do more and we will do more.</p><p>And the last of the 3 categories is prescription. So now you know you are you, you can forecast, and what are we going to do about it using artificial intelligence? This is a case. We actually have this -- we have been using this for a year already. So if you are one of our auto insurance customer, if you're unfortunate, your car is damaged, you can use our app to take a few photos of your car, upload it, our back-end engine will be able to determine, \"Hey, is that a Mercedes or is that BMW?\" If it's a Mercedes, is it a E Class or C Class? If it is an E class, C Class, and what year model? We figure that out and also we'll figure out if this -- have you done any Photoshop? Is it for real, this photo? And then we'll able to determine, by the engine itself, the damage level of the panel. There will be 4 categories of each panel, 14 different areas, and then we'll figure out if you need a paint job, a body work or completely replace the panel. So why do we develop an engine like this? One of our customer in Southern China -- it was during a typhoon, the car was damaged, unfortunately. The customer took a few photo, upload it. Before the typhoon left Southern China, the money is already in their account. This is why we do this kind of technology.</p><p>So -- and Jessica mentioned this also, we develop a lot of technology, and Ricky will cover this a little bit more in depth about different products. And we put most of them on our cloud platform. From the Ping An ICE infrastructure layer, the pass layer, so we have Blockchain as-a-service, we have some of the Big Data analytical engine, even artificial intelligence, we'll put them on a cloud. First, we put them on a cloud so that all the companies within Ping An Group can take advantage of, and they have been. And after that, we believe in sharing. We want to democratize. We want to democratize our technology to a much bigger customer base. Even other banks in China and outside China. So -- and therefore, I think the demand of financial high-quality, better financial service will, across the entire industry, and it will ultimately benefit Ping An Group also, and we have seen the benefit already. So this is how we have been leveraging the technology we developed to create value for our customer.</p><p>All right. I think I will stop here. I will introduce Ricky to cover a bit more on some of this specific technology in depth, and he's our Chief Product Officer. Thank you, everyone.</p><p>RICKY OU: Hi, everyone. It's good to be back to Hong Kong and give this presentation. Well, I live in -- Ericson and I actually live in Hong Kong and we commute to Shenzhen every day to work. So I'm going to introduce the 3 key technology today. One is facial recognition, the other is cloud and then third one is Blockchain.</p><p>Okay. First starting with facial recognition. And thank you for Ericson teeing up with the story from last night, so apparently me taking off my glasses, I look exactly like Ericson.</p><p>Okay. Now seriously, going back to the facial recognition. Actually, the facial recognition research started about 20 years ago, it's nothing new. But unfortunately, back then there were using a technology just like pattern matchings and what not, and the accuracy could never get over 90%, that's why it's deemed to more as a research project, but never been useful.</p><p>Now what changed? 2 or 3 years ago, we started to apply AI, the deep learning technique, so to simulate how your PC -- just like teaching a child how to recognize your faces, what's the difference, the subtle difference that sometimes that even a human eye cannot see, all right? So we have slowly, slowly, slowly, we pushed the accuracy to about 99%. So just for the record, people's eye -- human's eye at the best, best situation, the accuracy is about 97%. But obviously, last night, we can tell, human is also being influenced by very different scenario, being tired, in a different life situation and so on and so forth, it's not quite reliable. But computer, they are very reliable. And once we hit the 99%, that become something that we can rely on even in the financial situation, right? So that's where we come from.</p><p>Now -- and then Ericson already told you that in June, we actually hit the benchmark, 99.8%, which is top of the world. Besides the LFW, we've actually gone through a similar verification. We have the police research institute, number 3. So why they are important? They are actually the authority for online authentication. So literally for all the financial-related transaction and whatnot, we would need to go through that verification. So with that, we also achieved even a slightly higher score on that. Right. So all in all, it shows that from an accuracy standpoint, we are already one of the best in the world, right?</p><p>Now getting to the different scenario. I think there's a video here.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>RICKY OU: Okay. Thank you. So in 2 minute, I think you can appreciate all the different scenario, not only on the financial scenario, but in all the different other scenario as well, right? So all in all, I mean, 200-plus scenario that's actually to me is a understatement. I think we can expand to that. Okay. So why is our cap better than, let's say, the other leading Chinese technology company, right? First of all is the engine itself. I'll explain, the engine is like your little brain. So I -- you can imagine the model that we are constructing is like a very high -- highly smart student.</p><p>So we have a accuracy of 99.8%. You can imagine, we got a student with an IQ of, let's say, 150, right, to start with. No, but that's not enough. The second thing is you have to put them through school. That's where the data, the second will come from data. Data is like, okay, you go into a school, what do you learn? What's the material? How good are the different material, right? Now, data wise, I think a lot of our competitor, they also have enormous amount of data, but yet their data is singular dimension, right, they've got a photo but they don't know who you are, right? But in Ping An because of our big data and also we have over 130-million-plus customer, they're not just a regular customer, they're our financial customer. So what that means is we have now very deep multi-dimension of who they are, right?</p><p>So with all those data combined together we throw into that model and to train that model. And this is the second part is the training, okay? The kind of the data that we have, the richness of the data that we have to train a model, okay?</p><p>Now they finally graduated as a medical doctor and then get to the third stage, which is the scenario, right? So even if you graduate -- you are the smartest student, you graduate from top of the class from the best university, but you are not ready to be a doctor yet. You need to be tested out, right, in a different scenario. This is how a third advantage over the other customer, which is, well, not only we have hundreds of financial scenario for them to test it on, but we also have security, all the other scenario that I just showed on the video.</p><p>So (inaudible) after a while, you are really ready to be a doctor. Now then you can imagine this doctor, you will be truly trusted on because, a, he's smart; second, it has probably the best training; third, it has the most scenario to battle test it before we put them out, right? So that's kind of the core Ping An advantage in that.</p><p>Now this is another layer. I think we -- I can go a little bit deeper into what's differentiated us from, let's say, BAT. Now BAT, they're really good on the online capturing. This is like -- in online world, it's very easy to capture your identity and then what you do online and then how you transact online, right? This is very much proven. But when you move to the off-line, well, this is completely different. And you will see even BAT do. They struggle to getting into the off-line scenario, because they cannot do, a, how do they identify. People walks around. How do you identify who they are and what do they do, and how do they transact, right? Now they have other advantage of, let's say, BAT they have to obey laws. And this is where -- is Ping An advantage comes in. With facial recognition, I just show you in all the different scenario, we can easily identify who you are. And better yet, facial recognition is something that I need your approval to get, because the minute you walk into my premise, I have the right to take your photo, I can scan your face, I can recall you -- pull you out from our database and then I can tell who you are, right? Second, tracking. We are working with the partner.</p><p>I give -- here, I give you one example. There is a Shenzhen Tong, which is similar to the Octopus Card in Hong Kong. So Shenzhen Tong has about 40 million card, just like Octopus Card. Every day, it has 10 million active user to use the card. But without the step #1 identity, all they seen in the system is that 10 million card going every day, everywhere, but they don't know who they are. So there is really no value in that amount of data, right? So the first thing we help them is to identify. We move them to a online situation using facial recognition. And why not we can identify who you are. Once I can relate you and a card instantly, that data makes a lot of sense. Oh, Ricky, Monday to Friday, this is your travel pattern. Oh, I can infer, this is where you live, this is where you work. Over the weekend, huh, you are spending in a different part of the world. Oh, you're going to a theme park. You're going to this. So I can further infer, you may have a family and things like that.</p><p>So all the sudden, once the identification kind of kicks in, all that data become much more rich and valuable. So the second part, we're actually working with a partner to track those off-line scenario and data. And then three, that's where the engage come in, right? We have Ping An Tech, one of the things that Jessica and Ericson mentioned, we actually aggregated all our financial product and -- including bank, insurance, all the product onto one platform. So we make it very easy for us to tailor whatever at that moment what you'll need in terms of product, we will put it right in front of you.</p><p>So imagine it's like putting a 7/11 right next to you following you. At any moment, whatever you need, I'll give it to you at that point. That will dramatically increase the rate of the transaction completing, right? Yes, so find the 3 step, identify, track and engage. And we can apply that to many off-line scenario and helping not only us, but our partner to create new ecosystem for the finance.</p><p>Now we talked about a scenario earlier. So within the Group -- so first of all, before we release the technology, we first will battle test them within our Group. So in the past year also, this has been applied in over 70 scenario, over close to 20 subsidiary, right? Ericson just mentioned earlier the micro loan that we did previously on the manual process, it will take about 24 hour to complete a loan process, but we have facial recognition, the [Shenzhen] and electronic signature, we can narrow that whole process down to 3 minute. And because of that, we will be able to fast up. So the scale of the loan application going from every day in terms of tens of million to close to 1 billion a day in terms of the loan process. So we can see that we have the technology enablement. We actually closely helping our Ping An Group's brother and sister company to greatly improve the efficiency, right, on that.</p><p>Outside of Ping An, as we just mentioned, so we are rapidly getting into the airport, the house bureaus and the social insurance in a way to help the other institute to increase the efficiency. Just like in Shenzhen Airport, every day, tens of thousands people walk by, how do you track and then pick out the bad guy, right? So with our technology, we will be scanning all the faces coming into the airport and then match with a known database of a bad guy and then, hopefully, we'll pick them out before they get in -- get onto our plane, right?</p><p>Now not only that, we are actually working with our partner. So this is one example. So we're working with Fudeng. Fudeng Auto Group is actually one of the largest commercial truck provider in China. In fact, it's enormous high. To climb up to one of their truck is almost like a two-story high, it's kind of scary on top. So you can imagine, if someone is driving that car over 10 hour a day, if they get tired and accident happen, that could create a lot of damage.</p><p>So we're working with them by using our micro-expression technology to trying to detect whether the car driver has been tired or not, right? And if they show the tiredness, we can give them a warning to warn the driver. And if that continues and without any response, we can even remotely trying to slow down the car or stop the car, right?</p><p>So this is -- are the next layer of technology we're trying to work with our industrial partner to trying to improve their safety and efficiency.</p><p>Okay. Second part, our cloud, right? Cloud technology today, I think everybody will realize is it's not something that's truly differentiating. In fact, you will talk about BAT, they all have their cloud. Amazon, Microsoft, we all -- they all have their clouds. From a technology point of view, we are not really that much different. I will say we are just like at the same level as they are, but what make us different is the top left bottom, the compliance, security and reliability. Because Ping An Group is a fully licensed library. We have all the license that comes with a lot of scrutiny, right? So every month, we have been closely monitored by (inaudible) right, the Chinese Central Bank, (inaudible), right, all the compliance.</p><p>So with that everything that we do has to go through their checking and compliance. And we are the only car provider in China that was under that full security of the compliance watch every day, right? So because of that and that's why, earlier you see Jessica and Ericson mentioned that over 200 bank, they happily put their stuff onto our cloud because they -- that's where the trust come in because they know, they put their stuff onto our cloud, it's compliant, right? And none of the cloud provider in China can remotely claim that, right?</p><p>Now infrastructure wise, of course, we are geo redundancy, we have multi-size and make sure that even in a case of disaster, we can fully offload the loads to the other city. Besides our basic layer or what we call the IaaS layer and a PaaS layer, what differentiated us further is what we call the SaaS. Over the past 10-plus year because the fact that we have slowly moved all their -- our subsidiaries' IT system onto the cloud, we actually along the way developed some very verticalized solution, such as insurance, security, fund, all of those are now being able to -- those services are being able to be provisioned from the cloud, right?</p><p>So we can say, we have some very rich verticalized SaaS offering. And really, at the end of the day, the SaaS offering has also differentiated all the different cloud provider in that.</p><p>Now so as such, because earlier, I mentioned that, with all the trust into our cloud of not only our entire group, so up to about 80% of our Group's IT really reside on Ping An cloud. But outside of Ping An, we have over 20-plus banks, all the different cities and all the -- are being hosted onto our platform.</p><p>Lastly, Blockchain, right? Everybody heard about Blockchain is like the magic in a financial world, right? So let's take a look at what we've done with Blockchain. First of all, is scenario, because Blockchain in a way is very -- is a decentralized technology, it move paradigms from a centralized identity to be a decentralized offering. So as such that, it really can apply to a lot of different scenario, right? We identified 12 to -- as a start, but actually, it's going to be more than that. This is only in the financial scenario.</p><p>So I give one example that in the bank trading platform like Jessica mentioned earlier, we have really a (inaudible) of transaction last year in this platform. So how does Blockchain help in this case, right? So previously, all those step that we have done on the interbank transaction is done actually manually, right, you can imagine is done by fax. A lot of that is done by fax. People who come into is a, did you receive my money, can you fax it over? Literally, that was -- how it was being done before, right? But with Blockchain, we have the (inaudible) check as long as the bank, it's in a bank, they have a electronic contract in line. They can do a handshake. They can get that transaction happen. And this is a timeless seamlessly and all behind the background. So as such, once we apply the Blockchain, everything will go smoothly electronically rather than manually on that, right?</p><p>Now the other part of that is the real time reconciliation. Before that, without Blockchain, everything, again, is done -- have to be done manually. There is no synchronization. Everyone is using a different ledger. And because of that, again, it takes hours, if not days, to complete a single reconciliation.</p><p>So T+2, that's kind of the norm previously for the completion date. Now with Blockchain, Blockchain -- in addition to Blockchain, we actually put a unified ledger and mass account some of those system and platform that we put together. We were able to dump everything, again, online. And we have a supervision platform underneath to govern the rules and regulation and make sure the transaction will take place completely and seamlessly. Again, we achieved T+0 reconciliation time, right?</p><p>Now -- so again, what differentiated us from our competitor? We are not going to get into every single one of them. But you can see along with all the privacy, security, performance, flexible and most important last thing is technicality, right, to -- as you can see in our -- my earlier example, the interbank, the unified ledger, we actually applying the technology pretty much random. So it's not just that something that's in the lab, but we are actually moving to a real world, right? So with that, that concluded my presentation. And I think we can take another 5- to 10-minute break before we come back for the question.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>JAMES GARNER: Okay, great. Everybody, welcome back. This segment now, we're going to open it up to question and answers. I'll make one request, given that we've got 3 of our tech gurus here, it probably make sense given that we've got about 30 minutes left for Q&amp;A to actually focus the questions on some of the technologies that the team have presented today. When you ask a question, please state your name and the company you represent and try and limit it to 2 questions. That's 2 questions, not 2 questions with 5 subsections. Okay. So who would like to kick off with the first question? Okay. Mancy?</p><p>MANCY SUN, EQUITY ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Okay. Thanks, James, and thanks for the management from Ping An for the great presentation. And I do have 2 and 2 only questions. And one is that, you just mentioned that you are the largest big data platform among the Chinese financial enterprises and also the largest cloud among the Chinese financial companies. Can you put that into context for example versus some of the largest big tech companies? And can you give us a context as to how you stack up against those companies? So that's my first question. And the second question is we all heard a lot of very exciting things. So I want to ask something that's a little bit different. So what keeps you awake at night? And what is your biggest challenges?</p><p>ERICSON CHAN: I think the first question is about the cloud comparing our cloud with the rest. First of all, we developed a cloud technology ourselves. So we are not leveraging any other vendor. So -- and then, we also in addition to that, we make sure there are -- it's like the financial industry grade as unlike some of the other -- I'm not saying the others are not secure, okay, don't get it wrong. So -- but we focus -- put a lot of effort on making sure our cloud technology is secure. And that -- in addition to that, I don't know if you have mentioned, we need to be compliant for all different regulators in China. When I say all regulators, probably I think will be quite unique is (inaudible), it's the Central Bank, the banking regulator, insurance regulator and securities regulator. And they all do have different -- a little bit different set of rules. And we need to make sure they're complying to all unlike if you or any other Internet-based cloud provider, they don't need to do this. So the level of stringency that we offer is quite different.</p><p>SIN YIN TAN: So let me just put some numbers into context. So I think you wanted it at relative scale. I think there's 2 aspects to look at it. I think one is just pure scale. And if you look at pure scale, let's say, if this cloud, by revenues from what I know, our cloud revenues is probably at 15% of the largest public cloud provider, okay? So I think that's just to give some sense. But I think more importantly, as Ericson mentioned, both in the data and the cloud aspects, the reason we stress is in the financial services sector. It's the -- it's a very different nature. It took us -- we started building our own cloud 5 years ago. It takes a lot of work -- I mean, we made it look very easy, but when I first came to Ping An, we were completely cloudless. We had 700 firewalls separating all our systems across 28 different companies. It took us really 4 years, 4.5 years actually to be exact to move 70% of those one by one to a cloud infrastructure. And we almost customized everything for it, right? We didn't start off wanting to build our cloud goal because we evaluated and we didn't think that the ones out there, the public cloud, fit our needs, right? So I think that is -- that's why it serves a very different purpose. The other example I'll give in terms of data is not just -- I think ours is probably twice the size of ICBC like in terms of scale of data. The Internet kind of companies naturally have much more. Actually, I don't know how much more. But I think it's not just the amount of data, I think it's about the richness of the data, right? One of the reasons that you see, we were not the only company that got the provisional credit bureau license. We were 1 of 8, like Ali, Tencent, (inaudible) also credit bureau license. But if you look at how we've evolved over the past 2.5 years since we started, many of the others Internet companies who got this, they use it more as a consumer product. When you see it on their app, they use it for more everyday life, right? If you have a score above a certain level, you can use the VIP channel of the airports in Beijing or you can apply for a visa faster whereas ours is actually used by 2,000 financial institutions for loan approval purposes. I think this is not by coincidence because when you just have data, it's not enough. You need to have a full breadth of data. And then, you also need to have the past track record in order to do the model. By just having a data without able to correlate who is a good or a bad loan, who is a good or bad driver, is useless, right? And I think that itself shows why we have both the track record and the richness of the data in order to do this, right?</p><p>JAMES GARNER: I think the second part was, what keeps you awake at night?</p><p>SIN YIN TAN: Too many things to do. Many of these things takes a long time. The Blockchain for example. Lots of people talk about Blockchain. We went to the -- we went to U.S. We've talked to many people. We are not the first ones to do Blockchain. But many of them over 3 years. I mean, Ericson used to work for his better half in the past, Standard Chartered. He was at Standard Chartered for 18 years. Not to say anything bad about Standard Chartered, Standard Chartered was one of the early pioneers. Many of the global banks did Blockchain 3 years ago. But none has able to put a real-life application, right? And I think what keeps us awake is just a suite of things we are doing. It takes a lot of work to take something from the technology in lab and actually use it. And this was exciting about me, actually, all 3 of us, unfortunately, are not Mainland Chinese. They travel every day to Hong Kong -- to Shenzhen. I travel every week from Singapore to Shanghai and Shenzhen. But we're really excited to be here, because it's very rare. I mean, I used to be at McKinsey 13 years serving financials. It's very rare where you get an opportunity with the breadth of businesses, right, and the open reception to try these things. When we did that Blockchain, we literally have 4 BUs, not everyone talk about Blockchain can reduce reconciliation. Nobody has even do that. We told the 4 companies, I want to do this, we did it in 4 months. We were able to reduce 80% of the T+1 reconciliation all have problems real time, right? And the Ping An is just what -- beautiful of Ping An is the execution council, which is do it. Our facial recognition -- in our celebration last night, I'm trying to say, we don't have enough Chinese faces to do the model. We told Ping An tech employees, those were the -- the 2,000 employees were our first customers. We bought 100 cameras and we just ask people to sit there and take pictures all over their angle and be the first model, right? And it's just really fun. And I think that is a lot of things to do, a lot of work, but it's really exciting.</p><p>JAMES GARNER: Next question, please. We'll take from the lady in white.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: My name is [Donna] from [KBTU]. May I ask the questions in Cantonese or Mandarin? Oh, Cantonese?</p><p>SIN YIN TAN: Sure.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Okay. (foreign language)</p><p>SIN YIN TAN: (foreign language) So the question is about Lufax IPO, right? Every time, there will be such question, that's fine, because every time just as we -- I think our last time, we mentioned this was probably in our shareholders meeting, we are always actively preparing, and we will look for the right time that if it fits our shareholders the most. So unfortunately, I don't have a new answer.</p><p>JAMES GARNER: Great. [Burlington].</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Actually, our tech analysts will have 2 questions.</p><p>SIN YIN TAN: Sure.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: I'm CIC's tech analyst, Lu King. So I've got 2 questions. So one of the things I was just basically I'm looking the global and the spending of the tech company, so if you look your 7 billion number, actually, if I rank it, I think globally it ranks 14 or something, it's actually just behind some great Internet company, Amazon or Google or this company. But it's huge money, but just only 1% of the spending. But if you look at the cost structure of these companies, we have roughly 10% or 15% of their revenue spend. So I think my question is that, so I look the difference between a tech company and the financial company that the tech division of financial company typically is the cost center and we are just -- but currently -- so -- but tech -- R&amp;D of the tech companies are revenue center to generate a new revenue for the company. So how your Ping An Tech are generating a new revenue stream for the Ping An Group? I think this is the first question.</p><p>SIN YIN TAN: So first I have to thank both our Chairman, actually our group CFO is here, Mr. Yao, for actually -- right at the beginning, they created Ping An Tech as a P&amp;L entity, right, even when I came first 5 years ago. It doesn't have a -- it's not a cost center, it's not budget, it has a separate P&amp;L zone. It's been thought on day 1, you're going to survive on your own. It's not granted that people will give you the money. You've got to earn your money. Earn your money in both internally and externally. And I think that has helped to keep the group technology team a little bit more market-centric, right? They need to be the best, because otherwise, our companies can choose to source from other people. So I think that has helped. Now in terms of your question directly about how much -- how do we measure the value that we've invested out in this? I think there's really 2 ways we look at the value created all of the technology spend. First one is, actually, in our core businesses, right? If you look at our very impressive results, right, lots of analysts ask us how is that you've been able to sustain a lower cost income ratio for a P&amp;C consistently over the years before pricing regulation, after pricing, right, it's not by accident. The way we manage our P&amp;C with the applying technology, we are able -- right now, we have about 40% of our on-site investigation, we can reach there within 5 minutes or 10 minutes, it's faster than a police car in China actually, would you call us if you ever get into trouble instead of calling a police. And we are able to do that because actually, over time, we build a risk heat map, because every year, we have 14 million claims. We actually can predict kind of where are the accident areas. We actually have this grid that we dynamically shape every 5, 10 minutes different parts of the time and stuff like that. So what I'm trying to say is that all these things with the loan example. So I think we were the first online loan Puhui, I remember, 1.5 years ago. And today, we are the largest consumer finance company, not by accident, I think because of our technology. So I think that's one way in which we've not able to create value, so that our core business can constantly stay at the top of their game. The second way which we are trying to create value, I think this one takes a little bit while is the right (inaudible) side of the house I mentioned. We're trying to take that and say, look just serving our own businesses is not sufficient. We hope that each of these company, the Lufax, the Good Doctor, the OneConnect, the Social Health Insurance over time, becomes actually standalone, viable technology companies themselves serving the external market. I'm pleased to say, actually, over the past 6 years, about 3 to 4 of our Internet companies have actually broke even and start making money. Now a lot are still in the investment phase, which used to do so just like Amazon -- I mean, you cut your tech Amazon, the famous story AWS, they lost for 11 years. So we believe in the tech platform story, you need to invest in the beginning, but once you get in, you get the scale. And so hopefully, over the next few years, you start to see value also from the right-hand side of the house.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: The second question is that the how to resolve the conflict of interest with your customer? So it means that you are as a Ping An Group is a financial institution and the way you provide a tech service, it's great. It's of financial cloud from their technology, but your customer is also a financial institution. In some degrees, they are competing with Ping An as a group. So can you show some example how you resolve the issue and become profitable, I mean, business?</p><p>SIN YIN TAN: So I think we do that in 3 levels. One is that, legally, we create separate legal infrastructure. So they're really, I mean, Ping An is a very competitive group. We compete internally too. So we're all P&amp;L driven. They're completely separate businesses. So for the OneConnect I mentioned, it's a completely separate business. And they treat Ping An bank like 1 of the 200 banks that they serve. At a security technical level, each one of these, because remember even without serving the external banks and the FIs actually, internally, we have to manage also 28 companies differently. Each one of them actually have a different regulator. We can't really share and stuff like that. So over the years, we've built our infrastructure the way we segregate our data, even now cloud. One of the unique things about cloud is that we are able to -- our VPCs, virtual private networks, is such that we really segregate, but in some cases, we physically segregate. But we're able to dynamically do that as well. And we've been doing it over the past 20 years for our company. So at the beginning of cost, there is a third thing, which is trust factor. I mean, I can tell you I do that and stuff. People may not still trust me. So it took a while, right, to be honest. Our OneConnect started 3 years ago. The first one took a while. But after that, people believe us more and more. I mean, the Bank of Shanghai example you mentioned now has been running live for 9 months, right, and all their customers say, we will not compromise. I think, may ultimately because we are regulated entity, we never compromise. Because the one time we do something like that where we use your customer information that we shouldn't, I mean, we're dead. We're dead not just in terms of our new business, but our core businesses as well. So this is something we take very seriously.</p><p>ERICSON CHAN: If I may just add one more line. So some of the customer really just told us if it's good enough for Ping An, got to be good enough for me. So there's -- because they believe that if we can serve Ping An well enough scale and speed and security, they are more and glad to join.</p><p>JAMES GARNER: Right, next question. The gentleman over there.</p><p>KAILESH MISTRY, HEAD OF FINANCIALS EQUITY RESEARCH, ASIA-PACIFIC AND ANALYST, HSBC, RESEARCH DIVISION: It's Kailesh Mistry from HSBC. I got a couple of questions. The first one is just philosophically, why did you develop the technologies in-house? You could have gone externally. And then the second question is, given the business is very P&amp;L focused, I got a good feel of effectively the service provision to then feed into product provision. Could you give us an idea of how management is incentivized to encourage the behavior to benefit the rest of the Group?</p><p>SIN YIN TAN: Sir, is the second question is how do you incentivize management?</p><p>KAILESH MISTRY: How is your -- the technology sort of stream of management incentivized to effectively provide the services and then cross-sell into the rest of the Group, because you know the service initially is free.</p><p>ERICSON CHAN: Okay. Quite -- first, to begin first of all, we have the scale. And many, the customer base look fortunate for us, the customer base that we have is probably bigger than a lot of the tech company customer base to begin with. And -- but that is not the core reason. And some of the things that -- of course, we spend like, for example, talk about facial recognition. And those in the market today or when the time that when we first started, it just wasn't good enough for us. And then we have tested the accuracy, the interoperability. And then I just also mentioned it does not have a Chinese face model some of the -- for international supplier. So therefore and we start to develop. And once we gain scale ourselves and gain a capability, we figure out actually we can do a better control of the quality and a direction of the technology capability of that products that we have been developing. So -- and then it's like a positive cycle and it was -- see the advantage then we just continue to do more. Not necessary that we are doing everything in-house. But a lot of it is a bit more than normal financial institute for sure. Sometimes, we also collaborate. Collaborate with other higher universities. Sometimes, for example, some of the latest leading-edge technology we'll be working with MIT universities like that so to help each other. I just met with them this morning in fact, it was like MIT professor in Hong Kong. So we'll figure out what else we can codevelop. So it's not pure together, but we case-by-case basis look into it.</p><p>SIN YIN TAN: And I think that just on the first one I want to just emphasize a lot about making, because all of us have technology background. Often, it's just not about the technology, it's about how you make it work and that's where the secret sauce is, right? The face one is very practical, not just they cannot recognize Asian face, there are some local vendors too. But we need -- it's not just accuracy rate. A lot of people don't advertise false positive rate. That's very important for financial services. I cannot wrongly identify that that's the right person. And we need to be (inaudible) 0.0001%, right? And most people (inaudible) don't have that need. So we have to do it ourselves. On your second question about how do we incentivize, it's a multifaceted way of incentivizing, because we're asking our tech people to do a couple of things. So there's 3 things we try to measure them on. I think one is stability and security. That is at the heart of everything. This is a, I mean, you die. We often tell them, it doesn't matter how many facial recognition you do, number one, but it would have a big security or stability risk, you're dead. And so this is why, I think, Ricky mentioned this disaster recovery. Every year, we do this. We imagine the entire year data center got burned or something. And we have to recover everything on the other side. When I first came 5 years ago, I think we were at 20-something hours recover. We are now at 4.3 hours last year. We haven't done one this year. We will usually do in Q3. Every year, we do that, right, so that's -- I think that's number one. Number two is then about service. So we actually have a very complicated back to back anonymous satisfaction level, not just the usual service SLAs that most banks, global banks do, but like a satisfaction and then for all the BUs et cetera. So we make sure that what we're really doing is what they want. And then thirdly, to incentivize on innovation we have stock options incentives just like any other Internet companies. So actually, our tech employees are one of the very rare exception. They get actually options in some of the businesses we're incubing, because a lot of businesses are incubated from them. We want them to say, look, it doesn't matter where you incubated, right? It's like you can give birth but you don't need to grow, you didn't need the ones to raise them, right? Somebody else can do it and you will still get the benefits. So that's how we incentivize.</p><p>JAMES GARNER: Next question. MW?</p><p>MYUNG WOOK KIM, VP, JP MORGAN CHASE &amp; CO, RESEARCH DIVISION: This is MW Kim from JPMorgan. I have 2 questions. One is about the road map for your AI development. So my understanding is there is a two-way of the AI development, as a financial institution perhaps analyzing precise data in a very speed way only about the customer finance information or the numeric data would be a one way. The other way is interrelating the images and thumb should be another one, IBM Watson should be a good example on that. So I want to know as a financier-backed FinTech company, so what would be the real road map for the AI for Ping An? The next question is about whether you are really focusing on the forecasting the claim for the customer in the process of underwriting? So many insurance company nowadays is filtering the customer, forecasting their customers, their input data and then that they use it in the underwriting and the screening and make their loss ratio better. Do you have this kind of underwrite process currently or are you planning to do that, if not?</p><p>RICKY OU: The road map. Yes, so I'll take the -- take a shot at the first question first, the road map. Yes, in terms of AI road map, we're going in 2 direction. One is going at the depth. And the other one is the breadth. Okay. First of all, the depth. So as you saw earlier, we do facial recognition, right? So that's just telling who you are. The next step we are going to do is facial analysis. So the things I mentioned earlier, micro-expression. So we will be able to currently recognize 19 different micro-expression on your faces and be able to infer about a nice state of emotion state. The levelness of being happy, your anger, frustrated and so on and so forth, right? So with that, we have actively incorporate that into our micro loan process. So in a way to trying to see whether you are nervous when you're being asked questions, so we drill down further. So technically, like, do you lie, right, that scenario, right? And the other dimension, we had a goal with AI is the breadth, right? So earlier, we mentioned we have facial recognition. We're going to have sound. Down the road, we're going to do retina and also the breadth, the vein recognition. Why? Why do we do that? Because for every single biometric, there's always a weaknesses. So for example, fingerprint, it used to be like they are very bulletproof, but now in Taobao for maybe $10, you can buy a fingerprint mold that you can fool about 60% of the fingerprint. And same thing with facial. I mean, you can take someone's selfie recording and you can fool a lot of the facial recognition system, right? Now what we do in the future, we're going to combine those, such as facial and voice together. And when you combine the 2 together, your level of safety would increase dramatically, right, because it will be very difficult for you to fake both at the same time, right?</p><p>SIN YIN TAN: So I'm not sure if we fully answered your question, I'll try the second one, right? And (inaudible). So I think in auto, we're doing 3 areas where we are focusing on. One is in terms of rating. And we do for new customers and renewal. And then one is in terms of claims. And then one is in terms of servicing, right? And I'll just give examples of how we think -- what we do. So on the rating, we don't just look at your past claims, because frankly, everyone has access to that. In China, there are -- this is publicized, right, who has claim, not claim, et cetera, that itself then you just have the same rating card, which is why you see in China, most of the insurers compete the same price, right? But what we do is actually look deeper into what, for example, what a bad driver Ericson is in his little car, a Good Car Driver App. But we also correlate with actually other data because of richness of data. So one interesting thing you see depending on your occupation, I'm not going to tell you which occupation it is, you actually have 5x higher a chance of accident than others just by simple -- because we have transferred the record and we have things. We're actually looking to stuff in terms of health. There is a high correlation between people with high blood pressure with bad drivers. I'm not sure how much causality or correlation there is. But these are interesting things that I think because of the richness of things we're going to do. With claims, we tend to do, as I said, the damage assessment is not just identifying automatically which part is being damaged and how much. Because we have accumulated millions and millions of parts over the years, how much it costs, we are now 85% accurate in terms of predicting how much the price is. That's why in the example that Ericson mentioned, we can give you the money so confidently, because we're quite sure. I mean, 85% is still not good enough, we are aiming for 90% at the end of the year. And these are some of the things we do. Servicing, the same thing. We have these little chatbots. If you try, if you're a customer, you can try our online check. 93% of our online inquiries are being answered by robots that we've trained over the years. And so these are things that we did apply on.</p><p>JAMES GARNER: Great. Next question. Gentleman over there.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: I'm from Nomura. I'm the insurance analyst. My question is regarding your tech application. Do you face some challenge from regulation? And what's the key challenges?</p><p>SIN YIN TAN: Can you give an example of what kind of regulation you think we might face challenge with?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Sorry, such as recently have some headwinds on the P2P, right, you have some new regulations so -- et cetera?</p><p>SIN YIN TAN: So actually, in our previous press review, this question was asked me as well. I think what you see in China over the past 5 years, what core Internet finance (inaudible) is a bit different from, I think, what we're trying to say today, which is FinTech. (inaudible) really is the P2P companies is the best example, are actually, institutions who are trying to do financial services but just on the Internet. So they're actually a loan company. So -- I think which is why you see over the past year plus, a lot of regulations have come up, because these used to be completely unregulated entities. And then, we've realized that, hey, these companies are actually doing financial services; therefore, they should be subjected to some regulations, right? So I think that has been the context, which is a bit different from what we are talking about today. Today, we are talking about technology itself that has existed for decades as long as serving financial institutions. So we are not doing the business of the (inaudible), we are saying how do we use technology to help institutions who have licenses do their financial services better by doing their service better, by doing their sales better, by doing their risk control better. So I think it's not really impacted by any of the regulations that's being discussed today.</p><p>JAMES GARNER: Next question. Charles?</p><p>CHARLES ZHOU, VP, CR\u00e9DIT SUISSE AG, RESEARCH DIVISION: This is Charles from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. So I have 2 questions. First of all, it's about your -- so you talk about the voiceprint recognition, face recognition. And I also noticed you used the word (inaudible) used by Lufax and P&amp;C. So can I ask you like can you give us a number or something that how much you have already used those AI technology in your business? For example, maybe 10% of your car claims has been used this technology? Or can you quantify this one, because I think (inaudible) one get a feeling whether there is something and also how much you have already used now and also -- so like how much has been really put into the reality, in the implementations? And also besides Lufax and P&amp;C, what other Ping An business or units can also use this maybe in the future? So this is the first question. And the second question, I think you probably already talked about this one, but compared with other big TMT firms, BAT whatever, can you maybe talk about great strengths, Ping An compared with them and also the 3 challenges?</p><p>SIN YIN TAN: Yes, sure, sure. I think on the first one, it depends by different technology, because we have different stages. So facial, for example, is very widely used. Already, I think about 10 of our companies use it on securities -- sorry, 17, I'm sorry. So almost all. You can do the calculation there. Our securities company use it for their account opening. Credit card will use it, et cetera, et cetera. Voice recognition is something relatively new. We've been working with MIT for 3 years on this. And it is now in the first phase of actual live testing. It's actually really difficult, because just we're trying to develop a fingerprint for the voice. A normal person can only differentiate about 100 to 150 people's different voices. You have to train the machine to recognize 1 billion people. And we've been able to make the breakthrough actually earlier this year. So we've just -- we're just launching. So we will be applying, I think, this year in 3 areas in our call center. We have about 200 million calls every year. So we'll be using that. If you are a customer, you can try that now, because a lot are self-service. Our self-service rate today is only 50% on the phone IVR. That's already much higher than, I think, most of the -- most financial institutions in China is about 30%. We expect to increase that to 80%, 85%, because a lot people stop in the self-service because they forgot their PIN number. They forgot their card number. So we're going to use the voice print and do that. And we're very confident we can do that, because we've been recording these people's voices for years. So I think that one is still relatively new. We'll start the call center. We're doing the P&amp;C and Lufax. And then, next month, you see we'll actually simultaneously launch to other financial institutions. So one of the things to just show how serious we are on the right-hand side of our house, we are going to offer it to other financial institutions even before the rest of our companies have used it. We want to give it a level playing field. Whoever wants to use it essentially incentivize their own companies to come and use it. So that's your first question. On the second question, what's our relative strengths and weaknesses compared to some of the TMT companies. I'll start with the weaknesses first. (inaudible) yes, one is that they have a much more online users traffic than us, right, after all we did start off that way, right? So we now have 400 million Internet users. They have 800 million, 900 million, right? So we caught up, but not yet. The second thing is just the frequency of the data, right? Many of the social chats, et cetera, they've lot more data than we do. And then, third one, they have much higher valuation. So they can afford to burn much better than us. So I think these are the 3 weakness I can think about. I think in terms of strengths though over the past 5 years, we've also found unique strengths, which is why we're quite confident here. I think the first strength is actually on the traffic. We've realized that in financial services and health, it's not like selling a commodity item. The face-to-face matters, right? Just our Lufax, for example, 50% of people who try to open account actually stop halfway online. They do it by us calling back or via agents kind of being there. And then once they get on, they're much better, right? The face-to-face does matter and China is so big. Most of them are not as savvy and educated as some of the younger generation in Tier 1 cities. And that's been a huge source. Our 1.4 million agents is wonderful, they can sell anything. Jahwa, for example, which is one of the companies we own for cosmetics skin care, we are now their largest distribution channel because our guys can sell it. And I think that's very unique for us. The number two, I think, is in terms of data, we've realized that it's not just about having lots of data. I mentioned earlier it's about having the richness and accuracy of the data. We have 880 million people's data, all of which we know exactly who they are. We don't have to guess. I mean, if you are a search engine, actually, a lot of the AI is spent guessing who you are. We try to guess whether you are a male or a female, who -- or who are you, we don't have to guess. Our customers told us. And I think that's the advantage of the data plus the track record, so we can build models. And then the third thing, I think, is about risk and security, right? We grow up that way in the way that we do our financial services product risk control, in the way in our system stability and even how we deal with regulators, right? In China, the regulation is very unique. It's not a nationwide regulation. It has nationwide regulation plus local regulation. And you need to have presence in local regulators, because if customers complain, they have to go to somebody, right? If you're one on Internet, which is why you see over the past few years is some of the TMT players have launched these Internet finance companies. They can't do a lot of -- none of that has done car, for example, they can't do car insurance, because you need to have local guys who can service. And I think we are able to do that. So I think these 3 strengths really make us quite unique and very interesting.</p><p>JAMES GARNER: Next question. Gentleman over last.</p><p>KELVIN CHU, ASSOCIATE ANALYST AND DIRECTOR, UBS INVESTMENT BANK, RESEARCH DIVISION: This is Kelvin Chu from UBS. Can you talk about on the life insurance business, in addition to underwriting efficiency, what kind of technology should we expect in the next 2 years for the life business that will help Ping An Life to further differentiate from peers? My second question is simple one. So 20,000 of highly intelligent individuals, are they just on AI or technology overall?</p><p>SIN YIN TAN: You want to answer the second question?</p><p>ERICSON CHAN: A lot of it is making not only on AI, but is making new technologies. So it could be making changes automating. So these are driving change for the entire group. That is what the 20,000 technologists is for. It's not like not keeping the lights on if this is what you're talking about.</p><p>SIN YIN TAN: On that, I'll just add, right, it's the impressive growth. 5 years ago, when I first came, we only had 4,000 developers. Today, we have 20,000. Not only that the number that Ericson showed earlier, I can't remember 60% or something, we delivered in 2 weeks. 5 years ago, it was like 70% in one month. So we've maximized our capacity 10x over the 5 years in terms of what we can churn out. And that's just in 5 years. Imagine what it would be next 5 years. So I think that that is just a scale and speed in which we're doing, right? To your first question about life insurance, I think there's really 3 areas. It's not just what is coming, but we've been actually consistently doing. I think besides underwriting, one is basically our agency productivity, right? You've seen and lots of analysts ask us at every road show, why is that we've been able to have a much higher productivity at a much larger scale, as some of our competitors have close to our productivity, but they have 1/10 of this -- this was our scale. And this is really because 10 years ago, already, our Chairman had said, they want to make each of our agents like James Bond. We got to make them equipped with technology. So that any of the agent who come, they can sell any product. And not because they are so smart or anything, we have our training app. We have a wonderful training app that we did this year. It's online training app, whereby they can simultaneously -- [football] was the craze in China last year. We actually had to support for our training, 1.4 million agents being trained on new stuff. We equip their laptop or the iPad with something as a remote. We had this 4 years ago already, whereby over 3G, you can have a video connection with our investment specialists in our centralized contact center, so that with their customer, they can appear professional. That's how they can sell. So I think that's one area we're consistently working at. And you can expect us to continue doing so in the future. And then the third area is the servicing. I think one thing that you will see is that we're going to not only have the checkbox that I mentioned in improving our IVR and stuff, but we are going to radically change how our counter -- actually, we're shocked that we still have a few thousand life insurance servicing people on the counter, which is actually highly inefficient, because the amount of time the people come to you is announced. So we're going to actually radically change that and make it much more automated and self-service.</p><p>JAMES GARNER: So we'll take a final question and then Jessica will wrap up. Lady in the front.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: (foreign language) I want to know which part you invested the most? And what's your focus on the next step incubation?</p><p>SIN YIN TAN: (foreign language) Finance and the health care are our 2 focuses. So in terms of these 2 areas, we are -- that's what we have invested in for the past 5 years. And we will continue to do in the next 5 years. And we haven't done many areas in the health care industry, such as the pricing reform. But pricing reform is only one part of it. We hope we can -- so we have the city OneConnect, and we want to develop more. So in these 2 ecosystems, you can see we will go very in-depth, such as the OneConnect I mentioned. We have over 200 banks and over 2,000 financial institutions. But their product is only -- average product is only 1.4. So we can go much deeper than that. So in the next 5 years, we have a lot of things to do. And in the other ecosystem, such as the auto and the real estate, we will take gradual long time to develop that areas. And the Autohome, we acquired actually is only 1 year. You can see Autohome stock, the share price has increased 50% since we joined. And they also brings us the benefits because P&amp;C and the Ping An Bank are off-line branches and outlets. But now you can see we can develop a lot, and we have a huge room to develop the auto ecosystem. And also, real estate is also a long-term plan.</p><p>JAMES GARNER: That's it for today's event. Thank you very much for your attendance. I'm not sure if you want to say a few final words.</p><p>SIN YIN TAN: Sure. I just want -- firstly, I just want to thank everyone, particularly for the tech analysts who have joined us. I hope you will come to us more often. We will love if you bring us new ideas. It's a whole different world there. And then, I think all we want to take away today is that, I think, don't just look at us on the left side of the house, we're very impressive. But hopefully, on the right side of the house, we'll equally bring you value and then hopefully more will come. Thanks very much.</p><p>JAMES GARNER: Thank you.</p><p>ERICSON CHAN: Thank you.</p><p>RICKY OU: Thank you.</p><p>[Thomson Financial reserves the right to make changes to documents, content, or other information on this web site without obligation to notify any person of such changes.</p><p>In the conference calls upon which Event Transcripts are based, companies may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding a variety of items.

But Pinterest has sharply outperformed them all in 2020.</p><p>Pinterest stock is up nearly 125% this year, easily outpacing Facebook's more than 25% gain and the 40% and 60% jumps for Twitter and Snap. </p><p>And several analysts think the image-sharing site has even more upside, thanks to Apple's new look.</p><p>Apple's recent iOS 14 release includes a folder-heavy update that makes it easier to customize iPhone home screens. As a result, there have been several reports about Pinterest downloads hitting records on the App Store in recent weeks, along with people tweeting screengrabs of their new home screens and citing Pinterest posts as an inspiration. </p><p>\"More users are coming on board following iOS 14,\" said DJ Kang, CEO of Value Champion, an investing research website. \"That's attractive to advertisers.\"</p><p>Kang noted the uptick in Pinterest downloads since Apple released iOS 14, adding that sustained interest in the social media firm could help boost its monetization rates internationally. Currently, the average revenue per Pinterest user in the US is more than three times that of revenue for international users. </p><p>Pinterest's new Story Pins feature, which lets creators post a mix of photos, video, audio and text, could help the company attract more users, Kang added -- particularly Gen Z consumers who have flocked to Snapchat, Facebook-owned Instagram and embattled video app TikTok.</p><p>Still, Pinterest may also need to prove to Wall Street that it can be consistently profitable for the long haul.

But Pinterest has sharply outperformed them all in 2020.  Watch: Apple unveils latest line-up of colorful iPads Pinterest (PINS) stock is up nearly 125% this year, easily outpacing Facebook's (FB) more than 25% gain and the 40% and 60% jumps for Twitter (TWTR) and Snap (SNAP). And several analysts think the image-sharing site has even more upside, thanks to Apple's new look. Apple's () recent iOS 14 release includes a folder-heavy update that makes it easier to customize iPhone home screens. As a result, there have been several reports about Pinterest downloads hitting records on the App Store in recent weeks, along with people tweeting screengrabs of their new home screens and citing Pinterest posts as an inspiration. \"More users are coming on board following iOS 14,\" said DJ Kang, CEO of Value Champion, an investing research website. \"That's attractive to advertisers.\" Kang noted the uptick in Pinterest downloads since Apple released iOS 14, adding that sustained interest in the social media firm could help boost its monetization rates internationally. Currently, the average revenue per Pinterest user in the US is more than three times that of revenue for international users. Pinterest's new Story Pins feature, which lets creators post a mix of photos, video, audio and text, could help the company attract more users, Kang added -- particularly Gen Z consumers who have flocked to Snapchat, Facebook-owned Instagram and embattled video app TikTok. Still, Pinterest may also need to prove to Wall Street that it can be consistently profitable for the long haul. The company has lost money in its past two quarters after eking out a profit in the fourth quarter of 2019. There is hope that Pinterest may be finally turning a corner, though. Analysts are currently forecasting that Pinterest will post a small profit for 2020 and that earnings will surge in 2021. And 20 of the 28 analysts who follow Pinterest have raised their price target on the stock since the company reported second quarter results in late July. Pinterest might also be benefiting from the fact that it's still relatively small compared to the likes of Facebook and other tech and social media behemoths like YouTube owner Google (GOOGL). While most Big Tech firms have come under intense scrutiny from Washington and antitrust authorities around the globe, Pinterest -- with just 96 million monthly active users in the US and 321 million internationally -- could continue to fly under the regulatory radar.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-43193710417</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60YF-6KV1-F07F-84M8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"477\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 29, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Yet, its revenue model looks increasingly similar to that of Facebook and Google, AKA advertising.</p><p>For the second quarter, advertising sales drove most of Pinterest's revenue growth. After Thursday's earning calls, Silbermann <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/01/tech/pinterest-earnings/index.html\">told CNN</url> that the company's future strategy would focus on more \"personalized\" content curation and \"getting better at showing things you love.\" In other words, more precise targeting and better ROI for advertisers.</p><p>\"I feel that online advertising often has a bad rap... because you are seeing ads when you don't really need to see them,\" Silbermann said. \"You don't need ads to talk to your friends. You don't need ads to read the news. But if you are re-modeling your home, you do want to see where you can buy that furniture.\"</p><p>Speaking of Pinterest's high-flying stock price right now, Silbermann said he's not too concerned about one-day or two-day fluctuations in share price. \"Over the long term, market tends to reward companies that grow their value over time. That's pretty much what we are focused on,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYOBSR-Fri02Aug2019165835+0000PinterestProvesChallengingFacebook'sSocialMediaSupremacyIsStillPossible</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYOBSR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WPX-F4B1-JBRW-X2XG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">241959</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"437\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The New York Observer, L.P.

Revenue was $261 million, growing 62% year-over-year, and beating analyst's estimates of $236 million. </p><p>Management also raised guidance for 2019 and said it now expects revenue of between $1.095 billion and $1.115 billion, compared to a previous range of $1.055 billion and $1.080 billion. Adjusted EBITDA is now expected to come in for full year 2019 at between a loss of $25 million and $50 million, narrower than a prior range of a lost between $45 million and $70 million.</p><p>Here's what analysts said about Pinterest's robust quarter:</p><p><br/>Credit Suisse, Neutral, Price Target Raised to $33 From $28 <br/></p><p>\"As we have previously noted, Pinterest is just starting to ramp its Int'l sales effort as it exports the products it has already built for the US. Similar to the ad monetization ramp on other properties, Pinterest disclosed that ad volume drove nearly all of the revenue growth - given the more nascent monetization levels, we believe that the company will continue to ramp the ad load to keep pricing at attractive levels in a bid to garner more revenue dollars. We believe there remains potential for upside to both 3Q19 and 4Q19 revenue estimates as the updated FY19 guidance calling for $1.095-1.112b in revenue implies that the nominal dollars of revenue ramp particularly in the US is lower than that of 2H18.\" </p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">- Stephen Ju</emphasis><br/></p><p><br/>D.A. Davidson &amp; Co., Neutral, Price Target Raised to $28 From $23 <br/></p><p>\"Once again, we were encouraged by the improving international monetization results. For 2Q19, its U.S./International audience (MAU) mix was 28%/72%, while its monetization (revenue) mix was 91%/9%. This compares against 32%68% and 95%/5% respectively, from last year. A more even distribution of revenue may inspire us to upgrade shares in the future.\"</p><p>\"We were excited to hear about Pinterest's efforts to expand video content on its platform. Management noted more videos were viewed in 2Q19 than all of last year combined. Note, we believe the rollout of 5G broadband wireless could be a catalyst for its video efforts. Additionally, we were encouraged by Pinterest's efforts to make its platform easier for consumers to shop.\" </p><p>\"Management answered our question on the call regarding regulatory risk and big tech, including increasing concerns about privacy. We believe, Pinterest's privacy-related strategy provides it a competitive advantage against Facebook and Google, which is becoming increasingly important in today's global regulatory environment.\"</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">- Tom Forte</emphasis><br/></p><p><br/>Pivotal Research Group, Hold, Price Target Raised to $32 From $29 <br/></p><p>\"BOTTOM LINE: We are increasing our PT from $29 to $32 based on 12x 2020 EV/Revs but remain hold rated on the stock based purely on valuation. Given how relatively new the street is to the PINS story and management team, the jury was out as to whether the management team's style would be conservative with revenue guidance for the year - particularly after Q119. Based on 2Q19 results, they feel more likely conservative than we or investors had thought. There were encouraging metrics around shopping feeds, an extremely constructive tone, and continued roll out to new countries - expanding to 19 countries from 13 at in the quarter Q119.\"</p><p>\"There is now likely upside for 2H19 based on the Q219 10% beat, and some flow through to the FY19 guidance.\"</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">- Michael Levine</emphasis><br/></p><p><br/>Nomura Instinet, Buy, Price Target Raised to $39 From $34 <br/></p><p>\"Canada was cited as an early success story (4x YoY growth in 2Q19) and the company is confident in its expansion playbook.
