But the amount is only about a month's worth of the company's revenue[6], suggesting that the fine, while seeming large, is, in fact, rather modest. More significantly, Facebook is required to have an 'outside assessor[7]' - a sort of privacy cop - to monitor the company's handling of user data, along with following a few other corporate procedural requirements. </p><p>That assessor could address the fundamental problems with the way Facebook operates - but as a scholar of technology companies' business practices[8], I'm worried that this potentially all-important role is set up for failure. In my opinion, in order to be effective, there are three main privacy-related concerns the FTC's newly designated cop would need to look out for: the potential for genuine violations of users' privacy; the targeted spread of harmful content, especially resulting in election manipulation and ethnic violence; and instances of collecting and harvesting far more data than is warranted to provide services to users. An independent assessor will lack the standards, regulatory and legal guidelines, and the insight needed to actually monitor how Facebook handles those three issues. This makes the privacy cop's job much harder than that of a regular cop or, say, a financial auditor. Protecting users' privacy Facebook's history of privacy violations extends well beyond the most publicized ones, like letting Cambridge Analytica[9] access the personal data of 50 million users[10] to craft micro-targeted political ad campaigns[11]. Facebook has secretly shared data with other companies[12] for years, without notifying the users. That practice, as well as the function that lets users sign in to other websites and apps with their Facebook login[13], has helped advertisers follow their targets around the internet[14]. The company has also used its trove of user data to gain a competitive advantage in business negotiations[15], boosting its own profits without compensating the users themselves. The FTC ruling gives the privacy cop no clear guidance on which data-sharing or data-withholding arrangements between Facebook and other companies are legitimate and where they cross a line. This is because there are still no internationally agreed-upon data protection rules[16], and few clear regulations[17] in the U.S. to compare Facebook's actions against. <url normalizedValue=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/285898/original/file-20190726-43136-pt1fwa.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0...5...o=format...000...=clip\">https://images.theconversation.com/files/285898/original/file-20190726-43136-pt1fwa.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0...5...o=format...000...=clip</url>  FTC Commissioner Rohit Chopra. FTC[18]  Facebook's business model uses its treasure trove of user data to target advertising, the source of almost all the company's revenue[19]. An outsider will be unable to tell the difference between legitimate business practices that harvest user data to increase profits and problematic abuses that violate users' privacy. In fact, FTC Commissioner Rohit Chopra, who dissented from the decision[20], declared that the new settlement still 'allows Facebook to decide for itself[21] how much information it can harvest from its users and what it can do with that information.' Blocking harmful content Facebook has struggled to limit harmful content[22] on its networks, such as that which fed ethnic violence[23], distributed misinformation[24] or facilitated election interference[25]. Personal data helped the perpetrators target their messages to certain groups of Facebook users. The outside assessor will be focused on privacy[26], which means that identifying, verifying and policing content will be beyond the assessor's mandate. Ironically, steps to enhance privacy, such as ensuring end-to-end encryption across all of Facebook's messaging platforms - as Mark Zuckerberg intends to do[27] - would help in protecting the identity of the spreaders of harmful messages, rather than exposing them and their actions. Protecting users from giving up too much Access to Facebook seems free, because it costs no money, but users pay with their data[28]. The assessor should ask if the users are being charged fairly, in privacy terms, for the service they're receiving. That raises the question of what a 'fair' price is for what Facebook provides. Normally, price is set by a competitive market, where customers can choose[29] from a range of service providers. Not so on Facebook, where there are high costs - again, not financial, but in terms of time and effort - to leaving, and no other option offering equivalent services. A social science phenomenon called the 'network effect[30]' means that any network is increasingly valuable as more people join it - but that means it's also increasingly hard to leave. There are now more than 2.3 billion Facebook users[31] around the world. For too many people, their most active online social connections[32] are on Facebook.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/285899/original/file-20190726-43130-tatb98.png?ixlib=rb-1.1.0...5...o=format...000...=clip\">https://images.theconversation.com/files/285899/original/file-20190726-43130-tatb98.png?ixlib=rb-1.1.0...5...o=format...000...=clip</url>Spotify is one of the many online services that allows users to log in with their Facebook account credentials. Screenshot of Spotify website[33], CC BY-ND[34]  It's hard to leave Facebook, not only because there are so many users. Many customers use their Facebook logins on thousands of other apps and services. If they delete their Facebook accounts, they lose all access to those other apps too, like customized Spotify playlists and Netflix viewing preferences. Worse still, Facebook has bought up many of its competitors. Lots of people who quit Facebook shift over to Instagram[35] - which is owned by Facebook. Looking to the future, the company is making the price of leaving Facebook even higher, by planning to consolidate its data-collection power[36] by integrating its various apps, including Facebook Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp - as well as through a proposed digital currency[37] for transactions conducted on Facebook platforms. All of these create a playing field that is tilted in favor of an all-encompassing single parent company, limiting users' choices and making switching difficult. No assessor can remedy the inherent unfairness of that imbalance. Far more than the fine, the centerpiece of the FTC deal is the outside assessor. If properly designed, this role could be truly game-changing - one of a forceful privacy cop setting the standards for how the power of big technology firms is managed from here on. But the fine is a slap on the wrist, and the cop's arms are tied and don't reach far enough. This sets a very bad precedent: Both the FTC and Facebook can declare a victory of sorts, while the consumer loses.

I ll be interviewing Facebook s former chief security officer, Alex Stamos, at 2:30 PM local time on Saturday; and Craigslist founder Craig Newmark on 3:30 PM Sunday. If you re in town, RSVP here and come say hello. The Interface returns March 13th   and in the meantime, I ll be doing some more original reporting that I can t wait to share with you.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On Wednesday, Mark Zuckerberg dropped a 3,200-word blog post in which he promised to  outline our vision and principles around building a privacy-focused messaging and social networking platform.  I took him seriously, and in the hours after his post was published, contemplated a Facebook that put messaging and privacy first.</p><p>But did I take Zuckerberg too seriously? That s the charge made by Silicon Valley s favorite morning columnist, Ben Thompson, in his newsletter today. We had a friendly chat about it on Twitter over direct message, so there are no hard feelings here. But I do want to dig into the opposing views about the Zuckerberg memo, because I ve noticed a fascinating split today in opinions.</p><p>My view is that if you accept that Facebook s News Feed and other feed-based products will eventually fade away, as they have already begun to do in North America, Facebook will need to transform its business completely. Rallying around privacy, encryption, and ephemeral messages   while buying time to build out new businesses around commerce and payments   seems to be as good an idea as any.</p><p>Zuckerberg nods weakly to a belief in the continuing importance of the News Feed in his post. But over the past year, he also moved top News Feed talent to parts of the company that he needs to grow faster: Adam Mosseri to Instagram; designer Geoff Teehan to the blockchain division, and so on. These moves, coupled with the decline of original sharing in the News Feed in North America, lead me to believe that Zuckerberg   ever paranoid about the company s long-term survival   feels pressure to start building lifeboats.</p><p>But in the aftermath of his post going up, Zuckerberg walked back some of his enthusiasm over this vision of a purely  privacy-focused messaging and social networking platform.  He told Nick Thompson at Wired:</p><p>It s not that Facebook and Instagram are going to be less important for what they re doing, it s just that people sometimes want to interact in a town square, and sometimes they want to interact in the living room, and I think that that s the next big frontier.</p><p>As I said on Twitter, Zuckerberg wants to have his cake, and eat it too: thriving public feeds, and fast-growing private messaging apps. Thompson, in a piece titled  Facebook s privacy cake,  takes the same metaphor and runs with it:</p><p>They still have the core Facebook app, Instagram,  Like -buttons scattered across the web   none of that is going away with this announcement. They can very much afford a privacy-centric messaging offering in a way that any would-be challenger could not. Privacy, it turns out, is a competitive advantage for Facebook, not the cudgel the company s critics hoped it might be.</p><p>He goes on:</p><p>Stop expecting companies to act against their interests. Facebook isn t killing their core business anymore than Apple, to take a pertinent example, is willing to go to the mat to protect user data in China.</p><p>If nothing else, this view explains why Facebook s stock has been mostly flat since the announcement. (It was down about 2 percent today.)</p><p>At the same time, I find this view to be surprisingly cynical. It takes as a given that Facebook s CEO, in announcing a bold new vision for privacy-focused social networking, was in reality simply describing a high-level product roadmap for an adjacent business. It suggests that the post was published primarily for public-relations reasons: to signal a commitment to privacy from a company whose reputation on the subject is dire.</p><p>But assuming this is the case, Facebook has put itself in a vise. On one hand it will have its advertisers demanding ever-more intrusive tracking and targeting options, as usual; on the other, there is a large and increasingly dissatisfied user base that has now been promised that the next generation of Facebook products will be private, ephemeral, and regularly purge their data. Whole divisions of Facebook will now be working at cross purposes.</p><p>And with each new error around data privacy   there was one a few hours ago, by the way   the world will have a chance to jeer: Remember the pivot to privacy? If the company truly hoped to buy some short-term goodwill at the expense of its long-term credibility, it seems like a bad bargain.</p><p>Perhaps, with the threat of a forced breakup of Instagram and WhatsApp looming, Zuckerberg felt that his hand was forced   and that he had to justify the unification of the apps  back-end technology with the most consumer-friendly argument he could find. But if he can t deliver what he promised   and if data-related scandals continue at the pace of the past 12 months   the  pivot to privacy  will be remembered as an epic folly.</p><p>One reason for the confusion over Zuckerberg s post may be that he uses  privacy  differently than most people do. As Konstantin Kakaes writes in MIT Tech Review:</p><p>By narrowly construing privacy to be almost exclusively about end-to-end encryption that would prevent a would-be eavesdropper from intercepting communications, he manages to avoid having to think about Facebook s weaknesses and missteps. Privacy is not just about keeping secrets. It s also about how flows of information shape us as individuals and as a society. What we say to whom and why is a function of context. Social networks change that context, and in so doing they change the nature of privacy, in ways that are both good and bad.</p><p>Russian propagandists used Facebook to sway the 2016 American election, perhaps decisively. Myanmarese military leaders used Facebook to incite an anti-Rohingya genocide. These are consequences of the ways in which Facebook has diminished privacy. They are not the result of failures of encryption.</p><p>In any case, I found that current and former employees seemed to take the news differently. Current employees, as Peter Kafka notes here, tend to endorse Thompson s view   that this is a cake-and-eat-it-too situation. But former employees I ve spoken to take Zuckerberg at his word that he plans to shift the company to a more message- and group-oriented future   and that it will be very, very hard. ( Everyone thinks it s a bad idea,  one person familiar with employee sentiment told me today.  But it s a top-down request to get it done. )</p><p>That s the thing about having your cake and eating it too. Very few people ever get to.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Democracy</emphasis></h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook plans to tie itself together as regulators debate tearing it apart</emphasis></p><p>Makena Kelly reports that some lawmakers are taking a dim view of Facebook s effort to consolidate its messaging apps:</p><p> Mark Zuckerberg is taunting antitrust authorities around the world, breaking past acquisition commitments and threatening to consolidate market control,  Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) said in a statement to The Verge.  The FTC and Department of Justice should see through this fa\u00e7ade. Big Tech will never change its invasive and anticompetitive ways until change is forced on them. </p><p> Yesterday, I suggested that our antitrust enforcers should consider unwinding anticompetitive mergers, including Facebook and Instagram,  Blumenthal continued.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook discovers UK  fake news  network</emphasis></p><p>Facebook took down an information operation today that was followed by 175,000 people and targeted at the United Kingdom. It s not clear who was behind it:</p><p>Facebook has removed more than 130 accounts, pages and groups it says were part of a UK-based misinformation network.</p><p>The company said it was the first time it had taken down a UK-based group targeting messages at British citizens.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Russia laws ban  disrespect  of government and  fake news </emphasis></p><p>Here s another authoritarian leader banning dissent under the guise of restricting  fake news. </p><p>Russia s parliament has passed two bills outlawing  disrespect  of authorities and the spreading of what the government deems to be  fake news .</p><p>The first ban refers to  blatant disrespect  of the state, its officials and Russian society, and repeat offenders face up to 15 days in jail.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">YouTube Is Rolling Out A Feature That Shows Fact Checks When People Search For Sensitive Topics</emphasis></p><p>Pranav Dixit reports that YouTube will start showing information panels when people search for topics that are  prone to misinformation,  starting in India:</p><p>Asked for an example of the kind of search that would show an information panel, the YouTube spokesperson cited the recent conflict between India and Pakistan that led to a flood of misinformation on social media platforms.</p><p>The spokesperson also provided BuzzFeed News with a screenshot of an information panel in Hindi containing a debunk for a Hindi search query for  CCTV footage of the Pulwama terror attack  that yields videos trying to pass off a bomb explosion in Syria as that of an attack on Indian paramilitary forces.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Elsewhere</emphasis></h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Car bomb fears and stolen prototypes: Inside Facebook s efforts to protect its 80,000 workers across the globe</emphasis></p><p>Rob Price has an illuminating look at the very real security threats faced by Facebook and its tens of thousands of workers around the globe. There are many candidates for the wildest detail in this story, but the kicker is probably the wildest:</p><p>In August 2013, after Facebook s beloved head chef died in a motorcycle crash, the company threw a blow-out party with free booze on a weekend to commemorate him. The memorial descended into chaos, with multiple fights breaking out among kitchen staff, which security staff believed were gang-related. The event culminated in one kitchen worker being beaten so badly on Facebook grounds they were hospitalised.</p><p>The assailant was subsequently blacklisted   but he continued to sneak onto campus afterwards to visit his mother who still worked there.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook Messenger had a vulnerability that could let hackers see who you contact</emphasis></p><p>Facebook made it one day into the pivot to privacy before a privacy vulnerability was announced. Here s Shannon Liao:</p><p>A previously reported Facebook vulnerability was similarly found in the company s Messenger product, according to security research group Imperva. Nearly a year ago, Imperva researchers discovered that, through Messenger, a hacker could use  any website to expose who you have been messaging with.  The bug was disclosed to Facebook in May and subsequently patched.</p><p>Hackers could target a Facebook user s web browser and exploit iframe elements to see which friends the user had talked to and which were not in the user s contact list. Imperva confirmed the hackers couldn t gain any other data from the attack.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The messy details behind Facebook s messaging plans</emphasis></p><p>Mark Zuckerberg says messaging apps should be more  interoperable.  Russell Brandom digs into what that might mean in practice:</p><p>If you re of a certain generation of techie, this all might sound a bit silly. There are lots of truly interoperable messaging standards, whether it s SMTP (aka email) or XMPP (aka Jabber), and if you don t like how they work, you can always start a new one. Facebook isn t proposing anything like that. Facebook is proposing a new system that it controls, which would aim to crowd out existing open standards as well as competing services from Google, Apple, and everyone else. It s very much a power play, and if it works, it would put Facebook at the center of one of the most important things we do with our phones.</p><p>It would also come with its own business opportunities, depending on how the system is constructed. Robust encryption would mean the company can t read the text of messages, but if Facebook kept the metadata, it would reveal who you re texting, which could be a powerful tool for targeted advertising and help Facebook build out its graph of who knows who. It wasn t mentioned in Zuckerberg s post, but Facebook is also reportedly working on a blockchain payment system that would let users send money through messaging apps, which would make the proposed system even more lucrative. And as regulators around the world start to think about splitting off WhatsApp and Instagram, bringing all three networks onto a single messaging system could be a crucial political protection.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">YouTube s family vloggers worry about their future amid comment section crackdown</emphasis></p><p>People whose business is showing off their children on YouTube are worried about the ban on advertising for videos depicting minors, Julia Alexander reports.</p><p>Most people might think of YouTube s comment section as nothing more than a haven for trolls, but for YouTubers comments are a way to communicate with viewers, Jon and Danielle told The Verge. People watch YouTube to engage with creators and other fans. But YouTube has removed comments from the majority of videos featuring minors, in an attempt to combat predatory behavior. Most affected videos belong to family vloggers like the Murrays   a popular genre of videos about living with kids.</p><p> We built this relationship with our subscribers, you know,  Danielle told The Verge in a phone call.  We just picked up a bunch of mail from our P.O. box, gifts that people send us, cards, and all kinds of stuff ... it really feels like people you know. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Can a judge order Elon Musk to delete his Twitter account?</emphasis></p><p>Elizabeth Lopatto talks with legal experts in an effort to answer the question. The answer seems to be: probably not.</p><p> I m doubtful the court can   or would   order Mr. Musk to stop tweeting and/or delete his Twitter account,  says former SEC commissioner Harvey Pitt, now the CEO of Kalorama Partners, in an email.  That type of order would smack of First Amendment infringement, I suspect.  Pitt says the court could order Musk to stop tweeting on behalf of Tesla, but because Musk is so closely associated with Tesla in the public s mind, I m not sure how that would work. This is the dude who immediately launched conspiracy theories just by changing his Twitter display name to  Elon Tusk  as a goof.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Launches</emphasis></h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook outlines plans to curb anti-vax conspiracy theories</emphasis></p><p>In the wake of Pinterest removing anti-vaccine content from search, Facebook is following suit. It s a welcome move   promoting freedom of speech while denying these zealots the right to hijack Facebook s viral machinery. Rachel Becker reports:</p><p>The news comes three weeks after Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) sent a stern letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, criticizing Facebook and Instagram for  surfacing and recommending messages that discourage parents from vaccinating their children.  When kids don t get vaccinated due to thoroughly debunked myths that vaccines cause diseases like autism, dangerous diseases like measles can spread. Schiff called this  a direct threat to public health. </p><p>One major problem area is Facebook groups where fear-mongering misinformation about vaccines can bounce around in a pseudoscientific echo chamber, The Guardian reported last month. Today, Facebook pledged to stop promoting anti-vax groups and pages in recommendations and in predictions in the search box. The company also promised to make it harder to find them through search or in the News Feed.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Twitter will let users be much more specific when reporting tweets with personal information</emphasis></p><p>Twitter is adding new options to its reporting process for tweets that abusively share personal information, adding much more specific fields that users can highlight when submitting reports, Chaim Gartenberg reports.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Takes</emphasis></h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A  privacy-focused  Facebook would kill Zuckerberg s business model</emphasis></p><p>Alex Hern is not taking Zuckerberg seriously:</p><p>So whether or not Zuckerberg believes what he s saying, the fact that Facebook s stock price is barely changed on the news of Zuckerberg s note suggests that the people who actually own Facebook don t. They read that letter, and decided that their money was perfectly safe where it was. From their conclusion, it shouldn t be hard to draw your own.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">It s time   high time   to take Fox News s destructive role in America seriously</emphasis></p><p>Margaret Sullivan calls Fox News a plague:</p><p>Everyone ought to see it for what it is: Not a normal news organization with inevitable screw-ups, flaws and commercial interests, which sometimes fail to serve the public interest.</p><p>But a shameless propaganda outfit, which makes billions of dollars a year as it chips away at the core democratic values we ought to hold dear: truth, accountability and the rule of law.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The India-Pakistan Conflict Was a Parade of Lies</emphasis></p><p>Farhad Manjoo worries about the misinformation flying between two nuclear-armed neighbors:</p><p>What I found was alarming; it should terrify the world, not just Indians and Pakistanis. Whether you got your news from outlets based in India or Pakistan during the conflict, you would have struggled to find your way through a miasma of lies. The lies flitted across all media: there was lying on Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp; there was lying on TV; there were lies from politicians; there were lies from citizens.</p><p>Besides outright lies, just about everyone, including many journalists, played fast and loose with facts. Many discussions were tinged with rumor and supposition. Pictures were doctored, doctored pictures were shared and aired, and real pictures were dismissed as doctored. Many of the lies were directed and weren t innocent slip-ups in the fog of war but efforts to discredit the enemy, to boost nationalistic pride, to shame anyone who failed to toe a jingoistic line. The lies fit a pattern, clamoring for war, and on both sides they suggested a society that had slipped the bonds of rationality and fallen completely to the post-fact order.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">And finally  </emphasis></h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tim Cook is now Tim Apple on Twitter</emphasis></p><p>On Wednesday President Trump referred to the CEO of Apple at  Tim Apple,  leading to widespread merriment on Twitter.

Both men share the dubious distinction of false arrest by law enforcement using facial recognition technology. In December 2015, the Denver police using facial comparison technology falsely arrested Mr. Talley when he was identified as a suspect in an armed bank robbery.[1] Prior to making the arrest, the police had not investigated whether Mr. Talley had an alibi, relying instead on the software match. Similarly, Mr. Williams, accused of shoplifting watches, had an alibi for the time of his alleged offense, which the Detroit police did not verify before his arrest.[2] In both cases, law enforcement erroneously relied on technology as dispositive, but facial recognition software is not magic \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s meant to serve as an investigative tool not evidence.\u201d[3]</p><p>While there are arguably benefits to facial recognition technology, its present unregulated application by law enforcement raises grim concerns about its role in exacerbating systemic racism and infringing civil liberties. Following the tragic murder of George Floyd, an unarmed black man suffocated by a white police officer,[4] opponents of this technology have viewed it with even greater scrutiny, stressing the need to both regulate the technology and reform its use.[5] In a country that champions the right to free speech, peaceful assembly, and social equality, we must question whether (and how) the police should deploy facial recognition systems in our democratic society.</p><p>Why facial recognition technology is flawed</p><p>Facial recognition technology owes its genesis to the development of computer vision in the 1960s.[6] The software underlying a facial recognition system relies on machine learning and complicated algorithms. Algorithms are ubiquitous in this digital age. In the case of facial recognition, however, algorithmic biases have developed within the code because the system was not adequately trained with diverse data.[7] Algorithmic biases (i.e , believing without verifying a computer\u2019s accuracy assessment) have led to unfairness and inequities when seeking employment, securing a loan, and, most egregiously, being misidentified for a crime.[8]</p><p>How law enforcement applies facial recognition</p><p>Facial recognition technology has assisted law enforcement in locating and identifying missing people and in identifying deceased persons. In an opinion supporting the technology\u2019s use for public safety, New York police commissioner, James O\u2019Neill, wrote \u201cUsed properly, the software effectively identifies crime suspects without violating rights.\u201d[9] He further noted that facial recognition technology has cleared suspects, stating \u201cNo one can be arrested on the basis of the computer match alone.\u201d[10] As witnessed in Mr. Talley\u2019s and Mr. Williams\u2019 cases, though, the technology can be improperly applied with tragic results. In those cases, law enforcement failed to recognize that \u201cthe technology is no magic bullet.\u201d[11]</p><p>How facial recognition should be reformed</p><p>Recognizing the inherent biases in facial recognition systems and how they can be (and have been) misused, the question is how these systems can be reformed and regulated to ensure their constructive use by law enforcement.[12] An answer to this question will take several forms: (1) limitations on facial recognition software use, (2) state and federal legislation, (3) judicial intervention, and (4) diversification in the technology workforce.</p><p>Although a few large technology companies have announced temporary bans on facial recognition technology sales to police departments (e.g , IBM,[13] Amazon,[14] and Microsoft[15]), the true players in this market, NEC, Idemia, and Clearview AI, have failed to take any action with respect to their sales practices. NEC\u2019s founder and CEO, Hoan Ton-That, has remarked that his company would not offer the technology to certain countries,[16] but believes that the system can be used to \u201ccombat racism.\u201d[17] Notwithstanding Clearview AI\u2019s anti-racism assertion, it has been sued in multiple states for its claim to \u201cend your ability to walk down the street anonymously,\u201d[18] a chilling specter of a panopticon society.[19] The courts\u2019 ultimate rulings in the pending Clearview AI litigation will serve as a litmus test of our ability to curb this technology\u2019s malevolent applications through judicial intervention.</p><p>Federal and state legislators must also play a critical role in this reformation. The laws they adopt should protect the right to privacy and other civil liberties impugned by facial recognition technology. Currently, all states have introduced or adopted a bill to address these concerns in some form[20] but Congress has yet to act. Washington State leads the way in legislative reform, noting, \u201c[L]egislation is required to establish safeguards that will allow state and local government agencies to use facial recognition services in a manner that benefits society while prohibiting uses that threaten our democratic freedoms and put our civil liberties at risk.\u201d[21] Acknowledging the chilling effect that mass surveillance has on peaceful protests, Washington\u2019s and California\u2019s laws forbid the use of facial recognition technology on any individual participating in \u201ca particular noncriminal organization or lawful event.\u201d[22] Further, the Washington law expressly forbids profiling or the use of predictive law enforcement tools.[23] New York\u2019s law is more circumscribed, banning the use of facial recognition or biometric surveillance in police officer cameras only.[24] Boston, MA has joined San Francisco, CA in voting unanimously to \u201cban surveillance technologies that automatically identify and track people based on their face.\u201d[25]</p><p>Federal legislation entitled \u201cFacial Recognition and Biometric Technology Moratorium Act of 2020\u201d will soon be introduced to \u201cprohibit biometric surveillance by the Federal Government without explicit statutory authorization and to withhold certain Federal public safety grants from State and local governments that engage in biometric surveillance.\u201d[26] Citing the December 2019 report from the National Institute of Standards and Technology[27] in support of their proposed bill, legislators noted that \u201ca growing body of research points to systematic inaccuracy and bias issues in biometric technologies.\u201d[28] Senator Merkley stated, \u201cAt a time when Americans are demanding that we address systemic racism in law enforcement, the use of facial recognition technology is a step in the wrong direction. Studies show that this technology brings racial discrimination and bias.\u201d[29] Co-author of the bill, Congresswoman Pressley, emphasized \u201cFacial recognition technology is fundamentally flawed, systemically biased, and has no place in our society.\u201d[30]</p><p>Transformation of facial recognition systems should also include reform at the developmental stage. We can achieve this by educating and training programmers from diverse backgrounds. As author and optics research scientist Janelle Shane writes, \u201cProgrammers who are themselves marginalized are more likely to anticipate where bias might be lurking in the training data and to take these problems seriously.\u201d[31] In her TED talk, Joy Buolamwini, a computer scientist at the MIT Media Lab, encourages inclusivity in her coding movement, noting that it matters who codes, how we code, and why we code and that technology should \u201cwork for all of us, not some of us.\u201d[32]</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Absent issuing everyone a pair of anti-facial recognition glasses[33] or employing creative face make-up techniques,[34] we need immediate practical solutions to the negative repercussions from the use of facial recognition technology by law enforcement. Limiting use, imposing strict regulations, and diversifying the technology workforce are logical places to start with a technology that does not magically work in every instance.</p><p>Vivian D.

More regulation and taxation are almost certainly on the horizon amid growing concerns about privacy, governance and profitability.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Just as the technology, media and telecom convergence inflated the dotcom bubble in the late 1990s, the likes of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google - the FANGs - accelerated the most recent run-up in US equities. But lately, not all has been fine for the FANGs. Hand-in-hand with their declining valuations, their public perceptions are also taking a hit:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u00b7 Facebook is being criticized for how it uses private data, as evidenced by the growing scrutiny on Cambridge Analytica.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u00b7 Amazon's success has been tied to a hollowed-out US jobs market, and President Donald Trump has singled out the firm with strongly worded tweets.</p><p>\u00b7 Google's near-monopoly status has drawn the ire of many politicians and pundits; together with Facebook and others, the firm is also grappling with accusations of abetting election interference and terrorism.</p><p>Although the FANGs have different business models, they face similar questions about their social impact and value - and they're feeling pressure from governments, regulators and users. We outlined many of the pitfalls the FANGs face, including increased regulation and greater taxation, in a 2017 article entitled \"De-FANGed: 5 Ways the Disruptors Could Be Disrupted\". Unfortunately, more bad news may be in store for the FANGs and their peers.</p><p>Four more forces fighting the FANGs</p><p>1. Greater consumer-privacy protectionsIn recent years, billions of consumers have come to enjoy - and even rely on - the \"free\" digital services that companies like Facebook and Google provide. Yet recent scandals over privacy are causing a growing number of people to realize what Apple CEO Tim Cook once said best: \"when an online service is free, you're not the customer ... you're the product\".</p><p>To be fair, not all users want to opt out of the ads and services that FANG-type firms sell; in fact, some simply don't care how their digital information is used. Others may be concerned, but ultimately unable or unwilling to pay for a service like Facebook's should it change its advertising-supported business model.</p><p>As the fight continues over the monetization of private information, the European Union will soon step into the ring with its new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) - a robust set of requirements aimed at guarding the personal information of all EU citizens. Launching in May 2018, GDPR will raise the costs of mining and disseminating digital data, which could affect the bottom line of any firm doing business in the EU. That includes the FANGs.</p><p>With privacy concerns increasingly making headlines, we expect more jurisdictions to put an emphasis on personal privacy instead of taking a laissez-faire approach. If this movement spreads to society at large, perhaps the social propriety of social media could be called into question. Even if the #deletefacebook movement ultimately loses steam, the customer is always right - and votes with his or her feet.</p><p>2. Calls for better corporate governanceBefore recent revelations about alleged election interference, much of the wariness about social media was limited to non-millennial generations. But today, consumer angst seems tangible and rising, and attention is turning to the corporate-governance structures - or lack thereof - that permitted what many consider to be the systematic abuse of society's data and trust.</p><p>Arguably, the governance of some of the FANGs and their brethren has rested with young billionaires and boards with little real-world expertise, let alone a desire to exercise restraint. One clear result has been their weak management of the mounting crises, which seems likely to alienate both users and advertisers in a self-reinforcing fashion. Moreover, one key avenue of recourse - pressure from shareholders - could be less than effective on FANG firms due to the dual-class share structure that gives their founders outsize control.</p><p>3. A changing investment environmentDuring the pronounced equity market run-up of recent years, some FANGs offered rising earnings to go with their soaring share prices - a factor that was generally absent during the dotcom days. Yet the business models of many of today's big tech giants may rely less on profitability than on access to cheap credit - an unintended consequence of the extremely accommodative monetary policies set by central banks in recent years.</p><p>With higher rates on the horizon, easy money will be harder to get. This raises a key question: if the rising cost of capital imperils tech firms that are actually running at a loss, can the disrupters continue to disrupt? Could we see some of the world's largest corporations - some less than 20 years old - fall to Darwinian forces as they fail to adapt?</p><p>4. A backlash against monopolist modelsGovernments have been known to help give birth to monopolies they then spend decades trying to control - and the FANGs and their ilk may find themselves on the receiving end of similar efforts. Politicians and regulators know that economies need a regular supply of efficient competition to promote innovation and productivity, but that supply is stifled by the \"winner-take-all\" effect at work today.</p><p>Adding to the monopoly accusations plaguing Google, Amazon has a model that is equally problematic for its competitors. Going head-to-head against such a company - which offers consumers a single marketplace with renowned services and efficiencies - becomes all but impossible when it is under little pressure to make a profit, which is normally what a free-market economy would demand.</p><p>Pride comes before the fall</p><p>FANG-type firms have re-energized the consumer experience across the developed world, but at what cost? The rise of e-commerce is hollowing out shopping malls and main streets, displacing many employees who once worked there. To be sure, the business models of the FANG family may be too popular not to endure, but they have begun to see their share of trust damaged. All companies form part of the social and ethical structures of their societies, and the pursuit of profit is only one goal.</p><p>Ironically, while the FANGs are increasingly seen as a hindrance to democracy and fair competition, their Chinese equivalents - Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent, also known as the BATs - seem to be more willing, more able or more compelled to align themselves with their own government. The BATs are also viewed less as troublemakers than as modernizers of the emerging markets, feeding the needs of consumers who want to shop, communicate and be entertained on their smartphones.</p><p>Setting aside the FANGs' public perception problems, two particular numbers underscore the investment case for BATs: the BATs will ultimately be able to access over 4 billion consumers across Asia, while the home market for the FANGs is less than 750 million.

But for years, John Deere has been selling tractors that practically drive themselves for use on farms in America's heartland, where there are few pesky pedestrians or federal rules to get in the way.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For a glimpse at the future, meet Jason Poole, a 34-year-old crop consultant from Kansas. After a long day of meetings earlier this month and driving five hours across the state to watch his little girl's softball game, he was still able to run his John Deere tractor until 2 a.m., thanks to technology that left most of the driving to a computer.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The land is hilly on Poole's family farm, so he drives the first curved row manually and handles the turns himself to teach the layout to his tractor's guidance system. But after that, he takes his hands off the steering wheel and allows the tractor to finish.</p><p>\"We kind of laugh when we see news stories about self-driving cars, because we've had that for years,\" Poole said.</p><p>The advancements being rolled out on the farm could soon show up next door: Your neighbor can already replace his lawn mower with the John Deere equivalent of a Roomba robotic vacuum for his yard.</p><p>The self-driving technology being sold by John Deere and some of its competitors is less technically complex than the fully driverless cars that big tech companies and car manufacturers are working on. For now, the tractors are still supposed to have a driver behind the wheel \u2014 even if they never touch it.</p><p>They've already started to transform farming in America and abroad: John Deere is selling auto-steering and other self-guidance tech in more than 100 countries, said Cory Reed, vice president of the company's Intelligent Solutions Group.</p><p>\"John Deere is the largest operator of autonomous vehicles,\" said Catherine Sandoval, a California public utilities commissioner, at a recent event hosted by the Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>Some farmers aren't shy about their enthusiasm for the technology \u2014 even uploading videos showing it off online. One appears to show a tractor hauling a planter making a tightly choreographed turn without a driver in the cab. In another, the driver takes pictures, throws paper airplanes and balances a water bottle on his nose before appearing to nod off while the tractor keeps working his field.</p><p>The systems come with their own risks, including concerns that they could be hacked. But because farm-equipment makers operate almost exclusively on private land, they've been able to bring products to market much more quickly than consumer automakers \u2014 and without the same level of regulatory scrutiny.</p><p>There are no federal rules specifically addressing self-driving tech for tractors, largely because farm equipment is designed for use in fields where it doesn't pose the same level of risk to other vehicles or people as a self-driving vehicle on a public road. The closest thing to national regulations are safety standards set by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, but the agency does not have any rules directly aimed at self-driving technology.</p><p>That lack of regulations is one reason that the future reached the farm first. But another is pure necessity: There's a labor crunch in rural America \u2014 young people move to the cities, leaving the average age of U.S. farmers at 58, according to the Agriculture Department. Similar forces are pushing self-driving tech into other industrial sectors at a pace that outstrips the consumer market. Earlier this year, the first self-driving semi-truck licensed to drive on public roads in the United States made its debut in Nevada with a splashy press show. Self-driving trucks are being rolled out for mining and oil operations in remote parts of the world.</p><p>The success of self-driving technology in agriculture could serve as a guidepost for carmakers who are trying to figure out how to move similar technologies onto U.S. streets.</p><p>Tractor makers started exploring the possibility of putting software in the driver's seat decades ago. At first, they used satellite technology to help farmers plot courses they could drive manually. About 15 years ago, John Deere started using similar systems to guide the tractors automatically, Reed said.</p><p>Crops are generally planted in one long row after another \u2014 and farmers want to make sure they use up all their land. Before auto-steering, that often meant a few feet would get reworked in every row. But with modern technology, that overlap can be reduced to less than an inch so it takes fewer passes to cover each field \u2014 saving farmers time and money.</p><p>Tractor buyers today can pile on modular systems that give computers more and more control over operations. You start with a basic satellite guidance system and a touch-screen interface, but from there the options are almost endless. Some add-ons let the tractor make very precise turns without the driver even touching the steering wheel. Others use radio base stations set up around fields to provide even more accurate navigation than satellites.</p><p>John Deere isn't the only company selling this kind of tech; its main competitor, Case IH, markets similar systems, as do lesser-known companies. Some are going even further than modifying existing tractor designs: The aptly named Autonomous Tractor Corp. designed a fully autonomous tractor prototype that looks like a golden, boxy tank, but without a seat for a driver.</p><p>The systems are pricey: Outfitting a new tractor with top-of-the-line auto-steering, navigation and guidance tech could cost upward of $20,000, Reed said. There are also activation and subscription fees if farmers want to use the company's satellite or radio signals.</p><p>There are risks to reliance on software. Poole said one neighbor using self-driving technology downloaded a software update that disabled his tractor for a week in the middle of planting season this spring. If a system is working, farmers will often hold off on updates rather than risk complications, he said.</p><p>Those gaps could raise added cybersecurity risks. John Deere takes this issue seriously, Reed said, and encrypts its systems to protect them from hackers.</p><p>Still, issues such as digital security fears, along with more traditional physical safety concerns, make it hard for consumer automakers to get their self-driving vehicles past various regulators and on to public roads. But tractor makers have shown that much of the technology needed to fulfill the promise of autonomous vehicles is here.</p><p>\"All of the things we're doing on the farm will find their way into the consumer market in the coming years,\" Reed said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Thanks to fewer regulations and a labor crunch in rural America, tractors have a yearslong head start in the autonomous-vehicles race.

If you take the Facebook example, consumers 'pay' for the service by supplying data which in turn makes the company money through ads that rely on this data.  Despite the severe \u2014 and warranted \u2014 backlash over data privacy, I don't think the existing data-in-exchange for services model is inherently a bad idea. </p><p>Where those systems break down is in the lack of trust and transparency, and when the bargain is one-sided and unfair \u2014 when you pay full price for a product and continue to pay with your data after the fact.  If Google, Facebook, Twitter, and your cell phone provider got together in a room, what details would they have about you? That lack of transparency is a problem causing deep data distrust, but I would argue that the more fundamental problem is that we don't yet have an index for what personal data is worth, and we don't have an open, transparent market to determine the price of data. What if instead of fighting that unknown with retrospective laws and public outcry, we took this opportunity to rewrite the whole system? We are not without precedent for what these models might look like. The agriculture industry has shown how data-as-a-commodity can be leveraged to benefit all parties, and offer models for other industries.From the ground upFirst and foremost, agriculture doesn't rely on an infrastructure that leverages a direct-exchange model of data for services. You don't give up your data in exchange for the right to own a machine, or be part of the commodities market. Rather, the data is used as business intelligence for the industry that collects it.  In agriculture, this is better equipment, better products, and (ideally) more transparency between the growers and the consumers. In the broader food system, companies like IBM, Walmart and Sam's Club[2] are implementing blockchain solutions to increase tracking and traceability based on digital data from the operation that produced the product. In this case, some growers are making the effort to record in great detail the story of how they grow their crop in exchange for a differentiated price versus the traditional commodity market price (commodity price + implied data value).  Because there is no established, industry-wide,direct-exchange model in place for this new commodity of data, there's room to repair and rewrite the existing rules. We are committed to figuring it out, and new and innovative models are emerging.The equalizing equation of the data economySome of the most interesting experimental models are those in which data is exchanged successfully for monetary gains on behalf of the data creator. Instead of access to a service, valuable data sets get a dollar amount attached to them. What's different in these models? a The data creators are now active participants in the conversation, not just passive recipients of services. They help set the terms of the negotiation.  In agriculture, I've seen first hand at my company the positive impact of giving farmers control over their data and a marketplace in which to monetize it. We're testing out a model in the field using real farmer-collected data, and it's paying off already for both the farmers creating the data and the data buyers that are hungry for this kind of ground-truthed data.  I feel we're at the perfect juncture to build an infrastructure for data rights in agriculture that can then be applied to other industries, like healthcare. The negotiations have already started. We need to make sure and let the market play its role.  Again, I would argue that it's not wrong to use or share our data \u2014 in fact, it's generally beneficial to both parties. Facebook learns about me and my preferences, and I can connect with every person I've ever met (and ones I haven't) for free.  But shouldn't we know exactly what we're getting in exchange? How much of our data is worth a Facebook subscription? Don't we have the right to know, and participate in the conversation about what our data is worth, and have the power to bargain for more or less in return? The proposed 'data as currency' model in agriculture requires that: 1) we agree on what our data is worth, 2) the data creator has an explicit say in the conversation and 3) there is far more transparency in how and when these transactions occur. Individuals and regulators need to demand that consumer companies follow suit, so that data rights are not only managed appropriately, but that the data economy can thrive. The challenges ahead are not trivial, but agriculture have proven that when incentives are properly aligned, when the individual has control, and when there is an open conversation between all parties, the data economy can exist.

Prior to that, on 10 November, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. introduced blockchain-as-a-service that can help companies \"deploy blockchain solutions quickly and easily\". And earlier in the same month, Primechain Technologies Pvt. Ltd, which operates a blockchain community of banks called BankChain, announced that the State Bank of India is working towards a \"safer, more secure banking system in India through its implementation of blockchain solutions with BankChain and Intel\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">These are just a few examples in the growing pile of reports about the potential of blockchain-the distributed ledger technology behind cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Now, increasingly, blockchain is finding traction among various industries. Research firm Gartner Inc. estimates that blockchain can generate business value worth $176 billion by 2025.</p><p>Among the big tech firms that have invested in blockchain are International Business Machines Corp., Intel Corp., Microsoft Corp. and Google Inc. Also, there are specialist firms seeking to capitalize on the opportunities emerging from it. \"We realized that different industries (financial, insurance, supply chain and others) wanted to try their hand at blockchain,\" said Akash Gaurav, founder and chief executive officer of one such Indian firm, Auxesis Services and Technologies Pvt. Ltd, in a recent interview.</p><p>While the buzz around blockchain is high, said Gaurav, it is still evolving (it is in its second version currently) and there are challenges to its adoption.</p><p>\"It is true that there (is) a lot of PoCs (proof of concept) in different industries, but nothing is moving beyond that stage into production,\" he said. The problems, in his view, are industry-specific. \"For instance, Indian banks tried blockchain in trade finance in 2016 and then people never talked about it. There were challenges at the production level in terms of maintaining privacy and confidentiality of data,\" averred Gaurav.</p><p>\"Blockchain is not as evolved as other mature technologies such as the Java programming language or the Oracle database,\" he added. While mature technologies can be easily deployed in any industry, it is a different situation with blockchain, as it \"involves many protocols related to specific industries\".</p><p>At the heart of the issue is that blockchain was designed with a peer-to-peer, cryptocurrency environment in mind. \"Now, what we are doing is taking that blockchain infrastructure and putting business logic on top of it so that it can be used in multiple industries,\" explained Gaurav.</p><p>The challenges of implementing blockchain for enterprises, said Gaurav, include companies' specific requirements, different data standards and the nascent nature of the technology. For instance, while the banks want to have the benefits of transparency, security and audit trail offered by blockchain, they \"do not want their competitors to see their data\" (something that blockchain allows in its current form). \"So they want to control certain things,\" he said.</p><p>To address this, Auxesis, on its part, has created a basic blockchain fabric, Auxledger. \"For each industry, we study its regulatory needs, its business processes and its data standards to build a (software) plug-in for that industry,\" he added. Using that plug-in, that particular industry can implement blockchain smoothly. Thus far, Auxesis has developed two plug-ins: one for identity management for the government sector and another for the financial industry.</p><p>A blockchain network must follow certain protocols. For instance, the consensus protocol by which a certain proportion of participants in the whole blockchain must agree to the modifications made to the contracts (called smart contracts, as they execute automatically) for those modifications to become functional.</p><p>\"For example, in the Ethereum smart contracts, a contract must be executed by every party in the network. This vision was against having private contracts. But in a banking scenario, you have to have private contracts,\" said Gaurav. The idea of having private contracts in a blockchain is also referred to as a \"permissioned blockchain\". In January this year for instance, Bajaj Electricals Ltd put in place such a permissioned blockchain to pay its suppliers.</p><p>Gaurav said that there are blockchain frameworks such as R3 Corda that can take care of confidential data so that all the transactions of the participants in a private blockchain are not visible to each other.</p><p>The growing capabilities of blockchain and efforts of firms such as Auxesis and Cateina Technologies Pvt. Ltd (which worked on Bajaj Electricals blockchain) are making organizations open up to experimenting with blockchain.</p><p>Talking about his current projects, Gaurav said that Auxesis has partnered with two state governments for implementing the Auxledger identity management software that is \"layered on Aadhaar\": \"We have onboarded 53 million identities on our platform. Using blockchain, the identity data of people can be made even more secure so that others cannot easily access it. This can be done through layered access rights and encryption. The identity management plug-in can also update any changes made to Aadhaar.\"</p><p>Further, as a pilot, Auxesis is working on a direct benefit programme for one of the two state governments. \"It is an end-to-end project which involves writing business logic, capturing data and making the data immutable, sending out communication alerts, etc.,\" said Gaurav, declining to name the state.</p><p>Another PoC developed by Auxesis for a pharma firm involved the use of humidity and temperature sensors on transport vehicles carrying heat-sensitive drugs that could spoil during distribution.</p><p>\"To detect this, we used the sensors connected to a microcontroller, which is a part of the blockchain network. So if the temperature varies from the required range by a certain amount for, say, more than 10 minutes, a smart contract gets executed in the blockchain and the involved parties to the contract get notified,\" he explained. The benefit of using blockchain combined with sensors (which would typically be part of an internet of things network maintained by another firm) is that if the goods are spoiled, it is easy to find out who is responsible and settle the claim with the party that should bear the cost.</p><p>Not everyone is convinced that blockchain will revolutionize businesses anytime soon. In an article titled The truth about blockchain, Harvard Business School professors Marco Iansiti and Karim Lakhani noted, \"... Our experience studying technological innovation tells us that if there's to be a blockchain revolution, many barriers-technological, governance, organizational, and even societal-will have to fall. It would be a mistake to rush headlong into blockchain innovation without understanding how it is likely to take hold.\"</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from MINT.

Ninety years ago, Henry Ford envisioned an experimental one-seat airplane called the sky flivver, only to abandon the project when one of the first prototypes crashed, killing the pilot. In the 1950s, the U.S. Army commissioned the development of \"flying jeeps\" with private-sector partners like Chrysler. The project never amounted to much. Today, flying cars figure most prominently not in urban skylines, but in venture-capital tag lines, as in Peter Thiel's mott \"We wanted flying cars; instead, we got 140 characters.\" (James Fallows has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2008/05/air-taxi-update-propeller-plane-division/8018/?utm_source=feed\">for many years</url> chronicled the ascendant hopes and stalled realities of air-taxi development around the world.)</p><p><br/>Now tech firms again insist that their Godot is finally coming-but, seriously. At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January, the most buzzed-about product was probably Uber's autonomous air taxi. The ride-hailing company has said that it hopes to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/07/uber-announces-a-big-step-in-its-plan-to-offer-on-demand-air-travel.html\">roll out an air-travel</url> business by 2023. And last week, Boeing       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2019/01/25/boeing-is-one-step-closer-to-electric-air-taxi-successful-passenger-air-vehicle-test-flight/\">debuted</url> a \"personal air vehicle,\" an electric-plane prototype.<br/>\"Global transit is going 3-D in the next 10 years,\" Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week, on a panel with the chief executives from Uber and UPS. \"Advanced propulsion, low-orbit travel, space tourism,\" he went on, listing a variety of forthcoming airborne technology: \"We know how to do this.\" Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi agreed that urban transportation is at an inflection point-from cars and trains to drones and planes. \"We want to make the city three-dimensional,\" Khosrowshahi said, echoing a theme.<br/>[      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/05/when-cars-fly/476382/?utm_source=feed\">Read: When cars fly</url>]<br/>But flying cars, air taxis, or to employ the industry term, \"vertical takeoff and landing technology,\" have their share of doubters. Elon Musk, who typically serves as Big Tech's mascot of industrial optimism,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.inc.com/thompson-wall/why-elon-musk-says-flying-cars-will-never-happen.html\">has said</url> that flying-car dreams have a \"fundamental flaw\": They'll always be too inconvenient for urban commuters to rely on for daily transportation. (Musk has founded at least two transportation companies, but they're focused on digging urban tunnels and rocketing to Mars.)<br/>Cities aren't about to let hastily trained pilots commandeer thousand-pound machines and human passengers. The alternative, which is to let autonomous pilots commandeer thousand-pound machines and human passengers, is no more likely. If the world has learned one thing about autonomous technology in the past decade, it's this: Autonomy is hard. It's really, really hard. Even self-driving advocates admit that in 2018, the hype around driverless cars came       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/12/uber-tesla-and-waymo-all-struggled-with-self-driving-in-2018/\">\"crashing down.\"</url> And speaking of crashing down, the consequences of a self-driving error for an air taxi would be calamitous: a machine the size of a small car hurtling hundreds of feet per second toward a skyscraper, house, or crowded intersection.<br/>\"I think the idea of air taxis is kind of bullshit,\" Carlo Ratti, an architect and urban theorist who serves as director of the Senseable City Lab at MIT, told me. \"Technology can change many things, but it cannot change physics. Helicopters are loud and expensive and, for most forms of transportation, inconvenient.\" As near-silent electric and hybrid cars take over the road, the sound of a fleet of flying vehicles buzzing overhead will be even more obvious.<br/>[      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/04/ubers-pr-nightmare-a-field-guide/523269/?utm_source=feed\">Read: Uber did what!?</url>]<br/>To address this noise problem, companies such as Boeing, Airbus, and Uber are plowing billions of dollars into technologies such as electric propulsion, which could be quieter and more reliable than a combustion engine. But building a fleet of electric-powered aircraft that shuttle passengers hundreds of miles between charges would require       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.com/story/four-reasons-we-dont-have-flying-cars-yet/\">heroic advances in battery-energy density</url>.<br/>The chief executives at Davos acknowledged these challenges-and identified others. What kind of city infrastructure would be necessary for autonomous flying machines to take off and land (and charge) within the city? Why would dense, expensive cities like San Francisco approve the construction of dozens of vertical platforms if simply building sufficient apartment buildings is already difficult? How would companies like Boeing achieve the economies of scale required to efficiently manufacture tens of thousands, if not millions, of air taxis without clear signals of consumer demand and city regulatory approval? Good questions.<br/>Several years ago, technologists and transportation companies insisted that self-driving cars would be significant parts of the urban landscape       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/02/self-driving-car-elon-musk-tech-predictions-tesla-google\">by the early 2020s</url>. That hope is proving illusory. But instead of accepting defeat, the mobility-tech world is shifting its laser beam of optimism from self-driving Earth taxis to self-driving air taxis.<br/>[      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/09/how-self-driving-cars-could-ruin-the-american-city/569518/?utm_source=feed\">Read: How self-driving cars could ruin the American city</url>]<br/>\"The last 30 to 40 years in technology have been about digitizing the physical world,\" Ratti said. \"Experimentation has been easy for tech, because in the digital space, you can test and test infinitely. But the next 30 years will be about building technology that bridges the digital and the physical worlds. It's a much harder challenge.\"<br/>If flying cars have a near-term future, it's probably not urban. Rural areas-where commutes are long and interruptive skyscrapers are scarce-are the more likely initial setting for airborne technology. Once drones and flying cars prove out in Idaho, perhaps they will migrate to Manhattan. Or not. Flying cars might ultimately be the rare Davos dream that actually makes more sense for a small town like Davos than it does for the major cities its attendees represent.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ATLNOL-willweeverhaveflyingcars581473</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ATLNOL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V9V-YG01-DYY9-J00N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414070</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"933\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc.

Ninety years ago, Henry Ford envisioned an experimental one-seat airplane called the sky flivver, only to abandon the project when one of the first prototypes crashed, killing the pilot. In the 1950s, the US Army commissioned the development of 'flying jeeps' with private-sector partners like Chrysler. The project never amounted to much.  </p><p><br/>Today, flying cars figure most prominently not in urban skylines, but in venture-capital tag lines, as in Peter Thiel's motto: \"We wanted flying cars; instead, we got 140 characters.\" (James Fallows has for many years chronicled the ascendant hopes and stalled realities of air-taxi development around the world.) Now tech firms again insist that their Godot is finally coming\u2014but, seriously. At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January, the most buzzed-about product was probably Uber's autonomous air taxi. The ride-hailing company has said that it hopes to roll out an air-travel business by 2023. And last week, Boeing debuted a \"personal air vehicle,\" an electric-plane prototype. <br/>\"Global transit is going 3-D in the next 10 years,\" Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week, on a panel with the chief executives from Uber and UPS. \"Advanced propulsion, low-orbit travel, space tourism,\" he went on, listing a variety of forthcoming airborne technology: \"We know how to do this.\" Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahiagreed that urban transportation is at an inflection point\u2014from cars and trains to drones and planes. \"We want to make the city three-dimensional,\" Khosrowshahi said, echoing a theme. <br/>But flying cars, air taxis, or to employ the industry term, \"vertical takeoff and landing technology,\" have their share of doubters. Elon Musk, who typically serves as Big Tech's mascot of industrial optimism, has said that flying-car dreams have a \"fundamental flaw\": They'll always be too inconvenient for urban commuters to rely on for daily transportation. (Musk has founded at least two transportation companies, but they're focused on digging urban tunnels and rocketing to Mars.) Cities aren't about to let hastily trained pilots commandeer thousand-pound machines and human passengers. The alternative, which is to let autonomous pilots commandeer thousand-pound machines and human passengers, is no more likely.<br/><br/>If the world has learned one thing about autonomous technology in the past decade, it's this: Autonomy is hard. It's really, really hard. Even self-driving advocates admit that in 2018, the hype around driverless cars came \"crashing down.\" And speaking of crashing down, the consequences of a self-driving error for an air taxi would be calamitous: a machine the size of a small car hurtling hundreds of feet per second toward a skyscraper, house, or crowded intersection. <br/>\"I think the idea of air taxis is kind of bullshit,\" Carlo Ratti, an architect and urban theorist who serves as director of the Senseable City Lab at MIT, told me. \"Technology can change many things, but it cannot change physics. Helicopters are loud and expensive and, for most forms of transportation, inconvenient.\" As near-silent electric and hybrid cars take over the road, the sound of a fleet of flying vehicles buzzing overhead will be even more obvious. <br/>To address this noise problem, companies such as Boeing, Airbus, and Uber are plowing billions of dollars into technologies such as electric propulsion, which could be quieter and more reliable than a combustion engine. But building a fleet of electric-powered aircraft that shuttle passengers hundreds of miles between charges would require heroic advances in battery-energy density. <br/>The chief executives at Davos acknowledged these challenges\u2014and identified others. What kind of city infrastructure would be necessary for autonomous flying machines to take off and land (and charge) within the city? Why would dense, expensive cities like San Francisco approve the construction of dozens of vertical platforms if simply building sufficient apartment buildings is already difficult? How would companies like Boeing achieve the economies of scale required to efficiently manufacture tens of thousands, if not millions, of air taxis without clear signals of consumer demand and city regulatory approval? Good questions. <br/>Several years ago, technologists and transportation companies insisted that self-driving cars would be significant parts of the urban landscape by the early 2020s. That hope is proving illusory.  <br/>\"The last 30 to 40 years in technology have been about digitising the physical world,\" Ratti said. \"Experimentation has been easy for tech, because in the digital space, you can test and test infinitely. But the next 30 years will be about building technology that bridges the digital and the physical worlds. It's a much harder challenge.\" If flying cars have a near-term future, it's probably not urban. Rural areas\u2014where commutes are long and interruptive skyscrapers are scarce\u2014are the more likely initial setting for airborne technology. Once drones and flying cars prove out in Idaho, perhaps they will migrate to Manhattan. Or not. Flying cars might ultimately be the rare Davos dream that actually makes more sense for a small town like Davos than it does for the major cities its attendees represent.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">QATART-136799052</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">QATART2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VBW-1BV1-F11P-X3XF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">357157</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"892\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Qatar Tribune.

He is currently a contributing editor of the magazine. Andrew discusses the launch of National Review's new section called 'Capital Matters,' which defends free markets.

Save it to your desktop, read it on your tablet, or email to your colleagues. Q2 2020 hedge fund letters, conferences and more[2]Can you tell us about your background?I am British born, but I moved to the US nearly thirty years ago. I began my career working as an attorney in London in the early 1980s, but I switched over to investment banking a year or two later and continued to work in various sectors of finance until March of this year. Meanwhile, I started a 'second' career in freelance journalism at the beginning of the 1990s, and have been writing on a varied range of topics from history to culture to politics[3] and the economy for a number of publications, including, of course, National Review: I wrote my first piece for NR in 1992.It is often reported that one of Berkshire Hathway's first subsidiaries was See's Candies. This is not the case. See's was one of the first businesses Warren Buffett and his right-hand man, Charlie Munger, acquired, but it was not through Berkshire. Berkshire's oldest operating subsidiary is National Indemnity Company, an insurance company based in Omaha, Read More[4]   What inspired you to start this new section?Well, it wasn't only me. This was very much a collaborative effort, involving several people at National Review Institute and National Review. For me, the starting point was, years ago, during the financial crisis[5], when I realized that beyond those who worked in the financial sector, there was relatively little understanding of some of what was going so badly wrong\u2014and what its significance was. What did it mean, for example, that the commercial paper market had dried up\u2014and why did it matter? Thinking on from that, I came to believe that, generally speaking, there was not enough understanding of how free markets worked. Plenty of people were well aware of what, given the chance, free markets can do, but not enough truly understood how they did it, something that left the market economy vulnerable to lines of intellectual and political attack that were\u2014how to put it\u2014not always based on logic or on fact.National Review does cover economics, so why another entity for this purpose?We have always covered economics[6], and, I believe, very well. Nevertheless, we would like to build and expand on that, with broader coverage and more writers. We also think that there is some advantage in having one 'go to place' on National Review's website where people\u2014whether regular NR readers or people looking for coverage of finance, economics and business from a rightish (or, at least, non-leftish) perspective can visit\u2014and hopefully find something that is of interest to them. I hope too that this space will act as a place where strong writers who have plenty to say, but lack a large enough platform, will feel that they can come to make their voices heard.It seems that economic liberalism is the order of the day, do you feel it's under attack?If by economic liberalism, you mean classical free market liberalism, I must disagree. I don't think it's the order of the day. On the contrary, it is under attack and on the retreat. To be sure, it's under attack from the Left\u2014that's what the Left does\u2014but you have also seen some of the classic characteristics of free markets, such as free trade, come under fire from the right. Meanwhile, the Business Roundtable, supported by the CEOs of many major corporations, has called for the adoption of 'stakeholder capitalism', the notion that a company's primary function is not to work for its shareholders\u2014its owners\u2014but that instead it must labor in the interests of 'stakeholders[7]', selected by, well it's not clear who. Meanwhile, asset managers are espousing the idea of 'socially responsible' (their phrase, not mine) investment under which their investment objectives now include not only making money for their clients, but also the pursuit of a social and political agenda.Industries such as healthcare and tech have become incredibly concentrated, is your approach to just hope the free market will solve these problems?Precedent would suggest that in most cases it will. Tech champions come and go. Do you remember Netscape or Myspace? There is a temptation to think that today's dominant players will be tomorrow's dominant players. But in a market economy, leaders rise and fall: Sears one day, Walmart another, and Amazon another. Where matters become more complicated is where legal or regulatory structures either embed or enforce concentration or distort the market in such a way that efficiency and competition are hobbled. That, I suspect, is what you have been seeing in healthcare[8], a 'good', arguably, like no other, where entrenched interests, regulatory overreach and many other non-market related factors have muddled the well-intentioned effort to ensure wide access to affordable, first-rate treatment.One reason many think that young people have been drawn to socialism is because of some of the problems mentioned to earlier. Many cannot afford healthcare - wouldn't small reforms like breaking up big tech giants be the best way to keep capitalism \"solvent\"?The reasons that young people have been drawn to socialism\u2014or what they imagine to be socialism\u2014are complicated, and we could talk about them for a long time. I think that the issues you mention have relatively little to do with it, although the failings in the health care system, which are not failings of the free market, have clearly contributed to their discontent. I would rather look elsewhere, to the education system, to entertainment media, where the default mode almost always seems set somewhere to the left. And then there is another problem, which will get worse, that of the underemployment created by automation. How you deal with that, I don't know, but breaking up today's tech giants is not the answer.This is also an issue with trade but there national security also gets involved. If China is making supplies for our weapons, doesn't that indicate we have a big problem with industrial policy?You raise a good point. We live in the real world, not in an economic model. And in the real world, we face, as a country, some major strategic challenges, most notably, perhaps from China. A trading relationship must be looked at with clear eyes, and that has not always been the case with China[9], where the combination of opportunity, free market fundamentalism and, yes, naivete meant that we got in too deep. That must change, particularly where strategically vital industries are concerned. And as we have discovered during this pandemic, there are more of those than we thought.Final thoughts?Free markets ought to be their own best justification, but, sadly, their deeds are not enough. Their defense needs words too, and we want to be out there making the case, a case that is not necessarily framed politically, although at times it certainly will be, but will often be a matter of explanation. This is how free markets work. This is what they deliver. And if you give them the chance, they can deliver even more.

No matter this business model's advantages to the tech industry, one thing is clear; there is no excuse for exploiting children through such practices.\"</p><p>\"When a game is designed for kids, game developers shouldn't be allowed to monetise addiction. And when kids play games for adults, they should be walled off from compulsive micro transactions. Game developers who knowingly exploit children should face legal consequences\"</p><p>The statement comes with overzealous rhetoric and has a whiff of a headline-grabbing publicity stunt, particularly given that Hawley has built a reputation on criticising big tech companies such as Facebook and Google. But it is hard to argue that video game publishers have not left themselves open to this kind of government intervention by letting loot boxes and microtransactions run rampant.</p><p>Self-regulation has apparently not worked and now the US government has decided it needs to step in. And the underlying principle is sound enough. Hawley's legislation is targeting loot boxes, digital packages with mystery items that can be paid for and many argue constitute gambling, and 'pay-to-win' microtransactions which can send players into a loop of paying to progress in a game.</p><p>Hawley singles out Activision's popular puzzler Candy Crush, citing its $149.99 'Luscious Bundle' as a particularly egregious example. Activision make $2bn a year from Candy Crush microtransactions, while paid 'loot boxes' in games such as EA's FIFA Ultimate Team form the bedrock of publisher profits in this age of spiralling development costs and long-running 'service' games.</p><p>In theory, there will be few game players that will actively mourn the loss of loot boxes. In many cases gamemakers have recently begun a kind of reverse-publicity with the practice, announcing the lack of loot boxes or microtransactions in a game as you would a back-of-the-box feature. Unfortunately for them, while steps are being made to scale back to avoid further scrutiny, the genie is already out of the bottle.</p><p>Many countries, including the UK, have so far said that loot boxes do not constitute gambling, but it remains an ongoing issue. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gaming/news/fortnite-removes-blind-loot-boxes-amid-fears-encourage-young/\">Regulators in Belgium have classified them as such, leading to the ban of the practice in the country</url> . In the US this debate has been rumbling in the US for nearly two years after other senators targeted EA's       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gaming/news/fortnite-removes-blind-loot-boxes-amid-fears-encourage-young/\">Star Wars Battlefront 2</url>, with the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gaming/news/fortnite-removes-blind-loot-boxes-amid-fears-encourage-young/\">Federal Trade Commission promising an investigation into the issue</url> . It could well be one of the rare, truly bipartisan issues that reaches the US senate.</p><p>Video game trade body the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) said: \"Numerous countries including Ireland, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, determined that loot boxes do not constitute gambling. We look forward to sharing with the senator the tools and information the industry already provides that keep control of in-game spending in parents' hands. Parents already have the ability to limit or prohibit in-game purchases with easy to use parental controls.\"</p><p>The ESA and the UK's own trade body UKIE have long argued against classifying loot boxes as gambling. Not, I suspect, because they have any great love for the practice, but because they are concerned about clumsy government intervention in the industry at large.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gaming/news/fortnite-removes-blind-loot-boxes-amid-fears-encourage-young/\">Loot boxes explained</url></p><p>And they are right to be. While loot boxes are an easy and righteous target, even the initial wording of Hawley's proposal is setting off alarm bells that suggest ill-educated regulation. Broadly, 'The Protecting Children From Abusive Games Act' would propose to ban 'loot boxes and pay-to-win microtransactions in games played by minors'.</p><p>But almost every word of that is open to interpretation; what games are intended for minors (the bill will not be attached to ESRB age ratings) and what constitutes both loot boxes and microtransactions that are 'pay-to-win'? It is a tremendously complex issue that has been debated within the industry for years. And one that is unlikely to be solved by a US senator wading in with a clumsy, publicity-hungry proposal.</p><p>Even if this bill falls down, which is by no means guaranteed, this feels like the beginning for further government intervention. If this bill fails, another is likely to take its place, which could open up further regulation on the industry beyond these gimme issues. And not just in the US, with politicians in the UK calling for more scrutiny on the games industry at large.</p><p>Which would be a shame, in principle. The thriving, exciting games industry would be better served with self-regulation rather than meddling from bodies that have shown little desire to understand the medium. But extraordinary profits and hubris have blinded many to the genuine concerns and has seen them lose control. It may be too late for the industry to wrest it back.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-53087518</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W2R-YPP1-JCJY-G3J5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"879\"/><timeReceived>11:07 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 9, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

But increasingly, it seems to have taken on yet another stereotype - as a nation of Luddites.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And truth be told, Germany is not a great place to be a big tech company these days. G\u00fcnther H. Oettinger, a German official and the European Union's incoming commissioner for digital economy and society, has assailed Googlefor having too big a presence in Europe, and speaks of ''cuts'' in the company's market power. In Berlin, Sigmar Gabriel, the vice chancellor and economics minister, is investigating whether Germany can classify Googleas a vital part of the country's infrastructure, and thus make it subject to heavy state regulation.</p><p>Googleis often spoken of in dark terms around cafes and biergartens. People regularly call it the Octopus. Even a figure as dominant in the global economy as Mathias D\u00f6pfner, the chief executive of Springer, Germany's largest publishing house, said he was ''afraid of Google.''</p><p>Googleisn't the only target of Teutonic ire. A few weeks ago, a German court prohibited Uber from operating in the country, reasoning that the company was violating federal licensing laws for professional drivers. And Amazon is entangled in a long and wearying battle over working conditions and pay with Verdi, one of Germany's most powerful unions.</p><p>To outsiders, this all seems like just another instance of collective German angst. In this view, Germany is the neurotic bystander of the digital revolution, shaken to the bone by its fear of everything new and its distrust of everything American, a secretive society still traumatized by its Stasi history, overestimating the importance of data privacy.</p><p>But this caricature misses the point. Germans don't fear technology. Nor do we dislike America. On the contrary: Whenever Apple debuts a new product, our media go bananas and people line up in front of Apple's flagship stores. Most Germans use Googleand Facebook on a daily basis, without ever getting sweaty hands when typing in a search term or answering a friendship request.</p><p>In politics, Silicon Valley is a magic phrase. It's what Berlin wants to be. It's where our representatives and business leaders go when they want to look really cool or snoop around for ideas. Speaking at a rollout for a new book on Silicon Valley, Mr. Gabriel's eyes turned dreamy when he told the audience how he strolled the streets of Palo Alto on his first visit there in the late '90s, looking around for the Hewlett-Packard garage, feeling the magic of innovation in the air.</p><p>What gives? How can Germany be both afraid of and in love with technology, and the companies that make it? The key is to look beyond those things, to the corporate model they represent.</p><p>The true origin of the conflict lies in the economic culture innate to those former Silicon Valley start-ups - now giants - that are taking the European markets by storm. To create and grow an enterprise like Amazon or Uber takes a certain libertarian cowboy mind-set that ignores obstacles and rules.</p><p>Silicon Valley fears neither fines nor political reprimand. It invests millions in lobbying in Brussels and Berlin, but since it finds the democratic political process too slow, it keeps following its own rules in the meantime. Uber simply declared that it would keep operating in Germany, no matter what the courts ruled. Amazon is pushing German publishers to offer their books on its platform at a lower price - ignoring that, in Germany, publishers are legally required to offer their books at the same price everywhere.</p><p>It is this anarchical spirit that makes Germans so neurotic. On one hand, we'd love to be more like that: more daring, more aggressive. On the other hand, the force of anarchy makes Germans (and many other Europeans) shudder, and rightfully so. It's a challenge to our deeply ingrained faith in the state.</p><p>The German voter-consumer will always trust the state more than he will any private company, no matter how ardently it insists on being a good guy. Trust in ''the state'' is hard to measure; polls vary greatly depending on the current government's performance and personnel, among other factors. However, Germans regularly report much higher levels of trust in the leading state institutions - the federal legislature, the courts and the police - than Americans do.</p><p>No major party, right or left, calls for shrinking the size of the state; the only party to do so, the Liberal Democrats, is too small to have a seat in the Bundestag, and is fighting for its life in state-level elections. Unlike in America, where trust in the state tends to dip during hard times, in Germany it rises. When problems appear, we look to ''Vater Staat'' - the Father State - to protect us.</p><p>That includes challenges by ''disruptive'' business models, like those coming out of Silicon Valley. Indeed, the reason politicians like Mr. Gabriel - who has said ''we must tame Silicon Valley capitalism''- go after Amazon and Uber is that it is a surefire way to get votes. Even politicians who are normally pro-deregulation, like Mr. Oettinger, know it's smart to come down hard on tech companies.</p><p>If it wants to succeed here, Silicon Valley needs to comply with the particularities of the German and European market. We love technology, but we want it delivered on our terms. In Germany, cowboys should remain in the movies.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-1846877</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5DBX-FS01-JC85-N4W9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"918\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>International New York Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"10\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>October 11, 2014 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0002KLJ</classCode><className>HP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

At Goldman Sachs, Chief Technology Officer Atte Lahtiranta says the crisis is highlighting why the financial industry will challenge big tech's dominance on innovation. \"We are going to be adopting new technology, not as a fast follower but in many cases as a leader,\" he said in a video posted to the Wall Street giant's website. Follow all of Business Insider's latest updates on the coronavirushere[1]. Click here for more BI Prime stories[2]. While the coronavirus pandemic is taking a wallop to IT budgets[3], there is growing evidence[4] that the outbreak could actually accelerate investments[5] in new digital tools. </p><p>That's the case at Goldman Sachs, where the outbreak is proving, according to Chief Technology Officer Atte Lahtiranta, why the financial industry writ large will challenge the dominance of technology giants in leading the way on innovation. One example he cited as a potential future disruption: a virtual reality-based trading desk. \"This is only going to go faster,\" Lahtiranta said in a video posted on Goldman Sachs' website[6]. \"We are going to be adopting new technology, not as a fast follower but in many cases as a leader.\" Goldman Sachs has been quick to embrace new technology[7], but still lags behind consumer banking rivals[8] like JPMorgan Chase. It recently announced a new partnership with SAP[9], for example, to facilitate cross-border payments on the German software giant's online marketplace[10]. Lahtiranta joined the Wall Street behemoth from Verizon's media group just five months ago. Among his major goals for the company is closer coordination with the developer community. \"I don't think the financial industry has yet focused as much on the developer's world as where I'm coming from,\" he previously told Business Insider[11]. \"You need to have great documentation for onboarding, keep the developers happy, and make them use your services, and hopefully create some value exchange.\" But as a relatively new executive, Lahtiranta said in the video that he has had the challenge of quickly pivoting Goldman's workforce of roughly 38,000 employees to remote work \u2014 a task that undermined many of Lahtiranta's assumptions about what working in the financial industry was like. \"Every moment, every evening I am like, 'What did I sign up for?' I thought that it was a more constant-paced, more regulated environment,\" he said. \"I did not understand how fast we can go as an industry, how fast we can adopt.\" Lahtiranta said the company was well positioned to navigate the challenge because of its \"very good technology base.\" Goldman Sachs, for example, already had its own remote desktop system and had been using Symphony, an instant messaging system designed for the financial industry. Alongside those existing resources, the company has introduced Zoom to all its employees and coached workers to stay as productive in their homes as they had been on the bustling trading floors. \"It's been a massive undertaking,\" he said.NOW WATCH: Taylor Swift is the world's highest-paid celebrity.

But perhaps the greatest risk to the sector\u2019s outperformance stems not from its scale alone, but from the prospect of an economic recovery.</p><p>The sector has of course provided a major boost to investors lucky or clever enough to have jumped in earlier this year.</p><p>Concerns of a swelling bubble were common over the summer, as the world growth-to-value equities ratio, or the ratio of the Nasdaq 100 to the Russell 2000, showed strong similarities to the period preceding the dotcom crash. </p><p>Household names from the technology sector make up almost a quarter of the value of the entire S&amp;P 500 index, and about half of the Nasdaq 100. And the big names have done some heavy lifting. Yes, they have pulled back sharply of late, with the Nasdaq 100 index shedding all of its August melt-up. Still, without Big Tech, the S&amp;P 500 would still be down 6 per cent so far this year, not flat.</p><p>But should size alone make investors nervous? History suggests not. According to a research paper by\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2900447\"> Hendrik Bessembinder at Arizona State University</url>, since 1926, the best-performing 4 per cent of listed companies have driven the net gain of the entire US stock market.</p><p>Sky-high valuations do make a good deal of sense. These companies\u2019 business models and the gradual digitalisation of our daily lives have contributed to their success. The accumulation of cash on their balance sheets over the years has allowed them to buy back shares; in the second quarter, tech companies accounted for 47 per cent of gross S&amp;P 500 buybacks, and their outstanding earnings margins have supported their strong share price growth. And this comes at a time when the divergence between strong and weak balance sheets has never been more critical. </p><p>Covid-19 lockdowns across the globe have accelerated structural trends such as working from home and ecommerce. Ever-lower interest rates on top of $16tn in negative-yielding sovereign and investment-grade debt in the system have made the equity complex a much more attractive asset class, while the lower discount rate has pushed valuations higher. </p><p>What is more, investors face a lack of choice when looking for pockets of portfolio protection, and 10-year Treasury yields stuck at 0.5 to 0.7 per cent no longer look attractive for this purpose. This explains how US tech has led the equity market recovery since March 23, a move certainly accelerated by retail flows, momentum playing and FOMO \u2014 the fear of missing out.</p><p>For as long as markets remain nervous, Big Tech is likely to remain in favour. The chance of a disputed or delayed US election outcome continues to favour growth assets and defensive segments of the global equity market. </p><p>So what could bring Big Tech back down to earth? Investors should watch out for the economic outlook and regulation.</p><p>Perhaps ironically, the biggest threat may come from a rosier economic picture. In our view, if we get a vaccine that shows signs of being effective, some normalisation of global economic growth would probably push market participants to look for the start of a new mini-cycle. This could lead to a rotation and trigger a diversification out of Big Tech towards the most cyclical parts of the equity complex. </p><p>In that scenario, we believe the S&amp;P 400 MidCap index, as well as eurozone and emerging-market equities, would benefit. Old Tech would also probably outperform New Tech.</p><p>In addition, enhanced regulatory scrutiny and politicians looking to raise taxes would not help. We do not see these as potential triggers for underperformance, but they could mar the strong risk-adjusted returns track record for these Big Tech companies.</p><p>The likelihood of more politicians including tech on their agenda in this election year is also increasing, which could lead to greater antitrust scrutiny. Since the 1960s, US regulators have widely attempted to preserve \u201cconsumer welfare\u201d, which has meant focusing mainly on prices. But a 2017 study by Lina Khan in the Yale Law Journal entitled\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.yalelawjournal.org/pdf/e.710.Khan.805_zuvfyyeh.pdf\"> \u201cAmazon\u2019s Antitrust Paradox\u201d</url>\u00a0led to a shift in thinking, with greater emphasis on data privacy, the welfare of workers and the impact of the online retailing giant on its competitors.</p><p>Meanwhile, major economies, through the OECD, are working on proposals that could change the international taxation landscape. In January 2019, 129 countries, including the US, agreed in principle to a digital tax under the aegis of the OECD/G20 base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) initiative. Under this proposal, the digital taxation problem is expected to be addressed by the end of this year.</p><p>This all means that while fears of the Big Tech rally collapsing under its own weight are likely to be misplaced, the sector still has vulnerabilities. Those investors optimistic on the prospect of a coronavirus breakthrough might want to look elsewhere.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The writer is a cross-asset strategist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale CIB</emphasis></p><p>\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-488a2210469140c2b25320cf7a8e4a5a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60XD-9S01-DXP9-90S7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"845\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 25, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Civil Procedure</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzUxNjJDMEQ5N0YwNDMzM0JDMjEzM0UzOTYzMzI3OTU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>Do Equity Principle</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDU3REJDMkYxQjJFNEU4RDgzQTA1QTQwQjM5RDQ3RDg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OENDNjZGMThDNzYwNDA3RjhERDREQUJENkIyQkM3Rjk</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Initiative &amp;

This means that in the United States, the pressure to similarly compensate stressed local publishers will be extremely high.</p><p>There are several ways the pressure on Google could be brought to bear. If the US Congress passes the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act, publishers would be allowed to negotiate rates with Google as a group.</p><p>Alternatively, publishers might finally be forced to undertake their own lengthy copyright litigation. In any case, I believe that Google will eventually be required to treat news publishers, like music publishers, as equals.</p><p>We have argued for some time that the big tech platforms should be an answer for journalism, rather than a problem.</p><p>They are the main distributors of news and they benefit greatly from the engagement that comes with it.</p><p>Just think of all of the hundreds of millions of people who went to Google and Facebook over the last few months for information about the coronavirus.</p><p>Google's refusal</p><p>These platforms pay for music and lots of other kinds of content, and last year Facebook even agreed to pay a limited number of publishers for its News Tab. But most local publishers were left out of that deal. And Google has refused to pay them anything.</p><p>A group of French publishers didn't accept that situation and brought a case against Google with the French competition regulator in November.</p><p>On April 9, the regulatory agency decided that Google had abused its tremendous market power by refusing to negotiate.</p><p>This decision is part of a larger, continuing competition investigation into Google. Once again, Europeans have been willing to be the first to address the power of the online platforms.</p><p>Google's market share of search in France was 90 per cent at the end of 2019, and data provided by more than 30 French publishers showed that between 26 per cent and 90 per cent of their referral traffic came through search engines, mainly Google.</p><p>Google likes to claim that referral traffic is a huge benefit to publishers, even though it dominates the digital ad system and captures most of the benefit from that traffic.</p><p>Every country should emulate the French government's resolve to fight for the freedom and future of the news media industry.</p><p>On Sunday, Australia instructed its Competition Commission to develop a mandatory code to address commercial arrangements between digital platforms and the news media.</p><p>This code will deal with data, ranking, news display and \"the monetisation and the sharing of revenue generated from news.\"</p><p>The digital platforms have a choice to make. They can get on the right side of history, quickly negotiate deals and help sustain journalism.</p><p>Or they can fight and delay, while watching huge segments of the local news ecosystem wither in the meantime.</p><p>With Covid-19, which has severely reduced newspaper revenue as advertisers struggle with lockdowns, we are likely to lose hundreds of newspapers in the United States this year.</p><p>If Facebook and Google are the good guys they say they are, they should skip the blood and the blame and jump right to the inevitable, fair conclusion. Pay for news now and help local journalism survive.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Statesman.

The news made headlines in Indonesia, one of its fastest-growing markets with four million BlackBerry users.</p><p>   Then last week, Googleannounced plans to set up three new Asian data centres - in Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan, skipping Indonesia altogether.</p><p>   In response, some Indonesian officials called on the government to take punitive action on the two companies.</p><p>   For their part, both RIM and Google- which are still in talks with the Indonesian authorities - have stressed that they remain committed to Indonesia in the long term.</p><p>   No less than Indonesia Investment Coordinating Board (BKPM) chief Gita Wirjawan, who was closely involved in courting these companies, said of RIM to reporters last month: 'Why build a factory in Malaysia? They are obviously developing it there to sell it in Indonesia, right''</p><p>   Industry Minister M.S. Hidayat was swift to suggest imposing an extra value-added or luxury tax on BlackBerry smartphones so producers such as RIM will choose to invest in Indonesia instead to get around it.</p><p>   This week, Mr Wirjawan asked visiting Canadian Trade Minister Ed Fast to lobby Ontario-based RIM to build a production base in Indonesia.</p><p>   A sympathetic Mr Fast said the decision was for RIM to make, but added: 'I do understand Indonesia's disappointment.'</p><p>   The episode, outcry and all, is emblematic of the ongoing challenge of doing business with and in Indonesia, where the allure of an increasingly affluent consumer base still has to be weighed against a woefully inadequate physical and legal infrastructure.</p><p>   They include an unreliable power supply, bad roads, excessive red tape and slow Internet speeds - which affect the country's attempt to draw tech players and get more of its 240 million citizens online. Only one in six is an Internet user.</p><p>   The government is taking some steps: This week, it disbursed 290 billion rupiah (S$42.4 million) to improve roads in the greater Jakarta area.</p><p>   With each new snub, pressure from officials to get tough on investors who pass on Indonesia has been mounting. </p><p>   Some Indonesians have also called on the government to fix shortcomings.</p><p>   Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Kadin) chairman Suryo B. Sulisto said: 'RIM's decision to locate in Malaysia rather than Indonesia is a clear indicator that our business environment is still not competitive.</p><p>   'Our government should be taking a long, hard look at our regulatory environment to make it less bureaucratic.'</p><p>   Mr Aulia Masna, who writes for the technology blog Daily Social, called for greater transparency and legal certainty.</p><p>   He told The Straits Times: 'The government desperately needs to be much more transparent and open about technology companies coming in to the country and sort out the technology and e-commerce Bill that is currently being discussed in Parliament.'</p><p>   'Unfortunately, the government does not seem to understand how the technology works or if it does, it is working really hard to ensure that the freedom that technology offers does not end up being used to undermine its authority,' he said.</p><p>   Officials have come under criticism for making what some see as unreasonable demands of big-name companies as a condition for expanding operations.</p><p>   For example, they have asked RIM to set up a data centre in Indonesia, to allow law enforcement officials to intercept its encrypted BlackBerry Messenger services and to filter pornographic content. </p><p>RIM has fulfilled the last requirement since January, and is in talks on the other areas. But it is maintaining a diplomatic silence on contentious issues.</p><p>   A RIM spokesman told The Straits Times this week that the company remained fully committed to Indonesia, 'where we enjoy strong partnerships and tremendous positive enthusiasm for our BlackBerry products'. She added: 'Like other smartphone providers, we plan our manufacturing on a global basis.'</p><p>Googlehas also been asked to set up a data centre in Indonesia, in spite of concerns about the reliability of electricity supply, and continues to express interest in opening an office in the country.</p><p>   Its chairman, Mr Eric Schmidt, was in Indonesia in July and met Vice-President Boediono.</p><p>   Some analysts say the Indonesian government needs to get its act together.</p><p>   'We can't expect RIM, Googleand other big tech companies to have local operations if we cannot give them mutual benefit,' said Mr Muhammad Ilman Akbar, who writes for Asian technology site Penn Olson.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:zakirh@sph.com.sg\">zakirh@sph.com.sg</email></emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-720699</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2011</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:53YS-V021-DYX4-030R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"828\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2011 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Straits Times (Singapore)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"10\" year=\"2011\"><dateText>October 7, 2011 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0001W7E</classCode><className>BLACKBERRY LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0008EIE</classCode><className>COMMERCE &amp;

There were reports that employees were unhappy about these alleged plans of entering China. However, Google CEO Sundar Pichai has now clarified that the company has no plans of relaunching in China. In an interview given to CNN, Pichai said that Google is not working on a Chinese search engine. He said in the interview, \"There are no plans for us to consider relaunching our service in China.\"</p><p><br/>  He further said that if Google had to relaunch its services in China, it would need \"the right conditions.\" One of the most \"important condition\" would be censorship-free internet. However, he refused to give further details and said, \"I don't want to speculate on a hypothetical situation. We have no plans. And, you know, we are not spending time on it,\" Pichai told CNN.<br/>  Further asked about China, Pichai said that Google has limited presence in China and is doing some work that includes \"limited AI\" and some \"non-profit work.\"<br/>Google had come in for criticism about how its work in China was benefitting the country's military. However, Pichai said that they've had \"good conversations\" over the controversy and the misunderstandings have been cleared.<br/>  Meanwhile there have been talks about breaking up \"Big Tech\" and how regulation is needed to scrutinize what companies like Google, Facebook, Apple and others do.

There were reports that employees were unhappy about these alleged plans of entering China. However, Google CEO Sundar Pichai has now clarified that the company has no plans of relaunching in China. </p><p>In an interview given to CNN, Pichai said that Google is not working on a Chinese search engine. He said in the interview, \"There are no plans for us to consider relaunching our service in China.\"He further said that if Google had to relaunch its services in China, it would need \"the right conditions.\" One of the most \"important condition\" would be censorship-free internet. However, he refused to give further details and said, \"I don't want to speculate on a hypothetical situation. We have no plans. And, you know, we are not spending time on it,\" Pichai told CNN. Further asked about China, Pichai said that Google has limited presence in China and is doing some work that includes \"limited AI\" and some \"non-profit work.\"Google had come in for criticism about how its work in China was benefitting the country's military. However, Pichai said that they've had \"good conversations\" over the controversy and the misunderstandings have been cleared. Meanwhile there have been talks about breaking up \"Big Tech\" and how regulation is needed to scrutinize what companies like Google, Facebook, Apple and others do. Pichai, however, believes that regulating just for the sake of it won't yield any benefits. He said in the same interview to CNN, \"I worry that if you regulate for the sake of regulating it, it has a lot of unintended consequences. You know, if you take a technology like artificial intelligence, it will have implications for our national security and ... other important areas of society.\" For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TOI-69818822</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TOI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WC4-C101-DXJR-H1RX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">362639</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"308\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.

For the sake of investors, it may want to try out a new slogan: \"Don't be boring.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Google parent company Alphabet has become one of the most boring Big Tech companies on the market, to the detriment of its stock. Alphabet shares are up about 9% this year. That's not awful of course, but the stock is lagging the rest of the so-called FAANG stocks in a major way. </p><p>Facebook is up more than 50% so far in 2019. Apple and Amazon are up about 30% while Netflix is up more than 40%.</p><p>Alphabet has fallen behind the broader market too. The S&amp;P 500 is up about 19% while the Nasdaq has surged nearly 25%. What's more, Alphabet shares are actually down nearly 4% over the past 12 months. </p><p>Why has Alphabet underperformed?</p><p>Is Alphabet \"old\" tech or \"new\" tech?</p><p>Revenue growth has slowed. Concerns about more tech regulation in Washington could also hurt its YouTube unit. </p><p>Many of Alphabet's non-core businesses continue to lose money, leading to worries that the company is a one-trick pony named Search. Its non-core businesses include its so-called Other Bets companies, which include self-driving unit Waymo, life sciences subsidiary Verily and drone delivery service Wing.</p><p>And perhaps the company's biggest problem: It's hard to figure out if Alphabet is still a high growth momentum stock or a mature old tech firm.</p><p>Alphabet's earnings are expected to grow about 14% a year, on average, for the next few years. That's certainly still respectable but it's lower than the projected growth rates of more dynamic companies like Facebook, Amazon and Netflix.</p><p>So it might be time for Alphabet to start paying a dividend like Microsoft, Apple, IBM, Cisco and other tech companies. It clearly can afford to do so. Alphabet ended the first quarter with a whopping $113.5 billion in cash on its balance sheet.</p><p>But the company probably doesn't want to throw in the towel and admit it has nothing better to do with its cash. Facebook, Amazon and Netflix don't pay dividends.</p><p>Alphabet did not have a comment for this article, instead referring CNN Business to the portion of its most recent annual report in which the company reiterated that \"we have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our common or capital stock. We do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\"</p><p>Why Alphabet stock could stage a comeback</p><p>Some of the worries that have held the stock back may be overdone.</p><p>The company's recent push to promote new advertising tools for professional content creators could be good news for Alphabet, said Nomura Instinet analyst Mark Kelley in a report Wednesday.</p><p>Ads on the YouTube channels for big media companies have higher rates and are considered \"brand safe\" for marketers, Kelley argued.</p><p>Alphabet's plans to feature ads on Google's relaunched news feed --- called Discover --- on the Google mobile home page could also be attractive to marketers given that the ads could reach up to about 800 million users worldwide, Kelley said. </p><p>Alphabet will report its second quarter earnings on July 25. If the company allays some of the concerns about a slowdown in its sales and earnings, then the stock could finally start performing as well as the rest of the FAANG companies.</p><p>Breakup fears may be overdone</p><p>Investors shouldn't be too concerned about Alphabet being broken up --- or even severely penalized --- by US antitrust regulators, said Jefferies analyst Brent Thill.</p><p>\"US regulators focus on 'consumer welfare' so it might be hard to argue that lower prices or better products are hurting consumers,\" Thlll wrote, even though some argue that Alphabet and other big techs may be harming smaller rivals.</p><p>Even in the unlikely event that tech giants were broken up, Alphabet could still wind up doing quite well, Thill added.</p><p>\"Breakups are not always a bad thing for stocks,\" he wrote, adding that the sum of the various parts at Alphabet could even be higher than the firm's current combined value.</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Five years after buying a Fitbit to \"try it out\", the tracker is almost always on his wrist. Every day, he'll check how he slept, log his calories, monitor his heart rate and track whether he's meeting his 12,000 daily step target. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But, over the past few months, Cripps has been rethinking his loyalty. Late last year, Google announced it was buying Fitbit, and, as a techie himself, Cripps was anxious. \"I was comfortable with Fitbit owning that data. I'm less so with Google.\"</p><p>Combined with all the other data Google gleans from him, the company could end up \"knowing more about me than my friends, my wife and probably even myself to be honest\", he says. That's not what he signed up for. \"I'm having to have a real think about it.\"</p><p>He is far from alone in harbouring such concerns. Since Google announced its plans to swallow up the fitness tracking company least year for $2.1bn (\u00a31.6bn), questions have been swirling over whether the deal could hand the Silicon Valley giant too much data. </p><p>Now, regulators may pull the plug on it altogether. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/08/04/eu-opens-full-competition-probe-googles-21-billion-fitbit-deal/\">European and Australian competition authorities</url>have kicked off parallel investigations into the takeover, due to conclude in December. </p><p>It is not just a matter of whether the deal would further entrench Google's digital dominance. It is true that watchdogs have cautioned that \"buying Fitbit will allow Google to build an even more comprehensive set of user data, further cementing its position and raising barriers to entry to potential rivals\". Yet, Fitbit holds a much smaller share of the global wearables market than Apple, Xiaomi, Samsung and Huawei. </p><p>For many, what presents more of a concern is whether Google should be <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/08/04/eu-opens-full-competition-probe-googles-21-billion-fitbit-deal/\">allowed access to intimate data from Fitbit's user-base,</url> which currently stands at 28 million people. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/08/04/eu-opens-full-competition-probe-googles-21-billion-fitbit-deal/\">EU advisers</url>this year warned that a \"further combination and accumulation of sensitive personal data by a major tech company could entail a high level of risk to the fundamental rights to privacy and to the protection of personal data\". </p><p>\"What is at stake here is pretty much our fundamental rights,\" Privacy International's legal officer Ioannis Kouvakas says. A tie-up could give Google sophisticated real time data about individuals' health conditions and needs, which Kouvakas warns could ultimately be pooled together with the US firm's already vast data troves. </p><p>This is not just information around how many steps users are taking. There are an array of applications on the devices which can allow users to track their menstruation cycles and fertility windows, as well as log meditations. </p><p>Such applications are set to increase in the coming years, as devices become more advanced and are able to generate more data using sensors. Experts have even said smartwatches could be used to detect early Covid-19 symptoms.</p><p>\"Everyone needs to stop and think what are the wider implications of this merger,\" Kouvakas says. In the short term, Google could use such data to train up artificial intelligence to provide better search results, he says. </p><p>But, in future, Kouvakas claims it's not out of the question that Google would start telling your employer when you need to be monitored or your insurer when you need to eat. </p><p>Such arguments have been roundly rejected by Google. For one thing, Fitbit does not have unique user data. What's more, \"this deal is about devices, not data,\" a Google spokesperson says. </p><p>\"The wearables space is highly crowded, and we believe the combination of Google and Fitbit's hardware efforts will increase competition in the sector, benefiting consumers and making the next generation of devices better and more affordable.</p><p>\"Throughout this process we have been clear about our commitment not to use Fitbit health and wellness data for Google ads.\"</p><p>Critics would be forgiven for some scepticism. In the past, major tech giants have reneged on pledges to ring-fence data gained through acquisitions from the rest of their operations. </p><p>Google has also faced <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/08/04/eu-opens-full-competition-probe-googles-21-billion-fitbit-deal/\">significant scrutiny over how it has used healthcare information</url>. In the US, the company last year faced a lawsuit that it had used patient records from the University of Chicago to develop artificial intelligence products.</p><p>It has also been probed over a collaboration which involved patient data called \"Project Nightingale\" which gave it access to records of more than 50 million Americans. </p><p>Wearable devices give much easier access to this particularly sensitive data, logging \"everything consumers do\", says Vanessa Turner from BEUC, the European Consumer Organisation.</p><p>\"There have been cases in the past that perhaps would have been decided differently in the tech sphere in hindsight. This is an important test-case for the Commission in terms of how it deals with digital healthcare. It should not allow these markets to tip in favour of one supplier.\"</p><p>Consumer rights groups and privacy advocates may be holding out for a tougher stance from regulators, a sign that after years of mounting Big Tech power, some real action is being taken. But, for now at least, it seems users are split.</p><p>Unlike Cripps, some, like Carolanne Hart, who has been using her Fitbit during lockdown, were not \"even aware that Google had bought Fitbit to be honest\". \"Would it influence my decision on using one? No, not at all.\"</p><p>John Fletcher, a photographer from Uxbridge, agrees. \"This is 2020. You need to give some data up to get a service.\"</p><p>He isn't convinced that his Fitbit information is of much interest to Google anyway. \"What are they going to do? Do they really want to check the amount of calories I've burned?\" If privacy experts are to be believed, the answer may not be a simple no. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-65229509</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60KP-DM41-F021-61FR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"948\"/><timeReceived>12:00 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 15, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

As individuals buy Libra the Facebook consortium will acquire a matching amount of securities, reversing that process when Libras are being redeemed.</p><p>That means the value of Libras will be relatively stable, although because they will be backed by assets denominated in a small number of major currencies, they might fluctuate significantly relatively to individual fiat currencies.</p><p>Initially, at least, Facebook is presenting Libra as an unregulated or \"shadow\" payment system that would be more efficient and timely than the fragmented range of existing payments platforms.</p><p>Those platforms are fragmented, and less efficient than perhaps they could be, because they are regulated at a nation-state level and their core participants are intensely-regulated financial institutions, with prudential requirements and other costly imposts like compliance with anti-money laundering, consumer protection and privacy laws.</p><p>Facebook's Libra could materially reduce the friction costs of payments, particularly cross-border transactions, if it could avoid those expensive webs of regulation.</p><p>Given that the earnings on the assets that will back the issuance of Libra will, unlike the interest on bank deposits, ultimately flow to Facebook and its partners that regulatory arbitrage - the arbitrage between regulation and no regulation, or even just less regulation - could be highly profitable.</p><p>Facebook says it is initially targeting the 1.7 billion people who don't have access to banking services, largely in developing economies. Its ambitions, however, aren't confined to the developing world.</p><p>It didn't take long for analysts to conclude that, if Facebook were successful in driving acceptance of Libra in countries with central banks unable to defend the value of their currencies, its consortium could effectively drive monetary and fiscal policies in those economies.</p><p>It's also isn't a great stretch to envisage that at some point in future, if Libra becomes a popular medium for exchange, that Libra's Swiss-based Libra Association might decide to offer more financial services and, in particular, might decide to offer credit.</p><p>That would essentially mean that it - a self-governing club of private companies - had created its own central bank and fiat currency and the ability to create credit which would be disruptive, not just for banks, but for central banks and governments.</p><p>There are those who think that prospect is risible but Facebook and the other tech giants have demonstrated their ability to exploit their economies of scale and network effects to create dominant global ecosystems with vast user numbers.</p><p>Financial information is essentially just data and Facebook and its partners should be able to grow Libra's user base and exploit both its data and that within their existing networks for profit, if they are left to do so as loosely checked and regulated as big tech companies like Facebook and Google are today.</p><p>Even if it were to remain just a payments system, fully backing the Libras in circulation with the fiat currencies in its reserve, the decisions it made about which currencies and assets to buy would have the ability to move bond markets and currencies.</p><p>The notion that the Libra Association, an unregulated oligopoly led by Facebook, could become a global shadow bank or even a de facto global central bank is more than disconcerting.</p><p>That is why governments and central banks should do whatever it takes to try to ensure that Libra is regulated stringently enough to limit any systemic implications - or kill it off before it has the opportunity to develop them.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SYMRLD-1520150063</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SYMRLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WG7-93T1-DY19-C118-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404053</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"895\"/><timeReceived>03:10 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

And that manual tracing will not be enough.</p><p>Australia's minuscule infection numbers mean that big state health tracing centres can use people power to run down the contacts quickly.</p><p>But this rapidly changes if you have a resurgence, exactly as Japan and Singapore experienced as they started to relax. Both were considered exemplars of the best pandemic practice.</p><p>Enthusiastic promoter</p><p>And it's why Prime Minister Scott Morrison moved from being a sceptic to an enthusiastic promoter. On Wednesday he described the app as a \"ticket to a COVID-safe Australia\".</p><p>The tracing app is an integral part of the armoury and is why most developed countries are now exploring them in some form. This is being supported by both Google and Apple, who are due later this week to release beta seed code that should significantly improve the effectiveness of Bluetooth tracking apps, including Australia's.</p><p>The issue becomes adoption. Estimates vary, but to get a meaningful number of contacts, the <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>maths</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link> suggests that more than half the community must download and turn on the COVIDSafe app.</p><p>Discounting for people without a smartphone, that is north of 10 million who need to turn on the app. The early adoption has been solid, about 3 million have downloaded the app by Wednesday, but there will need to be triple that uptake.</p><p>That is going to be an issue of public trust.</p><p>The troubled world of govtech</p><p>The anxiety among ministers and officials when they stepped up to the podium to launch the app on Sunday was palpable. And not surprising.</p><p>A litany of technology missteps has made the Commonwealth government everyone's favourite punching bag. The 24-hour shutdown of the 2016 Census site, the clumsy robo-debt implementation, the 2015 hack of the Bureau of Meteorology - and various small, but well-publicised, data leakages of Medicare and other data - had created an unshakable public narrative that big gov and its tech cannot be trusted.</p><p>At the same time metadata capture, encryption legislation and pernicious prison sentences for digital giants that host abhorrent violent video were rushed into law. Poorly explained and with little regard to the precious social licence required, legislation was rammed through a mostly tech ignorant cabinet and Parliament. This led to loud charges of overreach.</p><p>Distrust with gov tech has also been fuelled by numerous usability, design and performance issues as (very) traditional government chief information officers struggled to grasp a digital world where <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/public-services-are-too-hard-to-use-online-and-aren-t-trusted-20200218-p541wa\">citizen experience</url> is king. Witness the tragic collapse of the MyGov site and the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/my-bad-minister-apologises-for-mygov-hack-claim-20200324-p54dau\">farcical ministerial attempts</url> to blame it on hackers. Only last month.</p><p>A <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/public-services-are-too-hard-to-use-online-and-aren-t-trusted-20200218-p541wa\">2018 survey</url> by Boston Consulting Group and Salesforce revealed nearly two-thirds of users of government sites were worried about unauthorised data leakage and half about basic cyber security.</p><p>This collapse in digital trust has come as surging political partisanship and infighting and a federal public service that somewhere lost its mojo, have all combined to halve public trust in government over the past 20 years. Trust is now down to a miserable 26 per cent, with only one in three Australians trusting government services.</p><p>Privacy vacuum</p><p>The elephant in the room is a deeply ingrained, 30-plus-year fear of privacy and identity issues, that started when the late Bob Hawke sensibly suggested a single identity card, called the Australia Card in the mid-1980s. The then Labor government lost a critical byelection over it.</p><p>Ever since generations of ministers and agency leaders have run scared of building a sensible trust framework to underpin the common sense joining up of services and data sharing to build better services and targeted policy initiatives.</p><p>This is finally being addressed, but meanwhile, Australia continues to play in the sandpit when it comes to privacy. Dog's breakfast is probably the best description of the mishmash of federal and state laws, regulations, codes and principles that describe the Australian privacy landscape. This is made more problematic because of special privacy provisions that apply in public health emergencies</p><p>The recent Australian Competition and Consumer Commission Digital Platforms<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.accc.gov.au/system/files/Digital%20platforms%20inquiry%20-%20final%20report.pdf\"> report</url> highlighted the tight overlap between privacy, competition and consumer protection. And it joined the long queue calling for reform of the Privacy Act, as a means to build \"trust in the digital economy and spur competition between businesses on the basis of privacy\".</p><p>A review is being established by the Attorney General's department, but the net result of this regulatory vacuum is that Australia has little maturity or public consensus around privacy. In Europe, there is a broad consumer understanding of privacy rights through a decades-long process that culminated in the roll-out of the General Data Protection Regulation privacy framework. In Australia, the lack of community consensus around privacy has severely hindered the roll-out of digital initiatives and data sharing more broadly.</p><p>This was the real world playing field when Morrison a month ago told Singapore's Prime Minister he was <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/can-data-beat-the-virus-20200324-p54dbs\">interested in its new tracing app. </url>It set off a month-long scramble to try and reset the government's reputation for reliable, trust-worthy technology.</p><p>Five years ago it would have been laughable to even think the Commonwealth could get an app like the COVIDSafe live in a few weeks. The Digital Transformation Agency was set up for this exact purpose and leadership was determined to ensure the high-profile app was built with privacy and security at its core.</p><p>Working with Boston Consulting Group, local software engineer firm Shine Solutions and Amazon Web Services, the decision was taken to tightly limit the app to a single purpose, contact tracing, rather than a broader app that helped ensure social distancing. This meant no location data was needed.</p><p>Similarly, it was decided to collect only the minimum personal data needed for tracing. This materially reduced the risk of re-identification, an ever-present fear when collecting public data.</p><p>Learning the lessons from the past, it was decided to meet head-on any anxiety that the data could be used by public safety and policing agencies. A determination under the powerful Bio-Security Act was slammed in place on Saturday night ahead of the app launch to ban any third party. Lawyers are still reviewing how comprehensive that ban is, but the intent is clear.</p><p>This was not an easy call. The app would have provided hugely useful data for academic researchers once the virus passes, but in the interests of promoting uptake, it was decided all the data will be wiped.</p><p>By limiting the amount of personal and sensitive information this enabled the privacy policy and terms and conditions to be simplified and comprehensible by <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.webfx.com/tools/read-able/check.php?tab=Test+By+Url&amp;uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.health.gov.au%2Fusing-our-websites%2Fprivacy%2Fprivacy-policy-for-covidsafe-app\">a 14-year-old</url>.

After what it describes as years of poor treatment, the company is going to regulators to ask, or force, Apple to \"play fair.\" Confused?</p><p> Here's a little context.What does Spotify want?Spotify hasn't published what it sent to the EC, but Ek's blog outlines the company's grievances. Ek believes that Apple has, essentially, made life as hard on Spotify as it can, with regards to the Spotify app on the App Store. The company believes that Apple's practices have been designed to suppress Spotify as a competitor to iTunes and Apple Music.Ek is looking for three things to change in the future, starting with Spotify being treated the same as Apple's own apps. Secondly, he wants Apple to relax its rule about only being able to pay for apps through its own platform. Finally, he wants Apple's ban on apps communicating with users to be removed, so Spotify can talk to its customers directly about deals and offers.OK, why?Rightly or wrongly, Spotify believes Apple is singling it out because it offers a competing product. Spotify has published a timeline[3], running from 2007, outlining when its iOS app was rejected and alleging that Apple threatened to remove the app altogether. Spotify adds that the App Store rules were altered in \"ways to disadvantage rivals like us.\"Play Video[4] Spotify also says its products have been unfairly excluded from accessing Apple's hardware services. Like the fact that you can't invoke Siri to play songs from Spotify on the iPhone or on Apple's new(er) HomePod speaker. The company says that it tried, several times, to build an app for the Apple Watch, which Apple didn't agree to until 2018.These aren't as crucial to Spotify's case, however, as Apple taking a 30 percent commission on every app sold in its store. And that it insists on only using Apple's payment platform, rejecting apps that ask to be paid by other means. Compounding the issue, according to Spotify, is Apple refuses to allow apps to communicate this detail to its users.Spotify was unwilling to incur the 30-percent charge on its monthly subscription revenue from iOS users. After a lengthy back-and-forth with Apple, Spotify pulled the ability to upgrade to Premium, its paid-for product, from the iOS app. And Spotify suggests that Apple broke its own rules when it launched Apple Music and communicated offers to users -- something other app makers are blocked from doing.Is that fair on Apple?Not entirely, and Spotify may claim as conspiracy what could simply be two arms of a company behaving in conflict. If Apple was determined to exclude Spotify to make sure that Apple Music was all-conquering, why not block it from the App Store? It could easily amend its policies in a way that would make that a fair call, and it has not.Spotify is also complaining that it can't tell users to sign up to Premium via its website, or link to the website in the app. But if all apps simply bounced users to third-party websites, it would open the door for large-scale fraud, hacking and harassment. You could argue that Apple's policies are often built to avoid harm to consumers, which seems the case here.The music service may have also over-egged its justifications about being blocked by Apple from accessing its hardware. Spotify claims that Apple blocked Spotify from running on the HomePod, a Siri-only speaker that doesn't natively run competing products. There are obvious reasons why HomePod doesn't run Amazon Alexa, same as the Echo doesn't run Siri.But Apple does allow any app that can usee AirPlay to stream music to the HomePod, including Spotify. And if Apple was desperate to exclude Spotify, why does it use its rival's logo in its public messaging around the speaker? Just check this screenshot from the HomePod site, snapped shortly before publication.Apple's App Store transaction fees, as well, aren't being metered out on Spotify unfairly -- it's a blanket rule. It takes a 30-percent cut of all transaction revenue, as is its right for providing the store in the first place, and some of the revenue is used to run the store itself. Subscription deals actually drop after the first year, to 15 percent, which isn't being discussed either. As one developer puts it, that cash pays for security, app review, hosting, distribution and payment processing.How much is:\u2022 Payment clearing, fraud, indemnity, insurance, and dunning\u2022 Local tax law enforcement ...porting\u2022 CDN/Distro\u2022 DRM/theft protection Worth to you? 30% seems cheap at the 1.99 price, but crazy at the 500/yr subscription level <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/v7ekwRe4pg\">https://t.co/v7ekwRe4pg</url>[5]\u2014 grork (@grork) August 22, 2018[6] It's a clumsy metaphor, but imagine Apple owns a parking lot where a flea market is about to take place. Every stallholder would be, and is, expected to kick in some cash to compensate for the use of the parking lot. Why should it be that, rather than alter prices or eat the charge as a cost of doing business, Spotify is demanding preferential treatment?Could Apple be found liable?The EU treaties include rules that prevent companies from abusing their \"dominant market position\" to \"prevent effective competition.\" And both of those terms will be given a lot of scrutiny by some of the world's smartest lawyers. For a start, can Apple be described as \"dominant\" in Europe, where iOS market share is reportedly 27.69 percent[7], versus Android's 71.2 percent?How about in music streaming itself, where Apple can leverage its global dominance? Not so much. Spotify has 207 million monthly users and 96 million paid subscribers, compared to just 50 million Apple Music users. In Europe, Statista[8] believes that Spotify controls 40 percent of its home market, probably making it the dominant player.Of course, this is partly semantics, as everyone knows that Apple has an outsized influence on the industry. But regulators can't simply slap down Tim Cook (or Eddy Cue) just because a local competitor feels aggrieved. And, when EU officials were going after Google[9], it discounted Apple's existence as a justification for consumer choice.It'll also be interesting to see how much Apple's own conduct plays into this, given Spotify's accusations. The company says that Apple put Spotify \"under constant pressure\" to adopt in-app purchases and \"threatening to remove us from the App Store.\" If there is documentary proof of these threats, then Spotify's case is likely to be much stronger.Why Europe?The European Union is a massive continent-spanning body that is designed to ensure its free market remains a free market. It monitors companies and acts as a referee if it spots something that looks like foul play. It has been leading the charge against Big Tech in recent years as the big four (or five) companies in the space throw their weight around.The EU and its bodies represent the views of close to 510 million people, making it one of the biggest markets in the world. It sets minimum standards for consumer protection, including laws protecting private data, and prevents companies from abusing their position. In recent times, that has included fights with Microsoft over browser choice and Google's abuses around Android and Shopping. Oh, and Spotify is a Swedish company, so this was always going to be its first port of call.Why now?Spotify says that the timing of the complaint is unrelated to anything else, but it's another voice in the chorus against Big Tech. There are growing calls for platform holders to be blocked from being both player and referee, with Senator Elizabeth Warren leading the charge. The 2020 presidential candidate has called for Facebook, Amazon, Google and Apple to be broken up.She believes that it's too easy for a company like Amazon, which has a sales platform and sells its own goods, to abuse its position. She added that Amazon could easily identify a hot product, copy it and block the original, stifling competition. Similarly, Warren told The Verge[10] that \"you've gotta break [Apple] apart from their (sic) App Store. It's got to be one or the other.\"Netflix is another company that has engaged in some pushing and shoving with Apple over App Store fees. Late last year, Netflix removed the ability[11] to subscribe from inside the iOS app as a way of avoiding paying Apple its 30 percent cut. Not to mention that there is a Supreme Court case[12] on App Store commission fees brewing away in the background.What are the consequences?In the short term, nothing, since the EC has merely acknowledged that Spotify has made a complaint. European investigations are rarely done in a hurry, and we don't expect much to shake out of this for at least a year, if not longer. The first stick that officials can use to beat Apple with is a fine, which could be up to 10 percent of its annual revenue. Although given that Apple has a variety of European subsidiaries, it's not clear how the calculus will be made.In the State Aid case, in which Ireland was found to have given Apple inappropriate tax breaks, the company had to pay $15.4 billion[13] in back taxes, plus interest. Although that matter is still under appeal as Apple and Ireland try to get the penalties lowered or reduced.Europe will also have legislative remedies available to it, in the same way it did with Microsoft during the browser wars. In that case, Microsoft had to offer users a choice of browsers to download when they first opened Explorer. In this one, Apple may be required to alter its policies or directly notify users about getting Spotify[14] for less money elsewhere. Or, just as likely, officials will find no wrongdoing and close the complaint. At this point, it's too early to tell.

It permits internet companies to moderate their sites without being on the hook legally for everything they host. It does not provide blanket protection from legal responsibility for some criminal acts, like posting child pornography or violations of intellectual property.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Now, as scrutiny of big technology companies has intensified in Washington over a wide variety of issues, including how they handle the spread of disinformation or police hate speech, lawmakers are questioning whether Section 230 should be changed.</p><p>  Last month, Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, said in a hearing about Google and censorship that the law was ''a subsidy, a perk'' for big tech that may need to be reconsidered. In an April interview, Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California called Section 230 a ''gift'' to tech companies ''that could be removed.''</p><p>  ''There is definitely more attention being paid to Section 230 than at any time in its history,'' said Jeff Kosseff, a cybersecurity law professor at the United States Naval Academy and the author of a book about the law, ''The Twenty-Six Words That Created the Internet.''</p><p>  ''There is an inclination to look at Section 230 as one lever to influence the tech companies,'' he said.</p><p>  Here is an explanation of the law's history, why it has been so consequential and whether it is really in jeopardy.</p><p>  So why was the law created?</p><p>  We can thank ''The Wolf of Wall Street.''</p><p>Stratton Oakmont, a brokerage firm, sued Prodigy Services, an internet service provider, for defamation in the 1990s. Stratton was founded by Jordan Belfort, who was convicted of securities fraud and was portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio in the Martin Scorsese film about financial excess. An anonymous user wrote on Prodigy's online message board that the brokerage had engaged in criminal and fraudulent acts.</p><p>  The New York Supreme Court ruled that Prodigy was ''a publisher'' and therefore liable because it had exercised editorial control by moderating some posts and establishing guidelines for impermissible content. If Prodigy had not done any moderation, it might have been granted free speech protections afforded to some distributors of content, like bookstores and newsstands.</p><p>  The ruling caught the attention of a pair of congressmen, Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, and Christopher Cox, a Republican from California. They were worried the decision would act as a disincentive for websites to take steps to block pornography and other obscene content.</p><p>  The Section 230 amendment was folded into the Communications Decency Act, an attempt to regulate indecent material on the internet, without much opposition or debate. A year after it was passed, the Supreme Court declared that the indecency provisions were a violation of First Amendment rights. But it left Section 230 in place.</p><p>  Since it became law, the courts have repeatedly sided with internet companies, invoking a broad interpretation of immunity.</p><p>  On Wednesday, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed a lower court's ruling that Facebook was not liable for violent attacks coordinated and encouraged by Facebook accounts linked to Hamas, the militant Islamist group. In the majority opinion, the court said Section 230 ''should be construed broadly in favor of immunity.''</p><p>  Why is the law so consequential?</p><p>  Section 230 has allowed the modern internet to flourish. Sites can moderate content -- set their own rules for what is and what is not allowed -- without being liable for everything posted by visitors.</p><p>  Whenever there is discussion of repealing or modifying the statute, its defenders, including many technology companies, argue that any alteration could cripple online discussion.</p><p>  The internet industry has a financial incentive to keep Section 230 intact. The law has helped build companies worth hundreds of billions of dollars with a lucrative business model of placing ads next to largely free content from visitors.</p><p>  That applies to more than social networks like Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat. Wikipedia and Reddit depend on its visitors to sustain the sites, while Yelp and Amazon count on reviews for businesses and products.</p><p>  More recently, Section 230 has also provided legal cover for the complicated decisions regarding content moderation. Facebook and Twitter have recently cited it to defend themselves in court when users have sued after being barred from the platforms.</p><p>  Many cases are quickly dismissed because companies assert they have the right to make decisions on content moderation as they see fit under the law.</p><p>  What are the problems with the law?</p><p>  The criticisms of Section 230 vary. While both Republicans and Democrats are threatening to make changes, they disagree on why.</p><p>  Some Republicans have argued that tech companies should no longer enjoy the protections because they have censored conservatives and thereby violated the spirit of the law, which states that the internet should be ''a forum for a true diversity of political discourse.''</p><p>Facebook, Twitter and Google, which runs YouTube, which are the main targets for bias claims, have said they are baseless.</p><p>  On the flip side, some Democrats have argued that small and large internet sites aren't serious about taking down problematic content or tackling harassment because they are shielded by Section 230.</p><p>  Mr. Wyden, now a senator, said the law had been written to provide ''a sword and a shield'' for internet companies. The shield is the liability protection for user content, but the sword was meant to allow companies to keep out ''offensive materials.''</p><p>  However, he said firms had not done enough to keep ''slime'' off their sites. In an interview with The New York Times, Mr. Wyden said he had recently told tech workers at a conference on content moderation that if ''you don't use the sword, there are going to be people coming for your shield.''</p><p>  There is also a concern that the law's immunity is too sweeping. Websites trading in revenge pornography, hate speech or personal information to harass people online receive the same immunity as sites like Wikipedia.</p><p>  ''It gives immunity to people who do not earn it and are not worthy of it,'' said Danielle Keats Citron, a law professor at Boston University who has written extensively about the statute.</p><p>  Is Section 230 in jeopardy?</p><p>  The first blow came last year with the signing of a law that creates an exception in Section 230 for websites that knowingly assist, facilitate or support sex trafficking. Critics of the new law said it opened the door to create other exceptions and would ultimately render Section 230 meaningless.</p><p>  Ms. Citron, who is also vice president of the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, a nonprofit devoted to combating online abuse, said this was ''a moment of re-examination.'' After years of pressing for changes, she said there was more political will to modify Section 230.</p><p>  Senator Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri and a frequent critic of technology companies, introduced a bill in June that would eliminate the immunity under the law unless tech companies submitted to an external audit that their content moderation practices were politically neutral.</p><p>  While there is growing political will to do something about Section 230, finding a middle ground on potential changes is a challenge.</p><p>  ''When I got here just a few months ago, everybody said 230 was totally off the table, but now there are folks coming forward saying this isn't working the way it was supposed to work,'' said Mr. Hawley, who took office in January. ''The world in 2019 is very different from the world of the 1990s, especially in this space, and we need to keep pace.''</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTOS: PHOTO (B1)</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p> Ron Wyden, left, with Christopher Cox, introduced an amendment to the Communications Decency Act, which protected companies from liability (PHOTOGRAPH BY DOUGLAS GRAHAM/CONGRESSIONAL QUARTERLY, VIA GETTY IMAGES) (B5)       </p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYT-433853190806</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WST-8F61-DXY4-X4JD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6742</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1393\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The New York Times Company</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times</publicationName><edition>Late Edition - Final</edition><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/06/technology/section-230-hate-speech.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/06/technology/section-230-hate-speech.html</url><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 6, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Originally published at the Institute of Economic Thinking website[4] The Big Tech companies, including Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft and Apple, have individually and collectively engaged in an unprecedented number of acquisitions. In a new paper, Big Tech Acquisitions and the Potential Competition Doctrine: The Case of Facebook [5]we document the 90 completed acquisitions made by Facebook since 2007 and consider the applicability of the potential competition doctrine to two of their largest purchases. Tech giants like Facebook operate in markets with unique features such as strong network effects that can 'tip' the market toward domination by a single firm. </p><p>But these effects are a two edged sword. Creative start-up companies with innovative products can also capture network effects that allow them to scale quickly, gain a large user base, and blossom into a competitive rival of the dominant firm. This potential for start-ups to challenge market leaders reinvigorates the competitive process within the dominant firm's core market. In this context, acquisitions of nascent competitors by dominant firms undermine both current and future competition and reinforce the incumbent's dominance in the face of technological shifts. So why has there been so little attention by the antitrust agencies in the face of hundreds of mergers involving potential future competitors by the Big Tech companies? We argue that the potential competition doctrine that would be directly applicable to these situations was an early casualty of the Chicago School revolution that swept through the antitrust world in the 1970s and 1980s. In particular, Justice Powell's 1974 decision in United States v. Marine Bancorporation undermined the applicability of the potential competition analysis in a manner that rendered it virtually impossible to apply to online platform markets. Following the election of Ronald Reagan, the Department of Justice followed suit with new merger guidelines hobbling the doctrine even further. We illustrate the consequences of the attenuated potential competition doctrine in the context of Facebook's $1 billion purchase of Instagram in 2012 and its $19 billion WhatsApp deal in 2014. Both of these mergers avoided challenge by the antitrust authorities, yet have been strongly criticized by antitrust commentators. The details of these acquisitions are revealing. In 2012 Facebook was under pressure from investors ahead of its IPO while simultaneously struggling to reorient its network from a desktop-based platform to a mobile user base. In this period mobile-native applications with social features such as Instagram and Foursquare were attracting growing user numbers and threatened to draw user engagement away from Facebook precisely when its revenue base was under scrutiny. Instagram was particularly popular among younger users who focused on mobile photo sharing. Industry analysts suggested that Instagram was posed to challenge Facebook in its core social networking market. By applying the evidentiary standards required for a challenge under the potential competition doctrine, we show that even the strong prima facie case for Instagram as a potential competitor is difficult or impossible to establish under the extraordinary levels of proof required by the doctrine. Similarly, in 2014 WhatsApp was the largest and fastest growing messaging application in the world. It was reliable, affordable, worked across national borders, and offered end-to-end encryption. Importantly, WhatsApp was popular in markets where Facebook Messenger was a late entrant and it was growing at a record rate. At the time of the acquisition WhatsApp had 450 million monthly active users and was gaining one million users per day. WhatsApp users were also unusually engaged; more than seventy percent of WhatsApp users accessed the app daily. WhatsApp could have been a critical entry point into the social network market and a challenge to Facebook. However, once again the relevant antitrust agencies did not see a problem based on an analysis of potential competition. We contend that the problem of merger control in high tech industries is not related to technological innovation or changes in market structure. Instead, it is related to the continued hold of the Chicago School of Antitrust which hobbled the potential competition doctrine in a manner that made it for all practical purposes irrelevant. The Instagram and WhatsApp examples demonstrate how the potential competition doctrine is designed to fail. We argue that to untie that hands of the antitrust agencies, the enormous upfront proof requirements of the prima facie case imposed by the Chicago School on antitrust plaintiffs must be replaced with a simple structural presumption that high tech firms in concentrated markets that purchase start-up companies in adjacent or proximate markets creates a rebuttable presumption of illegality. At that point the burden would shift to the proponents of the acquisition to demonstrate that the merger would not harm competition in any market. Under this approach the current barriers to challenge potential competition mergers can be lessened without sacrificing the importance of a full competitive analysis. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2019/10/why-have-facebook-and-other-tech-giants-gotten-away-with-gobbling-up-competitors.html?utm_source=feedburner..._medium=feed..._campaign=Feed:+NakedCapitalism+%28naked+capitalism%29#\">https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2019/10/why-have-facebook-and-other-tech-giants-gotten-away-with-gobbling-up-competitors.html?utm_source=feedburner..._medium=feed..._campaign=Feed:+NakedCapitalism+%28naked+capitalism%29#</url> This entry was posted in Dubious statistics[6], Economic fundamentals[7], Free markets and their discontents[8], Guest Post[9], Legal[10], Politics[11], Regulations and regulators[12], Technology and innovation[13], The dismal science[14] on October 22, 2019[15] by Yves Smith[16].

While protests may have encouraged the City to work faster towards implementing (very minimal) fees[2], something that has been in the works since at least last year, I question why no restrictions on vehicle size for areas where double-decker coaches don't safely fit have not been implemented. State regulations prohibit charging large fees on the shuttle operators, so anything higher than a regulatory program that recoups its own costs is probably out of the question without a citywide vote or additional study. The buses are not really THE problem, however- they are a symptom of much larger local and state government dysfunction, which is where peoples' anger should really be directed.</p><p><br/>Google, for one, would love to build housing near its campus in Mountain View. They have tried to get it permitted and it has been rejected, while at the same time the city has approved additional office space. In fact, the city of Mountain View expressly forbade housing in its citywide general plan for the area around the Bayshore Campus[3]. This would have put large numbers of Googleemployees walking distance from work, while also providing a walkable neighborhood near a light rail station. Googlehas also started investing in affordable housing, including one project in Mountain View, but unfortunately it's only 51 units[4]. The truth is that suburban communities don't want to build more housing, and Prop 13 gives existing owners little reason to care about increasing housing prices. In fact, it's in homeowners best interest to keep housing prices high.<br/> Additionally, many communities set limits for vehicular traffic that employers need to comply with as part of transportation management plans. Aside from being a recruiting tool, company shuttles are the primary way of complying with these regulations[5]. Why not subsidize existing transit? For most people public transit to the peninsula is incredibly time-consuming, and it also lacks the capacity to take that many additional riders. Caltrain will be upgrading in the coming years with high speed rail funds, but that is still a ways off. Most trains are already at capacity (standing room only) at rush hour. There is simply not room for thousands more people right now, and most of the tech campuses are not close enough to Caltrain for people to walk without providing buses for the final leg anyway. Not to mention the time it takes to get to Caltrain within San Francisco on Muni, which is also straining under current ridership levels.<br/> If employees want to live here, why did all the big tech companies not lease offices in San Francisco in the first place? Aside from the fact that a lot of their employees still live on the peninsula or in the South Bay, there is not enough office space in San Francisco to accommodate them. San Francisco currently has the lowest office vacancy rate in the United States and it doesn't have room for 15,000 Googleemployees to relocate north.[6] Office space construction was severely limited in the 1980s over concerns of Manhattanization[7], and this has only recently changed as development has been permitted south of Market Street downtown.<br/> I'm not sure we'd be that much better off from a housing perspective if Facebook, Googleand Apple were all located in downtown San Francisco, though it would remove the need for shuttle buses (Google's downtown San Francisco office on the Embarcadero is already very popular with Googleemployees, most of whom bike or take transit to work). As we have seen, there has been a huge amount of anger levied at in-town tech companies setting up in the Mid-Market area[8] (although a lot of that anger has been directed at an arguably unnecessary tax break that will cost the city millions). There is no easy solution to these problems, but a total lack of coordination between municipalities with different priorities is the crux of the problem. Maybe the protests should move to suburban communities that don't want to allow rental housing construction?<br/> an earlier version of this piece was originally posted 12/20/2013 on marksaurus.com[9]<br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/@mphillips2357\">https://medium.com/@mphillips2357</url>       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/@TheGadgetFlow\">https://medium.com/@TheGadgetFlow</url>       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/@jimray\">https://medium.com/@jimray</url><br/> Written by<br/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/@markasaurus\">https://medium.com/@markasaurus</url><br/>Mark Hogan[10]<br/>Architect w/ specialties in urban housing + BIM implementation.

A week of revelations about Cambridge Analytica's use of data gleaned from the social network has left the world demanding answers. The company can't seem to decide: is it outraged that it was taken advantage of by an unscrupulous actor, or relieved that this is just normal use of tools that it made widely available for almost five years? Should Mark Zuckerberg come out front and centre leading the response, or should he hide in a cupboard until it all blows over?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Faced with its first true crisis, the company is paralysed with fear. And that paralysis is, remarkably quickly, leading people to reassess their relationship with the site as a whole. The teens got there first, really. Facebook usage among younger people has been declining for years, in the face of competition from upstart rivals such as Snapchat, internal disruption from Facebook-owned Instagram, and a general sense that Facebook is full of old people and parents. But the backlash isn't a generational thing any more. We're all losing control of our data, both online and off, and we're starting to kick back.</p><p>Not only is the burgeoning #deletefacebook movement picking up steam (although it will take a few weeks before hard numbers are available about how many have followed through on their words), but people are also beginning to look up, as if from a daydream, to ask: how exactly did we end up in this situation? Why did we give up our privacy so willingly? And how can we get it back?</p><p> Related:  The Guardian view on big tech: a new era needs new rules | Editorial</p><p>The 50m profiles harvested from Facebook by a Cambridge Analytica partner under the guise of research are a huge data store, but they pale in comparison with the amount of information the company holds on its own users. At the same time that Facebook turned off the spigot that had been used to pump industrial quantities of data off its platform, the company opened up a second set of floodgates: the Facebook Audience Network, which allows third parties to track, profile and advertise to Facebook users wherever they find them on the internet.</p><p>Facebook isn't really a social network. It's barely even an advertising company. It's a data analytics firm, which manages to use its position as the middleman for a vast proportion of all human communication to find out everything there is to know about its users.</p><p>Just as Cambridge Analytica claimed enormous powers of perception with a scant selection of personal information, Facebook also boasts to advertisers about how much it knows about its users - and how effective it can be at influencing their minds: it cites a games company that \"made video adverts to match different gamer styles\" for a \"63% increase in purchase intent\"; a clothes retailer that achieved \"a dramatic increase in sales\" with \"richly personalised ads\"; and a mobile network that scored \"a major boost in awareness and purchase intent\" by focusing on users with families. (Facebook used to have a similar page on which it showed off to politicians about how effective it was at swinging elections, but it quietly removed that in February.)</p><p>If you think you're a passive user of Facebook, minimising the data you provide to the site or refraining from oversharing details of your life, you have probably underestimated the scope of its reach. Facebook doesn't just learn from the pictures you post, and the comments you leave: the site learns from which posts you read and which you don't; it learns from when you stop scrolling down your feed and how long it takes you to restart; it learns from your browsing on other websites that have nothing to do with Facebook itself; and it even learns from the messages you type out then delete before sending (the company published an academic paper on this \"self-censorship\" back in 2013).</p><p>Facebook boasts to advertisers about how much it knows about its users - and how it can influence their minds</p><p>This data life isn't limited to Facebook. Google, famously, is in the same basic business, although the company is a bit more transparent about it (for a shock, try going to the \" My Activity \" and \" Location History \" pages to be vividly reminded that Google is tracking everything). And Amazon is building a modern surveillance panopticon, replete with an always-on microphone for your kitchen and a jaunty camera for your bedroom, purely to sell you more stuff.</p><p>Avoiding the big players doesn't help much. Large data brokers such as Experian and Equifax exist to collate information about everyone, whether or not they're online. The security services continue to build their own surveillance databases, with powers strengthened in the UK through the recent Investigatory Powers Act. Even going to church now comes with the potential for a dose of surveillance: the Church of England has authorised the roll-out of 14,000 contactless card readers, to let parishioners give without carrying cash. Is it time to say goodbye to the anonymity of the collection plate, and hope you're one of the more generous donors?</p><p>                     Richard Stallman has been warning of this state of affairs since before Zuckerberg even touched his first computer. The veteran computer scientist, creator of the GNU operating system and leader of the Free Software Movement, warns that \"the only database that is not dangerous is the one that is never collected\".</p><p>\"There is a limit on the level of surveillance that democracy can co-exist with, and we're far above that,\" he tells me on the phone from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \"We suffer more surveillance than the inhabitants of the Soviet Union, and we need to push it way down.</p><p>\"Any database of personal data will be misused, if a misuse can be imagined by humans. It can be misused by the organisation that collects the data. In many cases, the purpose of collecting it is to misuse it, as in the case of Facebook, but also in the case of Amazon, Google to some extent, and thousands of smaller companies as well.</p><p>\"It can also be misused by rogue employees of the company and it can also be stolen by some third party and misused. There'd be no danger of data breaches if a database doesn't exist. And, finally, it can be taken by the state and misused.\"</p><p>Stallman has little sympathy for those who choose to use such services. \"They're foolish,\" he says, when I ask him why he thinks data harvesting is tacitly accepted by so many people. \"They're accustomed to a certain kind of convenience... they choose to ignore that it might be dangerous.\"</p><p>I'm less certain that there's a choice being made at all, though. Yes, people may regularly be accepting terms and conditions that require them to give up their data, but that doesn't mean they read them. I should know: I have. A few years ago, I decided to read, in full, the small print for every single product or service I used. I read almost 150,000 words of legalese - three-quarters of Moby Dick - in less than a week, from the 21,000 words required to turn off the alarm on my iPhone on a Monday morning to the 4,000 words required to browse BuzzFeed in my lunch break.</p><p>The experience was gruesome. Legal documents are not written to be read by humans, and certainly not to be read back-to-back in a harrowing marathon of End-User Licence Agreements. But I did learn one thing, which is that the modern notion of consent upon which the entire data edifice is built has the shakiest of foundations.</p><p>Lukasz Olejnik, an independent security and privacy researcher, agrees: \"Years ago, people and organisations used to shift the blame on the users, even in public. This blaming is unfortunate, because expecting users to be subject-matter experts and versed in the obscure technical aspects is misguided.</p><p>\"Blaming users is an oversimplification, as most do not understand the true implications when data are shared - they cannot. You can't expect people to fully appreciate the amount of information extracted from aggregated datasets. That said, you can't expect users to know what is really happening with their data if it's not clearly communicated in an informed consent prompt, which should in some cases include also the consequences of hitting 'I agree'.\"</p><p>He adds that at many organisations, privacy was not being taken seriously, \"except when there was a need to include the phrase 'We take the privacy of our users very seriously' following a data breach\".</p><p>The modern notion of consent upon which the entire data edifice is built has the shakiest of foundations</p><p>It doesn't have to be like this. Doctors are required to demonstrate not just consent, but informed consent, from patients: the latter have to understand what they are agreeing to, or the agreement is moot. After years of mis-selling scandals, the same principle is slowly making its way to the financial industry. Logging in to check an ISA, you may be confronted with a 12-point questionnaire designed to check you understand the risks and are happy for the investment to continue.</p><p>Yet online, the biggest companies in the world base their businesses around users hitting \"I agree\" on a dialogue box on a website once, a decade ago, and then never being told what their agreement entails, nor being offered any way to retract their consent and take back control of the information they gave up.</p><p>Change is coming. In the EU, the General Data Protection Regulation - GDPR - overhauls a continent's worth of rules around a clear principle that the only person who can ever own an individual's data is that individual. Olejnik describes the law as a \"good starter\", but notes that even it will still need to be \"reviewed and updated on a regular basis\".</p><p>Stallman wants to go one step further. \"I recommend a law prohibiting any system that collects data,\" he says, \"no matter who runs it, whether it's a company, some non-profit organisation, or a public agency, whatever, that they are not allowed to collect data unless they can justify it as absolutely necessary for the function to be done.\"</p><p>It would be a huge step, and one that is unlikely to come without a radical change in how the public views mass data collection.

Here's why.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Go big or go home -- that's the message that hedge funds are sending in 2017, now that the data are rolling in on funds' favorite stocks from the past quarter.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Funds doubled down on big, blue chip stocks during the quarter, but they were very specific about what they bought. Of the 11 major sectors in the market, financials were the only one that saw a \"material\" amount of buying last quarter - and even then, funds only upped their stakes by 1.7%.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To figure out which specific stocks  last quarter, we've got to turn to the SEC filings.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Think of hedge funds' list of favorite stocks like an investing shortcut -- by leaving the hard analysis to the pros, you get all the perks of a well-staffed equity research department, without paying the hefty management fees the world's most successful hedge funds charge.</p><p>And believe it or not, you don't have to guess to figure out what the funds are buying right now because they'll tell you.</p><p>That's because institutional investors with more than $100 million in assets are required to file a 13-F, a form that breaks down their stock positions for public consumption. From hedge funds to mutual funds to insurance companies, any professional investors who manage more than that $100 million watermark are required to submit a form 13-F to the SEC.</p><p>Want to know which stocks are pro investors' favorites? Those 13-F filings hold the key...</p><p>By comparing one quarter's filing to another, we can see how any single fund manager is moving their portfolio around. And by looking at those changes collectively, we can see which stocks the pros are betting on as a group. In other words, we can see which stocks Wall Street loves. While the data are\u00a0generally delayed by about a quarter, that's not necessarily a bad thing. Research shows that applying a lag to institutional holdings can generate positive alpha in some cases. That's all the more reason to crack open the moves being made with pro investors' $21 trillion under management.</p><p>The early numbers for the fourth quarter\u00a0are starting to roll in. Consider this your sneak peek.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JPMorgan Chase</emphasis><br/></p><p>Topping hedge funds' list of favorites last quarter was banking giant <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JPMorgan Chase  </emphasis> -- no surprise there. JPMorganhas been a stellar performer lately, rallying almost 34% on a total returns basis in the last six months. Hedge funds have reacted to that outperformance by buying this bank stock with both hands, early-filing funds picking up another 2.68 million shares during the quarter. That adds up to a $226.8 million buy operation so far at current price levels.</p><p><br/>  is one of the biggest banks in the world, with more than $2.4 trillion in assets. Like the other big-four banks, JPMorganoperates a diversified financial services business, with operations in commercial and retail banking, asset management and treasury services, and investment banking. That wide range of services gives JPM a massive base of low-cost deposits that it can put to work in other, more lucrative, corners of its business.</p><p>The <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fed</emphasis> and President Donald Trump have been a couple of important catalysts for JPMorgan's recent rally. Higher rates from the Fed (and pressure from the White House to keep that rake hike pace going) translate into higher net interest margins for lenders, which should translate into meaningful income hikes at big banks like JPMorgan.</p><p>JPM has been a popular fund holding for two straight quarters now. Back in 2016, when the financial sector was getting pummeled, JPMorgan Chasewas one of the few stocks in the sector that investors were actually buying. Now, with momentum clearly being controlled by the bulls, it makes sense to join the funds in this bank for 2017.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Microsoft\u00a0</emphasis><br/></p><p>Financial institutions didn't like the tech sector in the fourth quarter -- in the aggregate, tech holdings dropped by 0.6% last quarter, making it the second-worst sold sector during the period. One notable exception to that was <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Microsoft  </emphasis>. Early-filing funds bought another 6.65 million shares of Microsoft during the quarter, a $431 million buy operation for funds that have filed their 13-F documents at this point in the month.</p><p>As more reporting comes in, expect that Microsoft buying to be even more prominent.</p><p><br/>  is one of the biggest companies in the tech sector, selling everything from software tools to mobile devices to gaming consoles. Despite that broad collection of offerings, Microsoft's Windows operating system and Office productivity suite still provide the lion's share of the firm's profits today. Management is intent on changing that, however. The firm has been pushing its cloud solutions, including Azure, very hard in recent quarters -- at the end of fiscal 2016, Intelligent Cloud made up 27.2% of total revenue.</p><p>Financially, there's a lot to like about Microsoft right now. The firm currently carries $41.6 billion in net cash and investments on its balance sheet, enough to cover just shy of 9% of Microsoft's market capitalization at current price levels. That huge cash cushion gives Microsoft options in 2017. Meanwhile, buyers are in control of the price action in this stock right now. Shares are up 14% in the trailing six months, and investors should think about joining the funds on this big tech trade.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Berkshire Hathaway</emphasis><br/></p><p>It's been a great year to be a <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Berkshire Hathaway   </emphasis>shareholder. In the last 12 months, this $404 billion holding company has charged 26.5% higher, beating the big market averages by a big margin. Along the way, shares have pushed to new all-time highs, as  and company have tacked another year of outperformance onto Berkshire's track record.</p><p>That recent run has made this stock a magnet for fund managers - in the last quarter, our group of early filers picked up 1.65 million shares of BRK.B. That works out to a $271.3 million shopping spree at current price levels.</p><p>Berkshire Hathaway owns a wide spectrum of very diverse businesses, ranging from insurance firm Geico to fractional private aircraft ownership company NetJets, to the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad. Despite the wide spectrum of businesses, insurance represents a huge share of Berkshire's overall value -- Geico, General Re, Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group and Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group added up to around a quarter of total profits in the most recent fiscal year.</p><p>That huge exposure to insurance means that Berkshire is another notable beneficiary when rates move higher. The firm's huge $91 billion insurance float should scale up their contributions to Berkshire Hathaway's income statement materially in the quarters ahead. While the risks of a transition from CEO Warren Buffett and his managing partner Charlie Munger are real, the two have done a stellar job of filling Berkshire's businesses with managers who don't need much input. That fact should give fund managers some comfort as they pile into shares of Berkshire this winter.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chevron\u00a0</emphasis><br/></p><p>The energy sector has been in rebound mode for the last year, and funds are turning to oil and gas supermajor <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chevron  </emphasis> as their way to play it at this point. Chevron is one of the largest energy companies in the world, with production of 2.6 million barrels of oil equivalent a day. The firm's proven reserves are in excess of 11.1 billion barrels of oil equivalent, and it's one of a few supermajors that's opted to stay fully integrated, earning a piece of every transaction from pulling crude oil out of the ground to pumping gasoline in consumers' cars.</p><p>That decision proves wise during the price rout in oil that kicked off back in 2014. As pure-play exploration and production stocks struggled under the pressure of tumbling oil prices, large firms with midstream exposure were the best protected. That positioning should continue to make  for risk-averse investors, particularly as the trajectory of commodity prices remains unclear given current geopolitics.</p><p>Funds picked up another 1.78 million shares of Chevron last quarter, adding nearly $200 million in exposure to their portfolios based on current share prices. While Chevron's fundamental story still looks attractive long-term, the technicals have been weakening in the near-term. Wait for CVX to recover from last week's earnings-fueled drop before you look for a buying opportunity.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">UnitedHealth Group</emphasis><br/></p><p>Last on hedge funds' list of favorites for the most recent quarter is $153 billion health-care giant <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">UnitedHealth  </emphasis>. UNH has been in rally mode since last fall, catapulting higher as the \"Trump rally\" sent investors buying on hopes that lower healthcare regulation under the new administration could translate into higher profits for UNH. Shares are hovering at all-time highs in January.</p><p><br/>  is the biggest managed care provider in the U.S., with more than 46 million heal members under its coverage. This is another situation where scale matters a lot: UnitedHealth's huge size means that the firm can negotiate more attractive contracts with health care providers, keeping costs low and attracting even more members. A huge customer base also helps to spread risks out over a larger population, which keeps underwriting surprises minimal.</p><p>Partially in reaction to the Affordable Care Act, UnitedHealth has been investing heavily in growing outside of its core business. More emphasis on highly profitable healthcare IT services, for instance, make the firm even more attractive now. Funds picked up 1.76 million shares of UNH during the most recent quarter, increasing their holdings by $285 million. This stock looks like a smart bet to make alongside the funds -- investors should expect more upside ahead in UNH this quarter.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSC-13973786</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSC2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5MSJ-W2G1-JCHV-V3N6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">220623</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1592\"/><timeReceived>6:01 AM EDT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 TheStreet.com, Inc.

From now on it will be us. Make sure you click the link and add yourself to our contacts so we can text you back.\"\u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>As a result, the band racked up contact information and locations for most of those attendees, to whom it can now sell concert tickets, merch and music directly by sending text messages to the specific groups -- or even the individuals -- who might be most likely to respond. \"We captured over 20% of our audience at Red Rocks and immediately had so much more engagement than we've ever had with Instagram and Twitter,\" Ryan Tedder, the lead singer of OneRepublic, told <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Billboard</emphasis>. \"Nobody else should have your fan's information other than you -- the fact that Facebook owns all of it and we can't have access to it unless we want to pay exorbitant fees is ridiculous.\"\u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>OneRepublic is one of about 300 celebrity acts -- from\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"/music/paul-mccartney\">Paul McCartney</url>\u00a0and\u00a0      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"/music/marshmello\">Marshmello</url>\u00a0to\u00a0      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"/music/puff-daddy\">Diddy</url>\u00a0and\u00a0      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"/music/jennifer-lopez\">Jennifer Lopez</url>\u00a0-- who've given out their digits in recent months, asking fans to text them at seemingly personal numbers that often bear the area codes of their hometowns. Behind their outreach is a startup called Community, backed by\u00a0      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"/music/madonna\">Madonna</url>\u00a0's longtime manager Guy Oseary, co-founder and principal of Live Nation's Maverick management group. He's betting that texting will allow artists to wrest information about the identities, whereabouts and preferences of their most engaged followers away from Twitter, Facebook's Instagram, Alphabet, Apple and Spotify, which guard such data closely.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>The fledgling platform is gaining traction as the U.S. regulators pursue antitrust investigations into the big tech companies, with the Justice Department's antitrust chief saying at a conference this month that the practice of stockpiling consumers' data can threaten market competition, and that privacy could factor into the department's antitrust analysis.</p><p>\"You may have millions of followers, but you don't know who's in that audience,\" Community co-founder and CEO Matthew Peltier told <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Billboard</emphasis> recently, in his first public interview since closing a $35 million funding round and launching the company on July 24th. \"People are starting to wake up to the fact that you may be investing a ton of time and energy and resources into social media, but you don't necessarily have a direct relationship with that audience.\"</p><p>Text messaging has long intrigued the music industry as a better way to market to fans, given how much more likely people are to open text messages than they are to engage with posts on social media. Peltier says that 98% of the texts sent through Community are opened within the first three minutes, while 90% of those are opened within the first three seconds of being sent. By contrast, the percentage of an audience that interacts with a post is 1.6% on Instagram; 0.48% on Twitter;\u00a0and 0.09% on Facebook,\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rivaliq.com/blog/2019-social-media-benchmark-report/#title-all-industry\">according to the social media analytics firm Rival IQ</url>. Even when artists and labels spend six figures on ads to target specific fan bases on social platforms, less than 2% of the targeted fans tend to click through.</p><p>SuperPhone, a company founded by music producer\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"/music/ryan-leslie\">Ryan Leslie</url>\u00a0, has been using a similar blueprint since 2016 with limited success, letting customers such as Atlantic Records manage text message conversations from thousands of users.</p><p>But hurdles to text-based marketing remain. One pop star's manager told <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Billboard</emphasis> he was hesitant to use Community because it doesn't yet support text messaging worldwide -- and he was wary of confusing or frustrating the large number of his client's fans living outside the U.S. (Community says its international coverage will expand in 2020.)</p><p>Dragging artists off Instagram isn't easy, either, especially in a world where high follower counts translate to both bragging rights and rich branding deals.</p><p>There's also a learning curve for celebrity texters. Artists and their camps are advised to text in a personal voice that doesn't replicate their tone on social networks; rapper\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"/music/\">Guapdad 4000</url>\u00a0, a new Community user, told <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Billboard</emphasis> that it's crucial to get \"past the barrier of people thinking that you're a bot.\"</p><p>\"A lot of what we do is make sure our \u2018Community Leaders' really think about this relationship differently,\" says Peltier. \"You can't just market to your fans here, you can't just promote things. You need to really invest in the relationship, and you need to provide value.\"</p><p>Community may also face stiff competition from the behemoths like Facebook, which has a lengthy history of \"borrowing\" features from smaller startups and incorporating them into its own products, and could easily offer its own texting service to Community's customer base. But Oseary says Community's commitment to data privacy could give it an edge against the tech giants. Instead of selling its data to advertisers, Community plans to charge its celebrity users a monthly fee based on how many contacts they accumulate on the service.</p><p>\"We're not trying to do 50 other things,\" Oseary says. \"We're just going to keep going down our path and keep building the best tech and the best solutions and also do it in a transparent way where people own their data, it's not shared, and it's not sold. If we do a good job, people will stick with us.\"</p><p>To get fans to buy in, some artists are hamming it up.\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"/music/diplo\">Diplo</url>\u00a0asked his fans to text him in\u00a0      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qy9HU4dHUyc\">a YouTube video</url>\u00a0, stating he was \"feeling lonely,\" and then put up\u00a0      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/DillonFrancis/status/1184171892980060160\">a billboard in Hollywood</url>\u00a0that read, \"This is\u00a0      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"/music/dillon-francis\">Dillon Francis</url>\u00a0' phone number. Ur welcome, Diplo.\"</p><p>\"So @diplo put my number on a billboard but you know what fuck it! i love texting random people SO JOKES ON HIM!\" Francis, who is signed to Diplo's label, tweeted in October.</p><p>To promote her debut album <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Over It</emphasis>,\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"/music/\">Summer Walker</url>\u00a0\u00a0kept it personal by texting fans in New York to \"meet up on Second and Hudson,\" for example.\u00a0\"Doing all these little micro engagements --\u00a0and doing this all around the country -- over time, we saw how that builds an audience and how it builds a direct connection,\" Peltier says. Walker's team also\u00a0      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSy36vEClKo\">released a commercial with Apple Music</url>\u00a0that featured Walker's phone number, placing\u00a0      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.blogto.com/music/2019/10/singer-took-over-phone-booth-toronto-tease-her-new-album/\">pink phone booths</url>\u00a0in five cities across North America where fans could listen to the album before it was released, and text Walker afterwards. Walker's team says the platform has now reached the same level of importance for future album rollouts as traditional social media networks like Twitter, Facebook\u00a0and Instagram. \"Everything we roll out on socials we also do for Community, and we'll do things that are special for them, like letting them know first,\" Malia Murray, senior marketing director at Walker's label\u00a0LVRN, told <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Billboard</emphasis>.</p><p>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"/music/tory-lanez\">Tory Lanez</url>\u00a0has also been using Community to promote his upcoming album, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Chixtape 5</emphasis>. \"Tory texted everyone to tweet #Chixtape5 and it was number five trending in the world,\" says his manager Sascha Stone Guttfreund. \"I think this is going to change the game for a lot of people.\"</p><p>Community's co-founders Peltier and Josh Rosenheck originally founded a startup called Shimmur in 2014, which was designed to allow celebrities and fans to communicate through an app, rather than text message.</p><p>But it launched just as app downloads began to decline across the board, prompting the company to pivot to texting in 2018,\u00a0with an assist in early 2019\u00a0from Sound Ventures co-founders Oseary and Ashton Kutcher, early backers of other tech firms like Spotify, Airbnb and Uber.</p><p>Community has quadrupled its engineering team this year and is still hiring aggressively. Barry Steinglass, who left his role late last year as CTO of Hulu, serves as chief technology officer.</p><p>Oseary sees potential for Community to reshape how concert tours are planned, thanks to its ability to allow clients to filter their fans by their location, age, gender, and soon, interests. \"I sat with one of the biggest promoters a few days ago, and when I showed him how Community worked, he had the same thought, which is what I always believed, which is a lot of the tour is routed on a guessing game,\" \u200bOseary says. \"Here, you're going to know, \u2018Wow, we've got 10,000 numbers in Phoenix.' We don't have to guess as much anymore.\"</p><p>Moe Shalizi, Marshmello's manager, says that while music streaming services already offer plenty of fan data to help\u00a0acts route their tours, marketing directly to potential ticket buyers requires other tools. \"Yeah, we know the Spotify data, but you can't really access the fans [through Spotify],\" Shalizi says. \"Here [on Community] you can access them.\"</p><p>Celebrities outside of music are experimenting with the platform, too, from Ellen DeGeneres to Mark Cuban, entrepreneur and owner of the Dallas Mavericks, who gave his number to fans in October during a radio interview with Ryan Seacrest, explaining that \"SMS is the most ubiquitous app on the planet -- everyone understands it and everyone uses it.\"</p><p>For OneRepublic's Tedder, texting is so far proving to be a more effective way to get the right fans' attention when he needs it. \"When I'm trying to tell people in Philly or in Shanghai, \u2018Hey, we're in Shanghai and we're going to pop up at this record store, we're opening up the final thousand tickets that we've saved until today,' I can't do it [on social media]\" Tedder says. \"People in Lima, Peru, are responding, and the Philippines, and Houston, and it just becomes white noise. If someone doesn't have that app open at that moment they're not getting that that post. If they're not trolling Twitter or if they're not currently on Instagram, they're not going to get that. [Community] cracks the code on that for me.\"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8543190/why-hundreds-music-stars-giving-fans-phone-numbers-community-app?utm_source=GALE&amp;utm_campaign=Syndication&amp;utm_medium=Why+Hundreds+of+Music+Stars+Are+Giving+Fans+Their+Phone+Numbers\">Link to Image</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BILLBD-8543190</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BILLBD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XGB-R0D1-DYRK-V4YM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">5545</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1673\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Prometheus Global Media, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Billboard</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30084\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 10, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>ONLINE</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Other institutions aren't far behind.</p><p>For any bank tempted by the promise of lower costs, quick deployments and ease of management they can get from adopting cloud computing, using an IBM firm may ease any qualms their compliance, risk departments and board of directors have.</p><p>\"IBM is one of those vendors we trust to help deliver mission critical systems,\" said Bruce Ross, group head, technology and operations at Royal Bank of Canada. \"This will put them in a much better position to compete with these other three players in the market,\" he said, referring to the cloud computing providers Amazon, Microsoft and Google.</p><p>That could help explain why IBM was willing to pay $34 billion, making Red Hat its largest acquisition ever. In addition to offering services for the cloud, Red Hat's technology, which includes a \"wrapper\" for open source software and a development platform, runs on all cloud platforms.</p><p>A boon for RBC</p><p>Like many banks, RBC has been building newer applications such as mobile banking and advanced analytics that need to coexist with legacy systems and applications. The newer work is done in the cloud, using agile development methods and Red Hat's Ansible software development platform.</p><p>Use of the cloud gives these projects the ability to consume large data sets and to be set up and deployed faster and with less cost, Ross said.</p><p>\"We end up in the cloud, either local on RBC's premise or in the public, and we're 30% faster than we were under traditional methods,\" he said. \"We're also getting capability to market much faster. An example is our mobile app, where we're getting up to 10 releases a year out to our customers, we can release new capability whenever we want to, whatever makes sense for the customer.\"</p><p>The merger of Red Hat and IBM will improve this dynamic, he said, as legacy and newer applications will work more seamlessly together.</p><p>\"With the two organizations working as one, I don't have to referee between the two of them,\" Ross said. \"I don't have to think about the transition from one company's software to the other; I can think of that part of our assembly line being through one. That helps me manage it.\"</p><p>Over time, he expects to be able to move applications easily between IBM, Azure and other cloud platforms because Red Hat works with all of them.</p><p>This is important to RBC because its cloud computing environment is hybrid. Most work takes place on an internal, private cloud. But at times, the bank needs to run fast-moving projects in a public cloud. For instance, a regulator might ask the bank to assess its exposure to a type of market risk, prompting it to rapidly analyze a huge amount of data.</p><p>\"In some of those cases, it's good to be able to do that on a public cloud because you don't have to spend all the capital to build all that infrastructure. You can dial it up when you need it and shut it down immediately,\" Ross said. \"The key is to be able to move from one environment to the other as you need to.\"</p><p>A potential drawback?</p><p>Developers who contribute to open source projects tend to be free thinkers, happy to share ideas with people in other organizations and to not be under the thumb of any one corporation. In fact, for banks like Capital One, one of the reasons to use open source software is to attract the best, most creative coders.</p><p>But IBM is seen as more conservative. The same observation could be made of Microsoft, which bought the open source community space GitHub in June.</p><p>Though IBM has been a supporter of the Linux open source operating system, at one point donating $1 billion to it, and some companies do run hybrid clouds on IBM computers such as the Z enterprise mainframe, heavy users of cloud computing and open source tend to think of the development ecosystems around IBM's mainframe and other computers as closed. They often argue that they have to go to purely cloud and open source environments to innovate.</p><p>\"For those in the open source community, I would be a bit concerned as IBM doesn't have the best track record of innovation in the operating system space,\" said Al Pascual, senior vice president of research at Javelin Strategy &amp; Research.</p><p>In their announcement, the companies asserted that Red Hat will remain independent and keep doing what it's been doing.</p><p>\"Importantly, Red Hat is still Red Hat,\\xE2  said James Whitehurst, Red Hat's chief executive, who will stay on at IBM in Red Hat's existing headquarters. \"When the transaction closes, we will be a distinct unit within IBM, and I will report directly to IBM CEO Ginni Rometty. Our unwavering commitment to open source innovation remains unchanged.\"</p><p>Whitehurst said Red Hat's technology will continue to work across all cloud platforms.</p><p>In Ross's view, the open source communities need the big tech companies to merchandise the code they create.</p><p>\"If I'm an open source developer, what do I want more than anything else? I want people to use the stuff I build,\" he said. \"If I build open source capability and Microsoft, IBM and Google use it, I will become famous as one of those developers.\"</p><p>IBM's big bet on the cloud</p><p>There's little question the purchase is beneficial to IBM. With cloud computing space dominated by Amazon, Google and Microsoft, this gives IBM an entry into the market, which it estimates to be worth $1 trillion.</p><p>In an interview Monday on CNBC, Rometty said that the move is about \"resetting the cloud landscape.\"</p><p>\"This is to create the company that will be the No. 1 cloud provider,\" she said.</p><p>Most IBM clients have moved about 20% of their workloads to the cloud, she said.</p><p>\"Chapter two is moving the next 80%, and that is what this is about,\" Rometty said. \"To move that 80%, you have to be hybrid, you have to be able to handle multiple clouds, you have to have open technologies, you have to do multicloud management.\"</p><p>Editor at Large Penny Crosman welcomes feedback <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:atpenny.crosman@sourcemedia.com\">atpenny.crosman@sourcemedia.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MA-00000166-c0de-de4b-ab66-fcde47960000-1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MA2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TM8-B9P1-JCRW-500J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8287</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1038\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 SourceMedia LLC d/b/a Arizent.

Other institutions aren't far behind.</p><p>For any bank tempted by the promise of lower costs, quick deployments and ease of management they can get from adopting cloud computing, using an IBM firm may ease any qualms their compliance, risk departments and board of directors have.</p><p>\"IBM is one of those vendors we trust to help deliver mission critical systems,\" said Bruce Ross, group head, technology and operations at Royal Bank of Canada. \"This will put them in a much better position to compete with these other three players in the market,\" he said, referring to the cloud computing providers Amazon, Microsoft and Google.</p><p>That could help explain why IBM was willing to pay $34 billion, making Red Hat its largest acquisition ever. In addition to offering services for the cloud, Red Hat's technology, which includes a \"wrapper\" for open source software and a development platform, runs on all cloud platforms.</p><p>A boon for RBC</p><p>Like many banks, RBC has been building newer applications such as mobile banking and advanced analytics that need to coexist with legacy systems and applications. The newer work is done in the cloud, using agile development methods and Red Hat's Ansible software development platform.</p><p>Use of the cloud gives these projects the ability to consume large data sets and to be set up and deployed faster and with less cost, Ross said.</p><p>\"We end up in the cloud, either local on RBC's premise or in the public, and we're 30% faster than we were under traditional methods,\" he said. \"We're also getting capability to market much faster. An example is our mobile app, where we're getting up to 10 releases a year out to our customers, we can release new capability whenever we want to, whatever makes sense for the customer.\"</p><p>The merger of Red Hat and IBM will improve this dynamic, he said, as legacy and newer applications will work more seamlessly together.</p><p>\"With the two organizations working as one, I don't have to referee between the two of them,\" Ross said. \"I don't have to think about the transition from one company's software to the other; I can think of that part of our assembly line being through one. That helps me manage it.\"</p><p>Over time, he expects to be able to move applications easily between IBM, Azure and other cloud platforms because Red Hat works with all of them.</p><p>This is important to RBC because its cloud computing environment is hybrid. Most work takes place on an internal, private cloud. But at times, the bank needs to run fast-moving projects in a public cloud. For instance, a regulator might ask the bank to assess its exposure to a type of market risk, prompting it to rapidly analyze a huge amount of data.</p><p>\"In some of those cases, it's good to be able to do that on a public cloud because you don't have to spend all the capital to build all that infrastructure. You can dial it up when you need it and shut it down immediately,\" Ross said. \"The key is to be able to move from one environment to the other as you need to.\"</p><p>A potential drawback?</p><p>Developers who contribute to open source projects tend to be free thinkers, happy to share ideas with people in other organizations and to not be under the thumb of any one corporation. In fact, for banks like Capital One, one of the reasons to use open source software is to attract the best, most creative coders.</p><p>But IBM is seen as more conservative. The same observation could be made of Microsoft, which bought the open source community space GitHub in June.</p><p>Though IBM has been a supporter of the Linux open source operating system, at one point donating $1 billion to it, and some companies do run hybrid clouds on IBM computers such as the Z enterprise mainframe, heavy users of cloud computing and open source tend to think of the development ecosystems around IBM's mainframe and other computers as closed. They often argue that they have to go to purely cloud and open source environments to innovate.</p><p>\"For those in the open source community, I would be a bit concerned as IBM doesn't have the best track record of innovation in the operating system space,\" said Al Pascual, senior vice president of research at Javelin Strategy &amp; Research.</p><p>In their announcement, the companies asserted that Red Hat will remain independent and keep doing what it's been doing.</p><p>\"Importantly, Red Hat is still Red Hat,\" said James Whitehurst, Red Hat's chief executive, who will stay on at IBM in Red Hat's existing headquarters. \"When the transaction closes, we will be a distinct unit within IBM, and I will report directly to IBM CEO Ginni Rometty. Our unwavering commitment to open source innovation remains unchanged.\"</p><p>Whitehurst said Red Hat's technology will continue to work across all cloud platforms.</p><p>In Ross's view, the open source communities need the big tech companies to merchandise the code they create.</p><p>\"If I'm an open source developer, what do I want more than anything else? I want people to use the stuff I build,\" he said. \"If I build open source capability and Microsoft, IBM and Google use it, I will become famous as one of those developers.\"</p><p>IBM's big bet on the cloud</p><p>There's little question the purchase is beneficial to IBM. With cloud computing space dominated by Amazon, Google and Microsoft, this gives IBM an entry into the market, which it estimates to be worth $1 trillion.</p><p>In an interview Monday on CNBC, Rometty said that the move is about \"resetting the cloud landscape.\"</p><p>\"This is to create the company that will be the No. 1 cloud provider,\" she said.</p><p>Most IBM clients have moved about 20% of their workloads to the cloud, she said.</p><p>\"Chapter two is moving the next 80%, and that is what this is about,\" Rometty said. \"To move that 80%, you have to be hybrid, you have to be able to handle multiple clouds, you have to have open technologies, you have to do multicloud management.\"</p><p>Editor at Large Penny Crosman welcomes feedback <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:atpenny.crosman@sourcemedia.com\">atpenny.crosman@sourcemedia.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MA-00000166-c0de-de4b-ab66-fcde47960000-1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MA2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TM7-1HP1-F06X-W17S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8287</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1037\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 SourceMedia LLC d/b/a Arizent.

Yet it generally costs much less to get a slice of their earnings.</p><p>\"China also has a huge domestic market that easily eclipses America's and a middle class that grows by millions each year,\" Ms Mui added. </p><p>While Silicon Valley behemoths such as Apple and Facebook have increased their earnings rapidly over the past decade, this growth is starting to slow. Chinese tech stocks on the other hand may have far more potential to expand. </p><p>\"At the moment they are very domestically oriented with little overseas exposure and so have lots of growth potential outside of China, especially in Asia,\" Ms Mui said. </p><p>They are also generally far cheaper to buy. The average price to earnings (p/e) ratio, which compares a company's share price with its earnings, for the Faangs is 42. For Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent - often called the Bat stocks - the average p/e score is 24.</p><p>Most expensive of all is Amazon, which has a score of 72. Internet service provider Baidu is the cheapest, with a ratio of 14.</p><p>Investors have been concerned for a while that the long-term rally enjoyed by Silicon Valley's tech stars may soon come to an end. Share prices of Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet started to slide a few weeks ago - which could be the start of a more serious price correction. </p><p>American tech stocks could also suffer if Democrat Joe Biden wins the American presidency and chooses to tighten up regulation of the sector. \"Chinese tech companies are unlikely to be hurt in the same way, as the country is typically very supportive of domestic innovators,\" Ms Mui said. </p><p>Continued conflict between the People's Republic and America has led each to impose crackdowns on tech firms based in the other country, such as Donald Trump's recently proposed ban on Chinese-owned app TikTok. Conversely, two-way sanctions could actually provide another boon to China's blossoming tech scene.</p><p>David Kimberley of Freetrade, a stock broker, said: \"When companies like Google, Facebook and Twitter were banned from operating in China, the consequence was that local firms sprung up in their place. WeChat, owned by Tencent, is probably the best example of this. It started out as a messaging app but has branched out into taxis, e-commerce, payments and business communications.\"</p><p>The app, which is also facing a ban in America, has over a billion users - around 100 million of whom are based outside of China. </p><p>Investing money in individual stocks can be risky and investors may prefer to put their money into a fund. One option is the Baillie Gifford China Fund, which has tripled investors' money over five years.</p><p>Its largest investments are in Alibaba and Tencent, which it has held for the best part of 10 years. Roderick Snell, one of the fund's co-managers, said he saw no reason why China's economic growth would slow down in coming years. </p><p>\"The country adopts new technology faster than anywhere else in the world. It has leapfrogged the West because they don't have legacy technologies like we do\" Mr Snell said. \"Facebook is now looking to Tencent for inspiration rather than the other way around.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-66231605</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60X6-8H81-JBNF-W0VK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"616\"/><timeReceived>6:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 24, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

The Irish narrative never fails to win over even the harshest critics; in sports and economics alike our story is one of relatability and against-all-odds triumph. This diplomacy is achieved simultaneously with a twinkle of the eye and rarely without a pint of Guinness at hand. The biggest export of Ireland is not our agricultural products or biomedical devices, it is without a doubt our \"craic\": packaged as diplomacy and marketed by a combination of our ancestral history, poets such as WB Yeats and Seamus Heaney and renditions of Michael Flatley in one of an estimated 7,000 Irish pubs outside of Ireland. </p><p>Ireland is a country full of people who are adored and envied globally, and we are proud of our ability to be adored. So when the Economist published its story of Irish praise, it was met with considerable enthusiasm. An Irish friend and colleague from MIT even went as far as to tweet: \"Ireland has become an unlikely diplomatic superpower, says the Economist. I disagree, it was not only likely it was inevitable.\"</p><p>It was Joseph Goebbels who said: \"If you repeat a lie often enough, it becomes accepted as truth.\" And in 2020, the mask of this feigned narrative is starting to slip. Because while Ireland is propagating diplomacy through the front door, it is ensuring the demise of democracy through the back door with an ill-fated strategy that cannot endure.</p><p>Ireland is the biggest tax haven in the world, used by multinationals to shelter profits. The Irish taxation of multinationals has been drawn back into headlines with the recent Apple case ruling, showing that Apple had a scandalously low effective tax rate for its European business of 0.005 per cent. There are many well-discussed and hotly debated reasons why the Irish tax strategy both enables and hinders Ireland, mostly focusing on Irish jobs, Irish economic growth and the cost of living and property. </p><p>But the real danger inherent in Ireland's relationship with the global tech sector is not an Irish problem alone. We need to look outwardly during this debate. Because while Ireland is winning the short game in terms of sector and economic growth off the back of these tech giants, the costs to this strategy are not only shared globally but are terminally damaging to the levels of democracy experienced worldwide. </p><p>The value and viability of global democracy is more highly contested today than ever before. While democracy has enjoyed widespread global growth since the latter half of the 20th century, technological progression is affecting the levels of democracy within old and new democracies alike. The creation of algorithm-based technologies has led to overwhelmingly private ownership of the production, collection and distribution of information and knowledge in the technological era. </p><p>The very nature of democracy seeks to create a balance between government and individual control, however the private technology industry has created unprecedented influence for governments (democratic and authoritarian alike) and for itself. </p><p>Companies such as Google and Facebook have been permitted to acquire unfettered power and through such power have increased their share prices at the cost of moulding the civic norms upon which democracy exists. Democracy has been eroded by technology in a three-pronged way: through the creation of power asymmetries between governments and corporations with communities; by sowing a lack of trust and disinformation in the media; and by changing our civic norms by hijacking our attention with endless targeted advertising.</p><p>The relentless pursuit of these corporations and capitalist pressure to act so egregiously at the will of their shareholders has been helped, not hindered by Ireland's exaltation of Big Tech and hence the jobs that this new religion has brought. Where the Irish economy was once propped up by the Catholic Church and ministerial decisions were made in the pew, global condemnation of the Vatican moved the ministers to a new god in the Silicon Docks. As Ireland's complex cultural ties with religion have clashed with its young and progressive communities, these progressive communities now look not to the Pope but to Mark Zuckerberg, whose following is exponentially increasing. And as Ireland moves the Catholic Church away from its economic and social core, there is another predatory and power-hungry sect making its way to the altar. </p><p>By housing Big Tech under anti-competitive tax structures and building their data centres, Ireland is making it nearly impossible for technology to be regulated in the European Union and beyond. Having an essentially zero-tax cost base enables these corporations to grow at an unprecedented speed while creating long-lasting social devastation in their path. The cost of Big Tech growth in Ireland can be felt everywhere, so we must start to ask ourselves if the trade-off will pay out in the long term, when the music stops and the semi-permanent jobs have moved to a lower cost base.</p><p>Eduardo Baistrocchi of the Tax Justice Network has explained: \"It is triggering an ongoing clash between globalisation and democracy because of the increasing inability of tax systems to address problems of inequality within countries. This clash has been producing, in turn, electoral shocks in both the developed and developing world such as Brexit, Trump and Bolsonaro.\"</p><p>I recently read a beautiful poem by Imelda May, You Don't Get to be Irish and Racist, which explored the space of contradiction between our cultural heritage and our globalised, modern viewpoints. It made me think of the Economist article - is Ireland really a diplomatic superpower? In my mind, no. You cannot use the local profits from eroding democracy to pay for your rise in global diplomacy. You don't get to promote a set of values abroad while quietly contradicting yourself at home. We cannot celebrate our Nobel laureates who have written about prevailing Irish sovereignty through wars fought on land while removing the sovereignty of others through wars fought online. </p><p> Sin\u00e9ad O'Sullivan is a Sainsbury management fellow at Harvard Business School and a senior research fellow at MIT's Sloan school of management, leading research into geopolitics, technology and democracy</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-1.4332802</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60M8-VH51-JC8Y-801R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1112\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 18, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001688</classCode><className>TAXES &amp;

Like most people, I don\u2019t trust Facebook, Instagram\u2019s parent company very much, these days.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This fact isn\u2019t so remarkable in and of itself, but it begs the question of why. Of course, there\u2019s the oft-cited Cambridge Analytica scandal, but across history, brands have had various scandals that touched their users and managed to emerge relatively unscathed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So then why do I, like so many other people, have a deeply ingrained trust deficit with Facebook and, more broadly, big tech? And is the cause of this something more serious that other brands should be observing and planning for?</p><p>This isn\u2019t a product issue per se. On the surface, Facebook is a great consumer product. It offers a host of services, largely free, that connect us with our nearest and dearest, keeping us in contact in a way that would have been unimaginable before it existed. Sounds great, right? Yet people don\u2019t like Facebook. Indeed, the company has a serious trust issue. A 2018 Trust Index of U.S. adults by Jebbit found that Facebook had the lowest consumer trust score (3.1) of any surveyed brand. How a company that offers such a great, valuable product could come to be disliked and distrusted so strongly speaks to the changing nature of trust in the data-driven internet era.</p><p>There are two issues at play here. The first is the lack of understanding that consumers have of just how much data is being collected about them and how deeply this is mined to synthesize incredibly personal insight. The lesson that Cambridge Analytica should have taught us is not simply that elections can be manipulated, but that we can be simultaneously susceptible to deep suggestions and unaware that it\u2019s happening. This is covert mass manipulation.</p><p>The second is a lack of understanding as to how this data may be used in years to come. The information we expose about ourselves or our children may not seem relevant today, but allowing any company to accumulate a pattern of your child\u2019s behavior or facial characteristics from birth to early adulthood is a treasure trove of data that, in decades to come will be mined, analyzed and exploited in ways even engineers have not yet considered today. This is the risk. You\u2019re placing your data (and faith) in a future state of technology driven by process automation, machine learning and artificial intelligence that no one yet quite has a grasp on.</p><p>Here\u2019s a thought experiment, none of which is beyond even current technology. Suppose you have a public Instagram feed with photos of your children posted over several years. As a young adult, your child applies for health insurance. In this future universe, the systems that exist within the insurer\u2019s actuarial armory have already scraped the photos from their childhood and noted an excessive amount of time in bright sunlight, and using skin pattern scanning, note some blemishes that may be early indicators of skin cancer. They\u2019re denied insurance or even a human review.</p><p>The technology I\u2019ve described above sounds frightening and sci-fi-like, but many of the technologies outlined here exist today with varying degrees of accuracy. Our images are regularly scraped, indexed and searched by systems, and various algorithms can be run on these. This is for data you can naturally see, notwithstanding the vast quantities of data you create without perhaps realization, such as behavioral traits, interests and physical location, all of which can be used to triangulate a detailed understanding of your personality, habits, disposition and socioeconomic status.</p><p>Consider as an individual, a parent or a company, how are you managing the data you create?</p><p>Historically, trust as a pillar of a brand\u2019s equity was thought of as something earned with time, perhaps aided by some emotional cues of history and heritage or inter-generational inheritance of a brand (think of your parents\u2019 preferred toothpaste brand, for example).</p><p>Trust was also imbued in the messaging. A brand you could trust was sincere, thoughtful and almost earnest. Plus, the experience you might have with that brand would reflect this. Now brands collect, process and synthesize hundreds of data sources simultaneously to derive competitive advantage across the entire spectrum of their business activities, from new product innovation to marketing optimization and improved customer experiences.</p><p>With that valuable data and insight comes a whole new set of trust issues, from a legal and regulatory perspective, but perhaps most importantly, from a perspective of consumer relationship management. In a future that is entirely data-driven, we can see that already fickle consumers strongly prefer a brand they can trust with their personal information.</p><p>There have been countless data breaches affecting users of Facebook, Experian, British Airways and Marriott, just to name a few. But more worryingly still are the visible failures or a lack of any controls in the systems within large brands to safeguard their customers\u2019 data. As we race to a world in which data represents the greatest competitive advantage, sometimes referred to as the \u201cnew oil,\u201d it seems reasonable that companies should be working overtime to earn consumers\u2019 trust vis-\u00e0-vis handling such a precious resource.</p><p>Instead, corporations have tended to behave irresponsibly, to shoot first and ask questions later. Consequently, increasingly savvy governments are rapidly imposing regulations (like GDPR in Europe or CCPA in California or LGPD in Brazil) with the aim of protecting their constituents.</p><p>Regulations will of course force gradual change as they have done in banking and healthcare. But there is a greater opportunity here for brands to capitalize on for competitive advantage. In the coming years, actively courting consumer trust through responsible data management will come to be seen as a key differentiator.</p><p>In an age of distrust in globalized, data-hungry corporations, ensuring that the personal information you collect is managed ethically and with the care and integrity that your users might expect gives you a moral high ground and a brand position that is unique. It\u2019s an opportunity to show that you do more than grab data, to prove you can be trusted as a guardian of that information while continuing to benefit from the business value it can bring.</p><p>While the lawyers, actuaries and public relations firms draft onerous response playbooks to be broken open in case of inevitable emergency, brands should take a step back and consider the value of simply doing the right thing with the information users choose to share. Make no mistake: Now that those users are becoming more privacy aware, they\u2019ll reward the brands that can demonstrate that they\u2019re actually aware of it, too.</p><p>But until the time comes that brands act responsibly and transparently with the data they hold, I\u2014and, increasingly, concerned consumers like me\u2014will tread cautiously when it comes to how much I share of my nearest and dearest on platforms like Instagram and Facebook.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ADWEEK-1072551</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ADWEEK2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X79-K741-JC8H-T181-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7907</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1173\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Mediabistro Holdings, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>adweek.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 8, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

View original post here[2]. While the financial media has been preoccupied with the idea that the banking business is at risk of being 'Amazon'd' by the blockchain, the banks themselves are worried about being 'Amazon'd' bywellAmazon  Or at least they should be, as American Banker[3]'s Lalita Clozel [4]explains in a piece tracing large tech companies' attempts to forge ties with banking regulators in anticipation of someday leveraging the vast quantities of customer data to outmuscle the banks in their own industry. Meanwhile, even the most optimistic cryptocurrency enthusiasts concede that blockchain technology continues to grapple with issues of scalability that, for now at least, will make it incredibly difficult to compete with banks.  </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user245717/imageroot/2017/10/04/2017.10.05bezos.JPG\">http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user245717/imageroot/2017/10/04/2017.10.05bezos.JPG</url>  A group of companies that includes Google, Facebook and Amazon recently formed a lobbying group to help them explore the feasibility of entering businesses like lending and loan-intermediation.  Technology giants like Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple are showing an increasing interest in engaging with federal banking regulators, a move that underscores Silicon Valley's growing involvement in the financial services arena. In recent years, such firms have formed a lobbying group, Financial Innovation Now, that is staking out their view on various hot-button topics. But some firms are also meeting individually with government agencies.  Furthermore, both Amazon and Square have taken meetings with the OCC.  For example, Amazon lobbyists met with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency starting in the second quarter of 2016, and again this year to discuss 'issues related to mobile payments and payment processing, financial innovation, and technology,\" according to publicly available lobbying disclosures.  PayPal, meanwhile, met with OCC officials in the second, third and fourth quarters of last year to discuss 'mobile payment innovation' issues related to underserved customers and remittances and money transfers, according to its disclosures.  Even before this latest lobbying effort, both companies had already launched forays into small-business lending (Amazon's SB lending businesses saw its revenue double over the past year). Apple, meanwhile, has for years been lending to customers hoping to purchase its products. But before deciding whether to expand their financial services offerings, tech companies must first understand what regulatory obstacles might exist.  'People are kicking the tires,' said Lawrence Kaplan, a bank lawyer of counsel at Paul Hastings. 'People are asking questions: What does this entail? Can you get us up to speed if we want to pull the trigger?'  In the spirit of helping to shepard financial innovation, the OCC earlier this year created a national fintech charter that financial technology (and big tech) companies can use to circumvent certain restrictions, easing their transition into the financial-services business.  The charter, Clozel [5]notes, was adopted after an aggressive lobbying campaign by large tech companies. One of the most logical applications for leveraging the vast troves of personal data routinely harvested by firms like Facebook and Amazon would be intermediation - or connecting customers with lenders for a small finder's fee.  Large technology firms are 'really interested in the intermediation piece, where you have access to all that data,' said Paul Nash, the former senior deputy comptroller and chief of staff under Comptroller Thomas Curry, who began discussing the possibility of a fintech charter early last year. 'All of them are thinking about it.'  The next lobbying objective for big tech is to convince regulators to force banks to provide access to their financial data through an Application Programming Interface, or API, that would allow tech companies like Amazon to create almost instantaneous connections to banks' transaction processing networks, allowing them to take over more consumer-facing businesses.  In summary, while many a think piece has been written about financial services companies and banks trying to become more like technology firms, the irony is that tech firms are also trying to be more like banks.  'There's been lots of interest by financial services firms in technology companies and fintech companies,' said Kevin Petrasic, a partner at White ...se. 'Some tech firms are now looking in the other direction.'

As we all know, O'Rourke narrowly lost to Ted Cruz. But in doing so, he accumulated envious amounts of political capital and goodwill as a happy warrior running more for Texans rather than against Ted Cruz. The guy proved himself to be an undeniably talented campaigner who excelled at evoking a vision of hope, reconciliation and post-partisanship in the Trump era (standby for the inevitable 2008 Barack Obama comparison).  But the fact remains that O'Rourke is a former three-term congressman who wielded no discernible influence in Washington, D.C., before his Senate campaign. </p><p>And while he is by no means the only presidential candidate with a thin rsum, one has to wonder whether what worked for him in Texas in 2018 will translate to a national effort in 2020. First, it's worth considering how we got to this point. On the night of November 6, he became perhaps the most successful losing politician in modern political history and prompted instant speculation when he declared[1] in his concession speech, 'We'll see you out there on down the road.' Since then, Hopelessly Online folks have been tracking his every movement, every statement, every Instagram post, every email blast, trying to suss out his plans for the future. Amid it all were relentless attempts to both convince O'Rourke to challenge longtime Texas Senator John Cornyn and to export his magnetic political persona to the rest of the country.O'Rourke speaks to a crowd in Brownsville during his 'Border Surge' tour. Justin Miller All the while, the former El Paso city councilman played it cool. As he weighed his options, O'Rourke embarked on what can best be described as one part gap year/one part midlife crisis, during which he tried to shake his self-described post-campaign 'funk.' He spent some time with family and friends in El Paso. He went on a road trip and toured a community college in New Mexico and a state university in Oklahoma. He went[2] to the dentist. He wrote discursive personal essays on Medium.com. He wistfully reminisced[3] about his days spent in New York City. He hung out with Oprah.  Yet through all the 'Will he or won't he' intrigue, it was painfully clear that Beto had caught the bug that infects nearly every above-average politician: He wants to run for president. That was confirmed in an exclusive Vanity Fair cover story[4] that ran on Wednesday in which the reporter finally got O'Rourke to admit, 'Man, I'm just born to be in it.' Of course, there was no shortage of political hands and party insiders stroking that ambition. He had met with Obama and has maintained backchannel communication with the former president's top advisers. There's even speculation that a Beto bid was the main thing keeping former Vice President Joe Biden from formally jumping into the race.  Sure, it was fun to see O'Rourke relentlessly ignore the consultant and donor class while they poked and prodded about whether he might be up for some sightseeing in Ottumwa. But it all became a little much after a while. After the weeks stretched into months, the schtick wore thin and even his some of his most fervent supporters grew tired of his malaise. It soon became clear that Betomania might just have an expiration date.  It didn't help that all the rampant presidential speculation fueled suspicion on the left that he would be used as a tool for the neoliberal elites and prompted far more critical national coverage in the months after he lost then he ever drew in the unfathomable number of overwrought profiles about his Senate bid. An explicit O'Rourke-ian ideology has been elusive if not nonexistent. This is the same guy, after all, who told VICE News[5] one year ago that 'I could care less, to be honest with you, about Democrats or the Democratic Party or about parties at all. I'm just going to do my best, give it all I can, and that's all I can focus on.'  In December, one reporter found that he had run afoul[6] of a campaign pledge not to take money from oil and gas executives. Soon after, another journalist almost broke the Internet by doing a thorough accounting[7] of his voting record in the House, which found that while representing one of the bluest districts in the country he had repeatedly cast votes that sided with Republicans on everything from tax policy to Wall Street regulations to his bread-and-butter issue of immigration. Yet another reported[8] on his vote in support of what was seen by critics as a 'Blue Lives Matter' messaging bill. He drew renewed flak[9] in the New York Times for his refusal to back fellow Democratic candidate Gina Ortiz Jones, who was challenging his Republican pal Will Hurd in the swingy district next to his. She lost by fewer than 1,000 votes and Hurd has since declared that he would vote for Trump over Beto. It soon became clear that Betomania might just have an expiration date.  He has flirted with, though never fully embraced, single-payer health care[10]. He has voiced support for Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the Green New Deal, but has not gone so far as to condemn fossil fuel industries that drive his home state's economy. He has forcefully spoken out against the denigration of Latino immigrants, the U.S. borderlands and Trump's proposed wall while also supporting Trump's waiver of polygraph tests for new Customs and Border Protection agents and joined 76 House Democrats in voting for an omnibus bill that included wall funding in 2018.  O'Rourke, who raised a record-breaking $80 million, has a built-in base of national supporters. But will they rally around Beto 2020? That question hinges on how the first Democratic presidential primary of the Trump era pans out. Some believe that the outcome will hinge more on concrete populist stances that Beto has in the past proven allergic to, like whether to abolish private health insurance and replace it with a pure single-payer system, whether to break up Big Tech (to say nothing of Wall Street) and whether to soak the rich via a wealth tax or a 90 percent marginal tax rate.  O'Rourke's ideological amorphousness could prove to be too great a liability. Or, much like Obama's vaguely aspirational platitudes helped catapult him to the presidency, it could prove to be his biggest strength. Democrats won back the House in November by capturing the affluent suburbanites who detest Trump. Now they see a potential path to the White House that doubles down on that demographic in an effort to win Sunbelt states like Georgia, Arizona and even Texas. O'Rourke proved that he had crossover appeal by outperforming Democrats in almost every county, especially rapidly growing suburbs.  Of course, it all depends on how O'Rourke defines himself \u2014 as the voice of the middling Gen X professional in suburban Phoenix, the champion of the factory worker about to bottom out in Kenosha, all of the above or nothing at all.

As we all know, O'Rourke narrowly lost to Ted Cruz. But in doing so, he accumulated envious amounts of political capital and goodwill as a happy warrior running more for Texans rather than against Ted Cruz. The guy proved himself to be an undeniably talented campaigner who excelled at evoking a vision of hope, reconciliation and post-partisanship in the Trump era (standby for the inevitable 2008 Barack Obama comparison).  But the fact remains that O'Rourke is a former three-term congressman who wielded no discernible influence in Washington, D.C., before his Senate campaign. </p><p>And while he is by no means the only presidential candidate with a thin rsum, one has to wonder whether what worked for him in Texas in 2018 will translate to a national effort in 2020. First, it's worth considering how we got to this point. On the night of November 6, he became perhaps the most successful losing politician in modern political history and prompted instant speculation when he declared[1] in his concession speech, 'We'll see you out there on down the road.' Since then, Hopelessly Online folks have been tracking his every movement, every statement, every Instagram post, every email blast, trying to suss out his plans for the future. Amid it all were relentless attempts to both convince O'Rourke to challenge longtime Texas Senator John Cornyn and to export his magnetic political persona to the rest of the country.O'Rourke speaks to a crowd in Brownsville during his 'Border Surge' tour. Justin Miller All the while, the former El Paso city councilman played it cool. As he weighed his options, O'Rourke embarked on what can best be described as one part gap year/one part midlife crisis, during which he tried to shake his self-described post-campaign 'funk.' He spent some time with family and friends in El Paso. He went on a road trip and toured a community college in New Mexico and a state university in Oklahoma. He went[2] to the dentist. He wrote discursive personal essays on Medium.com. He wistfully reminisced[3] about his days spent in New York City. He hung out with Oprah.  Yet through all the 'Will he or won't he' intrigue, it was painfully clear that Beto had caught the bug that infects nearly every above-average politician: He wants to run for president. That was confirmed in an exclusive Vanity Fair cover story[4] that ran on Wednesday in which the reporter finally got O'Rourke to admit, 'Man, I'm just born to be in it.' Of course, there was no shortage of political hands and party insiders stroking that ambition. He had met with Obama and has maintained backchannel communication with the former president's top advisers. There's even speculation that a Beto bid was the main thing keeping former Vice President Joe Biden from formally jumping into the race.  Sure, it was fun to see O'Rourke relentlessly ignore the consultant and donor class while they poked and prodded about whether he might be up for some sightseeing in Ottumwa. But it all became a little much after a while. After the weeks stretched into months, the schtick wore thin and even his some of his most fervent supporters grew tired of his malaise. It soon became clear that Betomania might just have an expiration date.  It didn't help that all the rampant presidential speculation fueled suspicion on the left that he would be used as a tool for the neoliberal elites and prompted far more critical national coverage in the months after he lost then he ever drew in the unfathomable number of overwrought profiles about his Senate bid. An explicit O'Rourke-ian ideology has been elusive if not nonexistent. This is the same guy, after all, who told VICE News[5] one year ago that 'I could care less, to be honest with you, about Democrats or the Democratic Party or about parties at all. I'm just going to do my best, give it all I can, and that's all I can focus on.'

Yet another reported[8] on his vote in support of what was seen by critics as a 'Blue Lives Matter' messaging bill. He drew renewed flak[9] in the New York Times for his refusal to back fellow Democratic candidate Gina Ortiz Jones, who was challenging his Republican pal Will Hurd in the swingy district next to his. She lost by fewer than 1,000 votes and Hurd has since declared that he would vote for Trump over Beto. It soon became clear that Betomania might just have an expiration date.  He has flirted with, though never fully embraced, single-payer health care[10]. He has voiced support for Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the Green New Deal, but has not gone so far as to condemn fossil fuel industries that drive his home state's economy.

Or, much like Obama's vaguely aspirational platitudes helped catapult him to the presidency, it could prove to be his biggest strength. Democrats won back the House in November by capturing the affluent suburbanites who detest Trump. Now they see a potential path to the White House that doubles down on that demographic in an effort to win Sunbelt states like Georgia, Arizona and even Texas. O'Rourke proved that he had crossover appeal by outperforming Democrats in almost every county, especially rapidly growing suburbs.  Of course, it all depends on how O'Rourke defines himself   as the voice of the middling Gen X professional in suburban Phoenix, the champion of the factory worker about to bottom out in Kenosha, all of the above or nothing at all.

Trump <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.blockchaintechnews.com/news/trump-trashes-bitcoin-facebook-libra/\">tweeted out</url> his disapproval of Facebook's Libra and Bitcoin alike.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air. Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity,\" Trump said in a tweet.</p><p>U.S. lawmakers have also been heavily suspicious of cryptocurrency, with members of Congress calling for Facebook to halt development on the cryptocurrency until they can examine it closely. And then, two weeks ago, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.blockchaintechnews.com/news/us-lawmakers-to-question-facebook-on-libra/\">representatives and Senators</url> grilled Facebook executive David Marcus about it.</p><p>\"They're motivated by one thing: surely their own bottom line,\" Sen. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, said in a statement.\u00a0\"Allowing Big Tech companies to take over the payment system or position themselves to influence monetary policy would be a huge mistake.\"</p><p>Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin also\u00a0said\u00a0during a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/18/mnuchin-says-us-will-ensure-bitcoin-doesnt-become-like-anonymous.html\">CNBC interview</url> last month that he would make sure, \"Bitcoin doesn't become the equivalent of Swiss-numbered bank accounts, which were obviously a risk in the financial system.\"</p><p>From these comments, it seems that many lawmakers view cryptocurrency as being a national security issue, and there are a variety of reasons for this perspective.</p><p>\"It's no surprise to see certain US officials align with President Trump on the subject of cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies have boxed technology, economic and governance matters all together,\" Christophe de Courson, CEO of asset management fund Olymp Capital, said in an email. \"Thus, Facebook's Libra is seen as a\u00a0 major threat to the US dollar's supremacy and the role the FED plays in the U.S. economy. \"</p><p>Jose Llisterri, co-founder of cryptocurrency trading platform Interdax, said in an email that a project as large as Libra's could potentially disrupt the U.S. dollar as a global reserve currency, which would certainly qualify as a national security risk.</p><p>On the other hand, Courson believes that regulators are mainly worried about the potential for cryptocurrency to be used for illegal activities and are not looking at the bigger picture of crypto's benefits. However, some experts view this complaint as just being a cover for big banks.</p><p>\"The conflation of cryptocurrency with criminality has become the standard position of big banks because it is their last rhetorical line of defense against a new technology that threatens their stronghold of global financial power,\" Sky Guo, CEO of blockchain platform Cypherium, said in an email. \"Steve Mnuchin, a second-generation career banker and former CIO of Goldman Sachs, has criticized cryptocurrencies in the same week that a shipment owned by his former bank was seized by U.S. Customs authorities for containing over one billion dollars in cocaine. This is far from earnest criticism of our technology.\"</p><p>However, not everyone agrees with this assessment. Lars Seier Christensen, chairman of Concordium, a blockchain network said in an email that is only natural for regulators to take a close eye at the cryptocurrency space.</p><p>\"Regulators would not be doing their job if they did not try to clarify the risks implicit in the cryptocurrency space. Clearly, there are major flaws in the ability to do appropriate KYC and AML monitoring and this has to be a concern for the authorities,\" Christensen said.</p><p>There is a possibility that an early wave of regulation could kill off early adopters, according to Christensen. However, this wave could help the U.S. government nail down the key differences between cryptocurrencies and blockchain and pave the way for mainstream blockchain acceptance.</p><p>\"Blockchain is the real deal, while cryptocurrencies are an accessory oiling the wheels of blockchains. When the cryptocurrency becomes the main item \u2014 like placing the cart in front of the horse \u2014 it falls victim to excessive speculation and sometimes criminal use,\" Christensen said. \"It is essential that we get the message through to politicians that blockchain is a massive growth driver and that with an appropriate design, ID/KYC issues are manageable and in fact, more traceable than in most current business models.\"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"/media/filer_public_thumbnails/filer_public/79/02/79023c22-dfc1-47fa-94df-613b8b3f8a0f/istock-1151040156.jpg__300x170_q85_crop_subsampling-2.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BCTECH-whyiscryptocurrencyseenasanaturalsecurityissue</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BCTECH2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WT5-GMH1-JB5Y-B46V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">439832</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"730\"/><timeReceived>12:27 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Networld Media Group All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>BlockchainTechNews.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 11, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001RKX</classCode><className>GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But it's hardly the only one.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In May 2014, Europe's highest court ruled that citizens have \"the right to be forgotten\" from search engines, which has a disproportionate impact on Google. EU regulators later said the decision should apply beyond EU borders. Facebook faces a class-action lawsuit in Austria over data privacy. Many tech firms are under scrutiny for the tax deals they've gotten.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Taken together, it can often feel that Europe is simply against American big tech. Officials insist this isn't so. Nonetheless, the political, judicial, and private actions against the technology companies does reveal a transatlantic divide - some of it driven by cultural values, the rest of it just the market reality.</p><p>Q: Why is Europe so focused on Google?</p><p>Googleis in many ways a victim of its own success in Europe. In the US, where Googlewas also once under antitrust scrutiny, it is also the No. 1 search engine. There, it takes 67 percent of the market.</p><p>In Europe though, about 90 percent of all searches happen on Google. That means that when users in Europe search for products or restaurant reviews on the web, those competing against Googleare at an even greater competitive disadvantage.</p><p>Q: Is there a cultural component to anti-Googlesentiments?</p><p>Yes. In many ways, Googlehas become the McDonald's of its day - the symbol of hegemony at the hand of an American cultural empire.</p><p>This does not mean that Europeans don't love their mobiles, their Facebook and Twitter accounts, or new forms of socializing and staying in touch. But no matter how willing they are to buy an iPhone, they also routinely say they feel deeply ambivalent about ceding so much power to Silicon Valley.</p><p>Q: So Europe's concerns are primarily about cultural and corporate imperialism?</p><p>No. Even bigger than antitrust or anti-American issues are concerns about privacy. Put simply, Europeans guard privacy more tightly than Americans do. And fear of invasion of privacy is the main driver behind the \"right to be forgotten\" case or pressure on Facebook over its privacy settings or data collection behaviors.</p><p>To be sure, Europe is not a monolith, and attitudes vary greatly between countries. In Germany, where both the Nazi and Stasi apparatuses spied on citizens, often with brutal consequences, privacy is sacrosanct. In Ireland, where the subsidiaries of many of these tech firms are located and those jobs well-appreciated, concerns about intrusion are not as great.</p><p>But Europe and its many privacy watchdogs have come closer together in recent years, especially after the revelations of the extent of American spying revealed by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden.</p><p>Q: So does Europe have its own Google?</p><p>Not yet, though it's not for lack of trying. European companies have made some headway - especially by marketing privacy guarantees with secure e-mail providers or services to store information on personal clouds.</p><p>But Europeans say they've been hampered by the dominant position of American tech firms in the market. And some suspect that Europe's offensive against big tech companies is motivated less by ethics and more by an attempt to simply slant the market in Europe's favor. It's something that even President Obama suggested in a February interview with Re/code.</p><p>\"We have owned the Internet. Our companies have created it, expanded it, perfected it, in ways [Europeans] can't compete. And oftentimes what is portrayed as [Europe's] high-minded positions on issues sometimes is designed to carve out their commercial interests,\" the president said.\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CSM-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CSM2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5FS4-WBY1-DYRK-B2JX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7945</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"624\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Christian Science Publishing Society All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Christian Science Monitor</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"04\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>April 15, 2015 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

This week: Why India banned 59 Chinese apps, South Asia records 1 million coronavirus cases, dangerous floods hit Bangladesh, and a review of the new novel A Burning. If you would like to receive South Asia Brief in your inbox every Thursday, please sign uphere[1]. Why India Banned TikTokOn Monday, India's government announced[2] it would block the use of 59 mobile apps because they were 'engaged in activities prejudicial to [the] sovereignty and integrity of India.' While New Delhi's press release didn't mention Beijing by name, the list of 59 apps\u2014each run by Chinese companies\u2014made clear that it was the intended target. </p><p>The blocked software includes the video-sharing app TikTok, which has been downloaded an estimated 600 million times in India; UC Browser, an internet browser that uses very little data and is popular among Indians using low-cost smartphones; and other well-known apps such as Shareit, Baidu, Weibo, and WeChat. India cited section 69A[3] of its Information Technology Act in its explanation for why it took action. But according to Indian law, it could have kept the decision confidential. Taking a public stand against China was the point. After last month's deadly skirmish with Chinese troops, New Delhi has faced domestic pressure to come up with a robust response. Its options on trade were limited and potentially self-defeating[4], while military options were even more dangerous. China's technological exports were a natural arena to turn to\u2014and one in which India could actually impose some damage. Monday's decision is momentous on its own, but it will also likely spur tit-for-tat actions between the world's two biggest internet markets in terms of users. It may even set a precedent for other countries looking to regulate or ban Chinese tech firms. The impact on China. India is China's biggest external market for apps such as TikTok and UC Browser. While India represents a relatively small source of revenue for Chinese apps, it is still its fastest growing major market. As Indians grow richer, average revenues per user will increase: India's digital advertising market is expected to grow by 26 percent this year, CNN reports[5]. New Delhi's actions close off this market. There may be further action on other Chinese software and hardware, especially 5G products, as Indians become more aware of the potential security threats of Chinese technology. Just this week, for example, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission officially designated[6] Huawei and ZTE as national security threats, effectively barring U.S. internet providers from using federal subsidies to buy their equipment. The impact on India. New Delhi's decision will hurt Indians, too. While the move will please the country's jingoistic media and those calling for revenge after last month's border skirmish, banning TikTok will hurt[7] thousands of Indian content creators who depend on the Chinese app for their livelihoods. Even so, Indian companies such as Roposo, a local alternative to TikTok, may see a surge in interest and new users. Chrome is still the most popular browser app in India, and companies such as Google may also benefit from the blocking of UC Browser. A new era of techno-nationalism? While the immediate impetus for India's actions comes from the border clashes, the app ban itself is not that surprising given the broader trend of countries trying to safeguard their citizens' data. As more Indians come online through cheap smartphones and low-cost data plans, personal data will become more valuable to tech firms and governments alike. Given how intertwined China's biggest companies are with the state, it was only a matter of time before countries such as India imposed their own Great Firewalls. If anything, India may have left it too long, given the inroads made by apps such as TikTok, and the fact that the most popular smartphone brands in India are not just companies such as Huawei and Xiaomi, but also less Chinese-sounding brands such as Oppo, Vivo, and OnePlus. (Vivo is the title sponsor of the popular Indian Premier League cricket series, a relationship that may well now be cut short before next year's tournament.) The question now is how Beijing might retaliate. What We're Following Coronavirus update. South Asia's countries now have more than 1 million confirmed coronavirus cases between them. India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh are among the top 20 countries in the world with the most cases, in fourth, 12th, and 18th places respectively. As shown above, the region's countries have been doubling their total cases between every 14 and 20 days. And with testing rates still low, aggressive contact-tracing is next to impossible. Nonetheless, the region is reopening for business, as leaders begin to accept that some form of herd immunity may be the only solution for people who depend on daily labor. Dangerous monsoon flooding in Bangladesh. Thousands of hectares of farmland in Bangladesh lie submerged from floods triggered by monsoon rains. A disaster management official told Reuters[8] that the crisis could worsen, with more than 200,000 people marooned and more rainfall expected this week. The crisis was exacerbated after the Brahmaputra River burst its banks in the neighboring Indian state of Assam last weekend, flooding thousands of villages in the area. Russia's Afghanistan 'bountygate.' After revelations last weekend that U.S. President Donald Trump may have received intelligence showing that a Russian spy unit[9] was paying the Taliban bounties to kill U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan, there has been fallout in Washington. While Trump says he was not actually briefed on this intelligence, a growing number of voices on Capitol Hill are calling for action[10]. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden said Trump's failure to act was a 'dereliction of duty,' while Trump's former National Security Advisor John Bolton said the news merited 'a very serious response.' It's worth pointing out that that Russia's involvement in Afghanistan should be no surprise. Russian night vision scopes have previously been found in Taliban hands, and U.S. commanders in the region have long admitted that Moscow was arming the Taliban. As Sajjan Gohel and Allison Bailey wrote[11] for Foreign Policy this week, Russian President Vladimir Putin has worked to enhance ties with the Taliban for years, 'with the purpose of expanding its strategic interests in Afghanistan. Once NATO and U.S. forces leave, Russia will once again have an opportunity to step in.' Turbulence ahead for PIA. Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) has been banned[12] from operating in the European Union for the next six months. The decision came after Pakistan grounded[13] 262 airline pilots from PIA and other domestic airlines with allegedly 'dubious' licenses\u2014a finding that emerged after an investigation into a deadly plane crash in Karachi last month.Question of the Week Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan faced criticism this week for using the word 'martyred' to describe the killing of a terrorist. Who was he referring to? A) Osama bin Laden B) Ayman al-Zawahiri C) Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi D) Baitullah Mehsud Scroll down for the answer. What We're Reading A Burning, Megha Majumdar, Knopf, 304 pp., $25.95, June 2020 Megha Majumdar's A Burning is one of the most talked-about novels this summer, and for good reason. As I wrote in a review of the book[14], Majumdar's compelling, timely, and propulsive book 'is soaring up the global bestseller lists thanks in part to its resonance with this summer of discontent and despair, a time when public trust in leadership and Big Tech is dwindling. One reason why A Burning should appeal to readers unfamiliar with India is that the novel is not just a critique of modern Indian society but a universal parable on inequality.' Read the full review here[15].  And the Answer IsA) Osama bin Laden. The former al Qaeda leader was killed in a U.S. raid in Pakistan in 2011, a decade after he masterminded the 9/11 attacks. Discussing the U.S.-Pakistan relationship in a speech in parliament this week, Khan said[16], 'I will never forget how we Pakistanis were embarrassed when the Americans came into Abbottabad and killed Osama bin Laden, martyred him.' Opposition leaders in parliament strongly objected to Khan's remarks: One called bin Laden the 'ultimate terrorist' who 'destroyed' Pakistan.That's it for this week.

In the wake of the alarming undercover documentary, showing workers in Dublin who monitor Facebook material turning a blind eye to underage users, Mr Varadkar was asked if he would listen to appeals from child safety campaigners to fast-track the creation of a Digital Safety Commissioner.</p><p>He replied: 'That's one of the things a lot of work has gone into. Minister Naughten is working on that at the moment.' However, he added: 'A Digital Safety Commissioner in Ireland will not be able to regulate the internet. It is the worldwide web. That's why, if we come up with solutions that are going to involve taxpayers' money and high-paid jobs for people, we need to make sure there is a result.' Last week, he announced modest online safety measures and said: 'I think in fairness to the big tech companies that are active online, any time I meet them; they are very in tune to this issue.</p><p>'They know that failure to act when it comes to online safety is damaging their reputations as companies and potentially damaging their shareholder value in the longer term, and that's the thing with big companies care most about, let's be honest.' However, Government backbencher and chair of the Oireachtas Communications Committee Hildegarde Naughton said that the new revelations require 'a response, not just from the company, but also from legislators'. The Fine Gael TD also said they suggest Facebook is 'compromising social responsibility for financial gain, regardless of the impact this could have on young people'.</p><p>The ISPCC's Director of Policy, Cl\u00edodhna O'Neill, said 'any indication that disturbing content is being left on any social media platform again highlights the need for statutory regulation', while Tanya Ward, of Children's Rights Alliance, said: 'I think the Channel 4 programme proves the reason we need a Digital Safety Commissioner.' And Lorraine Higgins, the new chief executive of the country's largest retail representative body, Retail Excellence, has suspended its partnership with Facebook, which provides training to retailers to enhance their digital strategies. She said they would not be working with Facebook 'until we are satisfied their policies have been overhauled regarding the posting of violent and abusive content for commercial gain'.</p><p>Tuesday night's documentary showed an undercover reporter at Irish firm CPL Resources, to whom Facebook has outsourced the moderation of huge numbers of its pages. Moderators were instructed not to remove extreme, abusive or graphic content even when it violated the company's guidelines, the investigation has found. While nudity is almost always removed, one shocking video showing a man punching and stamping on a screaming child was allowed remain. As were disturbing videos showing a schoolgirl beating up another girl, because they had captions condemning the violence. Racially charged hate speech and images of self-harm among underage users all remained on Facebook after being reported by users and reviewed by moderators.</p><p>Yesterday, the Taoiseach was asked by the Irish Daily Mail if the concept of self-regulation was dead. He replied: 'Facebook has community standards and we expect them to uphold their own standards. The evidence produced by Dispatches is that they haven't on all occasions. That would represent, in my view, a failure of self-regulation.' He said Minister Naughten will meet Facebook management in New York today to discuss the documentary. He also raised the possibility of fines for allowing offensive material stay online but didn't commit himself to such a move.</p><p>'What's of most concern, most shocking and most unacceptable, is that Facebook appears not to have lived up to its own community standards. The very least you expect is people to live up to their own standards,' he said, speaking after a Cabinet meeting in Kerry.</p><p>He added: 'We need to hear a response from Facebook and an explanation from them as to why they haven't upheld their own standards. Now we have to examine legislative mechanisms, whether we can bring in a system of fines to ensure that companies such as this uphold basic standards of decency. It is the worldwide web and it is international, but that is something we have to do.' Minister Naughten said from New York that he had been made aware of the contents of the Channel 4 programme and was 'deeply concerned.' He said it raises serious questions for the company on how it handles reports of harmful or illegal content.' Labour's spokesman on Justice and Children, Se\u00e1n Sherlock said: 'Instead of sticking to their promise and establishing the Digital Safety Commissioner, the Government chose to trust companies who do not have a track record of trust in this area. Ireland is where every tech company that matters is located. To suggest that we have to wait for international best practice to evolve to move on digital safety is a cop out.</p><p>'International best practice has turned out to be international worst practice,' he said.</p><p>Meanwhile, Facebook executives and the Data Protection Commissioner will be called before the Oireachtas Communications Committee following the shocking revelations in the documentary.</p><p>Committee chair Ms Naughton said: 'It is alarming and completely unacceptable that Facebook has apparently breached its own rules by allowing disturbing content to remain online in order to protect and boost revenue. It is sickening and hugely concerning.' She added: 'It is also vital that we look at our own legislation and establish whether there is adequate and appropriate regulation to address the concerns that have emerged in light of last night's programme. The revelations contained in the Channel 4 programme suggest that Facebook is compromising social responsibility for financial gain, regardless of the impact that this could have on young people in particular.</p><p>'This requires a response, not just from the company, but also from legislators, to make sure that the protection of children remains paramount.' Sinn F\u00e9in Communications spokesman Brian Stanley said Facebook's attitude 'indicates yet again, the need for an end to selfregulation in the industry'. However, Justice Minister Charlie Flanagan denied self-regulation was dead, but said tech companies need to do more.

We see it in the pharmaceutical industry, we see it in the airline industry, we see it in Big Tech,\" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn. \"The danger really is that antitrust enforcement is becoming an empty suit. Whether it's lack of wherewithal in resources or lack of authority, I think it's as much a lack of will.\"</p><p>The hearing is among several Senate and House members have held this year - and will likely continue to hold - calling out anticompetitive conduct by tech giants Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple. The urgency to rein in Big Tech has been building after years of complaints about Silicon Valley companies abusing personal data, allowing foreign actors to disrupt elections and employing winner-take-all tactics to eliminate potential rivals. The pressure boiled over this summer with investigations launched by the FTC, Department of Justice, Congress and a joint probe by attorneys general from 48 states.</p><p>On Tuesday, the Wall Street Journal reported on a dossier called Project Voldemort compiled by the startup Snap documenting how the company felt Facebook was trying to thwart competition. The article noted officials at Snap, which operates the Snapchat messaging app, are among the companies talking to the FTC as part of the agency's antitrust probe into Facebook.</p><p>Apparently feeling the heat from Capitol Hill, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg traveled to Washington last week, holding private meetings with President Donald Trump and select senators to discuss their concerns.</p><p>Among those was one of the company's harshest critics, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., who questioned Tuesday the FTC's ability to crack down on Big Tech's alleged anticompetitive tactics.</p><p>\"I'm concerned about the agency's ability to protect the public interest, to protect consumers' interests and to protect competition and make sure that we're getting good healthy competition that actually spurs innovation,\" Hawley said.</p><p>Subcommittee Chairman Mike Lee, R-Utah, also reiterated his frustrations from last week's hearing about how the FTC and Justice Department split up antitrust investigations rather than just one agency handling it. He also cautioned against overzealous regulators and lawmakers unintentionally crushing competition rather than creating it.</p><p>\"There's a bit of a feeding frenzy these days when it comes to antitrust and Big Tech. And while I'm encouraged that the FTC and DOJ are investigating whether the tech giants have violated the antitrust laws, I am also concerned that we might overshoot the mark in our efforts to rein in these firms,\" Lee said in his opening remarks.</p><p>Because of the digital industry's influence on nearly every aspect of daily life and the fact that many of the services companies provide are free to consumers, some of the traditional antitrust solutions - such as breaking up a big firm into several competitors or blocking acquisitions - aren't as clear cut.</p><p>For example, social media users experience benefits when Facebook buys a smaller competitor, like Instagram, as it enlarges the network of people its users can connect with. The acquisition can also enlarge the database of consumer information, which Facebook can then sell to advertisers seeking to target certain consumers.</p><p>Overly aggressive antitrust enforcement could also scare away venture capitalists who provide most of the financing for digital startups and often rely on the sale of a startup to a larger company to provide the return on their investment.</p><p>Patricia Nakache, a general partner at Trinity Ventures, a venture capital firm that finances digital startups, explained to the panel that the small startups are often launched by former employees of the larger firms and more often complement the bigger players and offer products to their customers.</p><p>She said if the government makes it more difficult to provide financing to startups, it could have a \"devastating\" effect on innovation.</p><p>Bruce Hoffman, director of the FTC's Bureau of Competition, calmly fielded the criticism, explaining his team of about 280 lawyers and investigators challenged 42 mergers and tried nine antitrust cases in the past two years.</p><p>\"We work really hard. We do the best we can. But we have limits on what we can do,\" Hoffman said, suggesting his team is sometimes outnumbered 10-to-1 by legal teams representing large corporations the government has taken to court.</p><p>But in the case of Big Tech, of the 700 mergers and acquisitions Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apply and Microsoft participated in since 1987, only one was investigated by the FTC, said Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute, a consumer and business advocacy group that promotes competition.</p><p>\"This record may indicate that agencies are either not finding these transactions raise concerns or they are not comfortable challenging them,\" Moss said.</p><p>While senators and witnesses agreed it's difficult to predict whether a small startup being acquired by a larger player will stifle competition and innovation, Moss and others said the FTC has the ability to retroactively look at past transactions to determine if the players violated antitrust law.</p><p>\"If there is evidence of post-merger harm, the agencies should use their authority to challenge consummated deals,\" Moss said.</p><p>Email: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:mbrown@deseretnews.com\">mbrown@deseretnews.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DESNWS-46156738</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DESNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X4C-WJF1-DY6J-M2JM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">164282</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1009\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Deseret News Publishing Co.</copyright><publicationName>Deseret Morning News (Salt Lake City)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 25, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;
