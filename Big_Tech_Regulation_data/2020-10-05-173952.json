The Senate is likely to render them mere pipe-dreams</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TO BE NOTICED in the crowded Democratic presidential primaries, it helps to toss out a sweeping policy proposal or two. Bernie Sanders, the socialist senator from Vermont, who took this approach in his unsuccessful challenge to Hillary Clinton in 2016, would still like free public college tuition and \"Medicare for All\". After a slow start Elizabeth Warren, the senior senator from Massachusetts, is enjoying a little polling bounce as reward for her proposals to break up big tech firms, impose a wealth tax on the ultra-rich and bring in universal child care. Upstarts have latched onto the strategy, too. Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, would like to pack the Supreme Court with six more justices. Andrew Yang, an entrepreneur with a large online following, has made a universal basic income his defining issue. Actually accomplishing any of these things will prove much harder than advertised, because even if Democrats were to take the White House in 2020, they look unlikely to take control of the Senate.</p><p>It may seem obvious to point out that the eventual Democratic nominee will first have to defeat Mr Trump before remaking the American health-care system. Yet when debating their two dozen (and counting) choices, party activists sometimes sound as if dethroning Mr Trump, whom betting markets now give a 49% chance of re-election, is inevitable. Americans usually like to re-elect their presidents when the economy is doing well. In April the unemployment rate hit a 49-year low. The chance of some presidential meltdown delivering a crushing Democratic victory seems slight. Though Mr Trump remains unpopular\u2014with approval ratings hovering around 42%\u2014his supporters are unyielding. A slew of scandals, from the jailing of his close associates to the caging of migrant children at the border, have had little measurable effect on his popularity.</p><p>Even if Mr Trump lost, the Democrats' less-discussed Senate problem would persist. Although it is theoretically possible for a future Democratic president to assemble cross-party majorities to pass legislation, continued partisan trench-warfare seems more likely. It is difficult to imagine a single Republican voting for a wealth tax. For Matt Bennett of Third Way, a centre-left think-tank, chastened Republicans could revert to being \"partisan but not preposterous\" after Trumpism breaks its hold over the party. The debate might then fall between \"kitchen-table\" ideas, like gradual expansions of health-insurance coverage, which might stand a chance, and \"Brooklyn coffee-shop, thumb-sucker\" ones, like Medicare for All or abolishing the country's immigration-enforcement agency, which would not.</p><p>Democrats would therefore need a working Senate majority to get more ambitious schemes through. Out of 100 senators, 47 are reliable Democrats. To win back control of the chamber, the party would need to pick up a minimum of three seats and also win the presidency (since the vice-president's vote breaks ties). That does not sound too hard, but even a net gain of three seats looks a stretch because of the way the upper chamber over-represents rural America. Though it is early, betting markets rate Democrats' chances of winning a Senate majority at 31%. </p><p>To wrest seats away from incumbents in difficult territory, the party needs high-quality candidates to run. Yet top-tier candidates are instead opting to be second- or third-tier presidential candidates. Beto O'Rourke, who nearly upset Ted Cruz in his run for the Texas Senate, would be the prime candidate to challenge John Cornyn, the state's other Republican senator, but is instead aiming for the White House.</p><p>At least Mr O'Rourke is registering a few percentage points in the polls. The same cannot be said of Steve Bullock, the popular Democratic governor of Montana, who is opting to run for president rather than challenging Steve Daines, the state's lone Republican senator. About 69% of Americans do not yet know Mr Bullock well enough to rate his favourability, according to a recent poll from YouGov.</p><p>Stacey Abrams, who lost a close contest for governor in Georgia, and who has the diary schedule of someone who is running for something, has said she will not stand for the Senate. Even without the distracting draw of the White House, recruiting troubles persist: Josh Stein, the attorney-general of North Carolina, would be the obvious candidate to challenge Thom Tillis, but he has declined. Tom Vilsack, a prominent former governor of Iowa, has ruled out a challenge to Joni Ernst.</p><p>Even if they were to win a narrow Senate majority, that would not automatically result in the kind of new New Deal that Democratic activists seem to dream of. Surmounting the filibuster, which requires a super-majority of 60 votes for legislation, will be impossible without Republican votes. Ms Warren has endorsed eliminating the filibuster, as has Mr Buttigieg. Her Senate colleagues and competitors, Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand and Kamala Harris, are more skittish, even though it is difficult to imagine some of their signature campaign issues\u2014gun control for Mr Booker, paid family leave and abortion rights for Ms Gillibrand, and marijuana legalisation for Ms Harris\u2014attracting eight or so breakaway Republican supporters.</p><p>Many current policy debates would be rendered practically meaningless by divided government, or even by a slim Democratic majority in the upper chamber. A hypothetical President Joe Biden and a President Elizabeth Warren would accomplish much the same in legislative terms, which is to say next to nothing. In that scenario, policy differences over foreign affairs and trade, where the president does have a lot of unilateral power, would matter more. But these are hardly being debated.</p><p>The people chosen by a President Biden or Warren to run the regulatory agencies would push in the same centre-left direction: reversing rollbacks of environmental protections under this administration, creating more expansive definitions of civil rights and pushing anti-trust regulators to be bolder. These are not insignificant powers. But proposals for sweeping social change, the kind that will be offered by candidates in the primary debates, would probably languish in committees.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECON-QG80O1S</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECON2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W8S-H4H1-DY2R-2023-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7955</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1059\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Economist Newspapers Ltd.

The federal government, you may have heard, is on the brink of shutting down tomorrow if Congress can't come to an agreement on funding it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The main stumbling block remains DACA. That's, of course, President Obama's program that gives work permits to illegal immigrants who came here as minors.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Almost all Democrats and many Republicans are pushing for an amnesty for DACA recipients as well as for millions of other illegal immigrants.</p><p>There is a striking fanaticism to their position. Illegal immigrants must be kept in this country at all costs, no matter what. For Democrats, it's understandable because the calculus is simple.</p><p>Having abandoned the concerns of the middle class here, they need millions of new voters and they need them fast. Otherwise, their party risks becoming a permanent minority. Replacing ungrateful citizens with obedient immigrants is their only hope.</p><p>Every Democrat who has thought it through for even a minute knows this well. They can't say it in public, though, because, obviously, it's horrible. So, instead, they are trying a new talking point.</p><p>Illegal immigrants are terrific people, every single one of them, far more noble and law abiding than you are. How dare you complain about their presence? You must be a bigot.</p><p>The one problem with this line of argument is that it's vulnerable to facts. But until recently, there really were few reliable numbers on crimes committed by illegal immigrants, and this allowed Democrats to pretend that every person who sneaks across our border goes on to become a heart surgeon or a member of SEAL Team Six.</p><p>We've got the data now and it turns out - surprise, surprise - they've been lying to you. In the border state of Arizona, for example, illegal immigrants commit 2.5 times as many murders as American citizens do. They are almost 50 percent more likely to be in gangs. They commit more armed robbery and more sex crimes against children. Overall, they are about twice as likely to be convicted of crimes of all kinds, non-immigration related.</p><p>And that's just in one state. In California, an illegal alien named Luis Bracamontes murdered two police officers. Bracamontes had been deported from this country multiple times. In each case, he came back, thanks to politicians who have zero interest in keeping people like him out.</p><p>In court this Tuesday, Bracamontes bragged about his plans to escape from prison and murder more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LUIS BRACAMONTES, CONVICTED MURDERER: I don't (EXPLETIVE DELETED) regret that (EXPLETIVE DELETED). The only thing that I (EXPLETIVE DELETED) regret is that I (EXPLETIVE DELETED) killed two. I wish I (EXPLETIVE DELETED) killed more of those (EXPLETIVE DELETED).</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: So, illegal immigration divides the country. It lowers wages for those who can least afford it. And in some cases, it literally cost Americans their lives.</p><p>So, why are we doing this? Because it's our moral duty. That's what our leaders are telling us. We have to. That's who we are.</p><p>Just days ago, the Senate's most celebrated moral philosopher Lindsey Graham of South Carolina spoke for the country's entire ruling class when he explained the rationale for his views on immigration. Diversity is our strength.</p><p>Now, you've heard that phrase before, obviously. You hear it every day. In effect, it's our new national motto, soon to replace the outdated and, in fact, polar opposite sentiment e pluribus unum.</p><p>Diversity is our strength. It will be in our currency before long. Trust me.</p><p>But what exactly does it mean? You may have noticed that nobody ever bothers to explain exactly what it means. And more pressingly, is it true? The less we have in common, the stronger we are? Is a marriage stronger when spouses have radically different beliefs? Are you closer to your kids when you share no common points of reference? Do you speak the same language as your best friend? Could you be best friends if you didn't?</p><p>These are important questions given that our leaders are radically and permanently changing our country wholly on the basis of their faith that diversity is, in fact, our strength. Maybe we should have talked this through ahead of time. Somehow we didn't.</p><p>House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy tried to start that conversation today. And here is part of what he said.</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R), HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER: We did not survive, grow and become the most powerful civilization in human history because we are focused on our diversity. It is not our differences that makes us stronger. It is our unity despite our diversity. Unity in past, of principles and of the purpose that brought us out of many into one.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: In other words, diversity isn't our strength. Unity is our strength. Don't let the left lie to you. That doesn't mean we have to look alike. It doesn't mean we have to come from the same places.</p><p>It does mean we have to share common beliefs. Otherwise, we'll hate each other and the whole enterprise will fall apart. That's true in families. It's true in friendships. And it's true in countries, too. You already knew that because it's obvious.</p><p>Our leaders spend most of their time denying it. They are lying to us.</p><p>Kate Gallego was a Phoenix City council member. She's running for mayor in that city and she supports the continuation of DACA. She joins us tonight. Kate Gallego, thanks for joining us. Appreciate it.</p><p>KATE GALLEGO, CANDIDATE FOR PHOENIX MAYOR: Thank you so much for having me.</p><p>CARLSON: So, trying to think through how legalizing people who are here illegally helps American citizens. And in Arizona, we have some data on this because it - the state passed, as you know, one of the toughest anti- immigration laws in the country in 2010.</p><p>And the effects of that have been studied. And here is what they showed. There was a short-term labor shortage, obviously. People here to work, they can't work. There was labor shortage. But, over time, automation made up for it and wages went up for American workers.</p><p>Costs meanwhile went down. Prison costs went down. Education costs went down dramatically, by hundreds of millions of dollars. So, given that we know that, why does it help the economy to legalize people here illegally?</p><p>KATE GALLEGO, CANDIDATE FOR PHOENIX MAYOR: Right now, the City of Phoenix is the fastest growing city in the entire country. We added more people in 2016 than any other city and we are constrained by our workforce right now.</p><p>We just had some folks from the homebuilding industry come into the City of Phoenix and say we could do so much more if we had a larger construction workforce. We could be creating jobs. We could be building new affordable homes for people to live in. But we don't have the workforce we need.</p><p>And they said that the point that they really feel like it's changed was not having enough people through immigration.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. Well, a lot of - I bet they feel that way. No, a lot of employers make that case and they mean it. They want, obviously, cheaper labor. I think all employers do. Why wouldn't they?</p><p>But, if that's true, if more legal immigrants make a place richer, then how many specifically do you think Arizona or Phoenix needs? How many illegals do you need in your city to make it richer? Would more be better? How about 10 million? Would that make it even richer?</p><p>GALLEGO: Right now, we are desperately concerned about our DACA recipients who are in our city. Arizona has 28,000 DACA recipients who have been great members of our community, who went to our high schools, were educated here. We have been investing in them for years. Now, they are ready to give back and we are worried about their future right now.</p><p>Our Republican governor has stepped up and said they're an important part of our economy. We want them to stay.</p><p>CARLSON: Right. No, no. But you just said - I just want to get to the nub of it, though, because I think it's a big deal. I mean, once you legalize people. They vote. They bring their relatives. It changes the place, maybe for the better, maybe for the worse. But we should be clear about the effects, I think. I think you'd agree.</p><p>So, if bringing in more people illegally and making them citizens makes you more prosperous, then why wouldn't you bring in 10 million and become really, really rich. Would that work?</p><p>GALLEGO: Immigrants have been amazing contributors to our community.</p><p>CARLSON: Right?</p><p>GALLEGO: If you look at some of the data from forward.us, Mark Zuckerberg's organization -</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, yes. I bet.</p><p>GALLEGO: So many of the entrepreneurs who built our tech economy came here through immigration. And we in Phoenix are desperate for more people in engineering and computer science.</p><p>CARLSON: How many big tech companies were started by people from Central and South America? Latin America?</p><p>GALLEGO: So, right now, I'm sitting in Phoenix, Arizona. Very close to a company called Fortis who was - that was started by a gentleman from Panama. It's one of our top engineering companies in this community and the actually are one of our largest employers of at-risk veterans. A wonderful success story.</p><p>CARLSON: I bet. I bet he is a great guy and the company is great. But how many big tech companies were started by the immigrants that you are talking about since you brought it up? How many?</p><p>GALLEGO: If you look at - we have so many success stories in this community and some of them have gotten national attention.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. So, I just want to be - with respect, look, I'm not attacking immigrants. I like immigrants. I'm sure a lot of these people are great people. But people who live here, who are born here who are citizens have a right to know the effects of this. So, how many is the optimum number? If bringing in people illegally and giving them citizenship makes you more prosperous, what's the ideal number of people we should give citizenship to?</p><p>GALLEGO: Our country and our community was built by immigration.</p><p>CARLSON: OK, you are not.</p><p>GALLEGO: We have so many stories in this community.</p><p>CARLSON: So, I know stories. But I am looking for facts. And I think it's fair to ask for facts. So, John Lotte, who is a researcher, a social scientist, got ahold of the conviction numbers which the government of the State of Arizona has hidden from the population because it's lying to the population about the effects of immigration, as you know.</p><p>And he found that illegal immigrants in the State of Arizona were more than twice as likely to commit murder and, overall, far more likely to commit crimes of all kinds. Not immigration crimes, but violent and property crimes.</p><p>So, given that, those are facts, how can you reassure the residents, the legal residents of Arizona of all backgrounds that this is good for them. I don't understand.</p><p>GALLEGO: We in cities throughout our community have seen great success stories when people feel like they can work with the police department and there is trust. So, we have had folks who did not have legal immigration status, but were willing to work with our police department and have been very important in helping us, particularly, with drug-related crimes.</p><p>CARLSON: But do you acknowledge - do you acknowledge the reality of what I just said. So, this study which got ahold of Arizona's state numbers, which I think are legitimate, says that people illegally in Arizona are far more likely to commit serious crime. Do you not believe that? Or are you just ignoring it or what's your response to that?</p><p>GALLEGO: So, I just received the arrest and crime data from the last calendar year 2017 for the City of phoenix. And that wasn't what we found in the City of Phoenix. Unfortunately, violent crime was led by people who live here and who were born here.</p><p>CARLSON: That's not the question. Were people who were there illegally more likely or less likely to commit serious crimes in the City of Phoenix? Are you really saying they were less likely? I don't think that's what the numbers show.</p><p>GALLEGO: Our 2017 numbers tell a very different story than the story that that researcher is telling you.</p><p>CARLSON: So, are you saying - just to be totally clear because we're almost out of time, are you saying that you've seen numbers that in the City of Phoenix people here illegally were less likely to commit serious crimes than citizens? Is that what you are saying? I just want to get you on the record.</p><p>GALLEGO: We need comprehensive immigration reform.</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, you are slipping out of the question. I am asking a very simple question and you are not giving me a real answer and I think that tells the whole story. Thanks for joining us. I appreciate it.</p><p>GALLEGO: Thanks for having me.</p><p>CARLSON: Democrats apparently realized that cutting off paychecks for military servicemen on behalf of millions of people here illegally might be a hard sell to voters. For months, we have been hearing that the government could shut down if Republicans refuse to continue DACA without any concessions.</p><p>In November, for example, Congressman Luis Gutierrez bluntly said we want a clean DREAM Act in return for funding the government. In other words, just give them amnesty.</p><p>Just a week ago, \"The Washington Post\" was totally unambiguous on this question. \"The thorniest issue,\" they said, \"holding up funding agreement was Democrats' demand that DACA recipients be protected.\" Everyone knew that, no one denied it.</p><p>And yet, oddly, with the Shutdown imminent, Democrats are abruptly changing their story. The issue, they say, now is healthcare, somehow. Today, Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said the real issue is that the Republicans won't permanently extend the CHIP program. That's the federal health insurance. \"This isn't about DREAMers,\" she said during a press conference at the Capitol, \"this is about what isn't there to help meet the health needs of the American people.\" Does anyone really believe that line? No, no one believes that because it's not true.</p><p>Well, America isn't the only country with a major political split over the question who comes in and under what circumstance. It's not the only country where its leaders baldly lie to its own people about the effects of that immigration.</p><p>Yesterday, for example, in Sweden, a police station was hit by a grenade attack. That's more common than it has been. Explosive attacks have, well, exploded in the past few years as Sweden has welcomed a massive number of immigrants into its once famously placid society.</p><p>This has caused a lot of effects, some of them political. We recently spoke to a man called Hanif Bali. He's an Iranian immigrant to Sweden, who, maybe unlikely as it is, has become a leader, a celebrated one, in the push for tougher immigration laws there. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CARLSON: What is the problem with Sweden's immigration system now?</p><p>HANIF BALI, IRANIAN-SWEDISH POLITICIAN: So, there are many problems. It's very hard to define one. But the biggest problem is the amount of immigrants that are coming in.</p><p>In the last couple of years, we have taken in about 250,000 asylum seekers. And for comparison, that would be like America taking in about 8 or 9 million asylum seekers. This is people that Sweden provides housing, healthcare, schooling, and all these big - a lot of these expensive services that the Swedish welfare system gives to people.</p><p>This has created, of course, a lot of huge costs in the short run for the Swedish system, but also when we look at long term, what we're seeing now with crime and poverty is the effects of having a very lax migration system for 10, 15 years ago.</p><p>And what we're seeing now with basically ghettos and street gangs, which is a phenomenon that hasn't been - never even heard of in Sweden and also jihadists traveling abroad, et cetera. These are problems that are new to Sweden.</p><p>And Sweden's system is not capable of - it's not capable and is not designed to handle these problems. For example, in unemployment, I mean, in 2006, about 20 percent of people unemployed were immigrants and foreign born. Today, that number is up to 60 percent. So -</p><p>CARLSON: You are an immigrant from a Muslim family, and yet you have taken a hardline against Muslim immigration, mass immigration from Muslim countries. What's the response been to you?</p><p>BALI: If we want to help people, and that is truly what we want to do, you cannot put so much pressure to the system that the system collapses under its own weight.</p><p>And the response I have been having - because I'm merely putting the statement out, that saying, look, there is a limit to how many people you can take in, have been to call me basically Uncle Tom, house (EXPLETIVE DELETED). I have been compared to Dr. Mengele.</p><p>And this is not from random people on the street. These are people who have prominent posts in parties, in the left, in newspapers. And this is, of course, because I don't tell them the wishful thinking that they want to hear.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. Well, we are very familiar with that in this country. You are a brave man. And we wish you luck. Thank you for joining us tonight.</p><p>BALI: Thank you.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CARLSON: That man could be the next prime minister of Sweden.</p><p>Nancy Pelosi says the Republican Party want to foist something repulsive on America, so repulsive probably not going to describe it on the air tonight. She said she might back support a government shutdown in response. Mark Steyn here to clear the air on that question. Stay tuned.</p><p>CARLSON: Congress is on the brink of a shutdown literally tomorrow. Nancy Pelosi won't admit that because that would be admitting the Democrats are shutting the government down because Republicans refuse to legalize people here illegally.</p><p>She is claiming Democrats want to shut the government down because the Republican Party is trying to do something repulsive. Here's her explanation.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: This is like giving you a bowl of doggy doo and put a cherry on top and call it a chocolate sundae. This is nothing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Meanwhile, over at \"CNN\", Chris Cuomo says the Republican Party is guilty of the horrifying sin of vilifying people who snuck into our country and are demanding rights and money. Here he is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS CUOMO, \"CNN\" ANCHOR: You guys have a pretty intentional effort to make illegal immigrants, as you call them, monsters. You put out this DHS report today that fictionalizes the risk of terror that is represented by people who come into this country illegally. We understand that that's against the law. We understand it has to stop. But why make them all into villains?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Mark Steyn is an author and columnist and an actual thinker and he joins us tonight.</p><p>So, Mark, when people like the guy we just showed put air quotes around the phrase illegal immigrant, what does that mean? Are you not allowed to admit they are immigrating illegally?</p><p>MARK STEYN, AUTHOR: Yes. I think he doesn't recognize that category. What's interesting is that both he and Nancy Pelosi and others on that side of the aisle are getting ever more explicit in their preference for illegal immigrants, so-called, as he would say, over American citizens.</p><p>He said - Chris Cuomo went on to say that the real problem is white supremacists in America. They are the real monsters. Not these nice, hard-working illegal immigrants. And that may be well and true.</p><p>I mean, for the purposes of argument, let's say he is right. It's irrelevant. The white supremacists are American citizens. The illegal immigrants are people who shouldn't be here.</p><p>And every - the organizing principle of nation states is that they're organized on behalf of their citizens, whether they are citizens, or cheerleaders, or white supremacists or whatever. You're stuck with them.</p><p>And this preference that Nancy Pelosi and Chris Cuomo and increasing people have for actually importing a class of citizen that they prefer to the ones they are stuck with is actually very revealing.</p><p>CARLSON: But how can you lead a country whose population you despise? I mean, would you be a good parent if you hated your kids? Would you be an effective officer if you didn't care about the safety of your men? I mean, doesn't that kind of, prima facie, show that you are not ready to lead if you don't love the people you are leading?</p><p>STEYN: No. I mean, you said what about parents and kids. Every family, I think it was Malcolm Muggeridge who said that friends are God's apology for relatives. In other words, you pick your friends. You're stuck with your relatives.</p><p>The Democrats are getting very close to saying that foreigners are God's apology for Americans. Nancy Pelosi has explicitly said that we should thank the parents of these so-called DREAMers, these DACA people for bringing them here illegally.</p><p>And, in fact, to go back to what your Swedish guest was saying, whatever the economic benefits, which are minimal and are not evenly distributed, the cultural transformation, which is what's happening in Sweden, other parts of Europe, and is what's happening in Arizona too, that's forever.</p><p>In Arizona, a majority of the grade school children now are Hispanic. That means Arizona's future is as an Hispanic society. That means, in effect, the border has moved north. And the cultural transformation outweighs any economic benefits that that lady was talking about.</p><p>CARLSON: It's at the very least bewildering for people who grew up here and that's real. I don't think you have to be animated by hate or anything to say maybe I should have some say in how my country evolves.</p><p>Mark, thank you very much.</p><p>STEYN: Thanks a lot, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: More evidence tonight that the Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock may not have acted alone. Not a conspiracy theory. There is evidence of that. Tonight, one person, fresh off walking the crime scene, has news on that investigation. Our continued look at that continues next.</p><p>CARLSON: Almost four months since the Las Vegas shooting, the worst in modern American history. Still many mysteries and some new developments in that case.</p><p>Just two days ago, a lawyer for the Las Vegas police indicated new charges could be forthcoming. Odd. Since the only suspect is dead. Detectives, though, saying very little.</p><p>Catherine Lombardo was an attorney representing the victims of Las Vegas. She joins us along with Republican Congressman Scott Perry of Pennsylvania who says he has got concerns about how this is going.</p><p>First to you, Catherine. What do you know?</p><p>CATHERINE LOMBARDO, ATTORNEY REPRESENTING THE VICTIMS OF LAS VEGAS SHOOTING: Yes, we had court two days ago. It was the hearing for the press where they asked the court to release the search warrants, the affidavits and all of the returns, which means all of the evidence, right?</p><p>And so, what we heard was quite shocking and quite surprising. Now, you have to remember that Sheriff Lombardo with the Las Vegas Metro Police has told us at his briefings that Stephen Paddock was the lone shooter. He was the only shooter.</p><p>However, at the hearing, we heard two things. One, that there will be no indictments coming for any murder or shooting. However, they are investigating other charges and crimes. They wouldn't say who. They wouldn't say what.</p><p>The entire courtroom took a gasp and looked up and went silent for a second. Even the judge reacted and the judge said something like, OK, without telling me who or what, are you saying to me that there will be other charges forthcoming?</p><p>And the lawyer for the police said, yes, there are other charges being investigated. The judge pressed him on that and he said within 60 days.</p><p>So, what the judge did, she asked him for further supplemental briefing to explain to her what that contains, who it is, what it's about.</p><p>You see, we're asking, and the press is asking, for the documents, the evidence to be released since there is no ongoing criminal investigation.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, that would be nice and answer basic questions such as how was an interior door locked inside the hotel suite.</p><p>Congressman, you are the only member of Congress I'm aware of who has taken a public position asking questions about this. What are your questions?</p><p>REP. SCOTT PERRY (R), PENNSYLVANIA: Well, I smell a rat like a lot of Americans do. Nothing is adding up. It's been four months, as you said.</p><p>We don't even - the man is dead. They said, he is a lone gunman, lone shooter, yet we can't get the autopsy results.</p><p>But even more troubling than that, recently, I've been made aware of what I believe to be credible evidence or credible information regarding potential terrorist infiltration through the southern border regarding this incident.</p><p>CARLSON: Terrorists?</p><p>PERRY: Yes, sir.</p><p>CARLSON: Connections. OK. So, what's the outline of that?</p><p>PERR: Well, they could be - let's face it, ISIS - twice before the attack, ISIS warned the United States that they would attack Las Vegas, I think, in June and August. And then, after the attack, claimed responsibility four times.</p><p>Meanwhile, the local law enforcement investigative services are telling us there is no terrorist connection, lone gunman. Again, something is not adding up.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, that's part of my confusion. Catherine, can you just confirm that this investigation is still being overseen by state and local authorities rather than federal?</p><p>LOMBARDO: That's right. The FBI and the Las Vegas Metro Police Department have been conducting the investigation. We have seen no evidence of a terrorist attack.</p><p>And I will ask, with all due respect, congressman, unless you have specific evidence to back that up, it seems a bit irresponsible to make that allegation. So, if you do - or make that assertion. If do you have any evidence of that, I'm asking you right now to share it with us and tell us what that is.</p><p>My clients -</p><p>PERRY: I'm not able -</p><p>LOMBARDO: My clients, victims, all 22,000 people have been waiting and waiting and waiting for evidence.</p><p>CARLSON: Got it. Let's let the congressman respond to that.</p><p>PERRY: We've all been waiting. I'm waiting, too. Like I said, nothing adds up. And I'm just telling you, I have received what I feel to be, and believe to be, credible evidence of a possible terrorist nexus.</p><p>LOMBARDO: What is it?</p><p>PERRY: And we're going to have to wait until that situation develops.</p><p>CARLSON: So, Catherine, congressman - hold on. Slow down for one second. I'm not taking a position on this either way. But I want to dig down a little bit here.</p><p>If that is your belief, does Congress have a role to play in this?</p><p>PERRY: I don't know that Congress has a role. But I think who does have a role is the National Counter Terrorism Center. And as ISIS claims - if ISIS warns about an attack and then an attack occurs and then claims responsibility after the fact -</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>PERRY: It seems to me that, at a minimum, they should have some portion of the investigation to clearly debunk that claim, and yet it hasn't happened.</p><p>CARLSON: So, tomorrow - we are unfortunately out of time, but we will be taking a press conference tomorrow out of Las Vegas by the investigators. Hopefully, we're going to learn more and, hopefully, speak to both of you again on this. Thank you both very much.</p><p>A powerful lobbying group wants to roll back a lot of the Republican Party's recent tax cut for middle class. We invited them on to discuss the plan. They refused. Of course, we will discuss it anyway. That's next.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, \"CNN\" doesn't like America's government very much, which you'll quickly learn if you watch that channel, not that we would recommend it, obviously.</p><p>But that doesn't mean \"CNN\" doesn't like foreign governments. Boy, do they. Ever see their overseas programming? It is packed with unfiltered propaganda from various authoritarian regimes around the world. Regimes that \"CNN\" presumably has business deals with.</p><p>Consider CNN's relationship with Turkey. Nominally, Turkey is an American ally. It's a member of NATO. Yet, the Turkish President Erdogan routinely attacks the United States in far harsher terms than, say, the Government of Russia ever does.</p><p>Just three days ago, President Erdogan accused this country of forming a 30,000-strong terrorist army in Syria to attack Turkey. Huh?</p><p>He's also said, it's \"very clear\" the US supports ISIS and he says he has video evidence to prove that. Now, that's lunatic rhetoric and it's also dangerous.</p><p>Yet, no matter what he does, or says, President Erdogan can rely on totally sympathetic coverage from \"CNN Turk\". That's \"CNN's\" network in Turkey, its Turkish broadcast outlet.</p><p>\"CNN Turk\" broadcast ever Erdogan speech in its entirety even as it denies a platform to Turkey's increasingly besieged opposition parties. Now, the network, \"CNN Turk\" accused an American professor with no evidence at all of helping to orchestrate a failed 2016 coup against President Erdogan.</p><p>That's a claim that echoes precisely one of the Turkish's governments most fervent talking points. One informed independent Turkish journalist says that \"CNN\" \"amplifies the hateful and xenophobic narrative of the Erdogan regime.\"</p><p>The question, we think might be interesting to get an answer to, is how much is \"CNN\" making in exchange for spewing one side of the authoritarian propaganda on behalf of a hostile foreign power? We contacted \"CNN\" to find out. We have not yet received an answer, but, of course, we'll let you know when we do.</p><p>If you're a middle-class conservative, you probably grew up thinking the Chamber of Commerce was on your side, standing up for small business, pushing back against pointless regulation and faculty lounge socialism. That's probably the Chamber of Commerce you remember.</p><p>Well, here's an idea from the new and definitely not improved Chamber of Commerce. Higher gas taxes. In order to fund federal infrastructure spending, the Chamber of Commerce is pushing an additional $0.25 a gallon fee on gasoline. That's more than double the overall federal gas tax.</p><p>So, who exactly would pay that tax? Not rich Hillary voters in cities. They take car services, Uber, or ride the subway. Not the poor, they don't drive much. No. The people who will pay this tax that the Chamber is pushing and who will feel the pain of it are middle class Americans who drive to work.</p><p>So, if you make 60 grand a year and commute more than 10 miles to your job, this is going to hurt you.</p><p>Does the Chamber of Commerce care about that? We invited them on this program to explain themselves. They declined. Maybe they were exhausted from lobbying for that massive corporate tax cut last month. We will keep you posted.</p><p>Time for \"Final Exam\". Leland Vittert who defeated Shannon Bream is back. Will he keep his winning streak alive? And can you outperform our hardened news professionals in summing up the news of the week? We'll be right back.</p><p>CARLSON: Time now for \"Final Exam\" where we pit two hardened news professionals against one another in a gladiator style match to see who has been paying more attention at work this week.</p><p>Last week, you will remember that \"America's News Headquarters\" host Leland Vittert ended Shannon Bream's legendary nine-match winning streak. Can he start a streak of his own tonight? That's the question.</p><p>His challenger, \"Fox News Headlines 24/7\" reporter Carley Shimkus, the pride of New York City.</p><p>They join us, both, tonight on set.</p><p>CARLEY SHIMKUS, REPORTER, \"FOX NEWS HEADLINES 24/7\": Not even close to nervous.</p><p>CARLSON: Are you ready? Not close to nervous, I love it.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Feeling confident.</p><p>CARLSON: Are you? Do you know the rules?</p><p>SHIMKUS: Let's refresh.</p><p>CARLSON: Here they are. Hands on buzzers. I'm going to ask the questions. The first one to buzz in gets to answer the question. You have to wait till I finish asking the question before you buzz in. Each correct answer is worth a point.

The two countries have agreed to come together to create a single team for which women's sport? Carley?</p><p>SHIMKUS: Figure skating.</p><p>CARLSON: Figure skating.

Can that be a new rule?</p><p>CARLSON: I'm not in charge here. We've got a room full of accountants.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Yes. We could brainstorm here and think of something new.</p><p>CARLSON: And, unfortunately, we can't count that. Nice try, though.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Question two. You are about to see the image of a car dangling off the second floor of a dental office. Crazy dash cam footage of that incident went viral on the Internet this week. The question is, how did the car get there? Carley?</p><p>SHIMKUS: OK. A little bit of a back story. The guy was arrested. He received a DUI. He flew over the median. And because of the trajectory, ended up in the second story of that dental office.</p><p>CARLSON: Wow! That's quite an answer.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Everybody, I believe, walked away unscathed.</p><p>CARLSON: Let's see if the tape reflects that. To the tape.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This happened in Santa Ana. Look at that. They hit that medium. And then the car, as you saw, went airborne and landed right into the second floor of a dental office. The car, there you see it, dangling right off that building.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHIMKUS: I said that a little (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>VITTERT: I think she said the right word, median.</p><p>CARLSON: And he walked away?</p><p>SHIMKUS: Yes. There was nobody in the dental office, I believe, and he was, of course, arrested. But he's OK. Minor injuries.</p><p>CARLSON: (INAUDIBLE). OK, so you are back to even where it stays as status quo, par, zero to zero.</p><p>VITTERT: There's three left.</p><p>CARLSON: Question three.</p><p>SHIMKUS: That's good to know.</p><p>CARLSON: A medical briefing, a televised one for 58 minutes, revealed this week that the president is indeed healthy. But that didn't stop reporters from fat shaming him. One \"NBC\" producer asked Trump to prove his weight with a very strange request. What was it? Carley?</p><p>SHIMKUS: Step on a scale.</p><p>CARLSON: I don't believe that.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Let's see.</p><p>CARLSON: To the tape.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST, \"THE INGRAHAM ANGLE\": A member of NBC's investigative unit tweeted out this gem. \"Seeing a lot of skepticism over the idea that @realDonaldTrump weighs only 239 pounds. Would he step on a scale in public to prove it?\"</p><p>He will do that when reporters and anchors agree to public lie detector tests during their broadcasts or after their broadcasts.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHIMKUS: That's like a prize match.</p><p>VITTERT: There you go.</p><p>CARLSON: Amazing.</p><p>SHIMKUS: All right.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. Step on a scale. I would not have guessed that. Question four, the temperature rises on the set. Google, which is a large search engine company, just released a new app that has become popular. The app takes your selfie, a picture of you, and compares it to what?</p><p>SHIMKUS: Portraits.</p><p>CARLSON: Portraits?</p><p>SHIMKUS: Yes. So, museum - famous museum pictures, paintings and portraits found in museums, I believe.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, that's bizarre. Does the tape reflect portraits - famous portraits in museums.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST, THE FIVE: Your image could already resemble a work of art on the walls of a museum somewhere. This is located in the ARMA Museum in Indonesia and it is a very famous painting.</p><p>KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, FOX NEWS HOST, THE FIVE: Fabulous. I like it.</p><p>GREG GUTTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST, THE FIVE: I'm not even trying. This is such BS. I did mine on my own and this is what I came up with.</p><p>This is so sad that you're so lonely and needy that you're going to let Google user your face.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) SHIMKUS: The reason I knew that is because I actually did it this week. And the portrait I received that resembled me the most, I got a 60 percent match, was that of a bald man.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, let's see. I think actually we did it, too. Let's see what we came up with.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Is that me? I don't know how I feel about that.</p><p>CARLSON: We also did Leland. This is the poet Robert Burns.</p><p>VITTERT: Oh, wow! He looks smarter than me. Did they do you, Tucker?</p><p>CARLSON: Actually, I'm not aware of - yes. And that's -</p><p>CARLSON: He does have very nice hair. So, you guys -</p><p>VITTERT: I think they just took our, like, Fox ID badges.</p><p>CARLSON: They may have from the 90s.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. Last question. It's multiple choice. Actress and comedienne Betty White had a birthday yesterday. She credits her longevity to her love of hot dogs and vodka. Naturally. How old is Betty White? Is she 86? B, is she 90? Or C, is she 96 years old.</p><p>SHIMKUS: She is 86 years old.</p><p>CARLSON: She is 86 years old says Carley. To the tape, we go.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Very, very happy birthday for a very golden girl. Betty White, everybody. Turns 96 years young today.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHIMKUS: Did I get that right?</p><p>CARLSON: No, she's 96. Off by ten years.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Remember the six?</p><p>CARLSON: That didn't prevent you from winning 1-0. It's the lowest score ever recorded, but still an impressive showing.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Thank, God.</p><p>VITTERT: Congratulations! Very nice. I will say to you what Shannon said to me in the Green Room a couple minutes ago. She said, you only have eight more championships to win before she will come back for a challenge. CARLSON: Rising like Lazarus. OK. So, you win the coveted mouth breather mug.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Oh, is that really for me? I can take it home.</p><p>CARLSON: You're going to be the most popular person in the break room.</p><p>SHIMKUS: This is fantastic.</p><p>CARLSON: Congratulations, Carley Shimkus.</p><p>SHIMKUS: (INAUDIBLE). I get a mug?</p><p>CARLSON: You do. Dishwasher safe. Thank you. Leland, thank you. You were the giant killer. History will record that.</p><p>Tune in next week for another \"Final Exam\". Keep studying the news all week long, so you can see how you do against our hardened news professionals. We'll be right back.</p><p>CARLSON: You saw the accidental ballistic missile warning over the weekend. But they're not the only shoddy things going on in the government in Hawaii.</p><p>News coverage of the state's emergency alert office revealed that one of the office's employees keeps a computer password written on a post-it note on a monitor and it's visible in the picture.</p><p>Greg Gutfeld co-hosts \"The Five\". His wife was in Hawaii during that false alarm and he joins us now to express his horror and amazement of what happened.</p><p>GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST, \"THE FIVE\": Alayna called me right after it happened and she just said - the way she explained things, it was like a complete - it was crazy town. It was nuts. And she told me that if it was real, that she probably would die. And I said I would never marry again. I might live with a model, but I wouldn't marry.</p><p>CARLSON: But isn't your wife already a model?</p><p>GUTFELD: No, no, no. She is a designer. I said I would visit her wherever she was laid to rest, provided it was near the surf and it's a decent restaurant.</p><p>CARLSON: What did she say? So, those would be your last words to her.</p><p>GUTFELD: I'm joking, but I've got to tell you, she was so lucky I wasn't there because she is pretty calm. I'm the kind of person in a disaster movie that the hero slaps. You know, get yourself together. I'm the guy that eats all the rations on the first day. I'm not even that hungry.</p><p>But Alayna was very calm. And it was not a fun experience. She watched mothers weeping over the phone about - because they are not going to see their kids again. And she saw families dragging their children crying. It was absolute chaos.</p><p>CARLSON: So, this is a sincere question, though. That's a profound experience. Most people don't face imminent death in their lifetime.</p><p>GUTFELD: Exactly.</p><p>CARLSON: And people who do are changed by it. I mean, that's real. Was she changed by it? Do you think the state is going to be different? I'm not joking at all.</p><p>GUTFELD: Do you think the state is different or do you think she is different?</p><p>CARLSON: The people who went through this.</p><p>GUTFELD: I don't know. Because here is the big problem and I said this on \"The Five\". We don't care about enough about these events because nothing happens. A close call is almost no different than it actually happening.</p><p>But as a human being, we don't see it that way. So, it's almost a distant memory. In the same way that we don't talk about Vegas anymore. Vegas didn't have a part two. So, we parted ways with that story. And this story has no part two.</p><p>We don't know what's going on right now. So, we have moved on. And plus, there is a lot of news going on. I think this is a really, really important story.</p><p>The Hawaii Emergency Management, I mean, they put - you don't put a missile notification menu next to your Don Ho playlist. This is serious business. You don't just reassign somebody. You got to look at the whole system.</p><p>And as long as we - if we don't put pressure on this, it will go away and nothing will change. And they have to take this seriously. And I talk to people - a lot of people who were there afterwards and they were - they had - they had changed.</p><p>Because when you live an event like that, you never forget that you thought your family was going to die. You never forget that.</p><p>CARLSON: And there is upside in that actually. It puts things in perspective. I'm not making light of this. It's horrifying. And I'm glad I didn't go through it, but I think there is a blessing in there.</p><p>GUTFELD: I'm glad I wasn't there. I would have embarrassed myself beyond belief.</p><p>CARLSON: I don't know about that.</p><p>GUTFELD: I panic when I have gas. My wife would have left me if we had lived.</p><p>CARLSON: I'm sure she'll be greatly - Alayna was pretty great already. Greg Gutfeld, thank you for that. Good to see you.</p><p>GUTFELD: Good to see you.</p><p>CARLSON: We're out of time sadly. You can tune in tomorrow night at 8:00 to the show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink. You can DVR it if you are ready to dive into the technical aspects of that.</p><p>Good night from Washington.

Not a single one took the opportunity.</p><p>Instead, Warren was allowed to dominate the crowded debate with her policy ideas, giving an energetic performance that seemed to leave voters with two options. Do they want her transformative proposals, which would essentially remake the American economy? Or will they favor the more incremental change embodied on stage by such candidates as New Jersey Senator Cory Booker or Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota?</p><p>It was the first act of a two-night, 20-candidate spectacle that will introduce millions of Americans to the choir of Democrats seeking to take on Trump, and Warren seemed to float above the fray, while lesser-known candidates tangled with each other instead of her.</p><p>During the first half of the debate, moderators ticked off the policy plans that have formed the spine of Warren's campaign and gave her so much time to speak early on that Hawaii Representative Tulsi Gabbard registered a complaint from her Twitter account.</p><p>Warren easily distilled the tenets of six months of campaigning into the 60-second time slots set by moderators trying to keep control over the crowded stage, using them to lay out her vision to imbue American life with new taxes and extensive government regulations.</p><p>\"When you've got a government, when you've got an economy that does great for those with money and isn't doing great for everyone else, that is corruption, pure and simple,\" Warren said, as the audience applauded. \"We need to call it out.\"</p><p>Meanwhile the candidates trying to climb up from the bottom of the polls talked over each other, traded barbs, and even tangled with the moderators in an attempt to blurt out a few extra words during their precious few moments on screen, giving parts of the evening a freewheeling feel that highlighted the more chaotic elements of a primary bursting with candidates.</p><p>Yet their extended exchanges on topics such as health care reform and immigration underscored that the party is far from agreed on the issues that will likely dominate next year's contest with Trump.</p><p>Warren's endorsement of Medicare for All \u2014 a marquee idea from Sanders that she has previously seemed reluctant to fully embrace \u2014 brought the candidates' differences on health care into sharp relief, even if the other contenders avoided criticizing her personally.</p><p>\"What they're really telling you is they just won't fight for it,\" Warren said of candidates who failed to back the sweeping measure. \"Health care is a basic human right and I will fight for basic human rights.\"</p><p>But later, Klobuchar, who has cast herself as the Midwestern pragmatist of the race, said she had reservations about the proposal.</p><p>\"I am just simply concerned about kicking half of Americans off their health insurance in just four years,\" Klobuchar said.</p><p>And Trump himself was rarely mentioned, with candidates focused more on revealing details of their biographies and their ideas to transform the country.</p><p>It was the first presidential debate stage to ever hold so many women \u2014 a point Klobuchar wryly emphasized when Jay Inslee touted his efforts to protect abortion rights as the governor of Washington state.</p><p>\"There are three women up here who have fought pretty hard for a woman's right to choose,\" Klobuchar said.</p><p>Every candidate seemed to have a different goal onstage, giving the debate an awkward friction at times.</p><p>For former Texas Representative Beto O'Rourke, it was an attempt to recapture the buzz he generated when he entered the race earlier this year after narrowly losing a Senate race to incumbent Republican Ted Cruz. O'Rourke started the debate by speaking in Spanish, and tried to use soaring rhetoric to describe his immigration plan, saying \"We should not build walls, we should not put kids in cages.\"</p><p>But he was interrupted by former Housing and Urban Development secretary Julian Castro, who has staked his candidacy on the issue of immigration and has called for the repeal of part of a federal law that criminalizes migration.</p><p>\"If you did your homework on this issue, you would know we should repeal that section,\" Castro told O'Rourke as Warren's head flitted back and forth between the fellow Texans arguing on both sides of her.</p><p>With several of the race's upper-tier candidates \u2014 including former vice president Joe Biden, California Senator Kamala Harris, and Sanders \u2014 clustered on Thursday night, Wednesday's debate felt like something of an opening act.</p><p>But that gave Warren, who has been steadily rising in the polls, an opening to show off her policy ideas without the temptation of tangling with her most imposing rivals. She stood in the center of the stage, flanked byBooker and O'Rourke.</p><p>The moderators asked other candidates about her plan to break up big tech companies.</p><p>When they asked her if she was picking winners and losers in the American economy, she did not deny it.</p><p>\"There is way too much consolidation now in giant industries in this country,\" Warren said. \"What's been missing is courage. Courage in Washington to take on the giants.\"</p><p>But they also pressed her on whether she had a plan to implement all of her proposals \u2014 especially given inevitable opposition from the likely Senate majority leader come 2021, Republican Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.</p><p>\"I do,\" Warren said, letting some of her precious seconds tick away as she grinned.</p><p>\"We have to push from the outside, have leadership from the inside, and make this Congress reflect the will of the people,\" Warren said.</p><p>Candidates repeatedly declined to go after Warren, despite multiple assists from the moderators. At one point, Booker insisted he did not disagree with Warren even after moderator Savannah Guthrie read his words criticizing her plan to break up tech giants out loud to him.</p><p>When Guthrie asked the more centrist Klobuchar whether her rivals' plans are too ambitious and are misleading voters. Klobuchar passed, instead blasting Trump for sitting in the White House and doing nothing about inequality \u2014 although she later took a subtle jab at the bevy of proposals that had come up on stage.</p><p>\"I don't make all the promises that everyone else can make,\" she said. \"But I can promise you this, I'm going to govern with integrity.\"</p><p>The lesser candidates squeezed at the sides of the stage attempted to interject at any chance they could, hoping for a viral moment. At one point, de Blasio yelled \"wait a minute!\" as Guthrie was cutting to a commercial. Moderator Rachel Maddow had to shush former representative John Delaney, who attempted to interject from the far right of the stage.</p><p>The Democrats attempted other ways to stand out. Booker and O'Rourke broke out their Spanish, Inslee claimed the distinction of being the only candidate who had passed a law with a health care public option in it, and Gabbard boosted her military credentials.</p><p>Warren took a pass when asked if she believes the federal government should play a role in getting rid of some of the millions of guns already owned by people. \"We need to treat it like a serious research problem, which we have not done,\" Warren said, adding that there's a difference between a collector who has guns and people selling them on the streets.</p><p>Booker went further, calling for licenses for gun ownership and later returned to his main campaign themes of love and unity.</p><p>\"I will beat him by calling this country to a sense of common purpose,\" Booker said of Trump. \"This is a referendum on him, getting rid of him, but it's also a referendum on us.\"</p><p>Trump, however, suggested he had loftier concerns than the first in a caravan of Democratic debates.</p><p>\"Sorry, I'm on Air Force One, off to save the Free World!\" Trump tweeted before leaving for Japan for meetings with world leaders.</p><p>But he was clearly watching: He tweeted \"BORING!\" 35 minutes into the debate.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BGLOBE-86645b8e-985c-11e9-ad02-659f2956f61b</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BGLOBE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WF6-6JN1-DYHJ-31V1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8110</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1414\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Boston Globe</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 27, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000C4DX</classCode><className>HEALTH CARE RATIONING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001342</classCode><className>POLITICAL CANDIDATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N813940MM</classCode><className>POLITICAL PARTIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001715</classCode><className>THEATER &amp;

But the Facebook CEO wound up facing more than five hours of often-strafing questions on the company's role in society, as Chairwoman Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) and other Democrats openly mused that maybe the time has come to break up the giant social network.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The hearing went as designed, Waters told reporters afterward. \"I told him that we were not going to make it comfortable for him,\" she said. \"I don't think that he should be moving forward with this huge project and this big idea with all of these other concerns that have not really been resolved.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">These are POLITICO's top revelations from Wednesday's hearing:</p><p>Democrats' list of grievances keeps growing</p><p>Hours of questioning from the panel's Democrats reflected just how far Facebook's fortunes have fallen with the party. Once the darling of Obama-era Democratic Washington, the company today faces a barrage of criticism from the left, most vocally expressed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren's (D-Mass.) trust-busting calls on the 2020 campaign trail.</p><p>And Facebook has only itself to blame, Waters told Zuckerberg.</p><p>\"You have opened up a serious discussion about whether Facebook should be broken up,\" the California Democrat said early in the hearing as she reeled off a series of complaints about everything from the company's role in facilitating foreign interference in U.S. elections to the lack of diversity in its leadership ranks.</p><p>That set the tone for much of the rest of the day, as the committee's Democrats repeatedly lambasted Facebook for allowing politicians to lie in political ads without facing fact-checking - a policy that has drawn the ire of top 2020 contenders including Warren and Joe Biden, himself the subject of a misleading attack ad from the Trump campaign.</p><p>Zuckerberg insisted that the decision is rooted in Facebook's commitment to free speech, and that the company wants to ensure \"people can see for themselves what politicians are saying.\" But that didn't appear to sway lawmakers.</p><p>\"Why should the very politicians who lead our country be held to a lower standard for truthfulness and decency than the average American?\" asked Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.).</p><p>Tlaib, who is a Muslim, also objected to posts showing that white supremacists have used Facebook events pages to organize armed protests of mosques. \"It is hate speech. It is hate. And it's leading to violence and death threats in my office,\" she said, adding, \"We need to be able to play a part in reducing that violence.\"</p><p>Other lawmakers questioned Facebook's track record on civil rights. Rep. Al Green (D-Texas) pressed Zuckerberg on whether the leaders steering the Libra Association, which will manage Libra, include any people of color or members of the LGBTQ community. (Zuckerberg didn't know.)</p><p>Several raised issues like Facebook's alleged violations of federal housing laws in the wake of accusations by the Department of Housing and Urban Development that the company has allowed marketers to exclude users by race in real estate ads, and its inability to stop Russia-backed trolls from heavily targeting African American users in their 2016 meddling campaign.</p><p>Republicans are more scattered on what they think of Facebook</p><p>When Zuckerberg couldn't answer questions about the company's ongoing civil rights audit, Rep. Joyce Beatty (D-Ohio) scoffed. \"It's almost like you think this is a joke, when you have ruined the lives of many people, discriminated against them,\" she said.</p><p>The hearing underscored the divide in the GOP about how to rein in Facebook, thanks to a mix of competing instincts over whether to praise the company for its business innovation or criticize it for intervening in the financial system and policing free speech.</p><p>The committee's lead Republican, North Carolina Rep. Patrick McHenry, tried to set the tone for the hearing by warning that \"American innovation is on trial today.\" He also slammed California Democrat Brad Sherman for predicting that Libra could wreak even more damage than the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.</p><p>\"I have my qualms about Facebook and Libra, I do, and the shortcomings of big tech - there are many,\" said McHenry, who also related an anecdote about early attempts to regulate automobiles. \"But if history has taught us anything, it's better to be on the side of American innovation, competition and most importantly the freedom to build a better future for all of us.\"</p><p>But other committee Republicans proceeded to raise grave concerns about Libra's potential impact, pressing Zuckerberg on fears about damage to the U.S. dollar and grilling him on why Facebook was losing marquee corporate partners such as Visa and eBay that had initially signed up to back Libra.</p><p>Some voiced other grievances with Facebook's influence.</p><p>Rep. Bill Posey (R-Fla.) put Zuckerberg on the spot about Facebook's decision to limit the reach of false claims that vaccines are dangerous, arguing that the move restricted free speech rights. Posey pressed Zuckerberg on whether Facebook could \"support users' fair and open discussions and communications related to the risks as well as the benefits of vaccinations.\"</p><p>\"You're making a bad mistake,\" Posey warned.</p><p>Zuckerberg was more confident; lawmakers were more hostile</p><p>The last time he testified on Capitol Hill, an apologetic Zuckerberg came under fire from lawmakers who sought to take him to task for Facebook's handling of 2016 election interference and the Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal - but who were also stymied at times by confusion over the world of high technology.</p><p>A year and a half later, House lawmakers on Wednesday appeared to mostly speak with a firmer grasp on tech as they aired grievances with the CEO, whose company's regulatory woes have only multiplied since April 2018. But a more confident Zuckerberg appeared better prepared to take the heat, fielding questions on everything from financial regulation to content moderation to concerns over Facebook's growing power and size.</p><p>The improved performance comes as the CEO has taken a more public role in addressing regulatory concerns about the company. Zuckerberg dialed up his direct outreach to top officials in Congress and at the White House with a series of closed-door meetings in September. He's also quietly huddled away from Washington in recent months with Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), sessions that touched on their concerns about Libra and data privacy, according to the lawmakers.</p><p>Even so, Zuckerberg acknowledged Wednesday that lawmakers might still hold reservations about Facebook's latest plans on Libra, given the heavy scrutiny the company is under.</p><p>\"I believe that this is something that needs to get built, but I get that I'm not the ideal messenger for this right now,\" Zuckerberg said in his opening remarks. \"We've faced a lot of issues over the past few years and I'm sure there are a lot of people who wish it were anyone but Facebook who were helping to propose this.\"</p><p>Some questions seemed to catch Zuckerberg more flat-footed. He said he did not know whether Facebook has ever done business with President Donald Trump's D.C. hotel, a question posed by Rep. Madeleine Dean (D-Pa.). And he had no ready answers for a series of rapid-fire questions from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), including one about a recent POLITICO story revealing that he has hosted off-the-record dinners with conservative pundits and journalists.</p><p>\"In your ongoing dinner parties with far-right figures, some of who advanced the conspiracy theory that white supremacy is a hoax, did you discuss so-called social media bias against conservatives and do you believe there is a bias?\" Ocasio-Cortez asked.</p><p>\"Congresswoman - sorry, I don't remember everything that was in the question,\" Zuckerberg responded.</p><p>She said: \"That's all right. I'll move on.\"</p><p>Libra faces more alarm bells than ever</p><p>The hearing raised further doubts that Facebook and its partners would be able to launch Libra next year as planned. Opponents notched a victory when they pushed Zuckerberg to commit to walking away from the project if need be.</p><p>Zuckerberg attempted to put lawmakers at ease by saying he would be willing, as a member of the Libra Association, to support delaying Libra's rollout if U.S. regulators didn't approve. Zuckerberg used the hearing as an opportunity to stress a narrative that policymakers are increasingly starting to hear from Facebook - that his company can no longer speak on behalf of the group that will manage Libra because the organization is now officially established in Switzerland and 20 other partners have a say.</p><p>Zuckerberg's assurance wasn't enough for members such as Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-Mich.), who pressed Zuckerberg on what Facebook would do if the association that will manage Libra wanted to move forward without locking down U.S. officials' approval.</p><p>\"Then I believe we would be forced to leave the association,\" Zuckerberg said.</p><p>The Libra Association in recent weeks lost support from major financial institutions and technology companies that had earlier planned to join the Libra effort, including Visa, MasterCard and PayPal. Zuckerberg attributed the loss of a quarter of its tentative initial membership to the fact that Libra's a \"risky project\" under intense scrutiny.</p><p>Lawmakers saw the exit of Libra's early backers as another reason to question whether it should move forward. Rep.

While co-hosting a recent episode[1] of tech podcast Pivot, President Obama's former speechwriter who also worked for Hillary Clinton during her Senate career claimed that while the world's largest social media company certainly made many missteps in recent times, the Democratic party's voter base simply doesn't care enough about those issues for the political left in the country to mount an organized push against them. Facebook is a lot of things but healthcare reform isn't one of them Plans meant to curb climate change and revamp the existing healthcare system in the United States are policies that voter base truly cares about enough to go out and vote, which is precisely what the Democratic House is likely to focus on moving forward, Mr. Lovett argued. </p><p>That isn't to say the incumbent DNC members aren't interested in cracking down on the Menlo Park, California-based firm as many would presumably like to see it regulated in private, according to the 36-year-old. However, without a concentrated push for such a move from the Democratic party's voter base which currently seems anything but likely, the House will simply ignore the matter at hand, being unwilling to commit resources to something that doesn't have a massive potential to stay in the voters' memories for many years, Mr. Lovett concluded A fight for the ages: reining in big tech Facebook is far from the only technology company in the country that has recently been receiving a lot of heat for its actions, whether regarding user privacy, security, censorship, monetization policies, or some combination of those factors. Mr. Lovett and Ms. Swisher's recent dialogue also touched upon the subject of Netflix and its decision to pull aPatriot Actepisode centered on murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi from Saudi Arabia. While the former White House official acknowledged Netflix already has no shortage of negative PR stemming from that decision, he described that particular incident as not a particularly problematic affair in the grand scheme of things. According to him, a much bigger issue is that companies like Disney are now self-censoring their content such as movies even before they're submitted for reviews meant to assign them age ratings, picking what does and doesn't go into their creations based on what they expect Chinese censors will think about it so as to maximize their chances of having a smooth launch in the Far Eastern country, one of the largest markets on the planet based on virtually every relevant factor. We're all in this together Ultimately, despite being critical of the tech industry and the manner in which it conducted business in recent times, Mr. Lovett doesn't believe any particular American actor in the segment is malicious and some degree of healthy dialogue needs to be established before larger problems are tackled. That sentiment is actually rather similar to what Facebook executives have been saying in recent times, acknowledging most of the company's missteps and agreeing they need to do better moving forward. The issue is what \"doing better\" actually means in this context, especially in terms of user privacy, seeing how the general public and even the industry itself is currently often confusing cybersecurity with privacy[2], not to mention the fact that data leaks enabled by software bugs and human error are something that's virtually unavoidable when it comes to platforms as massive as Facebook. Last year's Cambridge Analytica scandal dealt a massive blow to the company's public image, something it heavily relies on in order to successfully execute its business strategy based on technically free services and highly targeted advertising. Capitol Hill recently demonstrated some level of ambition to rein in big tech from the standpoint of data privacy, particularly in the sense that it enacts legislation resembling the General Data Protection Regulation that went into effect in the European Union in mid-2018. Even the tech industry is largely supportive of the effort because the alternative is leaving states to come up with their own regulatory frameworks and create a chaotic environment for running an Internet business in the country. That trend already appears to be starting seeing how California enacted a strict privacy law[3] last year and more states signaled they're eager to follow suit.

It has become a central focus of Warren's campaign, which has caused business leaders like Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg to voice concern, and the fight over big tech within the Democratic Party presidential primaries has bled into the courts.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In all of this, Andrew Yang has emerged as a reasoned voice against breaking up these companies. In a recent op-ed, he noted that \"Breaking up Facebook or Apple sounds good, but it wouldn't address this issue.\" His alternative, however, is not a practical solution either. Instead of breaking up tech companies, Yang proposes a Department of the Attention Economy that will implement regulations that curb what he sees as \"the negative effects of smartphones and social media.\"</p><p> Both the history and current reality of the Internet suggest that Yang's proposal has little chance of alleviating the addictive qualities or mental health effects that he says social media and big tech are having on Americans, young people in particular. It might only serve to make things worse.</p><p> We don't have to guess what a regulated internet will look like. For most of its history, in fact, the Internet was a tightly controlled platform called the ARPAnet, which served as the academic research network that preceded today's Internet. It was a platform in which norms and behavior were dictated to users by the federal government. Here is an excerpt of MIT's 1982 guide for new users of ARPAnet explained how it should be used:</p><p> \"It is considered illegal to use the ARPAnet for anything which is not in direct support of government business. At the Al lab, we use the network to talk to other researchers about all kinds of things. For example, personal messages to other ARPAnet subscribers (for example, to arrange a get-together or check and say a friendly hello) are generally not considered harmful. This is one of the ways in which we adapt the network environment to our community. It is very clear that without that sort of freedom, the network could not have evolved to its current point of technical and social sophistication.</p><p> \"Sending electronic mail over the ARPAnet for commercial profit or political purposes is both antisocial and illegal. By sending such messages, you can offend many people, and it is possible to get MIT in serious trouble with the government agencies which manage the ARPAnet.\"</p><p> You see, as a platform tightly controlled by the federal government, ARPAnet was regulated in an effort to stave off the perceived negative or \"antisocial\" effects of the commercial or political use of the platform. And while some are now arguing today that perhaps those same standards should be reinstated (just look at Twitter's ban of political advertising), it is hard to argue that the ARPAnet as conceived in 1982 would have changed the world in the way that the successive version of the commercial internet has.</p><p> But many, including Yang and Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Missouri, argue in favor of heavily and specifically regulating social media in the name of curbing \"social media addiction.\" And while we still have much to learn about whether or not this \"addiction\" is a serious problem, it ignores why people use the internet, to begin with. Yang's effort to create a federal agency focused on \"curbing design features that maximize screen time\" and discourage \"Design features that encourage social validation\" assumes that people are merely tricked and manipulated into using today's most popular Internet platforms. The data, however, suggests that it is not true at all.</p><p> Why do people seem so \"addicted\" to the internet? It may be passion, not addiction, driving users. A recent survey of Internet users found that approximately 80 million \u2013 38.15% \u2013 of U.S. adults use the internet to pursue hobbies and passion projects. And out of those 80 million, nearly 35% of them say that the internet is essential to that pursuit. This means that there are just short of 30 million Americans that can only pursue their passion projects with the internet. Looking back at the limited acceptable applications of the internet of the early 80s, it is hard to explain why taking us back in time will make millions of Americans better off.</p><p> Putting a federal agency in a position to determine acceptable and unacceptable behavior on the internet should not be a thought experiment played out by presidential hopefuls. Instead, we should look at the history of the internet in order to understand more clearly what that world would really be like. And while \"big tech\" has become the target of frustration and focus of the Democratic primaries, taking us back 30 years will only serve to undermine the greatest platform we have today, to connect millions of Americans with their passions and help them find more meaning in their lives.</p><p> Christopher Koopman is executive director of the Center for Growth and Opportunity at Utah State University.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKIL-1cfe8cc7163d2faf7cabd0922a582c8ec533c4d0</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2898989BE6149C NWBKIL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XR9-2RN1-JBCN-439C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399548</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"835\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Sauk Valley Newspapers, Shaw Newspapers<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

But it's not so, at least when it comes to certain issues. And no one knows it better than the big Silicon Valley tech companies that are the recent targets of proposed bipartisan bills.Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, joined today with a Missouri Republican, Sen. </p><p>Josh Hawley, to introduce legislation[1] that would force companies like Facebook (NASDAQ: FB[2]) and Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL[3]) to reveal how much money they're making by scooping up troves of personal data on their users.If passed, the legislation would require companies with more than 100 million active users to detail the types of data they collect on people, and the transactions they make with other companies to reap revenue by granting those third parties access to that data.'When a big tech company says its product is free, consumers are the ones being sold. These 'free' products track everything we do so tech companies can sell our information to the highest bidder and use it to target us with creepy ads,' Hawley said in a written statement as he and Warner rolled out the Designing Accounting Safeguards to Help Broaden Oversight And Regulations on Data (DASHBOARD) Act on Monday.'Even worse, tech companies do their best to hide how much consumer data is worth and to whom it is sold. This bipartisan legislation gives consumers control of their data and will show them how much these 'free' services actually cost,' Hawley said.While Congress has yet to pass stringent data privacy laws like the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation(GDPR), US lawmakers' interest in the issue hasn't flagged since 2017, when detailed reports surfaced that revealed how Facebook had allowed outside organizations to tap into millions of user profiles.The initial alarms over that data exposure centered on its possible effect on the US presidential election in 2016, when entities controlled by Russia were accused of illegally targeting social media users with misleading campaign-related messages. But Congressional hearings have since expanded their scope to examine a broader concern\u2014that tech companies are monetizing the data of individuals who are often unaware of the breadth of information they're surrendering.Under the DASHBOARD Act, big companies defined as 'commercial data operators'' would have to file annual reports disclosing the aggregate value of the data collected from their user populations. They'd have to help the Securities and Exchange Commission develop methods to calculate that value.In addition, the companies would be required to tell users each of the ways their data was being used, including those uses that have nothing to do with the main purpose of the app or service they signed up for. Users would gain some power to demand that companies delete some or all of the data collected about them.In a summary of the bill[4] posted on Scribd, Warner said the bill would not only benefit users, but would also assist US regulatory agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission, which protects consumers against business fraud and anti-competitive practices. Once US agencies understand the economic value of data collection, they can better enforce antitrust laws and flag unfair transactions, Warner said. Making the value more transparent could also increase competition by attracting rival companies into the market, he said.'User data is quickly becoming the single most important economic input in the digital economy,'' Warner wrote in the Scribd post.Warner and Hawley have also teamed up to introduce the Do Not Track Act, which would allow users to opt out of unnecessary data collection by tech companies, just as phone service customers can enroll in the FTC's 'Do Not Call' list to ward off telemarketing pitches.Last week, a Senate committee moved forward a related bipartisan bill sponsored by Warner and Colorado Republican Cory Gardner. That bill, the Internet of Things (IoT) Cybersecurity Improvement Act of 2019, would require IoT devices sold in the United States to incorporate a minimum level of cybersecurity safeguards to protect against data breaches and the infiltration of personal networks by hackers.Photo credit: Depositphotos Reprints[5] | Share: <url

The Radical Dems' obstruction, subversion, and continuing effort to overthrow the Trump presidency is already showing significant signs of wear and weakness in their mad dash to contrive a fraudulent and rapidly disintegrating impeachment charge against the president, the Dems have created only an annoyance for the president, but for themselves.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">They appear to have created what is a pit of quicksand. And that sucking sound you hear, it's the sinking of their hopes to frame President Trump and once again their lies laid bare before the voters.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here is one of President Trump's tweets today showing this. A deep red 2016 election map with a message, try to impeach this. The presidential dare comes in the midst of yet another wave of disappointments and bad news for the lying leftists and Radical Dems.</p><p>President Trump's attorney, Rudy Giuliani says he's still debating whether he will defy congressional subpoenas. The Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo flat out rejected the Radical Dem committee chairman saying that he and the State Department will not permit Congress to bully, to intermediate, or disrespect distinguished diplomats.</p><p>And not a good day for the Radical Dems anywhere, and their increasingly obvious fictional plot to attack and take down the president.</p><p>New reports tonight, that Senators Joe Manchin and Jon Tester are in fact worried that Pelosi and Schiff have already severely damaged the party with their half-baked and implausible impeachment probe that's already spinning out of control, and it could prove very costly indeed in next year's elections.</p><p>For the latest tonight, we turn to Chief White House Correspondent, John Roberts.</p><p>JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Lou, good evening. The president's outside attorney, Rudy Giuliani hasn't decided whether to comply with a congressional subpoena for documents.</p><p>Neither has the secretary of state, but Mike Pompeo was doing his best to keep State Department officials away from Capitol Hill.</p><p>The Secretary of State fired back today against a House demand to depose five current and former State Department officials. In a letter to Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman, Eliot Engel, Mike Pompeo is saying, the demand can be understood only as an attempt to intimidate, bully, and treat improperly the distinguished professionals at the Department of State.</p><p>While Pompeo didn't exactly say no to Engle, he did draw a red line saying, the five officials subject to your letter may not attend any interview or deposition without counsel from the Executive Branch present.</p><p>President Trump continue to slam the whistleblower today again demanding to know his or her identity tweeting, why aren't we entitled to interview and learn everything about the whistleblower and also the person who gave all of the false information to him.</p><p>The relentless attacks prompted a rare response from the intelligence community inspector general in a four-page press release, Michael Atkinson revealing the whistleblower complaint wasn't hearsay. The whistleblower stated on the form that he or she possessed both first-hand and other information.</p><p>The I.G. did not say what information the whistleblower had first-hand knowledge of, but makes it clear that the central aspect of the complaint, the phone call was third-hand.</p><p>The complainant was not a direct witness to the president's July 25th 2019 telephone call with the Ukrainian president. Members of the relevant congressional committees may get a chance to meet with the whistleblower as soon as next week.</p><p>Fox News' told plans are being made for a possible secret meeting away from Capitol Hill to help protect the whistleblower's identity. Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: John, thank you very much. John Roberts from the White House.</p><p>So, what are the Radical Dems, Pelosi, Schiff, Schumer, left with? Right now, it appears not much and how should the Trump administration deal with a Congress that is obviously unyielding in its efforts, no matter how futile, how silly to overthrow President Trump?</p><p>To take that up, we have with us tonight, senior policy advisor for the president, Stephen Miller. Stephen, good to have you with us and what a week it has been?</p><p>Let's start with a backdrop for this if I may, and that is suddenly we are hearing from Schumer, from Pelosi and several others that they want to negotiate with the president and are ready to sit down and talk about USMCA, gun control, you name it, apparently.</p><p>They seem to think they suddenly have the upper hand with the president. Your reaction?</p><p>STEPHEN MILLER, WHITE HOUSE SENIOR POLICY ADVISER: Well, I do agree that senate democrats are probably terrified about the cliff they're being driven over by Pelosi and the radical election nullifying democrats in the house of representatives.</p><p>And so, I don't doubt that's the case, but let's also be clear what the even deeper fear is. The deepest fear is the deep state is terrified of being exposed, Lou.</p><p>What we have right now is a situation in which the attorney general of the United States and John Durham are going to get to the bottom of what really happened in 2016.</p><p>And we're going to find out what went on and what was done to try and sabotage this president and try to sabotage this administration. And that has the deep state and their democrat allies terrified.</p><p>DOBBS: And terrified it seems of what is a highly unusual effort at what is a bizarre plot at best. Not even the stuff of fiction, because it's so implausible.</p><p>But the idea that they would make much of the president asking a foreign leader to meet or talk with his attorney general and to accommodate the law enforcement and national security investigative needs of this country and ally of Ukraine. On what basis would that be irregular?</p><p>MILLER: Well, I have some breaking news, Lou. The president of the United States is the nation's highest-ranking law enforcement officer. It seems like some of our democrats need a civics lesson.</p><p>And just because Joe Biden may be running for president, doesn't mean he's immune from scrutiny. It doesn't mean that his family is immune from scrutiny for corrupt behavior in the Ukraine and in China.</p><p>And the reality is, is that the president of the United States is doing the American people a profound service by getting to the bottom of corruption in Ukraine. And all Americans have a right to know how our taxpayer dollars are being spent and whether former high-ranking officials engage in corrupt behavior and whether or not Ukraine or anyone in Ukraine engage in interference in 2016.</p><p>DOBBS: There is as I suggested at the outset, some concern that the president in the face of this onslaught, no matter how rickety a contraption of this so-called impeachment inquiry is, is being asked by the Dems and if you will a proffer perhaps as a bribe or just outright intimidation to take up gun control, to take up various issues, and legislation.</p><p>That they've had absolutely no interest in accommodating him previously. This is a sordid and tasteless sort of initiative don't you think on the part of the Radical Dems?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MILLER: Lou, the Democrats have truly no depth to which they will not sink in their craven pursuit of power. And that's what this is all about, Lou, right. It's about power. You know you've talked about these issues for so many years on your show.</p><p>You've talked about the betrayal of the American workers because of offshoring, outsourcing, and misguided trade deals. You've talked about the betrayal of American families because of open border policies and misguided foreign policies.</p><p>The president stood up in 2016 and said, enough, I'm putting a stop to the selling out, the betrayal, and even the crucifying of the American middle class in this country.</p><p>And they are going to say, we're not going to let the American people have the leadership and have the government that they want. And this president is standing in the breach and saying he's going to fight for the American worker.</p><p>DOBBS: And he has done so splendidly and strongly throughout. Yet over the Senate, there's a senate bill 386, the rights for legal immigrants' legislation that would double the size of H1B visas and in so doing most of those visas to China and to India.</p><p>And it's also without a question, sponsored by Mike Lee and signed on to by a host of otherwise -- well, generally reasonable people previously. Is the president going to veto the damn thing?</p><p>MILLER: Well, I don't think that that bill as it's currently written is going to be passing the Senate anytime soon. But the administration has made clear that our view on H1Bs is that you cannot displace or replace American workers.</p><p>And the president has taken unprecedented action in the immigration space to do exactly that, including most of recently with the public charge regulation to keep newcomers from taking advantage of our welfare system.</p><p>But I want to drill down to the heart, Lou, of what's happening in our country right now. You have people inside the executive branch permanent career government officials who do not recognize democracy. I know because I deal with some of these people every week.</p><p>DOBBS: You're talking about the deep state?</p><p>MILLER: I'm talking about the deep state, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Right.</p><p>MILLER: And everything we're trying to do to make working Americans have a better future is constantly blocked and sabotaged by the deep state. And we're breaking through and we are winning and we're going to keep on winning.</p><p>But what you have with this current non-scandal, non-controversy, made up phoney story from this fake whistleblower about Ukraine. What you have is somebody inside the government along with their allies trying to overthrow a democratically elected president so they can get their policies that they want to put in place.</p><p>That's what's at stake for every American. Do you believe we should be governed by a democracy or not?</p><p>DOBBS: Well, I'm quite happy with this constitutional republic and less than happy as you know with the deep state that it's not only entrenched, but expanding, and increasingly powerful.</p><p>When we look at the, for crying out loud, the complaint for the so-called whistleblower who happens to be a CIA officer. I mean think about the absurdity of what we're talking about, suddenly a CIA, I can't even imagine this.</p><p>A CIA officer on hearsay is now a whistleblower, one wonders why he doesn't have a change of command that he would want to follow as a CIA officer?</p><p>MILLER: Right. Yeah, you would think, right?</p><p>DOBBS: And why he could not see the irony of spying on the president of the United States on U.S. soil which is by the way --</p><p>MILLER: Yes, yes.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DOBBS: -- a charge that he is not entitled to. I mean this is idiotic.</p><p>MILLER: Yeah, overseas surveillance is the CIA's mission, yeah, not to try and conduct illicit operations on the president of the United States.</p><p>First of all, if you read the complaint, right, it's public now. There's no firsthand nothing in that complaint.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, there's firsthand.</p><p>MILLER: There's no firsthand anything in that complaint nor could there ever be because the complaint is the fevered imagination of a deep state radical.</p><p>DOBBS: By the way, I want to say where you're seeing that. Michael Atkinson, the inspector general of the intelligence community who wrote a four-page document of rationale for changing that complaint form, it is one of the most of absurd documents I have ever seen.</p><p>It is irrational and it can only be explained by raising great questions of political corruption within the inspector general's office itself in my opinion, but that's just my opinion. See we could -- go ahead you collect word here Stephen.</p><p>MILLER: One thing I find so disappointing, Lou, is that the Democratic Party used to stand for liberal values in this country. They used to question power, now you have a liberal bureaucracy and liberals in Washington, D.C. that worship intelligence community as being above reproach and worship deep state power.</p><p>And that is fundamentally anti-liberal. Republicans and Democrat actually ignited in supporting this president.</p><p>DOBBS: I can't join you in bemoaning their move away from liberalism. I think liberalism deserves to die and by the way that maybe at hand because of this --</p><p>MILLER: Now they're just socialists and Marxists, Lou. Not even liberals anymore. They're socialist and Marxists.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, I don't know what else they are, but I can tell you this, they're working against the president of the United States and this country and that's got to be stopped.</p><p>MILLER: Amen, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Stephen Miller, we appreciate everything that you're doing for the country. Thank you so much.</p><p>MILLER: Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS: More on Secretary Pompeo's answer to the Radical Dems on Capitol Hill. He's not pleased with their efforts to bully his state officials.</p><p>Ed Rollins, the savant himself with us tonight. We'll that up. And a photo of Joe Biden. Wow. Who knew, there's another photo and it shows his son and himself in -- well, the Hamptons playing golf, having a good time.</p><p>He does a lot of good-time photos, have you noticed that? Anyway, Eric Trump will be joining us right after the break with that and much, much more, stay with us.</p><p>DOBBS: The sell-off on Wall Street today, the Dow Jones Industrials fell 344 points, the S&amp;P down 37, the Nasdaq down 91 points. Volume on the big board, 3.6 million shares. Some excitement in the market after a report that manufacturing had contracted at the fastest rate in the past year.</p><p>Crude oil down about a percent, just over $53 a barrel that's settlement. And gold up over a percent, silver rising nearly 2 percent.</p><p>A reminder, listen to my reports three times a day coast-to-coast on the Salem Radio Network.</p><p>A 2014 picture unraveling Joe Biden's claims that he never talked about his son's overseas business dealings. It could be. The picture shows the former vice-president whose son Hunter golfing in the Hamptons with Devon Archer whose archery you say.</p><p>Well, Archer and Biden, Hunter Biden were both on the board of Ukrainian gas company Burisma Holdings, also partners in the private equity firm, Rosemont Sineca. Oh yes, that's the one that attracted --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>-- a half billion-dollar investment from China just weeks after Hunter had accompanied his father on a trip to Beijing and in December of 2013. Pure coincidence, I'm sure.</p><p>Well, joining us tonight the president son and Executive Vice-President of the Trump Organization, Eric Trump. Eric, good to have you here.</p><p>ERIC TRUMP Can you imagine if I took 3 cents from the Ukraine or 4 cents from China? I mean it's unbelievable. It's unbelievable.</p><p>DOBBS: I have a feeling it would be quite a different reaction on the part of the national leftist media. I'm just guessing but --</p><p>TRUMP: Slight double standard to say the least.</p><p>DOBBS: I think double standard is a nice way to say it. It is outright rank political corruption on the part of our national media.</p><p>TRUMP: You know the worst part of thing is? I mean first of all, the guy doesn't speak the language. So, he's on the board of a Ukrainian company and he doesn't speak the language.</p><p>All right, put me on the board of a company where I can't communicate with the other people in the company because I don't speak the language.</p><p>DOBBS: Without a third person to interpret.</p><p>TRUMP: He had no knowledge of the industry. He knew nothing about the industry at hand and he's being paid $50,000 for what? I mean for not knowing the language and not having any relevant experience within the -- it's insane. It's an absolutely insane.</p><p>DOBBS: Again, it fails the implausibility test and it's just unimaginable that this firm would hire a man who had a drug problem, publicly documented drug problem, absolutely knew nothing about energy, the Ukraine or international finance for that matter.</p><p>TRUMP: I kick that a maybe.</p><p>DOBBS: Yeah, well --</p><p>TRUMP: Minor details.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, these issues. And the Chinese had no problem either, 1.5 billion dollars. He's going to be at least in part the steward for $1.5 billion. It's not an inconsiderable amount of money even for the Chinese. And that, I would guess a good faith in the vice president.</p><p>TRUMP: We knew the biggest investors in the world, they go over to China, these are the guys who run the biggest companies in the United States, the biggest investment firms. They go over to China and they can't get three cents out of China.</p><p>I mean they can't get any money out of China, and then all of a sudden you have this young guy, who goes there, you know flies aboard in Air Force two, goes to China, comes back, and all of a sudden has a billion five in his pocket. I mean, Lou, it's insane. It's insane.</p><p>And this whole witch hunt, it's another witch hunt that they're doing right now. They know they can't beat my father. The corruption is being seen for the 20th time. You've reported on it for the last several years.</p><p>DOBBS: From the time he was a candidate, for crying out loud, he's had the FBI and who knows how much other agencies working against him, and how much foreign agencies work</p><p>TRUMP: How many more of these scandals do we need to have? Whether it be the fake dossiers, whether it be nonsense Russia investigations, whether it'd be the absolute insane leaks, whether it's Bill Clinton and Loretta Lynch, you know meeting in a private little airport somewhere on the back of a plane.</p><p>DOBBS: Loretta Lynch? Did you say Loretta Lynch? We've got most of people don't even know who she is now because she hasn't been considered for investigation by anyone in the Justice Department.</p><p>TRUMP: How about Kavanaugh and how about trying to destroy his life? How about all the other lives that they've ruined in the process? And you know what, my father is out there fighting like hell to turn around the country and he's done an unbelievable job.</p><p>He's succeeded in every single metric. We are the talk of the entire world and I know that because I quite frankly travel the world and I hear from people. We are doing everything right. He's doing everything right. We have the best markets, we have the best jobs, we have the manufacturing is coming back.</p><p>We're winning again on every front, and you know what? The Democrats know it and they want to distract from that, they want to distract from what he's doing and his message, and the patriotism that he's brought back to this country and the winning that he's doing now because they know they can't win.</p><p>Biden is not going to win. The guy is a crook, right&gt;? Warren is not going to win. This is somebody who goes out and lies about her native American ancestry. She's not going to win, right.</p><p>So, what do they have to do? They have to make up another nonsense diatribe and here we go again. I feel like it's a merry-go-round, I really do.</p><p>DOBBS: I wish it were as amusing as a merry-go-round because frankly, this effort to overthrow the president of this congressional -- this constitutional republic.</p><p>I mean it's stunning stuff on one hand and as you say on the other it's become old stuff because it has been going on for three years against your father and against this country. And there is a rationalization.</p><p>I think it's a psychotic rationalization that broaden our body politic that because the left opposes your father who is an anti-establishment populist president whose appeal crosses both parties, supports the working men and women who is part of the middle class, supports the middle class where their American dream resides instead of the corporatist class. You know, he's fair game and he is not, and neither is this country.</p><p>TRUMP: You know what, he threatens their very existence and they know that. And they know that when he came in, look at the movement. Go to these rallies, I've been to so many of them. Go to these rallies where you have 30,000, 40,000, 50,000 people, they're holding American flags, they're cheering USA, USA, USA.</p><p>They don't have that on the other side. You know, they are political class. But how many years has Biden been a politician? Over 50, if you include -- I mean he's been a politician Lou, substantially longer than I've been alive, think about that, right? Yet Biden will blame the problems of the country on my father.</p><p>DOBBS: Yeah.</p><p>TRUMP: Yeah.</p><p>DOBBS: It's an incredible thing.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, the American people. This is a great thing. The American people are watching all of this. And they're not half as done as the Democrats, the Radical Dems believe them to be.</p><p>Or they wouldn't pull such a nonsensical implausible plot as this impeachment inquiry against your father. This is blowing up so quickly. I mean it's exploding right now in the faces of --</p><p>TRUMP: There are fundraising numbers show that. Our fundraising number showed that we raised $15 million dollars --</p><p>DOBBS: You're such a business guy, it all comes you know what out of money.</p><p>TRUMP: It's a great way to show support.</p><p>DOBBS: You bet it is.</p><p>TRUMP: When people are going online donating 10 bucks and 12 bucks and you raise $15 million in 72 hours including 50,000 people who have never donated to a political party before? It shows where American stands.</p><p>People are sick and tired of this nonsense, they're sick and tired of games, they're sick and tired of career politicians and we're going to beat them again.</p><p>DOBBS: And still, all of us are still thrilled to win. Eric Trump, thanks.</p><p>TRUMP: Good to see you.</p><p>DOBBS: Great to see you. Come back soon.</p><p>TRUMP: I will.</p><p>DOBBS: Up next, here are the 2020 candidate that Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg sees as an existential threat. And the intelligence community's watch dog questioning back on his, well the criticized handling of the so- called whistleblower complaint. It is a construction of language the likes of which you will wish you had never heard but it's coming up next as Victor Davis Hanson, he's with us tonight. Stay with us. we'll be right back.</p><p>DOBBS: Facebook's Founder, CEO, Purchaser, Mark Zuckerberg captured in leaked audio blasting presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren and her plans to break up big tech.</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, FACEBOOK CEO: Elizabeth Warren thinks that the right answer is to break up the companies. I mean you know, if she gets elected president, then I would bet it that we will have a legal challenge and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge.</p><p>Does that still suck for us? Yeah, I mean I don't want to have a major lawsuit against our own government. But look, at the end of the day, if someone's going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight.</p><p>DOBBS: And joining us tonight to take up all of this and much more, former Regan White House, Political Director, Fox Business Political Analyst, Leading Republican Strategies, Ed Rollins.</p><p>ED ROLLINS, GREAT AMERICA PAC CHAIRMAN: Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS: Ed, good to have you here.</p><p>ROLLINS: Nice to be with you, thank you.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, let's start with this president was campaigning against big tech before Elizabeth Warren had -- I was going to say left the reservation. The fact of the matter is that's one of his policies. His concerns and his trouble perspective.</p><p>ROLLINS: It should be. And at the end of the day, you think Zuckerberg was going endorse Trump the way he was talking about the opposition.</p><p>The reality is you need to have some kind of regulatory control in some of these entities that basically out of control. You got all of this information of people out there --</p><p>DOBBS: So, you're agreeing with Elizabeth Warren?</p><p>ROLLINS: No, I'm agreeing with Donald Trump, what he said originally.</p><p>DOBBS: Okay, all right.</p><p>ROLLINS: Basically, you know, I think you need to look at it hard and fast.</p><p>Lou: Well hard and fast is what I would call --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>-- a hard, fast, and peculiar at the very best. This impeachment inquiry as the Democrats like to call it. This thing is bizarre. There's first no crime as we documented here last night.</p><p>ROLLINS: Right.</p><p>DOBBS: There is this complaint is riddled with mistakes and errors and concerted efforts it appears with a law firm and a couple congressional committees. And then the coverups, remember the discussion immediately of the coverup.</p><p>The coverup just happens to be the routine top-secret code secure files that are presidential conversations are kept in. I mean this is a laughable, just disaster for the Radical Dems as thing that they concocted.</p><p>ROLLINS: And you have to understand, the CIA works for the president.</p><p>DOBBS: Don't tell me, tell them.</p><p>ROLLINS: Their purpose is to gather information from other countries on things for --</p><p>DOBBS: They have to go abroad.</p><p>ROLLINS: -- the president. Supposed to be abroad not supposed to be here.</p><p>DOBBS: Not 1600 Pennsylvania.</p><p>ROLLINS: They're not the FBI. They're not -- and the idea that in FBI --</p><p>DOBBS: The FBI wanted to wear wires in the White House. I mean what a bunch. You can't make these people up.</p><p>ROLLINS: I mean, I've been around a long time and you know first when I worked from the days of J.J. Hoover. He was a minor league player compared to these guys. And we have to be prepared for the big, big fight and I think the Democrats are going to get bloodied and bruised.</p><p>And unfortunately, the president has to be very prepared to fight and he will fight.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, I don't think there's any trouble about this president fighting.</p><p>ROLLINS: No, no.</p><p>DOBBS: The real issue here is why in the hell does he have to fight? Because talking with Stephen Miller earlier, this is the deep state. This is the Radical Dems, the left in this country and their compatriots and the leftist national media.</p><p>If there were an honest media in this country instead of this closed feedback loop, you know, amongst the Dems, the left, and the leftist media, we wouldn't have this.</p><p>ROLLINS: Well, the great indictment against Trump is he's doing what he said he would do. He was unconventional candidate, he's got an unconventional president.</p><p>DOBBS: Thank God.</p><p>ROLLINS: And he's a very effective president and they're very unhappy about that.</p><p>DOBBS: And now, they're trying to -- it seems very clear the Radical Dems are pushing along with the establishment at the White House, wanting to talk you know, maybe we can talk business on trade, we can talk business on tariffs, we can talk business on gun control, we can talk business and you name it.</p><p>ROLLINS: Well, the only business the country is going to talk about the next couple months here is going to be their efforts to try to impeach him and they'll be unsuccessful.</p><p>DOBBS: Ed Rollins, always good to see you.</p><p>ROLLINS: My pleasure. Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS: How does it end?</p><p>ROLLINS: It ends I think, you know it's about 218 votes, I think they've got the votes to impeach him on some obscure thing. But certainly, the Senate is going to be outraged by it and I think the country is outraged by it.</p><p>And they have to take all of this money they're raising and go out and start the campaign day one and go out and tell the country what's going on in Washington, D.C.</p><p>DOBBS: Yeah, I can't wait to see him back in the campaign trip.</p><p>ROLLINS: That's where he needs to be, he's where he's very good at.</p><p>DOBBS: Yeah, thanks so much, appreciate it.</p><p>ROLLINS: Pleasure.</p><p>DOBBS: Up next, we take up the dramatic escalation of violence in Hong Kong. And what in the world is going on in Beijing. To find out, Dr. Michael Pillsbury joins us. Stay with us, we'll be right back with that and more.</p><p>DOBBS: China today unveiled new military weapons including an intercontinental ballistic missile, the DF41 missile flaunted as the most powerful missile on this planet at the 70th anniversary of the Communist Party parade in Beijing.</p><p>The missile we're told can carry 10 nuclear war heads theoretically ahs the capability hit the United States within a half hour. Well, Hong King demonstrations today turning extremely violent.</p><p>Demonstrators they are taking to the city center more than a 100,000 people marching through the main streets clashing with police, chanting anti-China slogans.</p><p>The clashes between the protestors and police escalated and an 18-year-old activist was shot squarely in the chest with a live round by one of the officers. The protester is said to be in critical condition tonight.</p><p>Well, joining us now, Dr. Michael Pillsbury, he's director of the center for Chinese strategy at the Hudson Institute. He just returned from Hong Kong and Beijing.</p><p>And Mike, it's great to have you with us. This is troubling development how violent and persistent these demonstrations have become.</p><p>DR. MICHAEL PILLSBURY, HUDSON CHINESE STRATEGY DIRECTOR: I think it's all part of the rise of Chinese nationalism combined with Chinese power. I mean somebody obviously authorized this police officer to use deadly force.</p><p>And the showing of these new weapons systems, besides the missiles they also showed off two robot submarines and they've got a stealth drone that looks a lot like our stealth drone.</p><p>They weren't supposed to have this kind of equipment, Lou, for another 10 years according to some experts.</p><p>DOBBS: Yeah, I can't imagine them having left it in a file somewhere as they perused all of our intellectual property and technology, and so I'm not in a least surprise in what they have.</p><p>PILLSBURY: Well, their weapons look a lot like our weapons.</p><p>DOBBS: And their aircraft, for crying out loud. I mean and it's astonishing. I want to turn to the discussion that we've seen the administration pull back.</p><p>Peter Navarro talking about, basically saying just basically we were just kidding about keeping China from our markets, the suggestion, there would be a delisting of Chinese companies, oh no, they can have access to everything. Your reaction to that?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>PILLSBURY: Well, every president I worked for wants to maintain secrecy of his policy options until he announces them. So, I understand what Peter Navarro is saying, he's saying he doesn't want to make any comment.</p><p>And the White House statement you're referring to, they said at this time, sort of at the very end of the comment about how we're not thinking about escalation and then it was at this time.</p><p>So, obviously the question arises for those of us outside the White House, when would be the right time? And my suggestion is if this delegation coming October 10th or 11th. If it has nothing to do in an offer and the talk showed an impasse, then it's time for escalation.</p><p>And there's some pretty good ideas, I and others have in mind, including you, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, one of those -- thanks for including me on that lustrous --</p><p>PILLSBURY: I'm presuming.</p><p>DOBBS: But I'm very concerned right now that we're looking at a country as it talks about a people that won't be stopped, a nation that won't be stopped.</p><p>PILLSBURY: I noticed that, yeah.</p><p>DOBBS: That is a bellicosity that it seems to me at least as an observer something new for the Chinese because that's an adamant statement of imperial nationalism if I've ever heard one.</p><p>PILLSBURY: I think you're right to single out that phrase in President Xi Jinping's speech yesterday. I was struck by it, too. It's more than feisty. It's almost arrogant. In my own meetings in Beijing, I must say there's a new tone of confidence or even arrogance in references to America as yesterday's power.</p><p>So, it's the end of a batch (ph) as the way they put it. Yesterday's hegemon. It's kind of insulting to us, actually.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DOBBS: Right. Well, the point is to make sure that it's incorrect. And when you've got Wall Street flying over on command from Xi, and the communist party to attend at the feet of the great Xi, you know, it gets to be a little troubling.</p><p>And when you've got companies continuing to go ahead with forced transfer of rare and extraordinarily valuable intellectual property when we continue to permit the theft of hundreds of billions of dollars of technology.</p><p>I'm scratching my head as to you know whether or not that is such an overwrought claim on the part of the President Xi about China vis-a-vis the United States.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>PILLSBURY: No, no. Have some faith in America, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: I got faith in America.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>I got faith in America. What I don't faith in --</p><p>PILLSBURY: What this Wall Street people are worried about is the escalation options. They know one of the options and they hate it. That is no more waivers for Chinese companies that have accounting problems and what they've gotten away with is claiming that the results of accounting are secret.</p><p>DOBBS: Yeah.</p><p>PILLSBURY: So, they won't give them to us and SCC has gone along with that, with the waiver. That can be changed in one second. There're several other escalation options.</p><p>DOBBS: What about and I'm aware of outside advisors and some inside advisors who have suggested to the president that there be a cutoff to our capital markets for the Chinese and that that, you know, whether in that vindication in ending the capital flows to China that would just about amount to half there economy I have it on good council. Your thoughts?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>PILLSBURY: That's for me. That's only one range of options affecting the capital markets and their access. Another one is private equity. There're actually enormous amounts of the private equity in China from U.S. Investment Banks.</p><p>That's not really been examined before. The third area is the so-called entity that Huawei and general nuclear and others are already on. The threshold for being on that list is not very clear, so at the discretion of the president he can add more important Chinese companies, the ones, Lou, they call the National Champions adding them to that list.</p><p>The combination of these options and there's plenty more, would inflict a lot of pain on China. I wish time had to be done --</p><p>DOBBS: And this doing to have the pain?</p><p>PILLSBURY: Well no, October the 12th, I think?</p><p>DOBBS: All right, Michael Pillsbury, always good to talk with you. Thanks so much.</p><p>PILLSBURRY: Thanks, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Appreciate it. Up next, Los Angeles hoping more money will solve a crisis. It's homeless crisis, a crisis of their hone making. We'll have that and more, Victory Davis Hanson joins me right after this.</p><p>DOBBS: There is nothing sanctuary in the sanctuary state for the homeless. There is a homeless crisis in Los Angeles that's now hit the breaking point apparently.</p><p>City officials there are trying to pressure Governor Newsom to declare a state of emergency in their state and city. City officials hoping to declare that state of emergency and divert more funds to combat homelessness.</p><p>Since last year, the homeless population in Los Angeles County has risen 12 percent. The total population nearly 60,000 people.</p><p>Well, joining us tonight is Victor Davis Hanson, a senior fellow, and military history at the Hoover Institution, professor at Emeritus sub- classics. A California State University, Fresno.</p><p>He is the author and best-selling author and national review contributor. Man, by the time I get through the --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>-- honoraria here, it's stunning stuff and it's good to see you, my friend.</p><p>VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, HOOVER INSTITUTE SENIOR FELLOW: Good to see you, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Let's start with the absurdity of Los Angeles having to declare a crisis because its policies have created so much homelessness.</p><p>HANSON: Yeah, I think California's reaching the logical limitation of this radical progressive thought. We're starting to see a medieval culture where people are infected with hepatitis B, e-coli, and even typhus.</p><p>And they go to the bathroom on the sidewalk, they shoot drugs and the whole idea is predicated that no one has the intellectual answer or the moral courage to say that's wrong and we're going to address it.</p><p>And partly Lou, it's because the Hollywood elite, the people who live down in Malibu or in San Francisco, the Gavin Newsoms, the Feinstein, and Presidio Heights, Pacific Heights, they're never subject to the ramifications of their own utopia and ideology and they're the architects of this culture.</p><p>DOBBS: Yeah, they deserve that consequences, don't they?</p><p>HANSON: Yes, they --</p><p>DOBBS: Victor, let me -- let's go to -- I'm sorry, go ahead, very quickly.</p><p>HANSON: It just doesn't fall on them because they have the money and the influence, the gated community, the private security patrol. And that's symptomatic of California.</p><p>DOBBS: Yeah, and a few other places, too, D.C. does come to mind.</p><p>HANSON: Yes.</p><p>DOBBS: Let's turn to the Radical Dems and this absurd quest to carry out an impeachment inquiry against this president with a clause that has no crime within point of fact a complaint that is authored by a CIA officer with third-person -- third-hand information.</p><p>And an allegation of a cover-up that happens to be the routine practice of secreting conversations between the president of the United States and foreign leaders. What make you of this?</p><p>HANSON: Well, I think what happen is that Nancy Pelosi was under pressure from her base and people in Congress that they warned her that the election is going to come up in 13 months and Donald Trump is going to win.</p><p>And some of them have explicitly said if we don't impeach him, we have eight years of him so before she got whistleblower's complaint and had read it, she went ahead with the so-called inquiry.</p><p>And what these land mines are starting to blow up in her face and what are the land mines? she doesn't know who the whistleblower is? Has the whistleblower contacted Adam Schiff's staff?</p><p>These are questions here she will be asked. Do they have a legal team draw up this? Though can't impeach a president on hearsay evidence and anonymous sources, just doesn't work. So, I think they're trying to get a --</p><p>DOBBS: That's what they're trying to do. Very quickly --</p><p>HANSON: They're trying to get the Kavanaugh circus. I think they feel if that they get an inquiry, they'll have an I am Sparticus moment, they'll have a Susan and Ford witness and nobody can control it.</p><p>They'll bring in everybody. They don't understand that this has happened for three years and people are getting tired of it. And meanwhile, we have all of these things that Pelosi can't control.</p><p>There's the Uber investigation, the Horowitz, the Durham investigation. We've got the debates, we've got nine crazy debates still to go. And there's going to be a lot of atmospherics that you can't anticipate.</p><p>She can't control the news cycle when she let the genie out of the bottle and nobody knows what's going to happen. But I don't think it's going to be good for her in a long run. They've taken out their premiere candidate, Joe Biden.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, Victor Davis Hanson, we're delighted to have our premiere guest with us again tonight. Come back soon.</p><p>HANSON: Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS: Stay with us. We'll be right back with more.</p><p>DOBBS: The desperate Radical Dems coup attempt against the president again over a highly questionable whistleblower claim, senior policy advisor for the president, Stephen Miller with a warning about what's at stake.</p><p>MILLER: But what you have with this current non-scandal, non-controversy made-up phoney story from this fake whistleblower about Ukraine, what you have is somebody inside the government along with their allies trying to overthrow a democratically elected president so they can get their policies that they want put in place.

Many of the Radical Dems and the left wing national media are in harmony on almost all national issues. And there's no dissidents at all with the views of corporate America and Wall Street.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And they passionately oppose with scant exceptions. President Trump tough stands on China's expansionary foreign policy and its mercantile trade policies, and outright theft of American technology and intellectual property. No matter it seems the cost to the United States and American workers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(START VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BILL MAHER, TV HOST AND POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: I have been saying for about two years that I hope we have a recession. A recession would be very worth getting rid of Donald Trump.</p><p>JOHN AVLON, CNN ANCHOR: There are plenty of signs of a possible recession.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: If we did face a recession, it would be normal, and it would be okay.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: There's been sort of a wing in the administration that has kind of push to be tough on China. But even though those people I'm hearing are starting to realize the importance of getting a deal done with China if they all want to have a job four years from now.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: President Trump today reminded all Americans of Beijing's decades of predatory trade practices China's theft of American intellectual property and technology, and the massive trade surpluses with United States over decades. It all amounts to trillions of dollars.</p><p>(START VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: China has been ripping this country off for 25 years, or longer than that. And it's about time, whether good for our country or bad for our country short-term. Long-term, it's imperative that somebody does this.</p><p>I don't know how to value intellectual property theft but they have experts let's say it's at least $300 billion a year where they steal it, somebody had to do something with China.</p><p>Obama should have done it, Bush should have done it, Clinton should have done it, they all should have done it. Nobody did it, I'm doing it. So what do you say, my trade deals are causing -- my trade deals aren't causing a problem.</p><p>This is something that had to be done, the only differences I'm doing it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: Is trade deals are actually the solution? Tonight we ask why everyone of President Trump's public policy initiatives and policies whether it be challenging China's aggression or its trade deficits or the President's efforts to secure our border with Mexico and to assure the safety of Americans.</p><p>Why is that anathema to the radical Dems, the rinos, the national left wing media, corporate America, and Wall Street? Why is it the elites hate our president and his America first agenda?</p><p>It all begs the question, who would these globalist elites put first if not America? We'll try to get to the answer to that question here tonight. And is the president support amongst African-Americans and Hispanics, the reason that the radical left has now ginned up its baseless vicious attacks using race as a weapon.</p><p>And has the once reliable coalition of the left, finally had its feel of the Democratic Party's insult. The country two largest minority groups appear to be tiring of the left, treating them like fools, as if they will continue to put up with senseless slurs against this president with no evidence, just hate while the president produces for all Americans, keeping his promise to all Americans.</p><p>The president's policies delivering record employment levels for African- Americans last month, near record levels of unemployment at six percent.</p><p>Hispanics also enjoying near record levels of unemployment at 4.5 percent. We'll show you the latest polling on the president support among those groups and likely the reason that Democrats are in a new higher stage of desperation.</p><p>We begin tonight with breaking news. NRA Chief Executive Wayne LaPierre says President Trump today assured him that universal background checks are off the table. The NRA tweeted the development, President Trump had sent clear signals on the issue earlier in the day.</p><p>President Trump saying that he and the Republican Party are very strong on the second amendment.</p><p>(START VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: The Democrats would I believe, I think they'd give up the second amendment. And the people that a lot of the people that put me where I am, are strong believers in the second amendment, and I am also, and we have to be very careful about that.</p><p>You know, they call it the slippery slope, and all of a sudden everything gets taken away, we're not going to let that happen.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: And joining us tonight, former congressman, former chairman of the house oversight committee, Jason Chaffetz, also best-selling author and Fox Business contributor. Jason, you just heard the president say strong on the second amendment, your thoughts about the president's position out of the Republican Party?</p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: No, I think the president is spot on. He understands this issue, his son is an avid shooter, most of the complaints you get people and not all, but most of the complaints you get from people are people that aren't familiar with weapons, I happen to have five, I'm a conceal-carry permit holder.</p><p>Most people go through background checks when they go to purchase a gun and I don't think as you look at these mass shootings that any of those changes that the Democrats are saying, one more law was going to suddenly change things.</p><p>There are things that we can do, but this so-called universal background check, I don't think is one of them.</p><p>DOBBS: I agree with you a hundred percent and the reality is that lawful purchases at gun shops require a background check. What we are experiencing.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: That's right.</p><p>DOBBS: What we are experiencing in every instance as you alluded is someone a family member, a counselor at a high school not reporting people who are troubled, who are in dire need of help and there's an awful and tragic list of those circumstanced.</p><p>But none of this bring, you know taking away second amendment rights of Americans would address the issue at all.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Yeah, they usually go after the suspicious list people the honest hardworking Americans who maybe like hunting or they want to carry a weapon to feel more safe.</p><p>They put more impediments upon them, what they should do, what I hope the president does embrace what I advocate is don't allow those people that are teenagers less than 18 years old that we know are entangled with law don't expunge their record when they suddenly become 18 allow law enforcement to look at those people when they suddenly turn 18. I would do more than anything Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: And you've got Lindsey Graham, you know going on about red flag laws which is to me is just bizarre and acting as if he is some sort of secondary presidential spokesman particularly on the second amendment for which he is imminently not qualified.</p><p>We're getting such nonsense and the judiciary committee in the Senate hasn't done any investigating, it is not focused on any of these issues when it could be taking on the issue of mental health in this country and instead playing at margin, and you know we never know with Lindsey Graham how fungible that idea or position will be.</p><p>But let's turn to the constancy of this president on China. Today, saying clearly, you know he is the man who has to turn things around. There is no doubt about that, even amongst the elites on Wall Street, the left wing media, and, of course, in politics, they all understand the truth of the president's position. If he doesn't stand here, all could be lost.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: I think everybody in their gut understands that China had been ripping us off for a very long time. I think that America figured out that they wanted a disruptive and unconventional president.</p><p>And Donald Trump is about the only personality that I think would have the true guts as president to take this on and win it. Not just in a short term but the long term and it takes a president like Donald Trump, he's not a resume item, he's not trying to get a cool business card, he doesn't need to go out and make more money after this job.</p><p>He's already got enough but he could actually stand firm, and that's what the people that are in the heartland of America understand. They know that, that's why he's doing so well and will continue to thrive.</p><p>DOBBS: And it's truly amazing, even Tom Friedman the New York Times columnist hardly a Trump supporter acknowledging that the president is exactly right to take the stand, to take this position.</p><p>Jamie Dimon doing so as well and yet, still the flirtation with the globalist elite and that suffocating crowd that you know, lead Wall Street, Steve Schwarzman and the list goes on. I won't get into the names.</p><p>This president standing up to the power, a political power, the economic power of those elites has been people do not I think appreciate how strong he's had to be to deal with that.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Yeah. I mean they're used to having a president who kind of tip-toe through the tulips and don't want to offend anybody yet here comes Donald Trump willing to blow down that whole tulip field and say all right fellows, here's what we're going to do.</p><p>We're going to start selling stuff to Taiwan. We are very supportive of what's going on with those protesters in Hong Kong, and you're not going to take advantage of America.</p><p>So you know, we're going to put some tariffs on you until you get your act straight, we just want to have fair, balance trade. I think that's a good winning message.</p><p>DOBBS: Yeah, I think it is too. I would like to quarrel with you about a word, you called him unconventional. Conventional is Clinton, Bush, Obama, that's conventional and each one of them failing.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Yeah.</p><p>DOBBS: The fact is he's a historic president, Jason. And I don't see why any Republican should hesitate to use the word because everyone in the Republican Party knows he has done more in two and a half years than any president in modern history, and he should be credited with that, don't you think?</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Yeah, I say it with fondness. I say that he's broken the mold that if you wanted different results you had to do it a different way and America figured that out.</p><p>They had a plethora of Washington, D.C. insiders running for president, but America rejected all that. They said no, we want somebody from the business community who could stand up, and get done put America first.</p><p>A lot of people still don't understand make America, you the maggot, the whole slogan, they don't even get it. They still don't get it.</p><p>DOBBS: And you know the president make America great again, something that you would think every American could embrace, but just about half the country is running from it because they don't understand the man, the country, or the times in which we live, or the challenges that face this nation.</p><p>And they don't care to open their eyes to the reality. Jason Chaffetz, great to have you with us, and I can't wait for your new book. A reminder about Jason's new book, \"Power Grab, The Liberal Scheme to Undermine Trump, the GOP and our Republic.\" We recommend to you highly and Jason just after thought, is it possible to order early?</p><p>CHAFFETZ: You could order early it's discounted now, and then it will be ship and be available for sale the day after Labor Day, September 3rd. Thanks Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: You bet, Jason. Good luck with the book. Jason Chaffetz.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS: Up next, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo rallying international support to further isolate Iran. Plus rino Paul Ryan, he left the swamp or did he? What's he saying? Is he turning his back on the heartland so soon? We'll have that story and much, right after the break, stay with us.</p><p>DOBBS: Forever never Trump-rino, Paul Ryan apparently now, way too big for Janesville, Wisconsin. A spokesperson for the former speaker of the house says his family is now temporarily renting a house in Maryland, so his wife can be closer to her family.</p><p>Ryan you recall made it clear, during his time in Congress that it was his career not a choice that brought him to D.C. So there you are, wondering what else has drawn him back to the swamp.</p><p>New poll shows Joe Biden once again commanding a double digit lead against the other 2020 Dem presidential hopefuls. CNN finding 29 percent of likely Democratic voters say they support Biden as for Kamala Harris, her popularity has plunged again now down to 5 percent, down 12 points from June.</p><p>Similar numbers in the recent Fox News poll in which Biden has 31 percent of support of Democratic voters, Harris 8 percent.</p><p>Joining us tonight former Reagan White House political director, Fox Business political analyst, the savant himself, Ed Rollins.</p><p>ED ROLLINS, FORMER REAGAN WHITE HOUSE POLITICAL DIRECTOR: Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS: Good to see you. Let's start with Biden is a hard man. He is resilient in these polls.</p><p>ROLLINS: Well the bottom line here is you can't pay too much attention to polls at-this-point. He's done it about 25.</p><p>DOBBS: Look at the long ways to go partner, don't tell me not to use it.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ROLLINS: We're going focus on polls all the way through, but let me just try and put things in. Until voters actually get to vote and that's in Iowa, that's in New Hampshire, and that's in South Carolina, the super Tuesday right after that.</p><p>It doesn't matter, this thing move back and forth. What he is, is he's the biggest name in the party, he is Obama-light in all practical -- I mean he's not Obama and he does not have issues of his own and so he's got --</p><p>DOBBS: What do you mean, he doesn't have any issues of his own?</p><p>ROLLINS: He doesn't have any issues and you take --</p><p>DOBBS: I got you.</p><p>ROLLINS: And you take two chasers, Bernie Sanders and --</p><p>DOBBS: Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren.</p><p>ROLLINS: Warren and Sanders basically had the same numbers he has. They have 15 and 14 percent, so it's 29 percent for that sort of social element.</p><p>So my sense is once he gets into combat which he's never been a good candidate, he's been a very good candidate here, he will drop. Democrats wanted on him --</p><p>DOBBS: He's in combat with himself it seems right now.</p><p>ROLLINS: That's exactly right.</p><p>DOBBS: But he did utter my very favorite Bidenism of you can call it that and that is he said, we believe in facts not truth. I am still working with that one. That is a beauty.</p><p>ROLLINS: But don't forget, remember, Rudy Giuliani was way ahead, and he didn't score well and Governor Bush is way ahead and he didn't score well.</p><p>So voters going to shout out at him and that changes the dynamics dramatically in Democrats and our party is basically we have our nominee, and all these others that won't to, that is too bad. They have to wait four years, six years before they get another shot.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, you know, apparently this guy \"mooch.\" What is going on there?</p><p>ROLLINS: Scaramucci is a fool. He never would have been heard from by anybody if president hadn't kindly put him in a position he wasn't qualified for which he lasted all of about 10 days. Ivanka and the son's choice to sort of --</p><p>DOBBS: Jared?</p><p>ROLLINS: Jared. One of many bad choices and he crashed and burned him. And now he's out --</p><p>DOBBS: Spectacularly.</p><p>ROLLINS: Exactly. I mean he always next 25 years, he'll be a term to someone Scaramucci when they crash it. And now he's out basically being I'm going to go take on somebody --</p><p>DOBBS: He's one of the most vicious, petty, nonsensical --</p><p>ROLLINS: Stupid, let's just put it this way. He doesn't know politics. He's a stupid, stupid man.</p><p>DOBBS: We'll --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ROLLINS: That's being kind.</p><p>DOBBS: I think we'll just sort of bury the issue of him for a while. Ryan, moving to D.C.? This is the guy who is flying back and forth on weekends to be with his family.</p><p>ROLLINS: Ryan has been a Washingtonian forever. He started there an intern and basically elected the Congress. His family live in Wisconsin where he got elected from but he's a Washingtonian and he'll never leave there the rest of his life.</p><p>He'll make tremendous amount of money being a lobbyist or heading a trade association like Chamber of Commerce or something like that. Make millions of dollar and that's part of the problem.</p><p>The establishment of that town is now ex-people like him, don't represent the people, they represent, whatever those best and interest is. I'm not surprised at a --</p><p>DOBBS: And the president, he's being attacked by the left, day and night, from all quarters, from all direction, whether it is recession, whether it is racism, whether it is Russia, you know the latest they're trying to -- for some reason the Radical Dems are having a hard time getting away from ours who was at George, Kellyanne's husband?</p><p>ROLLINS: George Conway.</p><p>DOBBS: Yeah, George Conway. It's good thing we're here to help each other, right?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>But anyway, I mean going after him, how does he put up with this much ignorance?</p><p>ROLLINS: Because he's tough, and he's smart and he basically knows it doesn't matter at the end of the day, he is doing what he said he was going to do.</p><p>He basically is going to gigantic economy, he's rebuilding the military, the country. And I always throw the question out, do you want Biden? Why would you want to go back to what was there?</p><p>And he's not even good as Obama was, he wasn't as good as communicator. My sense is president has been a superb job, and the country and this country at end of the day, when he's at campaign and he's focused on whoever the Democrat nominates whether it's Biden or whoever, the public will get a choice, and the choice will be very clear.</p><p>DOBBS: If it's not right now.</p><p>ROLLINS: Yes, what's clear right now?</p><p>DOBBS: It's what I think.</p><p>ROLLINS: We just need the campaign.</p><p>DOBBS: He need that vote, don't we.</p><p>ROLLINS: Need that vote.</p><p>DOBBS: Ed Rollins, thanks so much.</p><p>ROLLINS: Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS: Good to see you my friend. Well, the border patrol says they arrested a large group of nearly 200 illegals from Central America near a New Mexico port of entry.</p><p>Border agencies still tell us apprehensions are falling and while they have declined by some 60,000 since May the number of apprehension still are much higher year-over-year.</p><p>We'll have more on the crisis along the Mexican border in tonight's broadcast, Damon Hinigher, the CEO of CoreCivic, one of the largest operators of ice detention facilities will be joining us later tonight to talk about business and particularly banks playing politics.</p><p>Up next, a new study shows China could cripple the U.S. military in the Pacific within hours. Can you believe that? Wow. Just who is behind such a study and how credible is it? I mean hours, not days?</p><p>We'll take that up after the break and see when you think of it all, stay with us.</p><p>Dobbs: Officials in Greece say they have no requests for the Iranian oil tanker to dock at its ports as the U.S. state department warns them against helping the vessel. This comes as sources tell Fox News that a second Iranian tanker is now headed to Syria that would be in violation of U.S. sanctions though beneath a queen reporting to plan to transfer its cargo of crude oil two Syrian-owned tankers later in the year.</p><p>And Australian think tank warning China could win and end the pacific war against the United States in a matter of hours. Researchers from the University of Sydney claimed that China could launch a military attack against our allies in the region and when before the United States could even respond.</p><p>You know when you see something this dramatic and this alarming, you ask yourself, who did this study? Well, three people, basically three entities, I should say, the Australian government and two military defense companies.</p><p>Northrop Grumman and Telus a French company, makes you wonder doesn't it? President Trump for his parts as he's not losing any sleep over this.</p><p>(START VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We have the strongest military in the world right now, and we're getting very close to finishing that whole rebuilding. We've rebuilt the military. Right, there's nobody that's even close to us militarily not even close.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: so it doesn't concern you at all if the Chinese military?</p><p>TRUMP: No, because they'd pay a price that they wouldn't want to pay.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>Joining us tonight, Fox Business national security and foreign policy analyst, Dr. Walid Phares, and Dr. Sebastian Gorka, host of Salem Radio's America First, a selling author, former strategist to President Trump.</p><p>Good both of you to be here. Let's start with Iran, Walid. This business with the tankers, why is this so significant, and why is the United States to this point hapless, if it wishes to stop the tanker and confiscate it, why hasn't it done so?</p><p>WALID PHARES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK FOREIGN POLICY ANALYST: Well first thing, Lou, this demonstrates very clearly that the Iran regime is starving. They want their tankers to go anywhere they can sell and Syria is an ally back by Russia at this point in time.</p><p>This is evidence that we are successful with regard to Iran. On the other hand, seizing a tanker, I mean the United States before making such a decision needs to have the bigger plan.</p><p>So what happens next? The Iranians is going to move. Where we're going to move? It's not just across the Gulf or the Mediterranean, maybe in Iraq, maybe in Syria.</p><p>So I would give the administration the credit of being willing to study what should be done but definitely we're not going to allow Iran to break those sanctions.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, it looks to me though we haven't had a -- we haven't got an answer or at least a good one. Seb, what do you think?</p><p>GORKA: I tend to agree with Walid, this is a regime that's tottering the sanctions that we've reimposed following the president's incredibly sagacious decision to cancel the disastrous JCPOA Iran deal that we inherited from Obama has really put the squeeze on Iran, they're desperate. This is a nation that is so so very rich in oil but barely has a capacity to refine any of the oil that's under its own soil. This is just -- as far as I'm concerned Lou, this is rusty saber-rattling and it's a very good sign.</p><p>DOBBS: OK, we will take it as that. And the issue of ISIS, and I want to ask you Walid first, these accounts of ISIS in some sort of resurgence no matter how if you will nascent or control. It's alarming when you think about the Taliban in Afghanistan and ISIS and the relationship between those two. I see almost no mention of that relationship between ISIS and the Taliban. It's critical to the -- to the president's plans to rationalize our military presence around the world.</p><p>PHARES: It's true, this is a problem, meaning how to deal with the jihadist movements around the world on the long term. But let's be realistic, ISIS real estate and Syria and Iraq strategically is gone. The administration has done a formidable job in making sure that the Caliphate has gone.</p><p>Now, these are spasms. They're going to have them in Syria and Iraq and Afghanistan and 52 countries around the world possibly. But the concern I have is not really ISIS in Syria that can be handled, it's what we're doing in terms of cutting a deal with the Taliban in Qatar. That's a question that needs to be debated. I don't trust the Taliban before they'll reform and they are not reforming so far.</p><p>DOBBS: And the relationship between the Taliban and ISIS.</p><p>PHARES: I think that the Taliban are cutting deals with Al-Qaeda with ISIS are telling them, look guys, let me deal with the Americans first. Let us getting them out of Afghanistan and then we can have all what we want after they're gone. We should not be naive to allow the Taliban to proceed in that direction.</p><p>DOBBS: And Seb, I want to ask you as we wrap up here. China is confronting us across -- around the globe, Russia is doing so region by region but particularly in the Middle East. Your thoughts about the challenge they both represent now working together against the United States.</p><p>GORKA: Well, look, under the former KGB Colonel Vladimir Putin, Russia is still an international threat. It's a destabilizing force but it is also a nation in massive decline. 600,000 people die in Russia every year, more than our born. It's in a democratic -- demographic tailspin.</p><p>With regards to that study from Sydney, you asked the right question, Lou. This center nobody's heard of, the American Studies Center, the University of Sydney, this report three people that have never been heard of in the international community. This smacks a propaganda, the idea that China --</p><p>DOBBS: Yes.</p><p>GORKA: China is our number one strategic foe, but the idea that they could defeat us in a matter of hours, one metric, Lou, China has one aircraft carrier that is diesel power that they bought second-hand from Ukraine. We America have 12 nuclear aircraft carriers. This is a farce of a study.</p><p>DOBBS: They wouldn't be trying to gin up a little -- you know, contractors.</p><p>GORKA: Business. A little bit of business, right. You nailed it -- you nailed it.</p><p>DOBBS: Walid, you get the last word.</p><p>PHARES: Look, I agree with the professor that China has not had any experience in global warfare since when, since the Korean War. We have been there, we have been having all these experiences.</p><p>But above all as Seb said, we are all over the -- we are already deployed everywhere in the world. We can reach any point in hours actually. They should have done the study about our forces, that would apply to U.S. Air Forces not the China.</p><p>DOBBS: I think you both would agree with me that we would forego all of that experience and be willing to lament our -- well, our smaller presence around the globe rather than the vast presence that we have now.</p><p>Walid Phares, Sebastian Gorka, thank you both for being with us.</p><p>GORKA: Thank you, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: We'd like to hear your thoughts on all of this. Share your comments, follow me on Twitter @LouDobbs, like me on Facebook, follow me on Instagram @LouDobbsTonight.</p><p>Up next, a shocking new study exposes more of Facebook's bias against conservative voices and also its pre-election to what seems to be a very authoritarian perspective perhaps even goal. We'll have that and more right after this quick break, stay with us.</p><p>DOBBS: The Wall Street Journal tonight reporting that a group of state attorneys general preparing to launch a broad investigation in to technology giants including Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Google. Their investigation could begin as soon as next month and will focus on whether those companies use their economic power to stifle competition. It could possibly coincide with the Department of Justice's ongoing current antitrust investigation of the same subjects and perhaps more.</p><p>A recent audit finds a political diversity problem at Facebook, imagine that. The study written by former Republican senator Jon Kyl found a lack of conservative voices among its employees and its board of directors. Facebook did not give Senator Kyle direct access to its current content policies or algorithms which will be used to create a so-called news tab. That tab featuring media outlets, hand-picked and paid for by Facebook.</p><p>Well, joining me tonight, former Trump campaign manager, author Corey Lewandowski. Corey, good to have you with us.</p><p>The president taking on all comers and today saying straightforwardly on China, if he hadn't done it, nobody would have and where in the world were the three presidents at least who preceded it?</p><p>COREY LEWANDOWSKI, FORMER DONALD TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER: You know, Lou, as you look -- as we look back on this administration in 30 years from now, we're going to be looking at what Donald Trump has done to level the playing field against China. I'm going to be thanking him knowing that the American worker can compete with anybody if we have a level playing field. But for too long, China's taken advantage of the United States of America either through the theft of intellectual property, the currency manipulation they continue to do or just very candidly stealing our intellectual property without even telling us about it.</p><p>And so, they subsidize their companies, they dump their products in our U.S. soil and they put American companies out of business.</p><p>This president has stood up to the American worker time and time again and this is going to be one of his legacies when we look back when this administration is over 30 years down the road. And our children, our grandchildren will be thankful that this president stood up to the oppressive regime in China that is trying to rip us off every single day.</p><p>DOBBS: And you know, he was the lone among the candidates talking about as a -- as a presidential candidate taking on Silicon Valley. He has said straightforwardly that he wants to know what in the world is going on out there and is incensed by the anti-conservative bias of social media. This looks like we're going to see at least a joint effort at least an informal one as the state attorneys general are taking on technology in Silicon Valley as is the Department of Justice.</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI: Well, you know, Lou I don't agree with many of the state attorneys general out there and particularly the state attorney general of New York. But in this particular case, I happen to say I agree with her because she understands that -- look, these companies in Silicon Valley have done a terrible job of protecting people's personal privacy information. They've done a terrible job of just being a platform for sharing information they're completely biased. They're now forcing the American public to go to their news feeds and they're now becoming quote- unquote, journalists through their news feeds.</p><p>And so, look, if the government doesn't regulate the information that they're sharing and how they're protecting that information, we're going to have a big problem because these companies are actually determining what the American people are seeing on a daily basis.</p><p>DOBBS: Yes, and doing what they wish with all of the user data that they possess and without consequence. Not so -- not so in Europe where Europe is coming down hard on all of this, the anti competitive predatory practices as well as they're just the absolute disregard and violation of privacy.</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI: Well, Lou, we see it every day. We see another story that some company is listening in on your home because you've got Alexa at home where we see that -- you know, the cookies that they're taking off of your computer that they know when you're walking on your telephone. They know when you're literally driving in a car. They know your entire route. Fox News did a giant expose on this about a year ago. Even when you shut off your telephone.</p><p>These companies are tracking you every day. You supposedly agree to it when you turn on your telephone. I don't think that's what it's supposed to be and the American people deserve better.</p><p>DOBBS: So what are they hearing when they're listening to your phone and watching you and your home and as you travel and making your plans to run for the Senate?</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI: They're hearing there's a lot of people in New Hampshire want me to beat Jeanne Shaheen who did vote for Gorsuch or you know, Kavanaugh and voted to keep funding sanctuary cities. So that's what's on my phone right now every day, Lou. And look, I think, you know, the people in New Hampshire want to change.</p><p>DOBBS: And the president says you would be very tough to defeat. Are you -- wouldn't -- will we hear definitively that you're going to take care of business?</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI: Well, we had the president in New Hampshire last Thursday night, it was an amazing rally. He beat Elton John for the number of people who could fit into that arena, the tens of thousands of people outside. He was very encouraging. I'm going to spend a little more time thinking about it, Lou. But I promise you this, when I decide to do it, I'll break it on your show, how's that?</p><p>DOBBS: I appreciate it, we look forward to it.</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI: Thank you, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Corey, thank you so much, Corey Lewandowski.</p><p>Up next, big banks bending to the demands of the so-called social justice warriors refusing to fund border detention facilities, nothing like business and politics. We'll have much more on that right after the break. Stay with us.</p><p>DOBBS: A new report says Border Patrol agents in California are seeing a spike in drugs coming into this country from Mexico. Senior officials at the El Centro sector say so far this month, millions and millions of dollars of cocaine, meth, and fentanyl have been seized. Border agents are trying to figure out why they're seeing this spike in drugs coming across their sector of that border.</p><p>Joining us tonight is the President and CEO of the country's largest and oldest private prison company Damon Hininger from CoreCivic. Damon, good to have you with us. Let's start with the number of banks now that are refusing to bank companies like yours because they feel that they don't want to help Immigration and Customs Enforcement.</p><p>DAMON HININGER, PRESIDEN AND CEO, CORECIVIC: Absolutely, Lou. Well, thank you so much for having me. So yes, it's been very frustrating. We've been around 35 years providing great solutions to federal state and local governments during that period of time and we do really three key things.</p><p>We own and operate prisons, jails, detention centers where we provide some really great reentry programming that helps reduce recidivism. We also provide real estate solutions where we provide new modern facilities to state and local governments where they can get efficiencies but also have more programmatic space for offenders entering their care.</p><p>And then finally we do community facilities where we're providing the last six or 12 months before individuals get released into the community given that head start re-unify their family and also connect with an employer.</p><p>So yes, it's very frustrating to these banks that have been with us you know ten, 20, you know, 30 years.</p><p>MELBER: So why are -- why are they telling you they don't want your business?</p><p>HININGER: They don't have a good reason. And here's -- and here's what's frustrating is that the business that we do today, it's the same business we've been doing for 35 years, and it's the same business we did under President Obama.</p><p>So these great solutions that we're providing especially for ICE and Marshal Service, it's the exact same service. They don't -- they don't have a good reason, to be honest with you. It's pure politics in my view.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, it's pure politics and that may be the reason and one would suspect it could be the only reason to see commercial banks engaged in making political-economic judgments in point of fact for political purposes. This is stunning stuff.</p><p>I want to share with the audience, Brian Moynihan, the head of Bank of America on -- are you ready -- on illegal immigration. Let's roll that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIAN MOYNIHAN, CEO, BANK OF AMERICA: We need to get immigration right. We need people in this country. We're not creating people fast enough. The population is growing half the rate it was before the -- before the financial crisis. And so we'll grow faster if we have more people. And so it's got to be organized and efficient. It's got to be well documented and everything. And that's the crisis we're facing is just when we need more people, we're in a crisis of trying to figure out how to do it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: Wow. That's pretty clear. It's about immigration and he's got the solution, more people. And we got to have him, he says. It's really stunning to see what you're up against because you're not alone. Corporate America right now through the Business Roundtable made it very clear, the shareholders are not the stakeholders of primacy or priority.</p><p>They're opening it up to whatever a political organization wants to take them on in the community. It's pretty -- what's your recourse here? What are you going to do?</p><p>HININGER: Well, let me tell you. I read the announcement yesterday from the Business Roundtable very closely and, of course, as you know, Jamie Dimon is the Chair of that roundtable on being a CEO of JP Morgan who was a longtime banking partner of ours. And you know, my view and that is we are doing it those things that they're talking about.</p><p>I mean, we have a great company from earnest's perspective. We've got 30 percent growth year over year. We've got --</p><p>DOBBS: But what I mean is --</p><p>HININGER: But I guess my point, Lou, is --</p><p>DOBBS: What are you going to do?</p><p>HININGER: Well, so here's what we're going to do. We do great work within our facilities reducing recidivism. And the programs we provide are clearly showing that we're getting people when we released not come back to criminal justice system.</p><p>So we are talking and I'd encourage banks specially that are in a roundtable, if they want to be part of the overall solution in criminal justice reform in the United States, we are right in that sweet spot. We are in that discussion on helping people get better --</p><p>DOBBS: Damon, you and I both know that they don't give a whit.</p><p>HININGER: Well, you know, I know there's a lot of banks out there --</p><p>DOBBS: Do you have legal recourse.</p><p>HININGER: Well, I'll tell you this. There is a lot of folks up on the Hill both in the House and Senate and even the regulators have engaged this topic. So there's a lot of interest I should say both in legislative branch but also within the administration.</p><p>DOBBS: Oh I don't think banking regulators would go out of their minds. They have fiduciary responsibilities to both their shareholders and of course what they're doing here is outrageous.</p><p>HININGER: Absolutely.</p><p>DOBBS: So why is there not a challenge from the Fed, the controller of the currency, why aren't they reacting here?</p><p>HININGER: Well, I'll tell you, they're very --</p><p>DOBBS: And the Justice Department for crying out loud.</p><p>HININGER: Right. Yes, I will tell you, Lou, there is a lot -- a lot of interest I'll say I can't share anything tonight, but there's been a lot of interest in the last you know, 30 days from regulators and legislators. So really both sides of the branches of government --</p><p>DOBBS: You know, I get so good I get so tired of hearing that you know, there's nothing yet, and I don't mean from you. But when it comes to this government, it is glacial at best and one -- you know, I mean, they need to deal with this because this is it seems to me on its face a disaster that has to be corrected by the regulators. Who the hell do these people think they are, Damon?</p><p>HININGER: And you know, we are so critical especially the Marshals Services and ICE. They don't have any alternatives. So our solutions have been proven time and time again be very, very effective, very flexible and cost-effective.</p><p>DOBBS: Damon Hininger, good to have you with us. The company -- the CEO of the company CoreCivic. Thanks so much. I appreciate it.</p><p>HININGER: Lou, thank you.</p><p>DOBBS: Keep me posted on any developments of which you cannot speak.</p><p>HININGER: Yes, sir. Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS: And I promise to keep it a secret.</p><p>HININGER: Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS: Thanks so much. Up next, President Trump explaining his top trade stance with China. Why should he have to for crying out loud? We'll have more on that and much more right after this quick break.</p><p>DOBBS: On Wall Street, Stocks moving lower today. The Dow down 173 points selling into the close, the S&amp;P down 23, the Nasdaq dropped 54, volume on the big board light trading three billion shares. Crude oil up a quarter of a percent, over $56.00 a barrel, gold gained a quarter of a percent, silver gaining more than a percent. A reminder listen to my reports three times a day coast to coast on the Salem Radio Network.</p><p>President Trump at the White House today defending his tough stance on China saying China has been ripping this country off for more than a quarter-century.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Somebody had to take on what China was doing to the United States economically. We're winning big. I took it on. And it should have been done by previous presidents but I took it on. And I'm happy to do it because it had to be done. And the smart people say thank you very much, and the dumb people have no idea. And then you have the political people and they go with the wind.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: And that's a pretty good summation. That's it for us tonight. Attorneys Victoria Toensing, Joe diGenova among our guests here tomorrow night. And a reminder to follow me on Twitter @LouDobbs, like me on Facebook, follow me on Instagram @LouDobbsTonight. I'm looking forward to tomorrow night. I hope you are as well. See you then. Thanks for being with us. Good night from New York.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Lawmakers from both parties insisted they cannot trust the social network giant.</p><p>\"I think you're pretty low on the trust spectrum right now, and understandably,\" Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, D-Texas, told David Marcus, the Facebook executive leading the project. It was Marcus' second straight day of tough questioning by lawmakers.</p><p>Among their concerns is the risk that the new currency, to be called Libra, could be used for illicit activity such as money laundering or drug trafficking. Lawmakers also worry that the massive reserve created with money used to buy Libra could supplant the Federal Reserve and destabilize the financial system, and that consumers could be hurt by Libra losses.</p><p>The committee's leader, Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., has asked Facebook to suspend its plan for the new currency until regulators and lawmakers have a chance to fully review it. She renewed that demand to Marcus.</p><p>Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., asked that Facebook commit to starting with a pilot project with no more than a million users, overseen by the Federal Reserve.</p><p>If Facebook cannot meet that request, Maloney said, \"then Congress should seriously consider stopping this project from moving forward.\"</p><p>Waters held out the prospect of legislation that would prohibit big tech companies such as Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple from becoming chartered or licensed as U.S. financial institutions, and thus able to offer banking services, and specifically from establishing a digital currency.</p><p>Facebook, marshaling its more than 2 billion users around the world, \"is apparently trying to create a new global financial system that will compete with the U.S. dollar,\" Waters said.</p><p>The congressional criticism thickened the cloud over Facebook's plan, coming after negative statements and expressions of concern from the two most powerful financial regulators , Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, as well as from President Donald Trump himself.</p><p>In a rare endorsement of Trump's views, committee Democrats projected his negative tweets last week about cryptocurrencies and Libra on a giant electronic screen in the hearing room. Trump said Libra \"will have little standing or dependability.\"</p><p>As he did at Tuesday's hearing by the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, Marcus repeatedly took pains to assure lawmakers that Facebook would not launch the currency project until it had received all the necessary approvals from regulators and secured safeguards to protect the privacy of users' data. He said Facebook will not control Libra because Facebook will be only one of about 100 companies and nonprofits in an association that will manage the currency.</p><p>Marcus said the plan would open low-cost online commerce to millions of people around the world who lack access to bank accounts and would make it cheaper to send money across borders.</p><p>He did not agree to a suspension of the plan or a pilot project.</p><p>\"We will take the time to get this right,\" Marcus said.</p><p>He said Facebook isn't looking to base the Libra project in Switzerland in order to evade oversight, but because that country is recognized as an international financial center.</p><p>Acknowledging lawmakers' concerns over Facebook's record on data privacy , Marcus said, \"I think trust is essential and it's clear we've made mistakes. We're owning these mistakes.\"</p><p>The committee's senior Republican, Rep. Patrick McHenry of North Carolina, said skepticism over the project is justified but the effort should not be prohibited outright. A thorough review is needed, \"instead of a knee-jerk reaction of banning something before it begins,\" McHenry said.</p><p>Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., said the legislation Waters is proposing to ban big tech companies from banking \"has no constitutional basis.\"</p><p>Marcus' assurance that Facebook won't control Libra failed to convince Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Calif., who focused on Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.</p><p>\"This is the Zuck buck,\" Sherman insisted. \"This is a godsend to drug dealers\" and other criminals. \"Zuckerberg has billions but he doesn't have the authority to print more. ... This is an attempt to transfer enormous power from America to Facebook and its allies.\"</p><p>The planned digital currency is to be a blend of multiple currencies, which means the exchange rate will fluctuate.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APINTL-96e9d5753c124fbea7ec4f7e98b66e23</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APINTL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKM-K301-JC65-53M8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138211</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"788\"/><timeReceived>9:06 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press International</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 17, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Lawmakers from both parties insisted they cannot trust the social network giant.</p><p>\"I think you're pretty low on the trust spectrum right now, and understandably,\" Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, D-Texas, told David Marcus, the Facebook executive leading the project. It was Marcus' second straight day of tough questioning by lawmakers.</p><p>Among their concerns is the risk that the new currency, to be called Libra, could be used for illicit activity such as money laundering or drug trafficking. Lawmakers also worry that the massive reserve created with money used to buy Libra could supplant the Federal Reserve and destabilize the financial system, and that consumers could be hurt by Libra losses.</p><p>The committee's leader, Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., has asked Facebook to suspend its plan for the new currency until regulators and lawmakers have a chance to fully review it. She renewed that demand to Marcus.</p><p>Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., asked that Facebook commit to starting with a pilot project with no more than a million users, overseen by the Federal Reserve.</p><p>If Facebook cannot meet that request, Maloney said, \"then Congress should seriously consider stopping this project from moving forward.\"</p><p>Waters held out the prospect of legislation that would prohibit big tech companies such as Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple from becoming chartered or licensed as U.S. financial institutions, and thus able to offer banking services, and specifically from establishing a digital currency.</p><p>Facebook, marshaling its more than 2 billion users around the world, \"is apparently trying to create a new global financial system that will compete with the U.S. dollar,\" Waters said.</p><p>The congressional criticism thickened the cloud over Facebook's plan, coming after negative statements and expressions of concern from the two most powerful financial regulators , Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, as well as from President Donald Trump himself.</p><p>In a rare endorsement of Trump's views, committee Democrats projected his negative tweets last week about cryptocurrencies and Libra on a giant electronic screen in the hearing room. Trump said Libra \"will have little standing or dependability.\"</p><p>As he did at Tuesday's hearing by the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, Marcus repeatedly took pains to assure lawmakers that Facebook would not launch the currency project until it had received all the necessary approvals from regulators and secured safeguards to protect the privacy of users' data. He said Facebook will not control Libra because Facebook will be only one of about 100 companies and nonprofits in an association that will manage the currency.</p><p>Marcus said the plan would open low-cost online commerce to millions of people around the world who lack access to bank accounts and would make it cheaper to send money across borders.</p><p>He did not agree to a suspension of the plan or a pilot project.</p><p>\"We will take the time to get this right,\" Marcus said.</p><p>He said Facebook isn't looking to base the Libra project in Switzerland in order to evade oversight, but because that country is recognized as an international financial center.</p><p>Acknowledging lawmakers' concerns over Facebook's record on data privacy , Marcus said, \"I think trust is essential and it's clear we've made mistakes. We're owning these mistakes.\"</p><p>The committee's senior Republican, Rep. Patrick McHenry of North Carolina, said skepticism over the project is justified but the effort should not be prohibited outright. A thorough review is needed, \"instead of a knee-jerk reaction of banning something before it begins,\" McHenry said.</p><p>Rep.

Lawmakers from both parties insisted they cannot trust the social network giant.</p><p>\"I think you're pretty low on the trust spectrum right now, and understandably,\" Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, D-Texas, told David Marcus, the Facebook executive leading the project. It was Marcus' second straight day of tough questioning by lawmakers.</p><p>Among their concerns is the risk that the new currency, to be called Libra, could be used for illicit activity such as money laundering or drug trafficking. Lawmakers also worry that the massive reserve created with money used to buy Libra could supplant the Federal Reserve and destabilize the financial system, and that consumers could be hurt by Libra losses.</p><p>The committee's leader, Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., has asked Facebook to suspend its plan for the new currency until regulators and lawmakers have a chance to fully review it. She renewed that demand to Marcus.</p><p>Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., asked that Facebook commit to starting with a pilot project with no more than a million users, overseen by the Federal Reserve.</p><p>If Facebook cannot meet that request, Maloney said, \"then Congress should seriously consider stopping this project from moving forward.\"</p><p>Waters held out the prospect of legislation that would prohibit big tech companies such as Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple from becoming chartered or licensed as U.S. financial institutions, and thus able to offer banking services, and specifically from establishing a digital currency.</p><p>Facebook, marshaling its more than 2 billion users around the world, \"is apparently trying to create a new global financial system that will compete with the U.S. dollar,\" Waters said.</p><p>The congressional criticism thickened the cloud over Facebook's plan, coming after negative statements and expressions of concern from the two most powerful financial regulators , Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, as well as from President Donald Trump himself.</p><p>In a rare endorsement of Trump's views, committee Democrats projected his negative tweets last week about cryptocurrencies and Libra on a giant electronic screen in the hearing room. Trump said Libra \"will have little standing or dependability.\"</p><p>As he did at Tuesday's hearing by the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, Marcus repeatedly took pains to assure lawmakers that Facebook would not launch the currency project until it had received all the necessary approvals from regulators and secured safeguards to protect the privacy of users' data. He said Facebook will not control Libra because Facebook will be only one of about 100 companies and nonprofits in an association that will manage the currency.</p><p>Marcus said the plan would open low-cost online commerce to millions of people around the world who lack access to bank accounts and would make it cheaper to send money across borders.</p><p>He did not agree to a suspension of the plan or a pilot project.</p><p>\"We will take the time to get this right,\" Marcus said.</p><p>He said Facebook isn't looking to base the Libra project in Switzerland in order to evade oversight, but because that country is recognized as an international financial center.</p><p>Acknowledging lawmakers' concerns over Facebook's record on data privacy , Marcus said, \"I think trust is essential and it's clear we've made mistakes. We're owning these mistakes.\"</p><p>The committee's senior Republican, Rep. Patrick McHenry of North Carolina, said skepticism over the project is justified but the effort should not be prohibited outright.

Lawmakers from both parties insisted they cannot trust the social network giant.</p><p>\"I think you're pretty low on the trust spectrum right now, and understandably,\" Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, D-Texas, told David Marcus, the Facebook executive leading the project. It was Marcus' second straight day of tough questioning by lawmakers.</p><p>Among their concerns is the risk that the new currency, to be called Libra, could be used for illicit activity such as money laundering or drug trafficking. Lawmakers also worry that the massive reserve created with money used to buy Libra could supplant the Federal Reserve and destabilize the financial system, and that consumers could be hurt by Libra losses.</p><p>The committee's leader, Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., has asked Facebook to suspend its plan for the new currency until regulators and lawmakers have a chance to fully review it. She renewed that demand to Marcus.</p><p>Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., asked that Facebook commit to starting with a pilot project with no more than a million users, overseen by the Federal Reserve.</p><p>If Facebook cannot meet that request, Maloney said, \"then Congress should seriously consider stopping this project from moving forward.\"</p><p>Waters held out the prospect of legislation that would prohibit big tech companies such as Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple from becoming chartered or licensed as U.S. financial institutions, and thus able to offer banking services, and specifically from establishing a digital currency.</p><p>Facebook, marshaling its more than 2 billion users around the world, \"is apparently trying to create a new global financial system that will compete with the U.S. dollar,\" Waters said.</p><p>The congressional criticism thickened the cloud over Facebook's plan, coming after negative statements and expressions of concern from the two most powerful financial regulators , Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, as well as from President Donald Trump himself.</p><p>In a rare endorsement of Trump's views, committee Democrats projected his negative tweets last week about cryptocurrencies and Libra on a giant electronic screen in the hearing room. Trump said Libra \"will have little standing or dependability.\"</p><p>As he did at Tuesday's hearing by the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, Marcus repeatedly took pains to assure lawmakers that Facebook would not launch the currency project until it had received all the necessary approvals from regulators and secured safeguards to protect the privacy of users' data. He said Facebook will not control Libra because Facebook will be only one of about 100 companies and nonprofits in an association that will manage the currency.</p><p>Marcus said the plan would open low-cost online commerce to millions of people around the world who lack access to bank accounts and would make it cheaper to send money across borders.</p><p>He did not agree to a suspension of the plan or a pilot project.</p><p>\"We will take the time to get this right,\" Marcus said.</p><p>He said Facebook isn't looking to base the Libra project in Switzerland in order to evade oversight, but because that country is recognized as an international financial center.</p><p>Acknowledging lawmakers' concerns over Facebook's record on data privacy , Marcus said, \"I think trust is essential and it's clear we've made mistakes. We're owning these mistakes.\"</p><p>The committee's senior Republican, Rep. Patrick McHenry of North Carolina, said skepticism over the project is justified but the effort should not be prohibited outright. A thorough review is needed, \"instead of a knee-jerk reaction of banning something before it begins,\" McHenry said.</p><p>Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., said the legislation Waters is proposing to ban big tech companies from banking \"has no constitutional basis.\"</p><p>Marcus' assurance that Facebook won't control Libra failed to convince Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Calif., who focused on Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.</p><p>\"This is the Zuck buck,\" Sherman insisted. \"This is a godsend to drug dealers\" and other criminals. \"Zuckerberg has billions but he doesn't have the authority to print more. ...

Lawmakers from both parties insisted they cannot trust the social network giant.</p><p> \"I think you're pretty low on the trust spectrum right now, and understandably,\" Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, D-Texas, told David Marcus, the Facebook executive leading the project. It was Marcus' second straight day of tough questioning by lawmakers.</p><p> Among their concerns is the risk that the new currency, to be called Libra, could be used for illicit activity such as money laundering or drug trafficking. Lawmakers also worry that the massive reserve created with money used to buy Libra could supplant the Federal Reserve and destabilize the financial system, and that consumers could be hurt by Libra losses.</p><p> The committee's leader, Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., has asked Facebook to suspend its plan for the new currency until regulators and lawmakers have a chance to fully review it. She renewed that demand to Marcus.</p><p> Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., asked that Facebook commit to starting with a pilot project with no more than a million users, overseen by the Federal Reserve.</p><p> If Facebook cannot meet that request, Maloney said, \"then Congress should seriously consider stopping this project from moving forward.\"</p><p> Waters held out the prospect of legislation that would prohibit big tech companies such as Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple from becoming chartered or licensed as U.S. financial institutions, and thus able to offer banking services, and specifically from establishing a digital currency.</p><p>Facebook, marshaling its more than 2 billion users around the world, \"is apparently trying to create a new global financial system that will compete with the U.S. dollar,\" Waters said.</p><p> The congressional criticism thickened the cloud over Facebook's plan, coming after negative statements and expressions of concern from the two most powerful financial regulators , Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, as well as from President Donald Trump himself.</p><p> In a rare endorsement of Trump's views, committee Democrats projected his negative tweets last week about cryptocurrencies and Libra on a giant electronic screen in the hearing room. Trump said Libra \"will have little standing or dependability.\"</p><p> As he did at Tuesday's hearing by the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, Marcus repeatedly took pains to assure lawmakers that Facebook would not launch the currency project until it had received all the necessary approvals from regulators and secured safeguards to protect the privacy of users' data. He said Facebook will not control Libra because Facebook will be only one of about 100 companies and nonprofits in an association that will manage the currency.</p><p> Marcus said the plan would open low-cost online commerce to millions of people around the world who lack access to bank accounts and would make it cheaper to send money across borders.</p><p> He did not agree to a suspension of the plan or a pilot project.</p><p> \"We will take the time to get this right,\" Marcus said.</p><p> He said Facebook isn't looking to base the Libra project in Switzerland in order to evade oversight, but because that country is recognized as an international financial center.</p><p> Acknowledging lawmakers' concerns over Facebook's record on data privacy , Marcus said, \"I think trust is essential and it's clear we've made mistakes. We're owning these mistakes.\"</p><p> The committee's senior Republican, Rep. Patrick McHenry of North Carolina, said skepticism over the project is justified but the effort should not be prohibited outright. A thorough review is needed, \"instead of a knee-jerk reaction of banning something before it begins,\" McHenry said.</p><p> Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., said the legislation Waters is proposing to ban big tech companies from banking \"has no constitutional basis.\"</p><p> Marcus' assurance that Facebook won't control Libra failed to convince Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Calif., who focused on Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.</p><p> \"This is the Zuck buck,\" Sherman insisted. \"This is a godsend to drug dealers\" and other criminals. \"Zuckerberg has billions but he doesn't have the authority to print more. ...

Lawmakers from both parties insisted they cannot trust the social network giant.</p><p>\"I think you're pretty low on the trust spectrum right now, and understandably,\" Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, D-Texas, told David Marcus, the Facebook executive leading the project. It was Marcus' second straight day of tough questioning by lawmakers.</p><p>Among their concerns is the risk that the new currency, to be called Libra, could be used for illicit activity such as money laundering or drug trafficking. Lawmakers also worry that the massive reserve created with money used to buy Libra could supplant the Federal Reserve and destabilize the financial system, and that consumers could be hurt by Libra losses.</p><p>The committee's leader, Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., has asked Facebook to suspend its plan for the new currency until regulators and lawmakers have a chance to fully review it. She renewed that demand to Marcus.</p><p>Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., asked that Facebook commit to starting with a pilot project with no more than a million users, overseen by the Federal Reserve.</p><p>If Facebook cannot meet that request, Maloney said, \"then Congress should seriously consider stopping this project from moving forward.\"</p><p>Waters held out the prospect of legislation that would prohibit big tech companies such as Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple from becoming chartered or licensed as U.S. financial institutions, and thus able to offer banking services, and specifically from establishing a digital currency.</p><p>Facebook, marshaling its more than 2 billion users around the world, \"is apparently trying to create a new global financial system that will compete with the U.S. dollar,\" Waters said.</p><p>The congressional criticism thickened the cloud over Facebook's plan, coming after negative statements and expressions of concern from the two most powerful financial regulators , Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, as well as from President Donald Trump himself.</p><p>In a rare endorsement of Trump's views, committee Democrats projected his negative tweets last week about cryptocurrencies and Libra on a giant electronic screen in the hearing room. Trump said Libra \"will have little standing or dependability.\"</p><p>As he did at Tuesday's hearing by the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, Marcus repeatedly took pains to assure lawmakers that Facebook would not launch the currency project until it had received all the necessary approvals from regulators and secured safeguards to protect the privacy of users' data. He said Facebook will not control Libra because Facebook will be only one of about 100 companies and nonprofits in an association that will manage the currency.</p><p>Marcus said the plan would open low-cost online commerce to millions of people around the world who lack access to bank accounts and would make it cheaper to send money across borders.</p><p>He did not agree to a suspension of the plan or a pilot project.</p><p>\"We will take the time to get this right,\" Marcus said.</p><p>He said Facebook isn't looking to base the Libra project in Switzerland in order to evade oversight, but because that country is recognized as an international financial center.</p><p>Acknowledging lawmakers' concerns over Facebook's record on data privacy , Marcus said, \"I think trust is essential and it's clear we've made mistakes. We're owning these mistakes.\"</p><p>The committee's senior Republican, Rep. Patrick McHenry of North Carolina, said skepticism over the project is justified but the effort should not be prohibited outright. A thorough review is needed, \"instead of a knee-jerk reaction of banning something before it begins,\" McHenry said.</p><p>Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., said the legislation Waters is proposing to ban big tech companies from banking \"has no constitutional basis.\"</p><p>Marcus' assurance that Facebook won't control Libra failed to convince Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Calif., who focused on Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.</p><p>\"This is the Zuck buck,\" Sherman insisted. \"This is a godsend to drug dealers\" and other criminals. \"Zuckerberg has billions but he doesn't have the authority to print more. ... This is an attempt to transfer enormous power from America to Facebook and its allies.\"</p><p>The planned digital currency is to be a blend of multiple currencies, which means the exchange rate will fluctuate.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APE-96e9d5753c124fbea7ec4f7e98b66e23</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKM-K4H1-JC65-549V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304478</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"788\"/><timeReceived>9:06 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Associated Press</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 17, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Lawmakers from both parties insisted they cannot trust the social network giant.</p><p>\"I think you're pretty low on the trust spectrum right now, and understandably,\" Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, D-Texas, told David Marcus, the Facebook executive leading the project. It was Marcus' second straight day of tough questioning by lawmakers.</p><p>Among their concerns is the risk that the new currency, to be called Libra, could be used for illicit activity such as money laundering or drug trafficking. Lawmakers also worry that the massive reserve created with money used to buy Libra could supplant the Federal Reserve and destabilize the financial system, and that consumers could be hurt by Libra losses.</p><p>The committee's leader, Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., has asked Facebook to suspend its plan for the new currency until regulators and lawmakers have a chance to fully review it. She renewed that demand to Marcus.</p><p>Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., asked that Facebook commit to starting with a pilot project with no more than a million users, overseen by the Federal Reserve.</p><p>If Facebook cannot meet that request, Maloney said, \"then Congress should seriously consider stopping this project from moving forward.\"</p><p>Waters held out the prospect of legislation that would prohibit big tech companies such as Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple from becoming chartered or licensed as U.S. financial institutions, and thus able to offer banking services, and specifically from establishing a digital currency.</p><p>Facebook, marshalling its more than 2 billion users around the world, \"is apparently trying to create a new global financial system that will compete with the U.S. dollar,\" Waters said.</p><p>The congressional criticism thickened the cloud over Facebook's plan, coming after negative statements and expressions of concern from the two most powerful financial regulators , Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, as well as from President Donald Trump himself.</p><p>In a rare endorsement of Trump's views, committee Democrats projected his negative tweets last week about cryptocurrencies and Libra on a giant electronic screen in the hearing room. Trump said Libra \"will have little standing or dependability.\"</p><p>As he did at Tuesday's hearing by the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, Marcus repeatedly took pains to assure lawmakers that Facebook would not launch the currency project until it had received all the necessary approvals from regulators and secured safeguards to protect the privacy of users' data. He said Facebook will not control Libra because Facebook will be only one of about 100 companies and nonprofits in an association that will manage the currency.</p><p>Marcus said the plan would open low-cost online commerce to millions of people around the world who lack access to bank accounts and would make it cheaper to send money across borders.</p><p>He did not agree to a suspension of the plan or a pilot project.</p><p>\"We will take the time to get this right,\" Marcus said.</p><p>He said Facebook isn't looking to base the Libra project in Switzerland in order to evade oversight, but because that country is recognized as an international financial centre.</p><p>Acknowledging lawmakers' concerns over Facebook's record on data privacy , Marcus said, \"I think trust is essential and it's clear we've made mistakes. We're owning these mistakes.\"</p><p>The committee's senior Republican, Rep. Patrick McHenry of North Carolina, said skepticism over the project is justified but the effort should not be prohibited outright. A thorough review is needed, \"instead of a knee-jerk reaction of banning something before it begins,\" McHenry said.</p><p>Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., said the legislation Waters is proposing to ban big tech companies from banking \"has no constitutional basis.\"</p><p>Marcus' assurance that Facebook won't control Libra failed to convince Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Calif., who focused on Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.</p><p>\"This is the Zuck buck,\" Sherman insisted. \"This is a godsend to drug dealers\" and other criminals. \"Zuckerberg has billions but he doesn't have the authority to print more. ...

But in the last year or so, I\u2019ve had to add another title, one I never thought I\u2019d have: tech reporter.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the Trump era, those two topics are increasingly hard to separate. In the last year, I\u2019ve written about <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/01/27/technology/social-media-bots.html\">the booming business of \u201cbots\u201d and fake accounts</url> on Twitter and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/09/technology/russia-election-facebook-ads-rage.html\">how Russian agents used fake Facebook pages</url> to sow division and shape the 2016 presidential election. I also worked on a Times investigation, in partnership with The Guardian and The Observer of London, into Cambridge Analytica, the British-American political data firm       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html\">that improperly exploited the personal Facebook data of tens of millions of American voters</url>. To study political power today, you have to understand technology.</p><p>That\u2019s what drew me to the story of Alastair Mactaggart, the central character in this Sunday\u2019s magazine <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/14/magazine/facebook-google-privacy-data.html\">cover story about the war over privacy</url>. In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, it has become clear that tech companies like Google and Facebook not only collect extraordinary amounts of information about everyone, but sometimes deceive or mislead their own users about what information is being collected and how it is used.</p><p>My colleagues and I have reported extensively over the last year on the enormous power wielded by tech companies over politics and commerce and on the ways in which that power can be abused. Our reporting has shed light on how poorly tech companies protect the integrity of their platforms and of the data you hand them for free, with profound consequences.</p><p>Yet both Facebook and Google, and the broader tech industry of which they are a part, have escaped any major regulation or seriously punitive government action in the United States. (In Europe, Google was recently hit with a $5 billion fine for antitrust violations.) Even after a cascade of scandals, Washington had done almost nothing. Why?</p><p>Mr. Mactaggart, who last year began organizing to pass a California ballot initiative restricting the abuse of personal data, turned out to be an ideal way to answer the question. For one thing, his campaign was happening in real time, and as a political neophyte, he was encountering Silicon Valley\u2019s political machine for the first time, much as most readers would be. Mr. Mactaggart was not an expert on privacy when he started; he was a wealthy real estate developer from Oakland, whose main interaction with people in the tech world was at Bay Area birthday parties and his neighborhood dog run. He more or less fell into a rabbit hole and became a little obsessed. That journey allowed me to turn an arcane and often boring subject into a compelling yarn; his education \u2014 as a political campaigner and as a consumer \u2014 becomes the reader\u2019s.</p><p>That was important for me, too, as a reporter. I often write about complex policy issues, and questions surrounding data collection, advertising and privacy can be challenging to unspool in a compelling, accessible way.</p><p>I used to write about campaign finance; that\u2019s a complicated topic, too, and it was easy to lose readers\u2019 attention. But writing about data and privacy is harder. Presidential campaigns lend a certain innate drama to stories about donors and fund-raising. Tech and social media, while in one sense nearer to people\u2019s daily lives, can seem distant and abstract. For those who have no background in programming or data science, the industry they animate can seem impenetrable.</p><p>This is no accident. One reason Big Tech faces so little resistance from policymakers is that Silicon Valley\u2019s business seems so daunting. I find that Big Tech\u2019s lobbyists and \u201cthought leaders\u201d \u2014 and some journalists \u2014 implicitly and sometimes explicitly promote the idea that policymakers are too dumb, slow or unsophisticated to understand how it all works, let alone regulate something like data collection practices. This notion also helps insulate the industry from accountability.</p><p>The story of how Mr. Mactaggart forced California lawmakers to pass a landmark consumer privacy law is, in part, a story of the power of this idea \u2014 and also of its flimsiness. The law he helped pass is not a panacea, and won\u2019t solve every problem raised by the encroaching powers of Big Tech. Some critics believe the law doesn\u2019t go far enough. (And many in the industry believe it goes way too far.) But the fact of it \u2014 the political proof of concept \u2014 has already stirred intense debate and pressure to produce even more protections for consumers, not only in other states but in Washington.</p><p>That matters not only for consumers, but also for readers. Mr. Mactaggart is a smart guy, and he had time and resources most people don\u2019t. But he\u2019s not an expert on politics or technology. If he can figure it out, so can you.</p><p>PHOTO: Alastair Mactaggart, a real estate developer, pushed a California initiative to enshrine digital privacy.

Denham, who currently serves as British Columbia, Canada\u2019s Information and Privacy Commissioner, will replace Christopher Graham when his term is up in June.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> The appointment will need approval by the queen for finalization and the new term will commence on June 28.<br/><br/><br/><br/> \"First a Canadian as Governor of the Bank of England; now the UK is getting a Canadian to lead the ICO!\" former Information Commissioner Richard Thomas told The Privacy Advisor. \"Liz Denham has earned respect within privacy and freedom of information communities around the world. I wish her well.'<br/><br/><br/><br/> Denham appeared before the committee Wednesday and answered a string of tough questions from committee members for over an hour. Since Denham is not a British citizen, many of the questions focused on her understanding of British and EU data protection and freedom of information laws. She also faced questions about how she would deal with nuisance calls - a persistent issue in the UK - her analysis of the controversial UK Investigatory Powers Bill, the agency\u2019s enforcement powers, the challenges of moving to a new country, managing a staff 10 times the size of her current one, and how she would tackle funding issues for the agency.<br/><br/><br/><br/> \u201cCommittee members who may have seen my CV will have noticed I have a history of moving to more challenging positions in the last 20 years,\u201d she told the committee. She said being Information Commissioner would \u201cbe her life\u2019s work\u201d and that the \u201ctech savvy\u201d agency casts \u201ca long shadow across the world.\u201d<br/><br/><br/><br/> Evincing a measured tone throughout the hearing, Denham said she expects the UK to use some of the flexibility in the upcoming General Data Protection Regulation for a \u201cpractical application of the law.\u201d<br/><br/><br/><br/> Denham expressed support for the new fining powers that will come with the GDPR. She said she welcomed the four-percent fines of a company\u2019s global turnover: \u201cThere are serious issues that threaten consumer confidence on the Internet. People are increasingly troubled by data breaches, so the new fines are appropriate.\u201d<br/><br/><br/><br/> She also highlighted the importance of enforcing the bad actors in the digital space. \u201cIt\u2019s my attitude on enforcement that you start from a place where you educate, share best practices, audit, then move on to companies with a bad attitude,\u201d she said. \u201cClearing them out or getting them to responsibly process personal information is healthy and necessary for the digital economy.\u201d She also noted that, often, big companies rely on their trusted brand name and are usually willing to comply. It\u2019s the smaller, shadier businesses, those that do not have a brand at stake, that are the issue.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     \"It\u2019s my attitude on enforcement that you start from a place where you educate, share best practices, audit, then move on to companies with a bad attitude,\" said Denham.<br/><br/><br/><br/> Though the ICO has fining powers, there is question about how much money it receives from its enforcement actions as affected firms often liquidate and disappear instead of paying the fine. These bad actors are often overseas. Denham conceded that it\u2019s a \u201ccomplicated problem,\u201d but one that is improving, with new international agreements among data protection authorities.<br/><br/><br/><br/> Denham was also asked about fining directors of companies that have been breached. \u201cYou\u2019re implying you would not be loath to apply high fines and full enforcement capabilities as required, including fining directors,\u201d Committee Chairman Jesse Norman asked. \u201cAs a creature given statute and power, that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019d do,\u201d she responded.<br/><br/><br/><br/> Denham is no stranger to regulating big tech businesses either. \u201cI\u2019m battle tested as a commissioner,\u201d she explained. \u201cI have never shrunk away from an important issue. I led the first investigation into Facebook. I knocked on their door when they had 300 million users in 2008. We were a small office in Canada investigating Facebook.\u201d She also described her work on the Google Street View case. \u201cI took on Google,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a serious investigation that took us down to Google\u2019s lab so we could witness the destruction of Canadians\u2019 data. We were the only DPA to do that. I have crossed swords with some of the largest tech companies.\u201d<br/><br/><br/><br/>     \"I have crossed swords with some of the largest tech companies,\" she said.<br/><br/><br/><br/> She said since that time, both companies have put controls in place that weren\u2019t there eight years ago. \u201cBoth have come to a place where even though they make money on the collection of personal information, they are more careful and in tune with what people expect.\u201d But, she also expressed concerns that they\u2019re becoming monopolies. \u201cThey\u2019re so important to everyone\u2019s lives, we have to constantly watch them. I\u2019d like to keep the door open and ask for regular briefings from these companies to understand what is coming next,\u201d she added.<br/><br/><br/><br/> Funding for the agency will also be a challenge, particularly since the GDPR will alter a major source of the agency\u2019s revenue stream. Denham noted that the ICO has received 18 million pounds from notification fees, but when the GDPR goes into effect in 2018, that revenue stream will go away. \u201cThis is going to be one of my first priorities, how to get a new funding framework in place,\u201d she said.<br/><br/><br/><br/> Denham was also queried on her opinion of the controversial IP Bill currently being hammered out in Parliament, particularly the data retention mechanism. \u201cMy view,\" she said, \"is that it creates a honey pot. There\u2019s a lot of data that needs to be retained, so it\u2019s going to have to be secure.\" She also noted countries around the world are dealing with how to balance national security with privacy.<br/><br/><br/><br/> The committee pressed Denham during the hearing on last year's Talk Talk data breach and the Motorman incident in 2003. She said she didn\u2019t know the details of the cases, but said she backed liability placed on directors of companies for data breaches and contraventions of the law. She said that would bring boards of directors to the table. \u201cThat\u2019s where we\u2019re going to get change,\u201d she said.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     \u201cI\u2019ve been a strong leader and manager and have been successful in managing budgets, recruiting actual staff, building team.\"<br/><br/><br/><br/> Denham faced questions about Freedom of Information requests as well and what she would do about government officials using non-traditional communications - such as social media - to communicate government business. For her, the issue is around the communication itself, and not the technology used. \u201cIf a public official is communicating government business, then that record is subject to FOI,\u201d she said. Denham also said that social media accounts should be opened if that is the case, noting, however, that wouldn\u2019t mean such accounts would be released: \u201cWe would be careful not to invade people\u2019s privacy as much as possible. That\u2019s one of the great things about being a DPA and privacy commissioner. In order for FOI to work, we need people to respect the letter and spirit of the law.\u201d<br/><br/><br/><br/> By transferring to the ICO, Denham will have a staff 10 times larger than her current BC staff. \u201cI believe I\u2019m up to the task,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been a strong leader and manager and have been successful in managing budgets, recruiting actual staff, building team. I will bring that same skill set, by building in direct reports, making sure everyone understands the vision, check back with staff, review work, and create face-to-face meetings.\"<br/><br/><br/><br/> Denham also said she will need to get to know the public\u2019s concerns. \u201cI don\u2019t underestimate the issues that matter to the public here,\u201d she said. \u201cI have the pulse of the Canadian public, but don\u2019t necessarily have it here, but I\u2019m a quick learner.\u201d<br/><br/><br/><br/> In case of any query regarding this article or other content needs please contact: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:editorial@plusmediasolutions.com\">editorial@plusmediasolutions.com</email><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USOFFN-PMN383224020160429</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USOFFN2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5JN9-1SN1-J9XT-P3P1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400469</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1339\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>US Official News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"610\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"04\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>April 29, 2016 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002F2B</classCode><className>BANK OF ENGLAND</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Administrative Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjMxMjc0MUIzQjkzNEM4MEI4NkZGQjVCREJCRDk4OUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjYyRTk3QUVFRjk4NDVGMkI0REI0NDA4NTUzRDY5NDk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDk0RkJCOUQ5NEFCNDE2N0EzRUE0QzU2RUFBOEEzRTI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

I am very pleased to open this seminar jointly organised by Paris Europlace and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). A new year is usually the time when we regain confidence in the future and in our collective ability to prepare for it.  ***  However there are many uncertainties weighing on the global economic outlook.  In Europe, there are still many uncertainties about the outcome of Brexit negotiations and the vote over the withdrawal agreement. Caution requires that we all be prepared for a no-deal scenario. Public authorities and most importantly market participants have all prepared serious contingency plans to address and master the cliff-edge risks associated with such a no-deal scenario. </p><p>As a result, we can expect that those risks will be appropriately managed, without financial stability implications, should such a scenario occur.  Outside Europe, global trade tensions are also generating additional uncertainties. Protectionism can indeed be a temptation, but in my view it should not be an option. Let's be clear: our economies are increasingly integrated, and research conducted at the Banque de France suggests that a rise in protectionism on a large scale (i.e. a generalised trade war scenario) would have a negative impact on global growth.  Yet these uncertainties can be turned into opportunities and I would like to emphasise that. It is worth noting that EU Member States remained impressively united behind their negotiator, <person><nameText>Michel Barnier, </nameText></person>during the Brexit talks. This unity must now be directed towards achieving an ambition: completing and strengthening the economic and monetary union.  This period of uncertainties actually reminds us that bilateral and multilateral cooperation are quite valuable, as they are a common wealth enhancer, especially when the issue at stake is financial regulation and financial stability. At the end of 2017, central bankers and supervisors reached a very important agreement on the Basel III post-crisis regulatory reforms. This agreement must now be implemented in various jurisdictions to further increase the soundness of the banking system. Since the great financial crisis, other issues have emerged. Cyber-risks have risen significantly over the last few years and the financial sector remains a primary target. The surge of crypto-assets is another challenge for regulators given the risks they pose for consumer protection and anti-money laundering. To address these risks adequately, the digital and global nature of crypto-assets calls for an international approach.  ***  Cooperation is all the more necessary as the major financial centres, including Paris and Hong Kong, are highly interconnected.  I believe that Paris today has all the attributes necessary to become the pre-eminent financial trading and financing hub for continental Europe. Some of the world's biggest banks, asset managers and insurers are already preparing for life after Brexit and steering their European operations away from London to our capital. Paris is already home to four of the eight global systemically important banks in the euro area, in addition to being number one in the region in insurance and asset management. Recent regulatory initiatives have made Paris even more dynamic. Capitalising on the reform of Negotiable European Commercial Paper (NEU CP) in 2016, a number of very innovative projects have been launched: for instance, the Frenchtelecoms company Orange and the fintech SETL have jointly set up a new central securities depository (CSD) called ID2S for the NEU CP market, using blockchain technology.  Paris is also at the heart of cross-border initiatives, making the European financial market more integrated. The market exchange operator Euronext is continuing to expand its federal model and in November 2017 acquired the Irish Stock Exchange. The CSD Euroclear is also committed to fostering common infrastructures, and is even looking beyond Europe with partnerships in the United States with DTCC or in Asia thanks to Bond Connect.  Building on this comprehensive financial ecosystem, Paris has also been one of the principal supporters of the renminbi's move towards internationalisation. As of today, Paris is indeed the leading continental European centre for deposits and bond issuances in RMB. This support was embodied and exemplified as early as 2014 with the signature by the Banque of France of two memorandums of understanding with the HKMA and the People's Bank of China.  ***  Cooperation will also prove invaluable in the face of the uncertainty caused by structural challenges.  A first structural challenge is the digital revolution. The digital revolution is being fuelled by a wave of cutting-edge technologies, but also by the surge of new players. This new competition is being driven by fintech start-ups, but also, more importantly, by tech firms that have started to expand into the financial sector. Here in Asia, you can testify as to just how rapidly big tech firms can impact the financial sector. While ensuring a level playing field between competitors, our role as a central bank and supervisor is to guarantee that the digital revolution eventually delivers on its promises regarding increased security and efficiency. At the same time, incumbents should be prepared to adapt. Their business models are being challenged by the unbundling of financial services and by increasing customer expectations in terms of responsiveness and autonomy.  The answers are not easy and cannot be uniform, but I expect that only the most digitally agile financial companies will eventually prove financially resilient. Against this background, France has many assets that can make it a leader in digital innovation in Europe, and the Banque de France is committed to playing its part in this regard. Through its Fintech Innovation Hub, which has welcomed over 400 innovative players since 2016, the Banque de France promotes active and open dialogue with all market stakeholders, with the aim of building streamlined regulation for digital innovation.  The Banque de France is also committed to leveraging new technologies for its own digital transformation. We are already running an interbank blockchain called \"MADRE\" to automate the generation of creditor identifiers. I am convinced that by conducting their own experiments, central banks and regulators are more capable of designing relevant policies and regulations for digital finance.  ***  A second structural challenge is climate change, which is perhaps less tangible than the digital revolution but certainly no less significant.  The transition to a low-carbon economy requires shifting thousands of billions of dollars from carbon intensive industries. As a result, beyond green bonds, we also have to develop new financial products to bridge this green finance gap. I am thinking of green securitisation, green covered bonds, and green loans accessible to individuals, SMEs and start-ups. France is at the forefront of this challenge. Four out of the world's top ten green bond book-runners are French banks. France is among the top three green bond issuers. This trend is being supported by public action: a law has been introduced requiring investors and listed companies to disclose their climate-related risks; the French State issued the largest green sovereign bond in 2017.  We also believe that central banks and supervisors must play their part as, in the long run, climate stability is one of the main determinants of financial stability, which is their mandate. This is a shared conviction. At the One Planet Summit in Paris in December 2017, the Banque de France, with the support of other central banks and supervisors, launched the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), which now comprises some 30 central banks, supervisors and international organisations, including four Asian members, and will certainly attract more in the coming years.  ***  Let me now conclude by quoting Nassim Nicholas Taleb, the famous author of The Black Swan. He once wrote that uncertainties can be like the wind which \"extinguishes a candle and energises fire\", and added the following: \"You want to use them, not hide from them. You want to be the fire and wish for the wind\". My wish is that the ongoing uncertainties will become the wind that deepens our bilateral and multilateral cooperation. On that hopeful note, I wish you a very Happy New Year and for the time being an inspiring and fruitful conference. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RVMPCU-RLPMN754313120190116</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RVMPCU2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V6V-R6S1-DXCW-D415-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">424987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1468\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Plus Company Updates(PCU)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"45923\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 16, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

We have to be proactive about the fact that technology is going to be the parameter that defines development. Another factor is that big tech companies are becoming very large corporations, and therefore, very influential corporations.</p><p>There was a feeling in the Danish government and Danish foreign ministry that we needed a formalized and structured platform on which to put technology; it needs to be on the agenda both internally and externally. Additionally, doing so would enable us to have an opportunity to speak and influence tech companies in a way similarly to how we would when developing financial relationships with global countries and foreign and international organizations.</p><p>Q: As the global tech ambassador, what are the scope of your responsibilities? </p><p>Casper: We have a very, very, very broad agenda, ranging from discussions on online regulations and cybersecurity, to looking at how we can introduce technology in our development corporations in Africa or Asia.</p><p>If we were to boil it down, my responsibilities include three focal points:</p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>First, I'm expected to be a forward operating post - not only in Silicon Valley, but also in Beijing and Africa and the Middle East - in order to stay current on what's happening on the technology front. Essentially, I should be able to answer several key questions: What new technologies are being developed? What opportunities do they give a country like Denmark or Europe? How do we respond to those technologies? How can we make the technology inclusive to bring everybody on board? The flip side of this is also trying to anticipate the pitfalls of technology and attempting to prevent them from taking root. This is all an important part of the job that I do together with my team. We all collaborate with classic diplomatic roles to have a presence on the ground, gather analyses, and report back with the goal of better understanding the impact of new developments and how to respond to them from a policy point of view.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Second, I work to offer Danish authorities - or in a broader sense, Danish society - the opportunity to represent their views vis-\u00e0-vis the tech companies. For example, say there is a tech company operating in Denmark in an area where we might have some differences of opinion on how a particular platform is used (i.e. data protection or taxation issues). We now have a startup embassy and negotiating mechanisms in place (i.e. tech presentations) to initiate discussions with those companies in hopes of finding solutions that work for them and for Denmark and for the Danish society. We haven't had this opportunity before - at least not in the structured way we do now - and these mechanisms for engagement bring added value to Denmark and to the companies, who now have a platform where they can convey views and suggestions on regulations.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>I believe this last role to be incredibly important: helping to institute an international agenda where technology and digitalization are made mainstream in basically everything that we do. No matter what we talk about - be it developments in the South China sea, emerging economies, transportation, healthcare, or education - technology transcends all those areas, and we need to recognize that internationally and multi-laterally. We also need to carefully consider what governance will look like in the 4th Industrial Revolution: How do we maximize all the opportunities that technology brings about while simultaneously minimizing some of the risks that arise with it? Denmark is a very digitalized country and has always been open to using technology, and this pragmatic approach towards it is why we have something to offer. My team's focus lies on making sure we find the right balance between welcoming new technologies and setting the right boundaries.</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>Q: I love how you broke it down into three different roles and love the concept of point #2, especially because the European Connected Health Alliance and Canadian Integrated Health Alliance are working together through their I-Map program. Their goal is to convene the ecosystem (from startups, academia, and nonprofits) to tackle some of the most prominent digital health problems in countries. Anyway, I digress! To get back on track, I have met with and hosted many of Denmark's permanent secretaries in California. One of their issues is trying to figure out how to develop modern policies and government technologies that enable innovation yet are non-detrimental to future growth. However, given the fact that they don't know much about technology from a technical standpoint, are you working with them to craft the best tech policies? If so, how?</p><p>Casper: That's a relevant question because I can bring an insider's perspective on the dynamics of how a small country like Denmark works to the table. In fact, you're referring to an important area where we play a significant role in bringing information back to Denmark on what other countries are doing in terms of policy and regulation. We're not just looking just at Silicon Valley in California, but also researching what is being done in Israel and other parts of Europe, as well as Singapore and Korea. A critical role of my team's mandate is to find multiple countries' best practices for really utilizing technology in innovative ways.</p><p>It's also important to mention a caveat: we're not tech sector experts, nor do we have any ambitions to become such. For example, when I acted as Denmark's Ambassador to Indonesia, I had to report back on Indonesia's response in the South China Sea and various rule development challenges in the country. There are many aspects and subjects as an ambassador that you wouldn't necessarily be a sector expert on. But because you're a forward operating post, you have your ears to the ground, have a better sense of what's going on, and a better handle on the realities that exist when reporting back. For example, how quickly are developments actually commencing?</p><p>Our goal is to employ a sound, collective, and realistic approach to new technology.\u00a0 As an embassy, you represent the whole entity of government by default, which applies to my whole team. We work equally as much for each extension of the government; the Danish Ministry of Healthcare, Danish Ministry of Defense, Danish Ministry of Business, and the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs all fall on our plate. If you look at our, let's call them, 'customers,' we have a lot of interaction with a lot of other ministries back home. I would also actually count the private sector and civil society back home, in Denmark, as our customers. They're also quite interested in what we can offer, which could include anything from getting them some limelight on the Danish tech solutions, to showing them what Danish companies are capable of doing globally, to helping them with their internal reform processes. This is a mental revolution, which is incredibly important. A very important contribution from my team is acting as a foreign ministry and as representation to help gently nudge the Danish society in a direction, where reflections on new technology and the kinds of reforms we need to go through come to the forefront of the political agenda. Additionally, if we can at the same time help set an international agenda that is also an increasingly integral part of global discussions, then I would be a very happy man and believe that Denmark would have done something good for humanity, especially considering there's a lot of critical questions related to tech that need to be answered to form the international agenda, as well.</p><p>Q: Yes, I agree with you and believe that Denmark can show the world how to become tech savvy. The reason why Estonia is leading is because they've been bold in their approach to technology - especially considering that they're creating an agency that is led by an AI - and they are also a smaller country that can be a bit nimble. The world is taking examples from them (i.e. the Digital Health Societies) due to their being awarded the EU Presidency. Before resigning, NYC CTO Miguel Gamino talked to me about the disruptive force of new technologies. He stated that most technology companies are user-centric, not human-centric. He presented some impending issues that may occur, such as what happens to the parking attendee who tickets your car, or to the traffic court officials when driverless cars become prevalent? Will that whole economy be wiped? What he's working on is developing a disruptive lab to bring together ecosystems of tech companies to understand their impact on local economies. This is relevant because in your NPR interview you talked about the \"digitally poor.\" Casper, can you define what you meant by digitally poor, and maybe how you're trying to create international and domestic agendas that account for the digitally poor?</p><p>Casper: Well, I can give it a shot! I think that there is both a domestic and international dimension. If you look at the domestic side, we're a very small country. People would probably laugh if we say we also have challenges between the core and the periphery.</p><p>What do new technologies pose in terms of challenges? If you look at the wave of new mobile technologies, like 5G technology, they will become necessary in order to have driverless vehicles or to allow upload speeds that enable virtual realities. Now, if that's only an urban phenomenon, they will actually create some imbalances between the sense of the periphery and the core, even in a small country like a Denmark. If you then, of course, elevate this same local discussion to the global level, what we must pay attention to and be responsible for as global actors - and Denmark hasn't historically had a strong focus on developing nations and countries that have a lot of challenges - is focusing on the digitally poor and the digital divide. This is something I strongly believe we must focus on. If you look at the regions or countries that will fall way behind because they don't have the necessary infrastructure or the competences or the tech skills, they will be the root cause of the next wave of migration or radicalization and extremism. In order words, the digitally poor and the digital divide will create many global challenges, as well.</p><p>We can look at technology in a way where we recognize that it creates the opportunity to create a digital dividend - essentially bringing people out of poverty, growing economies, providing better education and healthcare, and having less global conflict. However, we must not lose sight of the fact that there are some risks in some parts of the world and places that will fall behind even in our own countries. We must pay attention to them to avoid potential radicalization and post-international threats.</p><p>Q: Thanks for sharing your point of view of the digital divide. In helping to spread the digital and tech wealth, how are you partnering with companies? What kinds of global alliances are you looking to build? Many of my government industry peers are super interested in trying to figure out how to advance your goals, but they don't know how to engage with you. How do they engage with you and your team? </p><p>Casper: We want to create a new alliance that focuses on technology, responsibility, and the right responses to new opportunities and risks. We're a small country, but we have a modest approach. We're focused on bringing together like-minded countries and international organizations, but, more importantly, the private sector to increase the frequency of having discussions around several key issues: What do we do in terms of ethics for data? How do we set the right boundaries for artificial intelligence? What do we do when it comes rolling out 5G to all parts of our societies? These are important questions. Yet the most important ones center around the governance issues.</p><p>You may ask what we're hoping to get out of these conversations. First and foremost, tech industries and tech companies will assume a societal responsibility, which is proportional to the influence and economic power that these companies hold. I don't think we're there yet, but we're seeing some positive developments. It is important for the tech industry to realize that we're not here to hammer down and create very difficult and complicated commercial frameworks for them. Rather, we are interested in having conversations about the areas of our highest concerns and communicating that they should take the responsibility upon themselves to help work together with governments to find solutions for issues around online content, misinformation and cybersecurity. We do need the tech sector to step up to the plate and assume that responsibility. Some companies have stepped up proactively to have conversations, but we're seeing other companies that are more restrained and perhaps less proactive. Although we're only six months into our jobs, we're hoping that we'll gradually be able to convince many more tech companies to have those conversations with global governments, including Denmark, by showing them the added value. For example, we do have a voice in the European Union (EU), and we do have the possibility to also set the right agenda with the EU on data protection issues, anti-trust issues, sustainability issues, and many more issues. The overall goal is to reinvent the relationship between the private sector and the public sector. It's going relatively well, but we have a lot of work to do and we're working quite hard to achieve it.</p><p>Q: What is \"Denmark's TechPlomacy Initiative\" and what does it consist of?</p><p>Casper: TechPlomacy is basically the initiative that has helped to establish and appoint the Denmark Tech Ambassadorship and to set the global team in place. There is a disruptive dimension to it forcing us to rethink a little about how traditional diplomacy is carried out - not to replace it, but to supplement it. What we are doing, of course, is trying to work with other capitals, countries, and international organizations to help them understand that diplomacy and technology and digitalization are not contradictory terms, but rather things that we must be integrated. TechPlomacy is essentially our life right now!</p><p>Q: Haha, that's awesome! Is there anything you'd like to share with the audience that I haven't asked? </p><p>Casper: I think there is one question you haven't asked that is super important of our agenda, which has to do with values and the Transatlantic relationship. I think that sitting in the US and looking at a world where there is a lot of turmoil and uncertainty, it is very important that we remember the very close historical ties between the US and Europe. We might not be in complete agreement on the role of tech companies in specific areas or on the role of international organizations on regulations and antitrust, but we have to really remember that that all of us - both sides of the Atlantic! - are still products of the same history and same values: we believe in democracy and human rights. If you look at global developments, including on technology, that realization should hit policymakers and decision makers on both sides and c-level executives in big tech companies. To put it bluntly, we need to stick together because any alternative is quite frightening.</p><p>I completely agree with you! Condoleezza Rice expressed the same exact concerns when at the Stanford Economic Policy Summit. Thank you for your time, Casper! I am looking forward to learning more about your work in the future and seeing the fruits of yours and your team's labors.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CIOMAG-3266107</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CIOMAG2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S09-SD31-JBP6-P3T8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258373</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2746\"/><timeReceived>04:10 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 IDG Communications, Inc.

And serving as Denmark's, and indeed the world's, first tech ambassador required him to rewrite the international relations playbook.<br/> The role of tech ambassador was created by the Danish government as a response to two main trends. One is that technology is now a driving force shaping the world - think the Trump-Russia scandal, Cambridge Analytica, etc. The other is that a small number of tech companies are the main catalysts for that change - enter Facebook.</p><p><br/> \"We're taking diplomacy back to its roots,\" Klynge said. It's \"about exercising national interests and trying to influence the direction of change on a global scale.\" To carry out this unusual mandate, Klynge moved on from his post as the Danish ambassador in Indonesia, and arrived in Silicon Valley with the goal of putting \"techplomacy\" on the political map.<br/> He cycles to work when he can, taking advantage of the predictably sunny weather in Palo Alto, lining up podcasts like \"The Exponential View\" and \"Governing the Future\" to get him started on his way to the embassy. Other days, Klynge tweets from NASA's Kennedy Space Center just moments after the latest SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launch, or from Microsoft HQ where he was recording a podcast on regulation and data ethics.<br/> At a first glance, the role of tech ambassador seems more about PR than politics - and it's something that has underlined previous reporting about Klynge's appointment. Because the role is experimental and unconventional, it seemed at first that Klynge's main tasks would be to play nice with the tech giants and lobby them on behalf of the Danish government.<br/> But given the ever-deepening scandal surrounding Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, and the fact that 87 million users of the social network had their data scraped without their consent, Klynge is adamant the job isn't just for show.<br/> As tech ambassador, he is there to rethink the relationship between the private and the public sector in a particularly mercurial global arena that seems to be more akin to the Wild West years than the structural certainty of the Cold War.<br/> Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg still mentions in interviews the sense of \"idealism\" the company had of building an unprecedented global community 10 years ago. But today, Facebook and other tech companies are setting another, much more real precedent - when they mess up, the authenticity of entire democratic processes, like elections, come under question.<br/> \"Techplomacy\" is an unprecedented approach, too and its main task is responding to the changing contours of the international arena and engaging with the most influential actors - which now, seemingly, includes the big tech companies.<br/> \"The timing couldn't have been better for the Danish Foreign Ministry to appoint a tech ambassador,\" Klynge said. \"The developments we've seen with Cambridge Analytica, Facebook, etc. - I think that's a confirmation that you do need to have techplomacy. You do need to have direct dialogue with tech companies.\"<br/> Two of the most important aspects of this dialogue have to do with regulation and enforcing data ethics standards. Klynge said that his team's main assessment after six months on the job is that, on the global scale, they don't see anyone stepping forward, \"picking up the bill\" and proposing implementation of new standards on the right boundaries for technology.<br/> And that's certainly their goal, as well as the official foreign policy goal of Denmark and the European Union. In fact, techplomacy is one of the pillars of Danish foreign policy - it joins Brexit, the Arctic, as well as terrorism, instability, and migration.<br/> \"When we meet with the big tech companies here in Silicon Valley or elsewhere in Europe and Asia, of course we do hear quite a lot of criticism of European Union regulation and privacy laws. But when you ask them the same question, 'What's your response to that?', then their answer is always the same, 'We will implement it fully,'\" Klynge said.<br/> It's part of a very deep misconception about big tech - \"that all these companies are interested in is this sort of unregulated vacuum where they can do whatever they want,\" Klynge said. \"A lot of the companies are, quite desperately, looking for a conversation partner representing a country or region to define the right way forward for technologies.\"<br/> It makes practical sense that Denmark in particular and the EU as a whole are taking the lead in this. At the centre of the discussion about Facebook and privacy is the EU privacy law, called GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). It's been in the works for a long time, but it will just happen to be the first major international crackdown to come into force post-Cambridge Analytica.<br/> The GDPR comes in force May 25 and, at its core, it's a law written to protect the privacy of all citizens of the Union's 28 member states. All companies across the world will need to comply with this law and make sure all users consent to the data collected and shared about them. It's a notable attempt at regulating that Wild West of big tech, and it's setting the tempo for the rest of the world. \"The EU is basically setting the global standards in the technology ecosystem in a very fundamental way,\" Klynge said.<br/>  That's the kind of dialogue he and his team are most concerned about and interested in precipitating with their partners in tech. \"We're not here to sugarcoat the technology companies,\" Klynge said. \"We're here to try influence issues that we don't necessarily agree with the tech companies about. That could be about misinformation or the accusation of influencing election campaigns - both of which go to the core of democracy.\"<br/> It's exactly the same playbook of using dialogue with other embassies to solve problems and conflicts on the ground. The key difference here is the actors - the recognition that tech giants do not only wield power because they are ridiculously wealthy. They are becoming superpowers, to use classic Cold War jargon, in their own right. And Klynge is there to treat them as such, but also offer them a helping hand and opportunity to join the grown-ups' dinner table.<br/> \"Companies are beginning to realise they cannot be left alone to self-regulate some of these big, big issues\"<br/> It's important to note that Klynge fully recognises that neither Denmark, nor the EU, can push through change on their own. But he also understands the importance of leverage. Cambridge Analytica is the key to shifting the narrative. It's a chance to get a critical mass going at a time when big tech seems ready to strike a responsible balance between commercial interests and ethical rules.<br/> \"That's why you're seeing companies like Microsoft proposing a digital Geneva convention - companies are beginning to realise they cannot be left alone to self-regulate some of these big, big issues,\" Klynge said.<br/> This seems to underline Denmark's prioritisation of techplomacy - an area where \"we punch above our weight\" among the 28 EU member states. Now France has an equivalent appointment, too, with the Council of Ministers announcing the position of a French ambassador for digital affairs in November, 2017. Klynge is sure others others follow suit, too.<br/> For him, this is a necessary response to underlying changes in global affairs. Denmark may be a relatively small country compared to, say, Germany, but those metrics no longer weigh up in the same way. States and the governments they appoint have ceased to dominate people's existence in the same way they did a century ago. Instead, it's a new era dominated by cross-national identity politics, (mis)information and data.<br/> Klynge has found himself in the hotseat of this new era where the main actors are not primarily states. And more importantly, where material forces or wealth are not the most important trump card - data and information is. \"Tech will define the winners and losers of tomorrow and whether countries, including developing economies, will be able to reap the benefits of the digital age,\" he said.<br/> Klynge's portfolio (which includes a stint as an assistant professor of international relations back in the day) is constantly expanding. Currently, his office contains a staff of 16, but his mandate is not entirely U.S.-centred. \"We're probably going to be opening up in Africa in the not so distant future.\" he said. Klynge is also keeping his hand on the pulse in Asia with a office which opened up in Beijing.<br/> These are undoubtedly uncharted waters because there are no defined rules to this new game, but Klynge is already setting the trend for others to follow. Klynge has only been doing it for six months, so he says it's too early to gauge the success of his role. But, as we have learned in the past, if Denmark's doing it, everyone wants to follow suit.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-n10459036</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S2S-BBR1-DYDW-72PG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1472\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 10, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000950</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>ST0008WTA</classCode><className>SPACE EXPLORATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00098A0</classCode><className>FOREIGN RELATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008ZF6</classCode><className>INTERVIEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N928120JM</classCode><className>EMBASSIES &amp;

Speaking from the meticulously designed and organized (what else did you expect?) Danish consulate in Palo Alto, Klynge said his goal is to build an understanding with Facebook, Google and other tech giants about how their innovations impact his country. So far, he says, his success has been mixed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Behind the job title's novelty is a vital mission, highlighted by the fact the tech ambassador also has a representative in Beijing. US and Chinese companies are building revolutionary technology and Denmark, which has a population smaller than the nine-county Bay Area, is no longer willing to take a passive role in the adoption of those products. The European Union is already passing more stringent regulations over big tech's data privacy and online advertising, along with tough antitrust regulations. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Q:\u00a0What did you hope to accomplish as the tech ambassador here?</p><p>A:\u00a0The reason why we decided to establish a role as a tech ambassador was acknowledging that the world is being transformed because of new technologies. And of course we're sitting here in Palo Alto, looking out the windows, and if we stare off for a few minutes, I'm sure a Waymo car will pass by or we'll see one of the small robots on California Avenue delivering something. So I think there's no better place to see the transformation through the lens, or the prism, of technology, in one of the epicenters of technology, Silicon Valley.</p><p>To be very frank with you, the number of people that are asking me, 'Why do we need a tech ambassador, and why did Denmark establish a technology embassy?' ... (has)\u00a0gone down in the last 18 months simply because we've seen a lot of big scandals. Cambridge Analytica, and what we see with Facebook, with Google, with some of the other big technology players, I think that has confirmed that the companies are not only commercial players.</p><p>Some of these companies are, to some extent, more important to Denmark than our bilateral relationship with the other countries around the world.</p><p>Q: How have those dialogues been going?</p><p>A:\u00a0It's been a difficult first 18 months. I'm not going to shy away from that. We've had to explain to a lot of the companies what it is that we are trying to do, trying to accomplish, what success looks like for us. And then, most importantly, the question that I always get from the companies here, is of course, what's in it for us?</p><p>I think some of these companies are delivering technologies or delivering platforms that are in some instances almost undermining democracies or institutions. We've been seeing meddling with election affairs. Cyber attacks are very often happening through new technologies. That's not a role just for the private sector to set boundaries around or to have an idea that something that needs to happen in partnership with governments.</p><p>Q: How did you picture living in the Bay Area? And how has that changed?</p><p>A:\u00a0We're having this conversation after the polar vortex also hit Silicon Valley. So I can tell you in the vacancy announcement, it didn't say anything about how cold the Bay Area actually is and how often it rains.</p><p>What I did picture and what I have confirmed\u00a0is, of course, it's this fantastic ecosystem that is built here because of very strong, world-leading universities and educational institutions, but also this sort of the mindset of sharing ideas, of working together.</p><p>There are some other aspects that I've also been a little bit surprised about and that is, let's say the social flip side of this incredible wealth and the innovation environment that you have here. I bike to work every day, which is a luxury by the way, coming from Jakarta where that was not possible. It's almost like I'm in Copenhagen. But I meet homeless people every single day in the (underpass), even on the streets. And even in downtown Palo Alto, you have people that are living on benches.</p><p>I'll be honest with you and say that that's very difficult for me to cope with coming from a Scandinavian welfare system.</p><p>Q: Do your kids ask you about that? How do you explain that to them?</p><p>A:\u00a0What we are trying to do and where we struggle, like all other parents, is of course to give them a set of values that we think are important. That is, you take care of other people, you make sure that there is a safety net that if people have nothing, that you try and help in whatever way that you can.</p><p>If the government didn't pay for our housing, we would never be able to afford to live where we live. I am a civil servant and that's a moderately well paid job, but of course compared to the salary levels you have in the Bay Area, it would be impossible for us to live here just on our normal salaries. And when we open the garage we don't have a Porsche or a historic Ferrari like many of our neighbors actually do, which annoys the hell out of me. Let me be frank, I would love to have one of those, but it's not going to happen. And so I think it's almost a Fata Morgana (or a mirage) in the sense that we live in a place where we actually don't necessarily belong because we represent a different part of society and also a different country. And keeping a level head in that situation is important for us, but it's also something which we are acutely aware that we need to pass on to the kids as well.</p><p>Q:\u00a0What's something that you would like Silicon Valley to adopt from Denmark?</p><p>A: It's going to sound horribly like\u00a0a stereotype for a Dane, but I think having a safety net for people that fall through the system is going to be important.</p><p>In Europe, there's a big debate that we need to build a generation of entrepreneurs, startups is the flavor of the day. And I think you primarily hear the good stories about how people have become very successful, work 24/7, they've put all the money, sold the house and the car, and\u00a0they became a big success. My guess is for every successful entrepreneur you can probably find 10, 20, 30 entrepreneurs that lost everything, that didn't make it, that fell through.</p><p>Those who invest everything, time, resources, it is also important that they do not end up on a bench in Palo Alto afterwards. I think that's a moral, but also human responsibility that I would love to see be universally implemented.</p><p>Casper Klynge</p><p>Title:\u00a0Denmark's Tech AmbassadorCurrent home: Menlo ParkFamily: Married, with two sonsEducation: Master's degree in political science from Kobenhavns Universitet - University of CopenhagenPrevious jobs: Head of mission, EU Planning Team in Kosovo; Danish ambassador to Indonesia, Timor-Leste, Papua New Guinea and ASEAN; Deputy Director, Stabilization, Fragile States and Afghanistan.</p><p>Five facts about Casper Klynge  His\u00a0first meeting of the day is a phone call with officials in Copenhagen, which he takes while biking to work. His family has lived in at least five countries, and one of his sons was born in Belgium. He was the Danish ambassador to Cyprus around the time of that country's historic financial crisis, and was head of the European Union's mission to Kosovo from 2006 to 2008. He was a staff sergeant with the Danish Armed Forces. He's a Knight of the Order of Dannebrog.  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNTRCT-6061824</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNTRCT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VT9-TH31-JCX4-652W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313958</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1238\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MediaNews Group, Inc. and ANG Newspapers All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The East Bay Times (California)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 4, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Dozens of police agencies here are encrypting their radio communications and keeping crime reporters in the dark. 'That means journalists and others can't listen in using a scanner or smartphone app to learn about routine police calls,'wrote[2]my colleague Jonathan Peters, a lawyer andColumbia Journalism Review'spress freedom correspondent, earlier this year.'Law enforcement officials say that's basically the point. </p><p>Scanner technology has become more accessible through smartphone apps, and encryption has become easier and less expensive.' The latest dustup is in Denver, where the police department this month indicated it would ask media outlets to sign an agreement in order to access scanner traffic. The agreement 'contains restrictions such as no recording or broadcasting transmissions,' reported[3]KUSA 9News. As of June 12, the station hadn't signed on.Eric Valadez, the 9Newsdirector of content, had this to say about it in the report: 'We respect the important role law enforcement plays in keeping our community safe. We cannot accept an agreement that restricts access to public safety information or limits our ability to report in a transparent manner. 9NEWS remains optimistic we can reach an agreement that balances the concerns of police with our responsibility to serve the public.' Rival TV station KDVRreported[4]the encryption efforts at Colorado's largest police agency are creating 'controversy.' Denver's police chief, Paul Pazen, has said encrypting correspondence would protect victim privacy and law enforcement tactics.Denver PD still claims there's no firm date for turning on encryption. The @denverpost[5] has also declined to sign the agreement, but because talks continue between media and city attorney's office, I imagine we won't see DPD cut off public access to police radio traffic today <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/RB40WCHzRw\">https://t.co/RB40WCHzRw</url>[6] \u2014 Matt Sebastian (@mattsebastian) June 13, 2019[7]The Denver Post'seditorial board waded in, saying if police scanners go quiet, 'Coloradans will lose one important tool of transparency and accountability.'The editorialpointed out[8]why scanners have been an important news gathering tool for journalists: Most Americans probably don't even realize that it's occurring, but reporters across the nation doggedly listen to radio communications between first responders, searching for breaking news stories. Reporters listen for the types of emergencies big and small that the public needs to know about and often the public first learns to stay away from a gas leak or to avoid an area with an armed suspect through local media outlets. Reporters learn about fires and shootings, injuries and deaths, arrests and rescues, all by listening to the scanner and then following up with police and fire agencies to get more details of what occurred. Reporters aren't looking to splash lurid details on social media. News organizations have policies dictating the need to verify facts before reporting them and reporters take that responsibility seriously. 'There must be a way to continue to shine a light on these operations, and we think Denver and Chief Pazen could create a model for the rest of the state to follow,' the board concluded.Still working on a deal. \u2014 nicolevap (@nicolevap) June 27, 2019[9]'At this time the final agreement to sign has not been distributed to the media outlets yet,' Denver police spokesperson Jay Casillas told me on June 26. 'At this time, the radios are not encrypted. There isn't a date set at this point as to when the agreement will be sent for signing or when the radio transmissions will go encrypted.'The Colorado Media Project is looking into ways to stabilize local news that includes taxpayer support Astory[10]inColumbia Journalism Review this month about two bills in Congress that offer a 'helping hand' to a hurting news industry, led by California Democratic Rep. Mark DeSaulnier, noted a Colorado connection.From the piece[11]:Last year, DeSaulnier formed The Working Group on Saving Local News. It includes David Cicilline, of Rhode Island; Diana DeGette and Ed Perlmutter, of Colorado; Jamie Raskin, of Maryland; and Zoe Lofgren, also of California, all Democrats. They have solicited expertise from a variety of media trade associations and publishers to help get their heads around the extent of the challenges outlets face. In April, the group introduced a resolution recognizing the importance of local journalism and hosteda special session[12]on the House floor to highlight the issue, during which several members explained how declines in local news have impacted their districts. DeGette, who represents the Denver area, lamented how, in a short few years,The Denver Post, has downsized from 250 staffers to less than 100, while other Denver papers had closed outright. In other Colorado counties, she said, no newspaper exists at all. 'For the sake of our democracy, we need our local newspapers, we need our local reporters, we need our watchdogs doing what they do best,' DeGette said. 'We need to find ways to protect our local news outlets and help them thrive.'Congress isn't the only place where conversations about whether government can \u2014 somehow, some way \u2014 work to support local news. On the East Coast, a bill in the Bay State's legislature would 'create a special commission to study local journalism in underserved Massachusetts communities,'writes[13]Northeastern journalism professor Dan Kennedy on his blog. 'Can government play a role in helping to solve the local news crisis?' Kennedyasks[14]. 'Not directly, perhaps. But indirectly, government can shine a light on the issue, call attention to worthy projects that might inspire others, and offer some policy recommendations.' In New Jersey, politicians approved a bill to 'create an independent 'civic information consortium[15]', which will have $5m to spend on various types of local news coverage,'The Guardianreported[16]. Here in our state,theColorado Media Project[17] is busy gathering research and input about various models to support local news 'including taxpayer-supported journalism,' says board member Greg Moore, who spent 14 years as editor of The Denver Postand nowworks at[18] Deke Digital. (I've written in this newsletter[19]already about ideas fromlibrary districts[20] to Scientific and Cultural Facilities Districts as potential stabilizing funding sources, and recently, those involved with the Colorado Media Project met to hash out some thoughts on what else might be out there.) The group hopes to put together a report in a couple months that synthesizes some of the best thinking on the subject, not just in the United States but around the world. I asked Moore if this was an idea he would have entertained 20 years ago. 'I could have never imagined this day arising,' he said. 'It wouldn't have seemed necessary but when confronted with the very survival of journalism, I think that you have to be willing to look at a number of things.' The group of about a dozen, which also included former Rocky Mountain News Editor John Temple, has only had one meeting. It's a nascent effort, and some involved understand how polarizing it can be to even mention it in some journalistic circles. 'Government-run news.' 'Losing independence.' 'Pravda.' You can imagine the sneers. TheCMP's[21] Melissa Davis put this latest initiative in context with the rest of what the project is up to this summer, describing it as only a small part. 'The funding pie for local journalism is changing radically right before our eyes,' she says. 'We need to think as a community about different roles for different sectors. We're looking at what roles philanthropy can play, what roles local governments might play, and what roles individuals need to play more actively if they care about sustaining journalism.' Shutting down debate before having a 'full, open discussion' about the importance of journalism in a democratic society, that includes the idea of taxpayer support, isn't constructive, Moore said when I noted inevitable resistance. Then he added this:'I think the first thing that you have to attack, if I may say so, is sort of the sacrosanct view that the advertising model was free of influence. That's ridiculous. We were covering the people who paid our salaries, OK? We were covering the people that allowed the enterprise to exist. And to act as though there was no tension in that relationship, that there were no checks and balances in that relationshipand that it wasn't fraught with conflicts, is just silly and uninformed. And so if that's what the fear is in having the taxpayers take a direct role in funding and preserving journalism, then I think that's a conversation that can be won.'Quite the times we're in, folks. Nancy Watzman, director for The Colorado Media Project, says the CMP exists to research, experiment and collaborate in order to explore different kinds of solutions. 'We need to think outside the box,' she says. 'I would hesitate about framing this as 'taxpayer-funding,' too,' she added. 'But the way to think about this is: Is there a role? And I don't think we know what that will be. We just want to explore all the various options.' The project is also researching the role of philanthropy and membership when it comes to funding local news. If you have any ideas for the CMP as they pursue this, shoot them to the projecthere[22]. Watch this space for what emerges. 'Governor, will you look into the camera and say' Earlier this month, reporterJoe St. George[23]of KDVR in Denver had a notableexchange with Colorado's new governor, Jared Polis, a Democrat with a libertarian streak. His question came during an event at a children's hospital where Polis signed anexecutive order[24]that directs state government to, among other initiatives, try and determine 'root causes' of low immunization rates in communities, 'further study the views of parents,' and 'implement a public education and outreach campaign to address vaccine hesitancy and access issues.' As Colorado Public Radioreported[25], 'One thing the executive order doesn't do is push to tighten Colorado's vaccine exemption process, something public health professionals have actively sought through legislative changes.The executive order follows on the heels of a contentious vaccine debate last legislative session in which Polis did not back a Democratic vaccine measure dealing with exemptions.' Nationally, Colorado is in the basement when it comes to immunization rates. In Colorado, parents can exempt their children from vaccines for non-medical reasons. As Polis talked about his executive order, St. George, his TV camera rolling,asked him a direct question[26]. Below is the exchange word for word (the KDVRreport[27]misquotes both the reporter and the governor; I've transcribed it myself instead of copying and pasting, which is why it looks different):Reporter St. George: 'Governor, will you look into the camera and \u2014 and say that anti-vaxxers are wrong?' Governor Polis: 'Well, wrong about what? It's not the decision I made for my kids. I gave my kids their shots, their immunization, I encourage all parents to give kids immunizations.' Reporter: 'Is the movement wrong, though?' Governor: 'Again, we have in our state Christian Scientists, we have people who have objections, and \u2014 and nobody should be forced to do anything with their bodies. I'm pro-choice.'VIDEO: I gave Governor Polis the opportunity to say #antivax[28] movement is wrong today. He declined saying he is \"pro choice.\" Important to note Polis did vaccinate his kids and encourages parents to vaccinate as well. #copolitics[29] #coleg[30] #kdvr[31] pic.twitter.com/Wa8HcNz19s[32]; \u2014 Joe St. George (@JoeStGeorge) June 13, 2019[33] That's a compelling way to ask a question for sure, and, asColorado Independentreporter Alex Burnesspointed out[34], Polis's answer is similar to controversial views that put actress Jessica Biel in the spotlight recentlyas she lobbied against a California bill to shore up requirements for childhood vaccines. FromThe New York Timeson June 13 about Biel's efforts:And it reflected one of the realities of anti-vaccine beliefs: They are held by individuals across the country who might have little else in common, politically or otherwise. Anti-vaccine advocates include wealthy actors in Los Angeles, Orthodox Jews in New York, parents in the Pacific Northwest who send their children to Waldorf schools, Somali-Americans in Minnesota and conservatives who home-school their children. Ms. Biel quickly issued a statement on Thursday insisting that she is supportive of vaccines, but opposed to the bill in California, which would require that medical exemptions to mandatory vaccination be approved by state health officials, rather than just individual doctors. But her backpedaling did little to quell the outrage from parents, doctors and others who have accused those in the anti-vaccine movement of allowing highly contagious diseases like measles to spread in the United States. With an outbreak of the measles now underway, and state legislatures around the country debating immunization requirements, the entry of another prominent celebrity into the debate both broadened the scope of the national discussion around the issue and drew a fierce pushback from the medical community.Burness also pointed out how both Polis and Biel'are from Boulder, where some schools in the district have sub-50% immunization rates.'Readthe fullNew York Timesstory[35]about the vaccine debate as Colorado is likely to become an increasing focal point in it. And read Burness'sstory[36]forThe Colorado Independent about how vaccine skeptics are 'heartened' by the new governor's stance.

DC journo sues CO's secretary of state with help from Judicial Watch Todd Shepherd[47], the former Coloradojournalist who once wrote for the libertarian-learning Independence Institute think tank in Colorado andnow writes for The Washington Free Beacon inD.C., issuing[48]Colorado's Democratic secretary of state, Jena Griswold, in a dispute over access to correspondence about theNational Popular Vote[49]bill. You can read the legal filinghere[50]. It looks to me like he's challenging the secretary of state for citing 'work-product'for withholding documents, which is one of the exemptions public officials can rely on when responding (or not) to open records requests in Colorado.'There is a pretty broad definition in CORA for work product for elected officials:deliberative materials to help them make a decision,' says Jeff Roberts, director of theColorado Freedom of Information Coalition[51].'I think it will be interesting to see how a judge looks at that.' There's a notabletwist that comes with this lawsuit, beyond that Shepherd's attorney inthe suit is former GOP Secretary of State Scott Gessler.A news release fromJudicial Watch[52], a self-described 'conservative, non-partisan educational foundation,' published a news release[53]stating the group 'filed a Colorado Open Records Act lawsuit on behalf of' Shepherd. (A Judicial Watch spokesperson didn't return an email; Shepherd declined to comment, and so did the Secretary of State's office through a spokesperson.) Will we see more newsrooms, likely strapped for cash in the fighting-for-records department, increasingly outsourcing litigation to ideologically simpatico outside groups that have agendas beyond journalism? Or maybe just certainkinds of newsrooms. One can imagine the howls from some quarters if a nonprofit newsroom in Colorado teamed up with, say, Ethics Watch (when it was around) or the ACLU on a public records lawsuit involving a Republican officeholder. Or, say, if an environmental journalist in Colorado allowed a well-funded environmental group to foot the bill for litigation on something. This isn't the first time Judicial Watch has waded into a Colorado open records dispute, by the way.As Roberts of the CFOICwrote[54] in 2018: 'The judiciary is exempt from the open records law because of two Colorado court rulings, most recently Gleason v. Judicial Watch[55] in 2012. In that case, the Colorado Court of Appeals appeared to leave it to the legislature to define the judicial branch as a state agency for open records purposes.' A debate aboutthe Coloradoan's'story from the CBDstore' In mylast newsletter[56], I wrote about how the Gannett-ownedColoradoannewspaper in Fort Collins is on the huntfor digital subscribers to keep its newsroom sustainable. Recently, though, one of the other ways it generates revenue came under scrutiny on social media. Someone in the Facebook group 'What's your Plan B,' which is popular with journalists and ex-journalists, posted a link to this \u2014 hmmm, what to even call it? \u2014 piece of content[57]on theColoradoan'swebsite. The byline for this piece of content reads it was authored by 'Kalee Stephens, for the CBD Store,' and above the headline reads small text identifying it as a 'Story from The CBD Store.' At the end of this content comes this: 'Members of the editorial and news staff of the USA Today Network were not involved in the creation of this content.' Here's what itdoesn'tsay: Advertising. Sponsored. Paid for. I think it should.Thoughts? pic.twitter.com/Rddfjg7sm7[58]; \u2014 Corey Hutchins (@CoreyHutchins) June 18, 2019[59]'Native advertising is an important part of our revenue model as it is across the industry, just as advertorials were in print,'said[60]the paper's content strategist when I raised the issue.'Every story is clearly labeled in multiple places, and it is always promoted as 'sponsored'on social and when it appears on our site with news content.' She went on: 'In addition, our company has spent a lot of time over several years developing guidelines for native advertising content, labeling and its promotion to ensure that it meets our ethical and editorial standards.' A debate about the extent to which this content is labeled ensued in the FB group. Again, I'll reiterate I don't think it's clearly labeled enough online. When I see stuff like this, I just have a really hard time believing those who paid for it would be let down if they thought someone who read it assumed it was like any other article in their local newspaper. I do think that's essentially the point at its root: Trading on the credibility of a local newspaper to try and pull a paid advertisement off to look like a news story. I used to roll my eyes and thinkWell by now most readers know the difference, but I don't anymore. 'What always strikes me about this discussion of media literacy is that I never learned it in school even though everyone seems to advocate for it as a topic,' a college student recently wrote to me. I see this in classes where young adults just haven't gained enough media literacy by the time they get to college to, say, understand what 'promotions[61]' in a byline means if the content looks too much like a regular news story. Maybe that will change[62]. Channel 2's Chris Parentegets theWestwordtreatment Longtime Denveralt-weekly reporter Michael Roberts has keptWestwordreaders up to date about his city's TV news personalities for years. For his latest Q-and-A, he takes a look atChris Parente[63]of KWGN. Roberts notes his 'Midwestern upbringing; his love of theater and debate and how it merged into broadcast journalism,' and more. From thestory[64]:He also discusses his decision not to hide his status as a gay man from viewers and how that's led to what he refers to as 'challenges,' albeit far fewer than the positives he's experienced through an honest representation of who he is. And he gets emotional when talking about his fiance, Luis Rios, a schoolteacher who relocated to Colorado from North Carolina around the time Parente was moved from Everyday, a now-canceled Fox31 program he adored, into the Daybreak gig.Here's another excerpt:On the subject of looking at issues from both sides, some journalists today feel that objectivity is overrated and that reporters should be able to express their own point of view in telling stories. It sounds like you take more of an old-school approach. Yes, I do think that as a journalist, it's my obligation to present both sides fairly. But ultimately, the goal is to reveal truth, whatever that truth may be. As the morning news anchor, it's not my job to pontificate or editorialize any of the stories I'm doing; that's not the kind of guy I am. But I do seek truth in our newscasts in the morning, and I think part of the way we get to truth is presenting the perspective of however many sides there might be and at some point finding the truth in that \u2014 or allowing viewers to find the truth in that.Roberts also asked him how those celebrity-interviewjunkets work:Are the questions vetted in advance, or can you ask whatever you'd like? The questions aren't vetted, but there's a code of conduct that nearly every journalist adheres to. That code of conduct is that you're going to be professional. And my rule of thumb is, I'm not going to ask any personal questions, which are none of my business, and I don't think they're relevant anyway. Most journalists are respectful that way, and that's what keeps the process going. There's the occasional person who'll ask a ridiculous, inappropriate question, but to be honest with you, the actors will usually call them out. But the movie studios never ask for the questions in advance or screen them, which is good, because I don't think I'd do it.Read the whole thinghere[65].Bittersweet goodbye in thisweek's Colorado mediaHR report andpersonnel file The Gazette'sgreat news and environment reporterLiz Forster[66], who published theEnvironmentWeekly[67]newsletter,is leaving for the University of Montana for a degree in environmental law.

Dozens of police agencies here are encrypting their radio communications and keeping crime reporters in the dark. 'That means journalists and others can't listen in using a scanner or smartphone app to learn about routine police calls,'wrote[2]my colleague Jonathan Peters, a lawyer andColumbia Journalism Review'spress freedom correspondent, earlier this year.'Law enforcement officials say that's basically the point. </p><p>Scanner technology has become more accessible through smartphone apps, and encryption has become easier and less expensive.' The latest dustup is in Denver, where the police department this month indicated it would ask media outlets to sign an agreement in order to access scanner traffic. The agreement 'contains restrictions such as no recording or broadcasting transmissions,' reported[3]KUSA 9News. As of June 12, the station hadn't signed on.Eric Valadez, the 9Newsdirector of content, had this to say about it in the report: 'We respect the important role law enforcement plays in keeping our community safe. We cannot accept an agreement that restricts access to public safety information or limits our ability to report in a transparent manner. 9NEWS remains optimistic we can reach an agreement that balances the concerns of police with our responsibility to serve the public.' Rival TV station KDVRreported[4]the encryption efforts at Colorado's largest police agency are creating 'controversy.' Denver's police chief, Paul Pazen, has said encrypting correspondence would protect victim privacy and law enforcement tactics.Denver PD still claims there's no firm date for turning on encryption. The @denverpost[5] has also declined to sign the agreement, but because talks continue between media and city attorney's office, I imagine we won't see DPD cut off public access to police radio traffic today <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/RB40WCHzRw\">https://t.co/RB40WCHzRw</url>[6]   Matt Sebastian (@mattsebastian) June 13, 2019[7]The Denver Post'seditorial board waded in, saying if police scanners go quiet, 'Coloradans will lose one important tool of transparency and accountability.'The editorialpointed out[8]why scanners have been an important news gathering tool for journalists: Most Americans probably don't even realize that it's occurring, but reporters across the nation doggedly listen to radio communications between first responders, searching for breaking news stories. Reporters listen for the types of emergencies big and small that the public needs to know about and often the public first learns to stay away from a gas leak or to avoid an area with an armed suspect through local media outlets. Reporters learn about fires and shootings, injuries and deaths, arrests and rescues, all by listening to the scanner and then following up with police and fire agencies to get more details of what occurred. Reporters aren't looking to splash lurid details on social media. News organizations have policies dictating the need to verify facts before reporting them and reporters take that responsibility seriously. 'There must be a way to continue to shine a light on these operations, and we think Denver and Chief Pazen could create a model for the rest of the state to follow,' the board concluded.Still working on a deal.   nicolevap (@nicolevap) June 27, 2019[9]'At this time the final agreement to sign has not been distributed to the media outlets yet,' Denver police spokesperson Jay Casillas told me on June 26. 'At this time, the radios are not encrypted. There isn't a date set at this point as to when the agreement will be sent for signing or when the radio transmissions will go encrypted.'The Colorado Media Project is looking into ways to stabilize local news that includes taxpayer support Astory[10]inColumbia Journalism Review this month about two bills in Congress that offer a 'helping hand' to a hurting news industry, led by California Democratic Rep. Mark DeSaulnier, noted a Colorado connection.From the piece[11]:Last year, DeSaulnier formed The Working Group on Saving Local News. It includes David Cicilline, of Rhode Island; Diana DeGette and Ed Perlmutter, of Colorado; Jamie Raskin, of Maryland; and Zoe Lofgren, also of California, all Democrats. They have solicited expertise from a variety of media trade associations and publishers to help get their heads around the extent of the challenges outlets face. In April, the group introduced a resolution recognizing the importance of local journalism and hosteda special session[12]on the House floor to highlight the issue, during which several members explained how declines in local news have impacted their districts. DeGette, who represents the Denver area, lamented how, in a short few years,The Denver Post, has downsized from 250 staffers to less than 100, while other Denver papers had closed outright. In other Colorado counties, she said, no newspaper exists at all. 'For the sake of our democracy, we need our local newspapers, we need our local reporters, we need our watchdogs doing what they do best,' DeGette said. 'We need to find ways to protect our local news outlets and help them thrive.'Congress isn't the only place where conversations about whether government can   somehow, some way   work to support local news. On the East Coast, a bill in the Bay State's legislature would 'create a special commission to study local journalism in underserved Massachusetts communities,'writes[13]Northeastern journalism professor Dan Kennedy on his blog. 'Can government play a role in helping to solve the local news crisis?' Kennedyasks[14]. 'Not directly, perhaps. But indirectly, government can shine a light on the issue, call attention to worthy projects that might inspire others, and offer some policy recommendations.' In New Jersey, politicians approved a bill to 'create an independent 'civic information consortium[15]', which will have $5m to spend on various types of local news coverage,'The Guardianreported[16]. Here in our state,theColorado Media Project[17] is busy gathering research and input about various models to support local news 'including taxpayer-supported journalism,' says board member Greg Moore, who spent 14 years as editor of The Denver Postand nowworks at[18] Deke Digital. (I've written in this newsletter[19]already about ideas fromlibrary districts[20] to Scientific and Cultural Facilities Districts as potential stabilizing funding sources, and recently, those involved with the Colorado Media Project met to hash out some thoughts on what else might be out there.) The group hopes to put together a report in a couple months that synthesizes some of the best thinking on the subject, not just in the United States but around the world. I asked Moore if this was an idea he would have entertained 20 years ago. 'I could have never imagined this day arising,' he said. 'It wouldn't have seemed necessary but when confronted with the very survival of journalism, I think that you have to be willing to look at a number of things.' The group of about a dozen, which also included former Rocky Mountain News Editor John Temple, has only had one meeting. It's a nascent effort, and some involved understand how polarizing it can be to even mention it in some journalistic circles. 'Government-run news.' 'Losing independence.' 'Pravda.' You can imagine the sneers. TheCMP's[21] Melissa Davis put this latest initiative in context with the rest of what the project is up to this summer, describing it as only a small part. 'The funding pie for local journalism is changing radically right before our eyes,' she says. 'We need to think as a community about different roles for different sectors. We're looking at what roles philanthropy can play, what roles local governments might play, and what roles individuals need to play more actively if they care about sustaining journalism.' Shutting down debate before having a 'full, open discussion' about the importance of journalism in a democratic society, that includes the idea of taxpayer support, isn't constructive, Moore said when I noted inevitable resistance. Then he added this:'I think the first thing that you have to attack, if I may say so, is sort of the sacrosanct view that the advertising model was free of influence. That's ridiculous. We were covering the people who paid our salaries, OK? We were covering the people that allowed the enterprise to exist. And to act as though there was no tension in that relationship, that there were no checks and balances in that relationshipand that it wasn't fraught with conflicts, is just silly and uninformed. And so if that's what the fear is in having the taxpayers take a direct role in funding and preserving journalism, then I think that's a conversation that can be won.'Quite the times we're in, folks. Nancy Watzman, director for The Colorado Media Project, says the CMP exists to research, experiment and collaborate in order to explore different kinds of solutions. 'We need to think outside the box,' she says. 'I would hesitate about framing this as 'taxpayer-funding,' too,' she added. 'But the way to think about this is: Is there a role? And I don't think we know what that will be. We just want to explore all the various options.' The project is also researching the role of philanthropy and membership when it comes to funding local news. If you have any ideas for the CMP as they pursue this, shoot them to the projecthere[22]. Watch this space for what emerges. 'Governor, will you look into the camera and say' Earlier this month, reporterJoe St. George[23]of KDVR in Denver had a notableexchange with Colorado's new governor, Jared Polis, a Democrat with a libertarian streak. His question came during an event at a children's hospital where Polis signed anexecutive order[24]that directs state government to, among other initiatives, try and determine 'root causes' of low immunization rates in communities, 'further study the views of parents,' and 'implement a public education and outreach campaign to address vaccine hesitancy and access issues.' As Colorado Public Radioreported[25], 'One thing the executive order doesn't do is push to tighten Colorado's vaccine exemption process, something public health professionals have actively sought through legislative changes.The executive order follows on the heels of a contentious vaccine debate last legislative session in which Polis did not back a Democratic vaccine measure dealing with exemptions.' Nationally, Colorado is in the basement when it comes to immunization rates. In Colorado, parents can exempt their children from vaccines for non-medical reasons. As Polis talked about his executive order, St. George, his TV camera rolling,asked him a direct question[26]. Below is the exchange word for word (the KDVRreport[27]misquotes both the reporter and the governor; I've transcribed it myself instead of copying and pasting, which is why it looks different):Reporter St. George: 'Governor, will you look into the camera and   and say that anti-vaxxers are wrong?' Governor Polis: 'Well, wrong about what? It's not the decision I made for my kids. I gave my kids their shots, their immunization, I encourage all parents to give kids immunizations.' Reporter: 'Is the movement wrong, though?' Governor: 'Again, we have in our state Christian Scientists, we have people who have objections, and   and nobody should be forced to do anything with their bodies. I'm pro-choice.'VIDEO: I gave Governor Polis the opportunity to say #antivax[28] movement is wrong today. He declined saying he is \"pro choice.\" Important to note Polis did vaccinate his kids and encourages parents to vaccinate as well. #copolitics[29] #coleg[30] #kdvr[31] pic.twitter.com/Wa8HcNz19s[32];   Joe St. George (@JoeStGeorge) June 13, 2019[33] That's a compelling way to ask a question for sure, and, asColorado Independentreporter Alex Burnesspointed out[34], Polis's answer is similar to controversial views that put actress Jessica Biel in the spotlight recentlyas she lobbied against a California bill to shore up requirements for childhood vaccines. FromThe New York Timeson June 13 about Biel's efforts:And it reflected one of the realities of anti-vaccine beliefs: They are held by individuals across the country who might have little else in common, politically or otherwise. Anti-vaccine advocates include wealthy actors in Los Angeles, Orthodox Jews in New York, parents in the Pacific Northwest who send their children to Waldorf schools, Somali-Americans in Minnesota and conservatives who home-school their children. Ms. Biel quickly issued a statement on Thursday insisting that she is supportive of vaccines, but opposed to the bill in California, which would require that medical exemptions to mandatory vaccination be approved by state health officials, rather than just individual doctors. But her backpedaling did little to quell the outrage from parents, doctors and others who have accused those in the anti-vaccine movement of allowing highly contagious diseases like measles to spread in the United States. With an outbreak of the measles now underway, and state legislatures around the country debating immunization requirements, the entry of another prominent celebrity into the debate both broadened the scope of the national discussion around the issue and drew a fierce pushback from the medical community.Burness also pointed out how both Polis and Biel'are from Boulder, where some schools in the district have sub-50% immunization rates.'Readthe fullNew York Timesstory[35]about the vaccine debate as Colorado is likely to become an increasing focal point in it. And read Burness'sstory[36]forThe Colorado Independent about how vaccine skeptics are 'heartened' by the new governor's stance.

DC journo sues CO's secretary of state with help from Judicial Watch Todd Shepherd[47], the former Coloradojournalist who once wrote for the libertarian-learning Independence Institute think tank in Colorado andnow writes for The Washington Free Beacon inD.C., issuing[48]Colorado's Democratic secretary of state, Jena Griswold, in a dispute over access to correspondence about theNational Popular Vote[49]bill. You can read the legal filinghere[50]. It looks to me like he's challenging the secretary of state for citing 'work-product'for withholding documents, which is one of the exemptions public officials can rely on when responding (or not) to open records requests in Colorado.'There is a pretty broad definition in CORA for work product for elected officials:deliberative materials to help them make a decision,' says Jeff Roberts, director of theColorado Freedom of Information Coalition[51].'I think it will be interesting to see how a judge looks at that.' There's a notabletwist that comes with this lawsuit, beyond that Shepherd's attorney inthe suit is former GOP Secretary of State Scott Gessler.A news release fromJudicial Watch[52], a self-described 'conservative, non-partisan educational foundation,' published a news release[53]stating the group 'filed a Colorado Open Records Act lawsuit on behalf of' Shepherd. (A Judicial Watch spokesperson didn't return an email; Shepherd declined to comment, and so did the Secretary of State's office through a spokesperson.) Will we see more newsrooms, likely strapped for cash in the fighting-for-records department, increasingly outsourcing litigation to ideologically simpatico outside groups that have agendas beyond journalism? Or maybe just certainkinds of newsrooms. One can imagine the howls from some quarters if a nonprofit newsroom in Colorado teamed up with, say, Ethics Watch (when it was around) or the ACLU on a public records lawsuit involving a Republican officeholder. Or, say, if an environmental journalist in Colorado allowed a well-funded environmental group to foot the bill for litigation on something. This isn't the first time Judicial Watch has waded into a Colorado open records dispute, by the way.As Roberts of the CFOICwrote[54] in 2018: 'The judiciary is exempt from the open records law because of two Colorado court rulings, most recently Gleason v. Judicial Watch[55] in 2012. In that case, the Colorado Court of Appeals appeared to leave it to the legislature to define the judicial branch as a state agency for open records purposes.' A debate aboutthe Coloradoan's'story from the CBDstore' In mylast newsletter[56], I wrote about how the Gannett-ownedColoradoannewspaper in Fort Collins is on the huntfor digital subscribers to keep its newsroom sustainable. Recently, though, one of the other ways it generates revenue came under scrutiny on social media. Someone in the Facebook group 'What's your Plan B,' which is popular with journalists and ex-journalists, posted a link to this   hmmm, what to even call it?   piece of content[57]on theColoradoan'swebsite. The byline for this piece of content reads it was authored by 'Kalee Stephens, for the CBD Store,' and above the headline reads small text identifying it as a 'Story from The CBD Store.' At the end of this content comes this: 'Members of the editorial and news staff of the USA Today Network were not involved in the creation of this content.' Here's what itdoesn'tsay: Advertising. Sponsored. Paid for. I think it should.Thoughts? pic.twitter.com/Rddfjg7sm7[58];   Corey Hutchins (@CoreyHutchins) June 18, 2019[59]'Native advertising is an important part of our revenue model as it is across the industry, just as advertorials were in print,'said[60]the paper's content strategist when I raised the issue.'Every story is clearly labeled in multiple places, and it is always promoted as 'sponsored'on social and when it appears on our site with news content.' She went on: 'In addition, our company has spent a lot of time over several years developing guidelines for native advertising content, labeling and its promotion to ensure that it meets our ethical and editorial standards.' A debate about the extent to which this content is labeled ensued in the FB group. Again, I'll reiterate I don't think it's clearly labeled enough online. When I see stuff like this, I just have a really hard time believing those who paid for it would be let down if they thought someone who read it assumed it was like any other article in their local newspaper. I do think that's essentially the point at its root: Trading on the credibility of a local newspaper to try and pull a paid advertisement off to look like a news story. I used to roll my eyes and thinkWell by now most readers know the difference, but I don't anymore. 'What always strikes me about this discussion of media literacy is that I never learned it in school even though everyone seems to advocate for it as a topic,' a college student recently wrote to me. I see this in classes where young adults just haven't gained enough media literacy by the time they get to college to, say, understand what 'promotions[61]' in a byline means if the content looks too much like a regular news story. Maybe that will change[62]. Channel 2's Chris Parentegets theWestwordtreatment Longtime Denveralt-weekly reporter Michael Roberts has keptWestwordreaders up to date about his city's TV news personalities for years. For his latest Q-and-A, he takes a look atChris Parente[63]of KWGN. Roberts notes his 'Midwestern upbringing; his love of theater and debate and how it merged into broadcast journalism,' and more. From thestory[64]:He also discusses his decision not to hide his status as a gay man from viewers and how that's led to what he refers to as 'challenges,' albeit far fewer than the positives he's experienced through an honest representation of who he is. And he gets emotional when talking about his fiance, Luis Rios, a schoolteacher who relocated to Colorado from North Carolina around the time Parente was moved from Everyday, a now-canceled Fox31 program he adored, into the Daybreak gig.Here's another excerpt:On the subject of looking at issues from both sides, some journalists today feel that objectivity is overrated and that reporters should be able to express their own point of view in telling stories. It sounds like you take more of an old-school approach. Yes, I do think that as a journalist, it's my obligation to present both sides fairly. But ultimately, the goal is to reveal truth, whatever that truth may be. As the morning news anchor, it's not my job to pontificate or editorialize any of the stories I'm doing; that's not the kind of guy I am. But I do seek truth in our newscasts in the morning, and I think part of the way we get to truth is presenting the perspective of however many sides there might be and at some point finding the truth in that   or allowing viewers to find the truth in that.Roberts also asked him how those celebrity-interviewjunkets work:Are the questions vetted in advance, or can you ask whatever you'd like? The questions aren't vetted, but there's a code of conduct that nearly every journalist adheres to. That code of conduct is that you're going to be professional. And my rule of thumb is, I'm not going to ask any personal questions, which are none of my business, and I don't think they're relevant anyway. Most journalists are respectful that way, and that's what keeps the process going. There's the occasional person who'll ask a ridiculous, inappropriate question, but to be honest with you, the actors will usually call them out. But the movie studios never ask for the questions in advance or screen them, which is good, because I don't think I'd do it.Read the whole thinghere[65].Bittersweet goodbye in thisweek's Colorado mediaHR report andpersonnel file The Gazette'sgreat news and environment reporterLiz Forster[66], who published theEnvironmentWeekly[67]newsletter,is leaving for the University of Montana for a degree in environmental law.

The Facebook founder wined and dined members of Congress and had a private meeting with Donald Trump.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The visit was the billionaire's attempt to shape the wave of regulation ahead and - he hopes - to stave off a break-up.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Facebook, Google and Amazon have all been hit this month with demands by the US Department of Justice to produce emails and internal documents as the government digs into the question of whether they have used their heft to squash competition illegally. None of the targets in the great tech crackdown of 2019, claims one critic, is as vulnerable as the fourth company in Washington's sights - Apple.</p><p>\"The App Store is the most blatant example of antitrust violation in tech,\" said Ben Thompson, the tech commentator and founder of Stratechery. \"It is textbook anticompetitive, and is kind of amazing in its brazenness.\"</p><p>The App Store is an online bazaar of 2m-plus free and paid-for apps, offered on the 900m iPhones around the world. While iPhone sales have fallen, Apple's services arm, which is powered by the App Store, has exploded. Morgan Stanley expects the division to bring in $58bn (\u00a346bn) next year, up from $24bn in 2016.</p><p>The surge is largely due to the 30% levy that Apple charges for in-app purchases or subscriptions to content services such as Hulu, the video streaming giant.</p><p>Spotify started legal action in Europe this year over Apple's 30% take (which drops to 15% after the first year). Apple waives the fees for Apple Music - a direct Spotify rival - giving it a price edge. Apple also prohibits Spotify from putting a link in the app to a sign-up page outside Apple's system.</p><p>Siri, Apple's voice assistant, will not play music via Spotify. A recent New York Times investigation found that Apple's search algorithm prioritised its own apps over those of rivals; the company swiftly \"improved\" the function. Thompson said: \"At some point, the smartphone crosses the line to something that's so meaningful to daily life, that you have to take more concern, and there's more responsibilities that come with the App Store.\"</p><p>Apple said that 84% of apps in its store are free, so produce no income for Apple, and that it has only 44 of its own apps competing with third parties.</p><p>In 1984, America broke up AT&amp;T's monopoly on local phone services, creating seven smaller companies and unleashing a wave of innovation. Antitrust scholars see it as the last significant victory for government trust-busters. Since then, a steady drip of court cases has narrowed the scope of the existing law - the Sherman Act - to such a degree it is almost unrecognisable.</p><p>Michael Kades, director for markets and competition policy at the Washington Centre for Equitable Growth, said: \"The courts have eviscerated the Sherman Act. Forty years of conservative legal interpretations mean it is not clear that, given the exact same AT&amp;T case, the government would win.\"</p><p>As Washington gears up for an almighty fight with Silicon Valley, the government's least worst option, said Kades, is for a divided Congress to pass new antitrust laws that make clear what companies can and cannot do. If it doesn't, Apple and the rest can argue that they are working entirely to the letter of the law.</p><p>Microsoft, which got into hot water in the 1990s for forcing computer-makers to bundle its Internet Explorer browser into their machines, fought the government for 29 years. It fended off a break-up and today is worth more than $1 trillion.</p><p>Microsoft's transgressions were \"small fry\" compared to Apple's leveraging of its dominance in smartphones, Thompson said. He added: \"Simply by virtue of having created a platform, you get to take 30% for basically everyone on Earth? We already decided, both in Europe and the US, that that was not OK.\"</p><p>However, Washington's scope to bring Big Tech to heel is weaker than ever.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-56298066</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X3P-2BS1-JCJY-G4F1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"644\"/><timeReceived>11:01 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 21, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009QBX</classCode><className>MORGAN STANLEY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Amazon stock was down 0.6 per cent in Wednesday morning trading and Facebook was off 0.3 per cent. Shares in Alphabet, Google's parent company, traded 0.4 per cent lower. Facebook declined to comment, and the other large platform companies did not respond.</p><p>The DoJ move comes after the outgoing European Commission signalled it was also looking to become more aggressive in checking the market power of the largest online platform companies. A report commissioned by the EU in April recommended lowering the bar for companies deemed 'dominant players', subjecting them to stricter antitrust rules.</p><p>Donald Trump has been critical of the EU's scrutiny of American tech groups, suggesting it should be US rather than European authorities investigating wrongdoing by the technology sector.</p><p>Tuesday's justice department announcement came the day before what is expected to be the imposition of the largest ever penalty levied by the Federal Trade Commission, America's other main competition authority.</p><p>The FTC is expected to announce that Facebook will pay about $5bn to settle an investigation into multiple claims that the social network misused its users' data.</p><p>This will include allegations, first reported by The Washington Post, that the company passed on the phone numbers of users without their full knowledge, and failed to fully disclose to users how they might turn off Facebook's facial recognition technology, according to one person familiar with the situation.</p><p>Under the terms of the deal, Facebook will be required to change how it handles and stores user data, and to be more transparent about its practices.</p><p>A few weeks ago US antitrust officials agreed to a broad carve-up in their responsibility for investigating individual tech companies, with the DoJ undertaking to study Google and Apple and the FTC looking into Facebook and Amazon.</p><p>That decision drew criticism from Mike Lee, the Republican chairman of the Senate's antitrust subcommittee, who said dividing up the tech investigations would be 'less effective and coherent' than if one agency took on the work.</p><p>David Balto, a former head of policy in the FTC's antitrust division, said Tuesday's announcement appeared to show that the DoJ had now taken on sole responsibility for taking on the big tech companies. The depth of expertise and experience at the justice department made it the natural agency to take the lead, he said, adding: 'It would seem to be a poor use of government resources' for both agencies to be involved.</p><p>However, a person close to one of the leading tech companies cast doubt on that conclusion, and said the DoJ appeared to be carving out a new area of investigation over the head of the FTC by taking on a broad review of issues raised by tech platforms. That raised the possibility that the agencies would eventually come to different conclusions in their investigations into some of the same companies, this person said.</p><p>The DoJ's first public declaration about the focus of its own inquiries, in a terse statement issued late on Tuesday, did not address the earlier arrangement with the FTC and left some legal experts questioning how Washington would proceed.</p><p>'I'd think there would be more co-ordination between the DoJ and the FTC,' said Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond, Virginia, adding that it was impossible to tell whether the agencies were now 'working together'.</p><p>Tuesday's statement appeared to show Makan Delrahim, the Trump appointee who heads the DoJ's antitrust division, was now firmly in charge of scrutinising Big Tech, Mr Tobias said.</p><p>'Without the discipline of meaningful market-based competition, digital platforms may act in ways that are not responsive to consumer demands,' Mr Delrahim said, adding that the review 'will explore these important issues'.</p><p>The potential conflicts of interest raised by the big tech companies - which act in some cases both as platform providers, supporting other online companies, and delivering their own competing services - has become a focus of criticism from several Democratic party hopefuls in the forthcoming presidential primaries.</p><p>Senator Elizabeth Warren from Massachusetts has led calls for the break-up of the companies, in order to turn their platforms into closely regulated utilities.</p><p>In another sign of the growing political concern in Washington, the House of Representatives judiciary committee held its first hearing into the power of the online platform companies last week. Mr Delrahim was expected to appear before the Senate judiciary committee on Tuesday to answer questions on antitrust enforcement, though the hearing was postponed.</p><p>Despite the rising political temperature and the justice department's new inquiry, some antitrust experts cautioned any legal sanctions against the tech companies are still a long way off. 'There is a tremendous distance between the concerns that are being raised and the conclusion by a court that consumers have been harmed,' said Mr Balto.</p><p>The DoJ confirmed that it has already started discussing the antitrust concerns with others, including 'industry participants who have direct insight into competition in online platforms'.</p><p>Additional reporting by Hannah Murphy in San Francisco and Richard Henderson in New York</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSDAY-BUSSDAY25072019000545</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSDAY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WND-F3T1-F00C-6049-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">436445</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1067\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Business Day All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Business Day</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 25, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

A\u00a0 report commissioned by the EU in April recommended lowering the bar for companies deemed \u201cdominant players\u201d, subjecting them to stricter antitrust rules.</p><p>Donald Trump has been critical of the EU\u2019s scrutiny of American tech groups, suggesting it should be\u00a0 US rather than European authorities investigating wrongdoing by the technology sector.\u00a0</p><p>Tuesday\u2019s justice department announcement came the day before what is expected to be the imposition of the largest ever penalty levied by the Federal Trade Commission, America\u2019s other main competition authority.</p><p>The FTC is expected to announce that Facebook will pay about $5bn to settle an investigation into multiple claims that the social network misused its users\u2019 data.\u00a0</p><p>This will include allegations, first reported by The Washington Post, that the company passed on the phone numbers of users without their full knowledge, and failed to fully disclose to users how they might turn off Facebook\u2019s facial recognition technology, according to one person familiar with the situation.\u00a0</p><p>Under the terms of the deal, Facebook will be required to change how it handles and stores user data, and to be more transparent about its practices.</p><p>A few weeks ago\u00a0US antitrust officials\u00a0 agreed to a broad carve-up in their responsibility for investigating individual tech companies, with the DoJ undertaking to study Google and Apple and the FTC looking into Facebook and Amazon.\u00a0</p><p>That decision drew criticism from Mike Lee, the Republican chairman of the Senate\u2019s antitrust subcommittee, who said dividing up the tech investigations would be\u00a0\u201cless effective and coherent\u201d than if one agency took on the work.</p><p>David Balto, a former head of policy in the FTC\u2019s antitrust division, said Tuesday\u2019s announcement appeared to show that the DoJ had now taken on sole responsibility for taking on the big tech companies. The depth of expertise and experience at the justice department made it the natural agency to take the lead, he said, adding: \u201cIt would seem to be a poor use of government resources\u201d for both agencies to be involved.</p><p>However, a person close to one of the leading tech companies cast doubt on that conclusion, and said the DoJ appeared to be carving out a new area of investigation over the head of the FTC by taking on a broad review of issues raised by tech platforms. That raised the possibility that the agencies would eventually come to different conclusions in their investigations into some of the same companies, this person said.</p><p>The\u00a0DoJ\u2019s first public declaration about the focus of its own inquiries, in a terse statement issued late on Tuesday, did not address the earlier arrangement with the FTC and left some legal experts questioning\u00a0how Washington would proceed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d think there would be more co-ordination between the DoJ and the FTC,\u201d said Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond, Virginia, adding that it was impossible to tell whether the agencies were now\u00a0\u201cworking together\u201d.</p><p>Tuesday\u2019s statement appeared to show Makan Delrahim, the Trump appointee who heads the DoJ\u2019s antitrust division, was now firmly in charge of scrutinising Big Tech, Mr Tobias said.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWithout the discipline of meaningful market-based competition, digital platforms may act in ways that are not responsive to consumer demands,\u201d Mr Delrahim said, adding that the review \u201cwill explore these important issues\u201d.</p><p>The potential conflicts of interest raised by the big tech companies \u2014 which act in some cases both as platform providers, supporting other online companies, and\u00a0delivering their own competing services \u2014 has become a focus of criticism from several Democratic party hopefuls in the forthcoming presidential primaries.\u00a0</p><p>Senator Elizabeth Warren from Massachusetts has led calls for the break-up of the companies, in order to turn their platforms into closely regulated utilities.</p><p>In another sign of the growing political concern in Washington, the House of Representatives judiciary committee held its first hearing into the power of the online platform companies last week. Mr Delrahim was expected to appear before the Senate judiciary committee on Tuesday to answer questions on antitrust enforcement, though the hearing was postponed.</p><p>Despite the rising political temperature and the justice department\u2019s new inquiry, some antitrust experts cautioned any legal sanctions against the tech companies are still a long way off. \u201cThere is a tremendous distance between the concerns that are being raised and the conclusion by a court that consumers have been harmed,\u201d said Mr Balto.</p><p>The DoJ confirmed that it has already started discussing the antitrust concerns with others, including \u201cindustry participants who have direct insight into competition in online platforms\u201d.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Additional reporting by Hannah Murphy in San Francisco and Richard Henderson in New York</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-4f008ab0ad8c11e98030530adfa879c2</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WMX-9X01-DXP9-93K1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1071\"/><timeReceived>3:14 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 24, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Millions of people were given a voice beyond the reach of traditional gatekeepers. It was glorious.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Now that we\u2019ve lived through two decades of this revolution, however, the gatekeepers have returned.</p><p>Facebook has banned several controversial account holders from its site and related properties such as Instagram, including conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, radical black nationalist minister Louis Farrakhan, and a whole host of alt-right commentators.</p><p> The company says they\u2019ve been removed as they\u2019re classified as \u201cdangerous individuals and organizations\u201d who \u201cpromote or engage in violence and hate, regardless of ideology.\u201d</p><p>YouTube underwent a similar process in March, shutting down the accounts of hundreds of conservative voices in response to pressure from activists who seek to \u201cdeplatform\u201d those with whom they disagree.</p><p> In a way, it\u2019s difficult to place blame directly at the feet at the platforms like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. They\u2019re only reacting to the feverish outcry of politicians in Washington and the new mantra of social justice that pervades major cities across the nation.</p><p> Banning fringe voices from social media networks may be popular among tech and political elites, but it will only further embolden the people with truly dangerous ideas.</p><p> The fresh wave of censorship is being led by the reaction to the actions of the deranged terrorist, motivated by very bad ideas, who opened fire on peaceful worshippers at mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in March, killing 51 people and leaving 41 injured.</p><p> He livestreamed the entire rampage, peppering his deadly killing spree with commentary and phrases found on seedy online chat rooms and websites.</p><p> Political leaders in western nations want global regulations on the social media platforms used by the shooter, which you or I use everyday to communicate with our friends and family.</p><p> In the rush to prevent another attack, however, we should be warned against any crackdown on social media and internet freedom. These are the tools of dictatorships and autocracies, not freedom-loving democracies.</p><p> But penalizing social media companies and its users for a tragic shooting that took place in real life abrogates responsibility for the individual alleged of this attack, and seeks to curb our entire internet freedom because of one bad actor.</p><p> What\u2019s more, trying to play whack-a-mole with bad ideas on the internet in the form of bans or criminal liability will only embolden the seediest of platforms while putting unreasonable expectations on the major platforms. And that leads us to miss the point about this tragedy.</p><p> Social media platforms like Facebook or Twitter already employ tens of thousands of moderators around the world to flag and remove content like this, and users share in that responsibility. It will be up to these platforms to address concerns of the global community, and I have no doubt their response will be reasonable.</p><p> But on the other hand, this tragedy occurs in the context in which Big Tech is already being vilified for swinging elections, censoring speech of conservatives, and not reacting quickly enough to political demands on which content should be permissible or not.</p><p> As such, we are set to hear anti-social media proposals that have very little to do with what happened on that tragic day in Christchurch in idyllic New Zealand.</p><p> Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison wants the G20 to discuss global penalties for social media firms that allow questionable content. Democrats like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, among many congressional Republicans, want to use antitrust regulations to break up Facebook.</p><p> A recent national poll found that 71 percent of Democratic voters want more regulation of Big Tech companies.</p><p> In the wake of a tragedy, we should not succumb to the wishes of the terrorist who perpetuated these attacks. Overreacting and overextending the power of our institutions to further censor and limit online speech would be met with glee by the killer and those who share his worldview. Reactionary policies to shut these voices out so they cannot read or listen to alternative views will only embolden them and make the internet a seedier place.</p><p> Many individuals and companies are now fully reliant on social media platforms for connecting with friends, attracting customers or expressing their free speech. They are overwhelmingly a force for good.</p><p> Yes, internet subcultures exist. Most of them, by definition, are frequented by very small numbers of people who are marginalized. But clamping down on social media will only radicalize this minority in greater numbers, and maybe lead to more blowback.</p><p> Cooler heads must prevail. Social media does more good than harm, and we cannot use the actions of a fraction of a minority to upend the experience for billions of users.</p><p> We can use these tools to condemn and prevent extremist ideas and behavior rather than the force of law or outright bans of controversial figures who make convenient targets.</p><p> Ya\u00ebl Ossowski is a consumer advocate and deputy director of the Consumer Choice Center.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKMI-doc75ceanz2pe81h0nhq53v</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2898016D0DCEBF NWBKMI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W4R-0G51-JBCN-415C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401943</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"874\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Monroe Evening News<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Competition and Innovation in Communications Buongiorno and thank you for that kind introduction. I appreciate the opportunity to open this conference on competition in the fast-changing and dynamic communications industry.\u00a0 So, my first question for you this morning is, 'Are you ready?' That's what the famous Italian inventor Guglielmo Marconi asked with the first radio broadcast over water, on May 13, 1897. After inventing what was then 'cutting edge' radio technology here in Italy, Marconi sent that message across the Bristol Channel in England; soon after that he was sending messages across the Atlantic. </p><p>Tapped out in Morse code, it said: 'Are you ready?' This was followed by: 'Can you hear me?' And, the reply: 'Yes, loud and clear.' Wireless communications was born. The world, of course, has never been fully ready for the many incredible advancements radio communications have enabled. But, it has been more than eager to embrace them. For over a century, since that first radio broadcast across the Bristol Channel, the communications industry has been marked by constant innovation. It's a dynamic industry that has delivered enormous value to consumers, starting here, in the birthplace of wireless communications, to countries around the world.  Makan Delrahim, the Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust at the United States Department of Justice, spoke in Rome a few weeks ago. He recalled the epithet that 'all roads lead to Rome,' and the power of network effects on display in the Roman Empire. Today's conference topics are built on the power of network effects how they deliver value to markets, and how they can hinder the competitive process. Indeed, with the development of advanced networks and the Internet of Things, we are entering a world of ubiquitous connectivity. Instead of 'all roads lead to Rome,' a more descriptive epithet for our time is 'all roads lead to everywhere and everything' or, maybe, 'all roads lead to all roads.' The ongoing development of wireless communications that Marconi helped advance, and eventually commercialize, has forever changed our world. There are now network connections and wireless signals crisscrossing the globe. This city of Milan and my home in Washington, D.C. no longer seem quite so far apart.\u00a0 In fact, I can hold up my smartphone from this podium and see if I have any text messages from distant Nigro family relatives in San Fele, Italy, or obtain critical, time sensitive information, such as a picture of the Italian Caprese avocado toast my daughter ate for breakfast today.\u00a0 In the modern era, however, it is also so much more than simply sending messages. In the last century, telecommunications was one of the most important industries in every economy in the world. It was how people and businesses shared information in real time. In the next century, however, many industries will rely on telecommunications not just to communicate, but as an integral part of the services their customers' desire. Telecom is rapidly evolving from being a means of communication to providing the platform on which other industries operate.\u00a0 Consider Amazon or Uber in the United States. Retail businesses and transportation services once stood beside communications providers as pillars of industry. Now, retail and transportation depend on communications not just to do business more expeditiously, but as part of the service itself. Telecom is quickly becoming inextricably intertwined with many other industries and changing the way we do business; it is restructuring entire industries.\u00a0 Throughout the decades since Marconi first sent his message, we have seen that innovation and consumer welfare are best served by competition and competitive markets. When the pace of innovation is stifled by external controls, be they unnecessary regulations or monopolists, consumers suffer. That is what I would like to talk about today - our responsibility as Department of Justice officials to enforce the antitrust laws through effective law enforcement, rather than unnecessary regulation. Regulated markets tend to react more slowly to the rapid changes that are the lifeblood of dynamic industries such as communications. In contrast, by preserving competition through effective antitrust enforcement, markets and competitors are free to embrace innovation at the pace of invention, unconstrained by the reigns of a regulator.\u00a0 I'll begin my remarks by talking about some general principles of antitrust enforcement and remedies in dynamic industries, before touching on a few of the key topics that will be the focus of the panels the next two days.\u00a0 The United States' first federal antitrust law, the Sherman Antitrust Act, was passed in 1890, seven years before Marconi sent that message asking: 'Are you ready?' When it came to having a tool to maintain competitive markets, the country was ready it had in place a law enforcement regime designed to protect competition and competitive markets.\u00a0 We also had much to learn in those early days. The drafters of the Sherman Act did not understand key market concepts in communications like network effects and gatekeeper power, or economic concepts like HHIs and Upward Pricing Pressure. They, however, endorsed a law enforcement regime, rather than a regulatory regime, which proved wise they lacked the depth of thinking that we do about the features of communications markets that can sometimes make them conducive to competitive problems. But, they did understand there were dangers from the misuse of corporate power, even as they were hesitant to interpose governmental authority over free enterprise. We are wrestling with the same tension today.\u00a0 In resolving that tension, let us be clear about the proper role of the government in dynamic industries. We are not inventors; I know I am certainly not, which is why I am here speaking to you today. We do not develop new technologies. Nor do we provide incubators for inventors that is what free and competitive markets do. Our job is to use law enforcement to protect those free markets and competition, to the benefit of consumers, innovators, and the economy as a whole. At our best, we protect the environment in which the modern-day Marconis have reason and opportunity to tinker, invent and invest to bring new technologies to market.\u00a0 That is precisely the intuition underlying this Antitrust Division' approach to merger settlements. Mergers change market structures. The question for us is whether the change is good or bad for consumers. When anticompetitive harm results from changes in market structure, attempting to wrestle the firm to behave in a way that we think replicates a competitive outcome makes no sense, even assuming we can guess what the competitive outcome would be, or should be, absent the merger. A problem caused by a structural change requires a structural fix. It is not our job as law enforcers to use our power to approve transactions as an opportunity to step in and order the firm to adhere to certain dictates. Regulatory restrictions and dynamic markets do not mix well.\u00a0 That is our guiding principle: whenever feasible, competition, as maintained through effective antitrust enforcement, is preferable to regulation. Competitive markets dynamically weigh risk and reward, support investment, and pivot to new innovation. Regulation, in contrast, is rigid and tends to be slow moving lagging both competitive problems and new innovations. The literature describes as 'regulatory lag' the delay between changes in market conditions or technology and the adjustment of regulations based on those factors. Particularly when attempting to regulate access to markets as a solution to a competitively problematic market structure, regulation and its resulting lags will typically mean delayed entry, expansion, or innovation.  A story from communications law history underscores the point. In the 1950s, a Texas rancher and inventor thought there should be a way to make and receive a phone call while riding a horse or tending to an oil field. So, Thomas F. Carter set out to build a device to attach to his telephone, then on AT... monopoly network, that would use radio signals to transmit out in the field. In many ways, his invention, the Carterfone, was the first mobile phone.\u00a0 AT...as then a nationwide telephone monopolist in the United States, and it sought to block the Carterfone. At the time, its equipment business, Western Electric, was vertically integrated with its telephone system, and naturally fought innovators who tried to develop new equipment.\u00a0 Moreover, AT...ad the assistance of FCC regulation, using a tariff filed with the FCC in 1957 to prohibit interconnection of non-AT...quipment like the Carterfone. So AT...as able to employ an FCC tariff to block the Carterfone.\u00a0 Carter eventually turned to legal action. He filed suit in federal court in 1965, but that case was dismissed. So nearly a decade after first attempting to bring his invention to market, in 1966 the industry regulator, the FCC, undertook an inquiry into the effect of its own rules. Two and a half years later, the FCC issued its famous 1968 Carterfone decision, insisting that AT...ermit the attachment of devices like Mr. Carter's to the telephone network.\u00a0 There we see the belated benefits of regulation. Over a decade after its invention, and eleven years after AT...iled an FCC tariff prohibiting its use, Mr. Carter had won access to the markets with the assistance of the sector regulator.  The Carterfone decision is rightly celebrated for opening up the monopoly telephone system to innovative new equipment. But consider that it took Tom Carter three years to win that result through a proceeding at the FCC, eleven years after the tariff was filed. Do you see what I mean about regulatory lag? Think about all the inventors and innovators who were not so persistent and who just never bothered in the decades prior. Even as Carterfone demonstrates the benefits of regulation when it produces a competitive result, it also exemplifies its pitfalls.\u00a0 Indeed, compare what Apple and Steve Jobs did as they developed the iPhone in 2007. In a competitive U.S. wireless market, he was able to find a launch partner with AT...which sought exclusive access to the device in order to gain a competitive advantage. The rest, as they say, is history.\u00a0 It is remarkable to think that if Apple's iPhone had followed the same path to the market that the Carterfone did, we would be looking forward to FCC action this year.\u00a0 Whereas in a regulated monopoly market, the first mobile phone took over a decade to reach the market; in a competitive wireless market, the iPhone took just a few short years. How much would consumers have lost these last ten years if the iPhone had needed to seek court or FCC intervention to change the world?\u00a0 The answer is too much. Particularly in dynamic and innovative markets, consumers do not deserve to pay the price of delay. That is why we believe in competitive markets unbridled by the reigns of regulation and behavioral dictates. Thus, as AAG Delrahim has said, we disfavor regulatory settlements and, instead, have a strong preference for structural settlements because they leave competitors and markets free to adapt and change with product availability and consumer demand.\u00a0 Our recent settlement in connection with the Bayer/Monsanto transaction is a good example of this philosophy. Any farmer will tell you that agriculture is an incredibly innovative industry. As they have for millennia, seeds like corn and cotton are undergoing constant technological development to improve their yields. Meanwhile, seed treatments that ward off insects and disease are at the forefront of agricultural innovation.\u00a0 As you know, Bayer proposed to acquire Monsanto in a $66-billion-dollar transaction. We worked with the parties to resolve all of our competition concerns with a historic divestiture. The proposed final judgment requires Bayer to divest businesses and assets valued at approximately $9 billion dollars. More importantly, none of the competitive problems, including the areas of vertical concern, were attempted to be managed using behavioral dictates.\u00a0 A few features of that settlement underscore our approach in dynamic markets. First, we undertook a thorough investigation and we were ready to litigate while also coordinating across jurisdictions. Although our friends at the EC were also working on their own review, we worked closely with them to coordinate our remedies.  Most importantly, the relief we obtained is purely structural. Bayer has agreed to divest itself of all of the businesses and assets needed to fully address both our horizontal and our vertical concerns with the transaction. While there are temporary commitments in place to effectuate the divestiture, it is important to note that they are a means to support the structural relief we obtained. After those transition commitments have passed, the market structure obtained in the settlement will remain, and throughout it will remain flexible to innovation and evolution in the industry.  We have also included in the Bayer/Monsanto settlement a number of new provisions to allow for more effective enforcement of the decree. Along with enforcement provisions that have been in all of our recent settlements, we have also added a new provision regarding the interpretation of the decree, which we intend to include in all decrees going forward.\u00a0 That emphasis on structural solutions to structural problems is particularly important in dynamic industries like agriculture and communications. When new technologies and modes of doing business are rapidly evolving, how can static behavioral commitments meaningfully solve competitive problems? Equally concerning, how can we write behavioral commitments that do not themselves risk hindering innovation and investment? As AAG Delrahim explained in a speech last November, regulatory remedies fall short by attempting 'static solutions to the realities of dynamic markets.' In dynamic industries especially, antitrust remedies should preserve the flexibility of competitively structured free markets, unconstrained by regulation.\u00a0 With that background in mind, let me turn to some of the specific topics we will be discussing the next two days. First, wireless. We have come a long way from Marconi's radio and the Carterfone, and even from the introduction of the iPhone. Mobile wireless network infrastructure has become a crucial component of any advanced society.\u00a0 According to GSMA, Europe and the US have the highest levels of mobile user engagement in the world. Just to give you a sense of the scope the US has 400 million wireless subscribers; that's more subscribers than the entire US population. Meanwhile, in Europe, there are 456 million mobile subscribers that is over 84% of the population.\u00a0 Mobile wireless is critical to both economies. Wireless services alone generate $189 billion in annual revenue, and devices add to that another $84 billion. And that is just the services themselves, with trillions of dollars in commerce flowing over the networks. Millions upon millions of jobs are supported by wireless infrastructure.\u00a0 Yet demand continues to grow. In tomorrow's economy, not only will each individual be 'connected' but most consumer products will be as well. Already, a connected carbon monoxide detector can save lives by turning off a home's furnace when it senses danger. The possibilities to add value to people's lives through further device interconnectivity on the Internet of Things is enormous. As more and more devices connect and machine learning technologies provide greater uses for that connectivity, demand will likely continue to increase at an enormous rate.\u00a0 Some claim that 5G technologies appear poised to meet that increasing demand; that they represent a leap forward in capabilities. We may, some argue, see speeds ten times faster than LTE, or more, alongside lower latency and greater security.\u00a0 What does that mean for competition enforcement? As in medicine, first, we should do no harm. With companies and infrastructure developers rapidly innovating and testing new models, we should be wary of trying to prescribe the correct path forward. Free market competition provides the best means by which to test and to hone the emerging wireless networks to provide a platform for tomorrow's economy. Just as we hope to let free market competition play out, however, we should avoid market structures that require regulatory intervention. I doubt anyone desires a return to the days of a regulated monopoly provider that can exclude new equipment like the Carterfone. Wherever the 5G evolution takes us, I hope we can agree that a competitive market, not a regulated one, is our goal. It is certainly a priority of the Antitrust Division to push for policies that promote the development of   and competition in   5G technologies.  Another item on the agenda for this conference is big tech, and how we should be thinking about competition among large tech players and in emerging virtual markets. Indeed, these topics have been on the agenda for many events this year. People around the world are thinking hard about the development of massive online platforms and aggregators that generate tremendous network effects. How do we maintain the value they deliver to consumers at the same time as we use antitrust enforcement to police the competition in their industries?\u00a0 A few key points to bear in mind. First, the Antitrust Division has active matters in this area as well. We expect a decision any day from the United States Supreme Court on our American Express case. After a lengthy trial, the district court found that American Express restrained competition on the merchant side of its platform the market in which credit card networks compete for the business of merchants. The Supreme Court is now considering an appeal from that decision that asks what consideration should be given the other side of the platform. Whatever it decides, its ruling will likely impact how we think about antitrust enforcement for platform businesses.\u00a0 We should also base enforcement decisions, as always, on evidence and sound economics. The bigness of technology companies as a general matter, or their success in delivering value to consumers, is not alone a basis for antitrust enforcement action. Competition enforcers should act only when an evidence-based assessment suggests antitrust enforcement will prevent real consumer harms. Also, there is a great deal of debate around so-called 'big tech,' but with these relatively new business models it is important our understanding of their economics is sound. For example, some are discussing a framework of thinking about big tech in terms of platforms and aggregators; they believe whereas platforms connect users with content, aggregators connect with users directly and package content for them. If so, these models may imply different competitive incentives and market structures that may be relevant to competition analysis.\u00a0 Another key point is that the consumer welfare standard is flexible enough to deal with the novel kinds of competition issues presented by online platforms. Although many of these services are zero cost to consumers in a monetary sense, they do cost consumers their time and attention, and oftentimes their data and other information about them. Revealed preferences suggest that consumers place value on their data such that its use forms a dimension of platform competition. Applying a consumer welfare standard through this lens, the antitrust laws are up to the task of analyzing platform industries. The Antitrust Division has also prioritized competition in video delivery, as exemplified by our recent enforcement action against the vertical merger of AT...nd Time Warner. We expect a decision from the court tomorrow, so I will not comment on the case. Vertical issues in telecommunications typically arise from gatekeeper power the power to affect or control access to a market. In the case of video distribution, this concern arises as Internet disruption threatens to challenge profits that industry incumbents have long enjoyed. We have sought, in a number of past cases, to prevent the harms that arise from aligning the incumbents' incentive to delay disruptive competition with the ability to do so.  Our Bayer/Monsanto remedy addresses a version of this concern. It requires the structural divestiture of certain important Bayer seed treatment product lines to remedy the competitive harm that would result from the vertical integration of those lines with Monsanto's leading seed business. Bayer has critical seed treatments products, and so the merger would have given it the incentive and ability to raise prices that Monsanto's rival seed companies pay for those treatments, ultimately raising prices for farmers.\u00a0 By requiring the divestiture of Bayer's seed treatment businesses, we eliminate the incentive and ability to increase prices to Monsanto's rivals. A behavioral remedy, in contrast, would have attempted to dictate the terms on which Bayer sells those seed treatments, even as they undergo continued development and innovation in the years to come. We chose a free market solution over a regulatory one.\u00a0 An important benefit of structural settlements is that they solve, for good, the competitive problem resulting from the merger. Behavioral commitments, meanwhile, attempt temporary solutions. Many celebrated the Comcast/NBCU settlement conditions back when that merger went forward in 2011. Those conditions expire on September 1, 2018. When we wake up on September 2, the merger will be here; the final judgment will not. Presumably, either all of the adverse effects the final judgment was intended to address have been solved, or not. While I want to be clear not to comment on Comcast/NBCU, more generally, it is our concern about the 'or not' world that compels our strong preference for structural fixes to structural problems. The end result of these regulatory fixes, unfortunately, can be markets that simply beg for more regulation. Some have said that the answer to expiring behavioral remedies is to extend them. Instead of five or seven 7 years, maybe behavioral decrees should be ten or fifteen years, or longer; although a decree that is too long may be just as stifling as one that is too short. Others have said the answer is to impose new sector regulations to fill the gaps. All of those suggestions, however, miss the point of antitrust enforcement as a law enforcement regime. The reason we favor structural relief is because we believe competition, not human dictates, is the best vehicle for promoting consumer welfare. Using antitrust law to impose yet more regulations is counterproductive and distorts incentives to innovate.  Let me conclude by acknowledging how fortunate we are. We live in a time of tremendous potential and rapid change. As consumers, that gives us much to look forward to; as enforcers, it gives us much to think about. The reason competition enforcement has proven time and time again it is up to the challenge of fast changing markets, is that it has benefitted from a vibrant community of academics, enforcers, and practitioners, thinking through the hard issues as they arise. Now, it is time to do our part. I look forward to an interesting discussion over these next two days.\u00a0 Thank you. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FEDBLG-USGFDAGFDAG10B91293181528754463069251764900065</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FDAG10B9-129318</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SJ4-8FR1-JB5Y-N3FM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">405244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3938\"/><timeReceived>10:01 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Federal NewsFeed <br/>Justice Department News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"06\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>June 11, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

I appreciate the opportunity to open this conference on competition in the fast-changing and dynamic communications industry.   So, my first question for you this morning is, \u201cAre you ready?\u201d That\u2019s what the famous Italian inventor Guglielmo Marconi asked with the first radio broadcast over water, on May 13, 1897. After inventing what was then \u201ccutting edge\u201d radio technology here in Italy, Marconi sent that message across the Bristol Channel in England; soon after that he was sending messages across the Atlantic. Tapped out in Morse code, it said: \u201cAre you ready?</p><p>\u201d This was followed by: \u201cCan you hear me?\u201d And, the reply: \u201cYes, loud and clear.\u201d Wireless communications was born.  The world, of course, has never been fully ready for the many incredible advancements radio communications have enabled. But, it has been more than eager to embrace them. For over a century, since that first radio broadcast across the Bristol Channel, the communications industry has been marked by constant innovation. It\u2019s a dynamic industry that has delivered enormous value to consumers, starting here, in the birthplace of wireless communications, to countries around the world.    Makan Delrahim, the Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust at the United States Department of Justice, spoke in Rome a few weeks ago. He recalled the epithet that \u201call roads lead to Rome,\u201d and the power of network effects on display in the Roman Empire. Today\u2019s conference topics are built on the power of network effects\u2014how they deliver value to markets, and how they can hinder the competitive process.  Indeed, with the development of advanced networks and the Internet of Things, we are entering a world of ubiquitous connectivity. Instead of \u201call roads lead to Rome,\u201d a more descriptive epithet for our time is \u201call roads lead to everywhere and everything\u201d or, maybe, \u201call roads lead to all roads.\u201d  The ongoing development of wireless communications that Marconi helped advance, and eventually commercialize, has forever changed our world. There are now network connections and wireless signals crisscrossing the globe. This city of Milan and my home in Washington, D.C. no longer seem quite so far apart.   In fact, I can hold up my smartphone from this podium and see if I have any text messages from distant Nigro family relatives in San Fele, Italy, or obtain critical, time sensitive information, such as a picture of the Italian Caprese avocado toast my daughter ate for breakfast today.   In the modern era, however, it is also so much more than simply sending messages. In the last century, telecommunications was one of the most important industries in every economy in the world. It was how people and businesses shared information in real time. In the next century, however, many industries will rely on telecommunications not just to communicate, but as an integral part of the services their customers\u2019 desire. Telecom is rapidly evolving from being a means of communication to providing the platform on which other industries operate.   Consider Amazon or Uber in the United States. Retail businesses and transportation services once stood beside communications providers as pillars of industry. Now, retail and transportation depend on communications not just to do business more expeditiously, but as part of the service itself. Telecom is quickly becoming inextricably intertwined with many other industries and changing the way we do business; it is restructuring entire industries.   Throughout the decades since Marconi first sent his message, we have seen that innovation and consumer welfare are best served by competition and competitive markets. When the pace of innovation is stifled by external controls, be they unnecessary regulations or monopolists, consumers suffer. That is what I would like to talk about today \u2013 our responsibility as Department of Justice officials to enforce the antitrust laws through effective law enforcement, rather than unnecessary regulation. Regulated markets tend to react more slowly to the rapid changes that are the lifeblood of dynamic industries such as communications. In contrast, by preserving competition through effective antitrust enforcement, markets and competitors are free to embrace innovation at the pace of invention, unconstrained by the reigns of a regulator.   I\u2019ll begin my remarks by talking about some general principles of antitrust enforcement and remedies in dynamic industries, before touching on a few of the key topics that will be the focus of the panels the next two days.   The United States\u2019 first federal antitrust law, the Sherman Antitrust Act, was passed in 1890, seven years before Marconi sent that message asking: \u201cAre you ready?\u201d When it came to having a tool to maintain competitive markets, the country was ready\u2014it had in place a law enforcement regime designed to protect competition and competitive markets.   We also had much to learn in those early days. The drafters of the Sherman Act did not understand key market concepts in communications like network effects and gatekeeper power, or economic concepts like HHIs and Upward Pricing Pressure. They, however, endorsed a law enforcement regime, rather than a regulatory regime, which proved wise\u2014they lacked the depth of thinking that we do about the features of communications markets that can sometimes make them conducive to competitive problems. But, they did understand there were dangers from the misuse of corporate power, even as they were hesitant to interpose governmental authority over free enterprise. We are wrestling with the same tension today.   In resolving that tension, let us be clear about the proper role of the government in dynamic industries. We are not inventors; I know I am certainly not, which is why I am here speaking to you today. We do not develop new technologies. Nor do we provide incubators for inventors\u2014that is what free and competitive markets do. Our job is to use law enforcement to protect those free markets and competition, to the benefit of consumers, innovators, and the economy as a whole. At our best, we protect the environment in which the modern-day Marconis have reason and opportunity to tinker, invent and invest to bring new technologies to market.   That is precisely the intuition underlying this Antitrust Division\u2019 approach to merger settlements. Mergers change market structures. The question for us is whether the change is good or bad for consumers. When anticompetitive harm results from changes in market structure, attempting to wrestle the firm to behave in a way that we think replicates a competitive outcome makes no sense, even assuming we can guess what the competitive outcome would be, or should be, absent the merger. A problem caused by a structural change requires a structural fix. It is not our job as law enforcers to use our power to approve transactions as an opportunity to step in and order the firm to adhere to certain dictates. Regulatory restrictions and dynamic markets do not mix well.   That is our guiding principle: whenever feasible, competition, as maintained through effective antitrust enforcement, is preferable to regulation. Competitive markets dynamically weigh risk and reward, support investment, and pivot to new innovation. Regulation, in contrast, is rigid and tends to be slow moving\u2014lagging both competitive problems and new innovations. The literature describes as \u201cregulatory lag\u201d the delay between changes in market conditions or technology and the adjustment of regulations based on those factors. Particularly when attempting to regulate access to markets as a solution to a competitively problematic market structure, regulation and its resulting lags will typically mean delayed entry, expansion, or innovation.    A story from communications law history underscores the point. In the 1950s, a Texas rancher and inventor thought there should be a way to make and receive a phone call while riding a horse or tending to an oil field. So, Thomas F. Carter set out to build a device to attach to his telephone, then on AT&amp;T\u2019s monopoly network, that would use radio signals to transmit out in the field. In many ways, his invention, the Carterfone, was the first mobile phone.   AT&amp;T was then a nationwide telephone monopolist in the United States, and it sought to block the Carterfone. At the time, its equipment business, Western Electric, was vertically integrated with its telephone system, and naturally fought innovators who tried to develop new equipment.   Moreover, AT&amp;T had the assistance of FCC regulation, using a tariff filed with the FCC in 1957 to prohibit interconnection of non-AT&amp;T equipment like the Carterfone. So AT&amp;T was able to employ an FCC tariff to block the Carterfone.   Carter eventually turned to legal action. He filed suit in federal court in 1965, but that case was dismissed. So nearly a decade after first attempting to bring his invention to market, in 1966 the industry regulator, the FCC, undertook an inquiry into the effect of its own rules. Two and a half years later, the FCC issued its famous 1968 Carterfone decision, insisting that AT&amp;T permit the attachment of devices like Mr. Carter\u2019s to the telephone network.   There we see the belated benefits of regulation. Over a decade after its invention, and eleven years after AT&amp;T filed an FCC tariff prohibiting its use, Mr. Carter had won access to the markets with the assistance of the sector regulator.    The Carterfone decision is rightly celebrated for opening up the monopoly telephone system to innovative new equipment. But consider that it took Tom Carter three years to win that result through a proceeding at the FCC, eleven years after the tariff was filed. Do you see what I mean about regulatory lag? Think about all the inventors and innovators who were not so persistent and who just never bothered in the decades prior. Even as Carterfone demonstrates the benefits of regulation when it produces a competitive result, it also exemplifies its pitfalls.   Indeed, compare what Apple and Steve Jobs did as they developed the iPhone in 2007. In a competitive U.S. wireless market, he was able to find a launch partner with AT&amp;T, which sought exclusive access to the device in order to gain a competitive advantage. The rest, as they say, is history.   It is remarkable to think that if Apple\u2019s iPhone had followed the same path to the market that the Carterfone did, we would be looking forward to FCC action this year.   Whereas in a regulated monopoly market, the first mobile phone took over a decade to reach the market; in a competitive wireless market, the iPhone took just a few short years. How much would consumers have lost these last ten years if the iPhone had needed to seek court or FCC intervention to change the world?   The answer is too much. Particularly in dynamic and innovative markets, consumers do not deserve to pay the price of delay. That is why we believe in competitive markets unbridled by the reigns of regulation and behavioral dictates. Thus, as AAG Delrahim has said, we disfavor regulatory settlements and, instead, have a strong preference for structural settlements because they leave competitors and markets free to adapt and change with product availability and consumer demand.   Our recent settlement in connection with the Bayer/Monsanto transaction is a good example of this philosophy. Any farmer will tell you that agriculture is an incredibly innovative industry. As they have for millennia, seeds like corn and cotton are undergoing constant technological development to improve their yields. Meanwhile, seed treatments that ward off insects and disease are at the forefront of agricultural innovation.   As you know, Bayer proposed to acquire Monsanto in a $66-billion-dollar transaction. We worked with the parties to resolve all of our competition concerns with a historic divestiture. The proposed final judgment requires Bayer to divest businesses and assets valued at approximately $9 billion dollars. More importantly, none of the competitive problems, including the areas of vertical concern, were attempted to be managed using behavioral dictates.   A few features of that settlement underscore our approach in dynamic markets. First, we undertook a thorough investigation and we were ready to litigate while also coordinating across jurisdictions. Although our friends at the EC were also working on their own review, we worked closely with them to coordinate our remedies.    Most importantly, the relief we obtained is purely structural. Bayer has agreed to divest itself of all of the businesses and assets needed to fully address both our horizontal and our vertical concerns with the transaction. While there are temporary commitments in place to effectuate the divestiture, it is important to note that they are a means to support the structural relief we obtained. After those transition commitments have passed, the market structure obtained in the settlement will remain, and throughout it will remain flexible to innovation and evolution in the industry.    We have also included in the Bayer/Monsanto settlement a number of new provisions to allow for more effective enforcement of the decree. Along with enforcement provisions that have been in all of our recent settlements, we have also added a new provision regarding the interpretation of the decree, which we intend to include in all decrees going forward.   That emphasis on structural solutions to structural problems is particularly important in dynamic industries like agriculture and communications. When new technologies and modes of doing business are rapidly evolving, how can static behavioral commitments meaningfully solve competitive problems? Equally concerning, how can we write behavioral commitments that do not themselves risk hindering innovation and investment? As AAG Delrahim explained in a speech last November, regulatory remedies fall short by attempting \u201cstatic solutions to the realities of dynamic markets.\u201d In dynamic industries especially, antitrust remedies should preserve the flexibility of competitively structured free markets, unconstrained by regulation.   With that background in mind, let me turn to some of the specific topics we will be discussing the next two days.  First, wireless. We have come a long way from Marconi\u2019s radio and the Carterfone, and even from the introduction of the iPhone. Mobile wireless network infrastructure has become a crucial component of any advanced society.   According to GSMA, Europe and the US have the highest levels of mobile user engagement in the world. Just to give you a sense of the scope\u2014the US has 400 million wireless subscribers; that\u2019s more subscribers than the entire US population. Meanwhile, in Europe, there are 456 million mobile subscribers\u2014that is over 84% of the population.   Mobile wireless is critical to both economies. Wireless services alone generate $189 billion in annual revenue, and devices add to that another $84 billion. And that is just the services themselves, with trillions of dollars in commerce flowing over the networks. Millions upon millions of jobs are supported by wireless infrastructure.   Yet demand continues to grow. In tomorrow\u2019s economy, not only will each individual be \u201cconnected\u201d but most consumer products will be as well. Already, a connected carbon monoxide detector can save lives by turning off a home\u2019s furnace when it senses danger. The possibilities to add value to people\u2019s lives through further device interconnectivity on the Internet of Things is enormous. As more and more devices connect and machine learning technologies provide greater uses for that connectivity, demand will likely continue to increase at an enormous rate.   Some claim that 5G technologies appear poised to meet that increasing demand; that they represent a leap forward in capabilities. We may, some argue, see speeds ten times faster than LTE, or more, alongside lower latency and greater security.   What does that mean for competition enforcement? As in medicine, first, we should do no harm. With companies and infrastructure developers rapidly innovating and testing new models, we should be wary of trying to prescribe the correct path forward. Free market competition provides the best means by which to test and to hone the emerging wireless networks to provide a platform for tomorrow\u2019s economy.  Just as we hope to let free market competition play out, however, we should avoid market structures that require regulatory intervention. I doubt anyone desires a return to the days of a regulated monopoly provider that can exclude new equipment like the Carterfone. Wherever the 5G evolution takes us, I hope we can agree that a competitive market, not a regulated one, is our goal. It is certainly a priority of the Antitrust Division to push for policies that promote the development of \u2014 and competition in \u2014 5G technologies.     Another item on the agenda for this conference is big tech, and how we should be thinking about competition among large tech players and in emerging virtual markets. Indeed, these topics have been on the agenda for many events this year. People around the world are thinking hard about the development of massive online platforms and aggregators that generate tremendous network effects. How do we maintain the value they deliver to consumers at the same time as we use antitrust enforcement to police the competition in their industries?   A few key points to bear in mind. First, the Antitrust Division has active matters in this area as well. We expect a decision any day from the United States Supreme Court on our American Express case. After a lengthy trial, the district court found that American Express restrained competition on the merchant side of its platform\u2014the market in which credit card networks compete for the business of merchants. The Supreme Court is now considering an appeal from that decision that asks what consideration should be given the other side of the platform. Whatever it decides, its ruling will likely impact how we think about antitrust enforcement for platform businesses.   We should also base enforcement decisions, as always, on evidence and sound economics. The bigness of technology companies as a general matter, or their success in delivering value to consumers, is not alone a basis for antitrust enforcement action. Competition enforcers should act only when an evidence-based assessment suggests antitrust enforcement will prevent real consumer harms. Also, there is a great deal of debate around so-called \u201cbig tech,\u201d but with these relatively new business models it is important our understanding of their economics is sound. For example, some are discussing a framework of thinking about big tech in terms of platforms and aggregators; they believe whereas platforms connect users with content, aggregators connect with users directly and package content for them. If so, these models may imply different competitive incentives and market structures that may be relevant to competition analysis.   Another key point is that the consumer welfare standard is flexible enough to deal with the novel kinds of competition issues presented by online platforms. Although many of these services are zero cost to consumers in a monetary sense, they do cost consumers their time and attention, and oftentimes their data and other information about them. Revealed preferences suggest that consumers place value on their data such that its use forms a dimension of platform competition. Applying a consumer welfare standard through this lens, the antitrust laws are up to the task of analyzing platform industries.  The Antitrust Division has also prioritized competition in video delivery, as exemplified by our recent enforcement action against the vertical merger of AT&amp;T and Time Warner. We expect a decision from the court tomorrow, so I will not comment on the case.  Vertical issues in telecommunications typically arise from gatekeeper power\u2014the power to affect or control access to a market. In the case of video distribution, this concern arises as Internet disruption threatens to challenge profits that industry incumbents have long enjoyed. We have sought, in a number of past cases, to prevent the harms that arise from aligning the incumbents\u2019 incentive to delay disruptive competition with the ability to do so.    Our Bayer/Monsanto remedy addresses a version of this concern. It requires the structural divestiture of certain important Bayer seed treatment product lines to remedy the competitive harm that would result from the vertical integration of those lines with Monsanto\u2019s leading seed business. Bayer has critical seed treatments products, and so the merger would have given it the incentive and ability to raise prices that Monsanto\u2019s rival seed companies pay for those treatments, ultimately raising prices for farmers.   By requiring the divestiture of Bayer\u2019s seed treatment businesses, we eliminate the incentive and ability to increase prices to Monsanto\u2019s rivals. A behavioral remedy, in contrast, would have attempted to dictate the terms on which Bayer sells those seed treatments, even as they undergo continued development and innovation in the years to come. We chose a free market solution over a regulatory one.   An important benefit of structural settlements is that they solve, for good, the competitive problem resulting from the merger. Behavioral commitments, meanwhile, attempt temporary solutions. Many celebrated the Comcast/NBCU settlement conditions back when that merger went forward in 2011. Those conditions expire on September 1, 2018. When we wake up on September 2, the merger will be here; the final judgment will not. Presumably, either all of the adverse effects the final judgment was intended to address have been solved, or not. While I want to be clear not to comment on Comcast/NBCU, more generally, it is our concern about the \u201cor not\u201d world that compels our strong preference for structural fixes to structural problems.  The end result of these regulatory fixes, unfortunately, can be markets that simply beg for more regulation. Some have said that the answer to expiring behavioral remedies is to extend them. Instead of five or seven 7 years, maybe behavioral decrees should be ten or fifteen years, or longer; although a decree that is too long may be just as stifling as one that is too short. Others have said the answer is to impose new sector regulations to fill the gaps. All of those suggestions, however, miss the point of antitrust enforcement as a law enforcement regime. The reason we favor structural relief is because we believe competition, not human dictates, is the best vehicle for promoting consumer welfare. Using antitrust law to impose yet more regulations is counterproductive and distorts incentives to innovate.    Let me conclude by acknowledging how fortunate we are. We live in a time of tremendous potential and rapid change. As consumers, that gives us much to look forward to; as enforcers, it gives us much to think about. The reason competition enforcement has proven time and time again it is up to the challenge of fast changing markets, is that it has benefitted from a vibrant community of academics, enforcers, and practitioners, thinking through the hard issues as they arise.

I appreciate the opportunity to open this conference on competition in the fast-changing and dynamic communications industry.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So, my first question for you this morning is, \"Are you ready?\" That's what the famous Italian inventor Guglielmo Marconi asked with the first radio broadcast over water, on May 13, 1897. After inventing what was then \"cutting edge\" radio technology here in Italy, Marconi sent that message across the Bristol Channel in England; soon after that he was sending messages across the Atlantic. Tapped out in Morse code, it said: \"Are you ready?\" This was followed by: \"Can you hear me?\" And, the reply: \"Yes, loud and clear.\" Wireless communications was born.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The world, of course, has never been fully ready for the many incredible advancements radio communications have enabled. But, it has been more than eager to embrace them. For over a century, since that first radio broadcast across the Bristol Channel, the communications industry has been marked by constant innovation. It's a dynamic industry that has delivered enormous value to consumers, starting here, in the birthplace of wireless communications, to countries around the world.</p><p>Makan Delrahim, the Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust at the United States Department of Justice, spoke in Rome a few weeks ago. He recalled the epithet that \"all roads lead to Rome,\" and the power of network effects on display in the Roman Empire. Today's conference topics are built on the power of network effectshow they deliver value to markets, and how they can hinder the competitive process.</p><p>Indeed, with the development of advanced networks and the Internet of Things, we are entering a world of ubiquitous connectivity. Instead of \"all roads lead to Rome,\" a more descriptive epithet for our time is \"all roads lead to everywhere and everything\" or, maybe, \"all roads lead to all roads.\"</p><p>The ongoing development of wireless communications that Marconi helped advance, and eventually commercialize, has forever changed our world. There are now network connections and wireless signals crisscrossing the globe. This city of Milan and my home in Washington, D.C. no longer seem quite so far apart.</p><p>In fact, I can hold up my smartphone from this podium and see if I have any text messages from distant Nigro family relatives in San Fele, Italy, or obtain critical, time sensitive information, such as a picture of the Italian Caprese avocado toast my daughter ate for breakfast today.</p><p>In the modern era, however, it is also so much more than simply sending messages. In the last century, telecommunications was one of the most important industries in every economy in the world. It was how people and businesses shared information in real time. In the next century, however, many industries will rely on telecommunications not just to communicate, but as an integral part of the services their customers' desire. Telecom is rapidly evolving from being a means of communication to providing the platform on which other industries operate.</p><p>Consider Amazon or Uber in the United States. Retail businesses and transportation services once stood beside communications providers as pillars of industry. Now, retail and transportation depend on communications not just to do business more expeditiously, but as part of the service itself. Telecom is quickly becoming inextricably intertwined with many other industries and changing the way we do business; it is restructuring entire industries.</p><p>Throughout the decades since Marconi first sent his message, we have seen that innovation and consumer welfare are best served by competition and competitive markets. When the pace of innovation is stifled by external controls, be they unnecessary regulations or monopolists, consumers suffer. That is what I would like to talk about today our responsibility as Department of Justice officials to enforce the antitrust laws through effective law enforcement, rather than unnecessary regulation. Regulated markets tend to react more slowly to the rapid changes that are the lifeblood of dynamic industries such as communications. In contrast, by preserving competition through effective antitrust enforcement, markets and competitors are free to embrace innovation at the pace of invention, unconstrained by the reigns of a regulator.</p><p>I'll begin my remarks by talking about some general principles of antitrust enforcement and remedies in dynamic industries, before touching on a few of the key topics that will be the focus of the panels the next two days.</p><p>The United States' first federal antitrust law, the Sherman Antitrust Act, was passed in 1890, seven years before Marconi sent that message asking: \"Are you ready?\" When it came to having a tool to maintain competitive markets, the country was readyit had in place a law enforcement regime designed to protect competition and competitive markets.</p><p>We also had much to learn in those early days. The drafters of the Sherman Act did not understand key market concepts in communications like network effects and gatekeeper power, or economic concepts like HHIs and Upward Pricing Pressure. They, however, endorsed a law enforcement regime, rather than a regulatory regime, which proved wisethey lacked the depth of thinking that we do about the features of communications markets that can sometimes make them conducive to competitive problems. But, they did understand there were dangers from the misuse of corporate power, even as they were hesitant to interpose governmental authority over free enterprise. We are wrestling with the same tension today.</p><p>In resolving that tension, let us be clear about the proper role of the government in dynamic industries. We are not inventors; I know I am certainly not, which is why I am here speaking to you today. We do not develop new technologies. Nor do we provide incubators for inventorsthat is what free and competitive markets do. Our job is to use law enforcement to protect those free markets and competition, to the benefit of consumers, innovators, and the economy as a whole. At our best, we protect the environment in which the modern-day Marconis have reason and opportunity to tinker, invent and invest to bring new technologies to market.</p><p>That is precisely the intuition underlying this Antitrust Division' approach to merger settlements. Mergers change market structures. The question for us is whether the change is good or bad for consumers. When anticompetitive harm results from changes in market structure, attempting to wrestle the firm to behave in a way that we think replicates a competitive outcome makes no sense, even assuming we can guess what the competitive outcome would be, or should be, absent the merger. A problem caused by a structural change requires a structural fix. It is not our job as law enforcers to use our power to approve transactions as an opportunity to step in and order the firm to adhere to certain dictates. Regulatory restrictions and dynamic markets do not mix well.</p><p>That is our guiding principle: whenever feasible, competition, as maintained through effective antitrust enforcement, is preferable to regulation. Competitive markets dynamically weigh risk and reward, support investment, and pivot to new innovation. Regulation, in contrast, is rigid and tends to be slow movinglagging both competitive problems and new innovations. The literature describes as \"regulatory lag\" the delay between changes in market conditions or technology and the adjustment of regulations based on those factors. Particularly when attempting to regulate access to markets as a solution to a competitively problematic market structure, regulation and its resulting lags will typically mean delayed entry, expansion, or innovation.</p><p>A story from communications law history underscores the point. In the 1950s, a Texas rancher and inventor thought there should be a way to make and receive a phone call while riding a horse or tending to an oil field. So, Thomas F. Carter set out to build a device to attach to his telephone, then on ATandT's monopoly network, that would use radio signals to transmit out in the field. In many ways, his invention, the Carterfone, was the first mobile phone.</p><p>ATandT was then a nationwide telephone monopolist in the United States, and it sought to block the Carterfone. At the time, its equipment business, Western Electric, was vertically integrated with its telephone system, and naturally fought innovators who tried to develop new equipment.</p><p>Moreover, ATandT had the assistance of FCC regulation, using a tariff filed with the FCC in 1957 to prohibit interconnection of non-ATandT equipment like the Carterfone. So ATandT was able to employ an FCC tariff to block the Carterfone.</p><p>Carter eventually turned to legal action. He filed suit in federal court in 1965, but that case was dismissed. So nearly a decade after first attempting to bring his invention to market, in 1966 the industry regulator, the FCC, undertook an inquiry into the effect of its own rules. Two and a half years later, the FCC issued its famous 1968 Carterfone decision, insisting that ATandT permit the attachment of devices like Mr. Carter's to the telephone network.</p><p>There we see the belated benefits of regulation. Over a decade after its invention, and eleven years after ATandT filed an FCC tariff prohibiting its use, Mr. Carter had won access to the markets with the assistance of the sector regulator.</p><p>The Carterfone decision is rightly celebrated for opening up the monopoly telephone system to innovative new equipment. But consider that it took Tom Carter three years to win that result through a proceeding at the FCC, eleven years after the tariff was filed. Do you see what I mean about regulatory lag? Think about all the inventors and innovators who were not so persistent and who just never bothered in the decades prior. Even as Carterfone demonstrates the benefits of regulation when it produces a competitive result, it also exemplifies its pitfalls.</p><p>Indeed, compare what Apple and Steve Jobs did as they developed the iPhone in 2007. In a competitive U.S. wireless market, he was able to find a launch partner with ATandT, which sought exclusive access to the device in order to gain a competitive advantage. The rest, as they say, is history.</p><p>It is remarkable to think that if Apple's iPhone had followed the same path to the market that the Carterfone did, we would be looking forward to FCC action this year.</p><p>Whereas in a regulated monopoly market, the first mobile phone took over a decade to reach the market; in a competitive wireless market, the iPhone took just a few short years. How much would consumers have lost these last ten years if the iPhone had needed to seek court or FCC intervention to change the world?</p><p>The answer is too much. Particularly in dynamic and innovative markets, consumers do not deserve to pay the price of delay. That is why we believe in competitive markets unbridled by the reigns of regulation and behavioral dictates. Thus, as AAG Delrahim has said, we disfavor regulatory settlements and, instead, have a strong preference for structural settlements because they leave competitors and markets free to adapt and change with product availability and consumer demand.</p><p>Our recent settlement in connection with the Bayer/Monsanto transaction is a good example of this philosophy. Any farmer will tell you that agriculture is an incredibly innovative industry. As they have for millennia, seeds like corn and cotton are undergoing constant technological development to improve their yields. Meanwhile, seed treatments that ward off insects and disease are at the forefront of agricultural innovation.</p><p>As you know, Bayer proposed to acquire Monsanto in a $66-billion-dollar transaction. We worked with the parties to resolve all of our competition concerns with a historic divestiture. The proposed final judgment requires Bayer to divest businesses and assets valued at approximately $9 billion dollars. More importantly, none of the competitive problems, including the areas of vertical concern, were attempted to be managed using behavioral dictates.</p><p>A few features of that settlement underscore our approach in dynamic markets. First, we undertook a thorough investigation and we were ready to litigate while also coordinating across jurisdictions. Although our friends at the EC were also working on their own review, we worked closely with them to coordinate our remedies.</p><p>Most importantly, the relief we obtained is purely structural. Bayer has agreed to divest itself of all of the businesses and assets needed to fully address both our horizontal and our vertical concerns with the transaction. While there are temporary commitments in place to effectuate the divestiture, it is important to note that they are a means to support the structural relief we obtained. After those transition commitments have passed, the market structure obtained in the settlement will remain, and throughout it will remain flexible to innovation and evolution in the industry.</p><p>We have also included in the Bayer/Monsanto settlement a number of new provisions to allow for more effective enforcement of the decree. Along with enforcement provisions that have been in all of our recent settlements, we have also added a new provision regarding the interpretation of the decree, which we intend to include in all decrees going forward.</p><p>That emphasis on structural solutions to structural problems is particularly important in dynamic industries like agriculture and communications. When new technologies and modes of doing business are rapidly evolving, how can static behavioral commitments meaningfully solve competitive problems? Equally concerning, how can we write behavioral commitments that do not themselves risk hindering innovation and investment? As AAG Delrahim explained in a speech last November, regulatory remedies fall short by attempting \"static solutions to the realities of dynamic markets.\" In dynamic industries especially, antitrust remedies should preserve the flexibility of competitively structured free markets, unconstrained by regulation.</p><p>With that background in mind, let me turn to some of the specific topics we will be discussing the next two days.</p><p>First, wireless. We have come a long way from Marconi's radio and the Carterfone, and even from the introduction of the iPhone. Mobile wireless network infrastructure has become a crucial component of any advanced society.</p><p>According to GSMA, Europe and the US have the highest levels of mobile user engagement in the world. Just to give you a sense of the scopethe US has 400 million wireless subscribers; that's more subscribers than the entire US population. Meanwhile, in Europe, there are 456 million mobile subscribersthat is over 84% of the population.</p><p>Mobile wireless is critical to both economies. Wireless services alone generate $189 billion in annual revenue, and devices add to that another $84 billion. And that is just the services themselves, with trillions of dollars in commerce flowing over the networks. Millions upon millions of jobs are supported by wireless infrastructure.</p><p>Yet demand continues to grow. In tomorrow's economy, not only will each individual be \"connected\" but most consumer products will be as well. Already, a connected carbon monoxide detector can save lives by turning off a home's furnace when it senses danger. The possibilities to add value to people's lives through further device interconnectivity on the Internet of Things is enormous. As more and more devices connect and machine learning technologies provide greater uses for that connectivity, demand will likely continue to increase at an enormous rate.</p><p>Some claim that 5G technologies appear poised to meet that increasing demand; that they represent a leap forward in capabilities. We may, some argue, see speeds ten times faster than LTE, or more, alongside lower latency and greater security.</p><p>What does that mean for competition enforcement? As in medicine, first, we should do no harm. With companies and infrastructure developers rapidly innovating and testing new models, we should be wary of trying to prescribe the correct path forward. Free market competition provides the best means by which to test and to hone the emerging wireless networks to provide a platform for tomorrow's economy.</p><p>Just as we hope to let free market competition play out, however, we should avoid market structures that require regulatory intervention. I doubt anyone desires a return to the days of a regulated monopoly provider that can exclude new equipment like the Carterfone. Wherever the 5G evolution takes us, I hope we can agree that a competitive market, not a regulated one, is our goal. It is certainly a priority of the Antitrust Division to push for policies that promote the development of and competition in 5G technologies.</p><p>Another item on the agenda for this conference is big tech, and how we should be thinking about competition among large tech players and in emerging virtual markets. Indeed, these topics have been on the agenda for many events this year. People around the world are thinking hard about the development of massive online platforms and aggregators that generate tremendous network effects. How do we maintain the value they deliver to consumers at the same time as we use antitrust enforcement to police the competition in their industries?</p><p>A few key points to bear in mind. First, the Antitrust Division has active matters in this area as well. We expect a decision any day from the United States Supreme Court on our American Express case. After a lengthy trial, the district court found that American Express restrained competition on the merchant side of its platformthe market in which credit card networks compete for the business of merchants. The Supreme Court is now considering an appeal from that decision that asks what consideration should be given the other side of the platform. Whatever it decides, its ruling will likely impact how we think about antitrust enforcement for platform businesses.</p><p>We should also base enforcement decisions, as always, on evidence and sound economics. The bigness of technology companies as a general matter, or their success in delivering value to consumers, is not alone a basis for antitrust enforcement action. Competition enforcers should act only when an evidence-based assessment suggests antitrust enforcement will prevent real consumer harms. Also, there is a great deal of debate around so-called \"big tech,\" but with these relatively new business models it is important our understanding of their economics is sound. For example, some are discussing a framework of thinking about big tech in terms of platforms and aggregators; they believe whereas platforms connect users with content, aggregators connect with users directly and package content for them. If so, these models may imply different competitive incentives and market structures that may be relevant to competition analysis.</p><p>Another key point is that the consumer welfare standard is flexible enough to deal with the novel kinds of competition issues presented by online platforms. Although many of these services are zero cost to consumers in a monetary sense, they do cost consumers their time and attention, and oftentimes their data and other information about them. Revealed preferences suggest that consumers place value on their data such that its use forms a dimension of platform competition. Applying a consumer welfare standard through this lens, the antitrust laws are up to the task of analyzing platform industries.</p><p>The Antitrust Division has also prioritized competition in video delivery, as exemplified by our recent enforcement action against the vertical merger of ATandT and Time Warner. We expect a decision from the court tomorrow, so I will not comment on the case.</p><p>Vertical issues in telecommunications typically arise from gatekeeper powerthe power to affect or control access to a market. In the case of video distribution, this concern arises as Internet disruption threatens to challenge profits that industry incumbents have long enjoyed. We have sought, in a number of past cases, to prevent the harms that arise from aligning the incumbents' incentive to delay disruptive competition with the ability to do so.</p><p>Our Bayer/Monsanto remedy addresses a version of this concern. It requires the structural divestiture of certain important Bayer seed treatment product lines to remedy the competitive harm that would result from the vertical integration of those lines with Monsanto's leading seed business. Bayer has critical seed treatments products, and so the merger would have given it the incentive and ability to raise prices that Monsanto's rival seed companies pay for those treatments, ultimately raising prices for farmers.</p><p>By requiring the divestiture of Bayer's seed treatment businesses, we eliminate the incentive and ability to increase prices to Monsanto's rivals. A behavioral remedy, in contrast, would have attempted to dictate the terms on which Bayer sells those seed treatments, even as they undergo continued development and innovation in the years to come. We chose a free market solution over a regulatory one.</p><p>An important benefit of structural settlements is that they solve, for good, the competitive problem resulting from the merger. Behavioral commitments, meanwhile, attempt temporary solutions. Many celebrated the Comcast/NBCU settlement conditions back when that merger went forward in 2011. Those conditions expire on September 1, 2018. When we wake up on September 2, the merger will be here; the final judgment will not. Presumably, either all of the adverse effects the final judgment was intended to address have been solved, or not. While I want to be clear not to comment on Comcast/NBCU, more generally, it is our concern about the \"or not\" world that compels our strong preference for structural fixes to structural problems.</p><p>The end result of these regulatory fixes, unfortunately, can be markets that simply beg for more regulation. Some have said that the answer to expiring behavioral remedies is to extend them. Instead of five or seven 7 years, maybe behavioral decrees should be ten or fifteen years, or longer; although a decree that is too long may be just as stifling as one that is too short. Others have said the answer is to impose new sector regulations to fill the gaps. All of those suggestions, however, miss the point of antitrust enforcement as a law enforcement regime. The reason we favor structural relief is because we believe competition, not human dictates, is the best vehicle for promoting consumer welfare. Using antitrust law to impose yet more regulations is counterproductive and distorts incentives to innovate.</p><p>Let me conclude by acknowledging how fortunate we are. We live in a time of tremendous potential and rapid change. As consumers, that gives us much to look forward to; as enforcers, it gives us much to think about. The reason competition enforcement has proven time and time again it is up to the challenge of fast changing markets, is that it has benefitted from a vibrant community of academics, enforcers, and practitioners, thinking through the hard issues as they arise. Now, it is time to do our part. I look forward to an interesting discussion over these next two days.</p><p>Thank you.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1122147067</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SJ5-MTK1-JCBF-S556-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3925\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"06\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>June 11, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Securities Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkFFMTQ3ODhCRDYyNDkyN0IwQkEyQzRCRDlFMEM5ODc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Composition</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkM4NkI4M0M2OUEzNDY3M0E1RjhFMDM5RUNBODAxMkM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDIwQjUyMTIwMkE5NDc3Qjk5ODQyMUI1OThGMzk2OTE</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097CJ</classCode><className>JUSTICE DEPARTMENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DJQC</classCode><className>CONSUMERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000128</classCode><className>ATTORNEYS GENERAL</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001366</classCode><className>PREGNANCY &amp; CHILDBIRTH</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001881</classCode><className>WIRELESS INDUSTRY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001693</classCode><className>TELECOMMUNICATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N515000CC</classCode><className>BROADCASTING INDUSTRY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST000A075</classCode><className>TEXT MESSAGING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST000DFFC</classCode><className>INTERNET OF THINGS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST000A0Z7</classCode><className>MOBILE &amp; CELLULAR TELEPHONES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS124</classCode><className>DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, USA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GC321</classCode><className>ITALY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>GC628</classCode><className>ENGLAND</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

Zugleich \u00f6ffnet sich der Blick auf neue, lukrative Felder im digitalen Raum. Die Akteure dort schlagen jetzt die Pfl\u00f6cke ein, um sich damit die Ernte von morgen zu sichern.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Dabei ist die Handlungsgeschwindigkeit der Banken schnell und langsam zugleich. So gibt es auf der einen Seite au\u00dferhalb des Technologiesektors wohl kaum eine Branche, die sich derart fr\u00fch um den Einsatz k\u00fcnstlicher Intelligenz bem\u00fcht hat. Das macht Sinn, schlie\u00dflich ist der Finanzsektor reich an Daten und damit hervorragend geeignet f\u00fcr die Anwendung von Big-Data-Methoden und des maschinellen Lernens, um Ertr\u00e4ge zu steigern und Verluste beziehungsweise Kosten zu vermindern.</p><p>Der Umbruch ist z\u00e4h</p><p>Auf der anderen Seite gestaltet sich der Umbruch z\u00e4h, gerade in Deutschland. Die Finanzbranche bundesweit trifft er zu einem ung\u00fcnstigen Zeitpunkt, verharren die Banken doch schon seit zehn Jahren in der Defensive: Erst galt es, die selbst verursachten Flursch\u00e4den der Finanzkrise zu bew\u00e4ltigen und das eigene \u00dcberleben zu sichern, sei es auch nur dank Staatshilfe. Seither geht es darum, die Kosten von Regulierung und Zinstief wegzustecken. An die ganz gro\u00dfen W\u00fcrfe denkt man da nicht. Die Folge: W\u00e4hrend neue Wettbewerber andernorts, kleine und sehr gro\u00dfe, das Gebiet f\u00fcr den k\u00fcnftigen Wettbewerb abstecken, scheinen die hiesigen Banken und Versicherer mehr oder weniger auf ihren H\u00e4nden zu sitzen.</p><p>Im 73 Seiten starken Bericht \"Fintech: The Experience so far\", den der Internationale W\u00e4hrungsfonds (IWF) Ende Juni publizierte, findet \"Germany\" jedenfalls lediglich ein einziges Mal Erw\u00e4hnung, und dies auch nicht im Zusammenhang mit einer Initiative der Privatwirtschaft im Bankensektor, sondern vielmehr mit dem Vorhaben von Deutscher Bundesbank und Deutscher B\u00f6rse, einen Blockchain-Prototyp zu schaffen. Zum Vergleich: Das Vereinigte K\u00f6nigreich, dessen Finanzplatz London der Fintech-Branche seit Jahren den roten Teppich ausrollt, und Singapur nennt der IWF in seinem Bericht jeweils 18 Mal.</p><p>Banken in Gro\u00dfbritannien, Australien oder den USA haben freilich eher die Gr\u00f6\u00dfe, mit Investitionsbudgets zu klotzen. Wo wird der Platz von Deutschlands Finanzinstituten sein, wenn im Zuge der Automatisierung des Gesch\u00e4fts die gro\u00dfe Flurbereinigung stattgefunden hat?</p><p>Viele Optionen</p><p>K\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz ist ja beileibe nicht das einzige Feld, in welchem sich Umw\u00e4lzungen ank\u00fcndigen. Managern mit einer Affinit\u00e4t technischen Neuerungen gegen\u00fcber m\u00fcssen die Augen \u00fcbergehen angesichts der Optionen in der sch\u00f6nen neuen Welt des Banking: Schnittstellen (Application Programming Interfaces/API) lassen Software-Programme interagieren, Daten austauschen, Transaktionen ausl\u00f6sen und erm\u00f6glichen damit die Anbindung spezialisierter Dienstleister im Zahlungs- und Datenverkehr oder etwa im Kreditgesch\u00e4ft. Banken stellen auf Plattformen Marktpl\u00e4tze f\u00fcr den Vertrieb von Produkten anderer Anbieter bereit; manches Haus gr\u00fcndet sich gleich als Technologie-Plattform, auf deren offener Architektur andere Dienste aufsetzen k\u00f6nnen. Distributed Ledgers wiederum bieten die Aussicht auf erhebliche Kostensenkungen im Zahlungsverkehr und der Wertpapierabwicklung.</p><p>Mit wachsenden Kapazit\u00e4ten zur Verarbeitung gro\u00dfer Mengen von Kundendaten verbindet sich f\u00fcr Banken die Hoffnung auf eine rasante Optimierung von Risikomodellen in der Kreditvergabe. Wer es schafft, sich als Plattform-Betreiber zu etablieren, profitiert vom Google- und Youtube-Effekt: Derjenige, der den Apparat hinstellt, sch\u00f6pft finanziell den Rahm ab. Den Inhalt liefern Externe f\u00fcr lau, wenn sie nicht sogar noch daf\u00fcr zu zahlen bereit sind. Kollabierende IT-Kosten erlauben unterdessen den raschen Aufbau neuer Angebote bzw. ganzer Banken. Automatisierung hilft, die Personalkosten gerade im Bereich des Bankbetriebs und dem Kundengesch\u00e4ft nachgelagerter Bereiche zu senken. Die Schattenseiten der technologischen Umw\u00e4lzung: Das Plattform-Banking etwa birgt Risiken mit Blick auf den Verbraucherschutz, auf Cyberrisiken, auf die Finanzstabilit\u00e4t sowie die Konzentration des gesamten Sektors. Die Distributed-Ledger-Technologie ist alles andere als ausgereift, digitale W\u00e4hrungen stellen das Notenprivileg der Zentralbanken in Frage. Und \u00fcber allem schweben f\u00fcr Regulierer und Aufseher dr\u00e4ngende Fragen internationaler Kooperation, nicht zuletzt in der Geldw\u00e4schepr\u00e4vention.</p><p>Das Problem f\u00fcr die Banken: Die M\u00f6glichkeiten der Umw\u00e4lzung haben auch branchenfremde Spieler erkannt. Sie haben im Zweifel tiefere Taschen, um zu investieren, und sie verf\u00fcgen zudem \u00fcber mehr technisches Know-how, wie man neuen Angeboten zum Erfolg verhilft. Zwar wirkt die Erlaubnispflicht von Bankgesch\u00e4ften einstweilen als Eintrittsh\u00fcrde etwa f\u00fcr die US-Technologieunternehmen, die global bislang nach Gutd\u00fcnken schalten und walten. L\u00e4ngst aber haben diese Gesellschaften erkannt, wie sie den regulatorischen und aufsichtlichen Aufwand optimieren, und haben sich folglich auf Dienstleistungen verlegt, die einen nur \u00fcberschaubaren Aufwand mit sich bringen.</p><p>Kredite als letzte Bastion</p><p>Mehr noch: Weil ihre Finanzdienstleistungen f\u00fcr sie einstweilen nur Zubrot sind, k\u00f6nnen sie es sich leisten, diese gerade einmal kostendeckend anzubieten. Denn sie sind nicht wie die Banken darauf angewiesen, mit Ertr\u00e4gen aus dem Kerngesch\u00e4ft gegen die Folgen negativer Zinsen anzuverdienen. Mancherorts im Markt wird vor diesem Hintergrund bereits prognostiziert, dass Big-Tech-Gesellschaften den Banken nach und nach Gesch\u00e4ftsfelder abnehmen werden, bis den traditionellen Instituten als Bastion nur mehr das Kreditgesch\u00e4ft bleibt.</p><p>Nur dort schlagen sie die Technologieunternehmen mit deren eigenen Waffen: Denn die Historie an Kreditdaten sowie die Risikoexpertise, auf welche die Banken zur\u00fcckgreifen k\u00f6nnen, m\u00fcsste Big Tech erst noch aufbauen.</p><p>Hei\u00dfe Debatten</p><p>Den Umbruch zu ignorieren, ist jedenfalls keine Option. Wer den Fortschritt nicht an die Hand nimmt, dem wird er an die Kehle gehen, ist von britischen Staatsmann Winston Churchill \u00fcberliefert. Die Vorboten der sch\u00f6nen neuen Welt des Banking werden bereits sichtbar: Im Gro\u00dfkundengesch\u00e4ft l\u00e4sst der Aufstieg der Maschinen zunehmend die Margen erodieren, und im Massengesch\u00e4ft machen neue Wettbewerber den Banken Kunden abspenstig. Die traditionellen Anbieter m\u00fcssen eine, eine eigene, Antwort finden.</p><p>Nun kann niemand ernsthaft behaupten, im deutschen Finanzsektor sei in den vergangenen Jahren nichts passiert: Kein Tag, an dem nicht allein in Frankfurt sich meist m\u00e4nnliche Repr\u00e4sentanten des Gewerbes auf Podiumsb\u00fchnen \u00fcber die Perspektiven der Digitalisierung die K\u00f6pfe hei\u00dfreden. Nur: Was hat dies bisher gebracht?</p><p>Bei Beobachtern ist zuweilen die Rede von einer Art Frustration, die in Banken um sich greife: Jahrelang hat man Projekte initiiert, Start-ups finanziert, Inkubatoren gegr\u00fcndet und andere Vorhaben gestartet. Im Ergebnis und im Aktienkurs aber ist davon nichts zu sehen.</p><p>Die Meilensteine in der digitalen Umwandlung sind andernorts zu vermelden. Etwa wenn Facebook Anstalten macht, eine private Kryptow\u00e4hrung einzuf\u00fchren, und damit die Notenbanken weltweit aufschreckt. Oder wenn das Technologieunternehmen Applemit seinem Zahlungssystem Apple Pay rasch Reichweiten gewinnt, von denen Paydirekt, das Online-Bezahlsystem der deutschen Kreditwirtschaft, noch lange Zeit tr\u00e4umen wird.</p><p>L\u00f6sungen ohne Probleme</p><p>Die Resultate digitaler Projekte fallen aber oft ern\u00fcchternd aus, die Versuchsballons fliegen nicht. Da ergibt eine Initiative zum Einsatz k\u00fcnstlicher Intelligenz im Firmenkundengesch\u00e4ft zur Vermarktung des jeweils n\u00e4chstbesseren Angebots, dass die mit KI bearbeitete Kundengruppe solche Offerten exakt ebenso oft annimmt wie die Vergleichsgruppe, da Kunden schon in Eigeninitiative auf ihren Berater zugehen.</p><p>Da werden bei Versicherern Angebote gestartet, die es Kunden erlauben, allein durch Einsendung eines Fotos eines Schadens dessen Bearbeitung zu starten, ohne dass dies auf nennenswerte Resonanz stie\u00dfe. Da werden hohe Summen in die Entwicklung von Apps versenkt, w\u00e4hrend man Kreditantr\u00e4ge weiter per Umlaufmappe herumreicht.</p><p>Anstatt zu versuchen, L\u00f6sungen f\u00fcr vermeintliche Probleme von Kunden in den Bankbetrieb zu integrieren, gelte es, die realen Probleme der Kunden zu identifizieren und von diesen den Weg zu einer L\u00f6sung zu suchen, meint denn auch Sven Kr\u00e4mer, Partner beim Beratungshaus ZEB.</p><p>Die Zeit dr\u00e4ngt, wollen Banken nicht marginalisiert werden. Den Zahlungsverkehr haben Big Tech und Private Equity schon weitgehend unter sich aufgeteilt. Im Aktien- und Devisenhandel haben die Geldh\u00e4user deutlich an Boden verloren, weil technologisch \u00fcberlegene Anbieter mit Namen wie Citadel, Susquehanna oder XTX Markets ihnen das Wasser abgraben. Setzt sich dieser Trend fort, k\u00f6nnten bald weitere Gesch\u00e4ftsbereiche wegfallen und breit angelegte Abschreibungen in den Banken nach sich ziehen.</p><p>Wie tief die anstehenden Umw\u00e4lzungen greifen d\u00fcrften, l\u00e4sst sich am Anforderungsprofil an die Besch\u00e4ftigten illustrieren, das sich gr\u00fcndlich ver\u00e4ndern wird. So stellte das World Economic Forum im vergangenen Jahr die Prognose auf, dass in den folgenden vier Jahren 56 % der Besch\u00e4ftigten im Sektor \"Finanzen und Anlage\" Umschulungsbedarf haben werden.</p><p>Automatisierung und maschinelles Lernen d\u00fcrften demnach den Anteil menschlichen Inputs im Falle von Routinet\u00e4tigkeiten etwa in der Verwaltung oder in der Datenverarbeitung bis 2022 um ein Drittel auf 39 % reduzieren. All dies schl\u00e4gt sich bereits in der Personalpolitik der Institute nieder: Software-Ingenieure sind in, Verwaltungsassistenten out (siehe Grafik). Ex-Barclays-Chef Antony Jenkins geht davon aus, dass der Anteil jener Besch\u00e4ftigten einer durchschnittlichen britischen Bank, die im Bereich \"Operations and Technology\" t\u00e4tig sind, bis 2030 von gut 50 % auf nur mehr 10 % fallen wird.</p><p>Mancher Siegeszug f\u00e4llt aus</p><p>Zugleich gilt: Bangemachen gilt nicht. Wie wenig belastbar langfristige Prognosen gerade im Finanzsektor zum Teil sind, hat sich schon oft gezeigt. Auch in Bezug auf die Digitalisierung: So ist der vor wenigen Jahren prognostizierte Siegeszug der Fintechs weitgehend ausgefallen. Im Feld der Robo-Advisor hat bereits die Konsolidierung eingesetzt.</p><p>Wie also beginnen? Nach Jahren der Auseinandersetzung mit der neuen Technik ist es Zeit, eine erste Bilanz zu ziehen. Welche Vorhaben fliegen, welche nicht? Gibt es f\u00fcr Banken ein Leben nach dem Einstieg ins Plattform-Zeitalter? Wie gro\u00df ist mit Blick auf das sogenannte agile Arbeiten die Diskrepanz zwischen Theorie und Praxis, zwischen Anspruch und Wirklichkeit? Welche Effekte haben Kryptow\u00e4hrungen, und wie betrachtet die Aufsicht sie? Was kommt auf die Banken zu, wenn im September die Bestimmungen der EU-Zahlungsdiensterichtlinie PSD2 in Kraft treten? Zudem: Was l\u00e4uft im Ausland? H\u00e4lt die Verhei\u00dfung k\u00fcnstlicher Intelligenz, was sie verspricht, und wie will ein Finanzvorstand etwaige Fortschritte kontrollieren? Wie weit sind an Wall Street Bem\u00fchungen gediehen, H\u00e4ndler durch Maschinen zu ersetzen? Wie steht es in China um die Pl\u00e4ne f\u00fcr ein Social Scoring von B\u00fcrgern? Und was haben die Regelsetzer in Berlin und Br\u00fcssel vor? Diese und andere Fragen wird die B\u00f6rsen-Zeitung im Zuge einer Serie \u00fcber die \"Sch\u00f6ne neue Bankenwelt\" beleuchten.

Es geht um etwas anderes. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mit Facebook stimmt was nicht. \"Die Welt f\u00fchlt sich \u00e4ngstlich und geteilt, und Facebook hat viel zu tun - ob es darum geht, unsere Gemeinschaft vor Missbrauch und Hass zu sch\u00fctzen, gegen die  Beeinflussung von Nationalstaaten zu verteidigen oder sicherzustellen, dass auf Facebook verbrachte Zeit gut verbrachte Zeit ist\", hat Mark Zuckerberg j\u00fcngst an die Nutzer geschrieben. Die  deutliche Kritik an seiner Sch\u00f6pfung ging um die Welt, ebenso die Folge: Er hat sich zur pers\u00f6nlichen Herausforderung gemacht, Facebook zu reparieren - zuvor setzte er sich Ziele wie Chinesisch  lernen oder 25 B\u00fccher lesen. </p><p>Diese Episode erschlie\u00dft ein Ph\u00e4nomen, das derzeit nicht allein Zuckerberg und Facebook betrifft: Die Tech-Konzerne stehen unter ungewohnt gro\u00dfem Druck, der sich verschieden auspr\u00e4gt. Das  Bundeskartellamt untersucht, ob Facebook seine Marktmacht missbraucht hat, die israelische Wettbewerbsbeh\u00f6rde durchleuchtet Google und Facebook. Der amerikanische Kongress verh\u00f6rte Vertreter von  Facebook, Twitter und Google \u00fcber die Einflussnahme Russlands auf die Pr\u00e4sidentschaftswahlen. In Deutschland gilt mittlerweile ein Gesetz (NetzDG), das die Unternehmen verpflichtet, zeitnah und  selbst\u00e4ndig Hass im Netz einzud\u00e4mmen. Zudem tritt in der Europ\u00e4ischen Union dieses Jahr die neue Regelung GDPR in Kraft, die auf den Umgang mit personenbezogenen Daten abzielt. Schlussendlich  riefen, und das ist wieder ein ganz anderer Fall, zwei Aktion\u00e4re den iPhone-Hersteller Apple dazu auf, st\u00e4rker zu erforschen, ob und wie Handys gerade junge Menschen abh\u00e4ngig machen. </p><p>Als Klammer um die vielen Einzelbeispiele herum macht nun wieder h\u00e4ufiger der Begriff \"Techlash\" die Runde - jene Wortsch\u00f6pfung, die einen R\u00fcckschlag der Technologiebranche und besonders ihrer  gr\u00f6\u00dften Vertreter beschreibt. Der Chef der amerikanischen Handelskammer diagnostizierte ihn in seiner Neujahrsansprache und warnte vor einer \"regulatorischen \u00dcbertreibung\" in den Vereinigten  Staaten und au\u00dferhalb. Wie kommt es, dass das Umfeld gerade f\u00fcr die hoch innovative IT-Branche rauher geworden ist? </p><p>Drei Antworten bieten sich an. Die erste und einfachste lautet schlicht: weil die Tech-Konzerne unglaublich erfolgreich sind. Sie machen Angebote, die Milliarden Menschen auf der ganzen Welt  nutzen (wollen). Das sind, auch das darf man einmal sagen, betriebswirtschaftlich-technisch geniale Leistungen gro\u00dfer Gr\u00fcnder. Regelm\u00e4\u00dfige Milliardengewinne haben Apple &amp; Co l\u00e4ngst zu den  wertvollsten an der B\u00f6rse notierten Unternehmen gemacht. Das liegt auch daran, und das ist die zweite und kniffligere Antwort, weil ihre Erfindungen interessante \u00f6konomische Eigenschaften  aufweisen: Wer etwa die Suchmaschine Google oder Facebook \"konsumiert\", schlie\u00dft w\u00e4hrenddessen niemand anderen davon aus, genau dieselben Produkte zu nutzen. Die Herstellung wird umgekehrt umso  g\u00fcnstiger, je gr\u00f6\u00dfer sie ist. Diese Gemengelage wirft oft heikle Wettbewerbsfragen auf, was der leichtere Teil der Angelegenheit ist, weil Antworten lange bekannt und erprobt sind. </p><p>Schwerer greifbar, und das ist die dritte Antwort, ist der wachsende Einfluss von \"Big Tech\" auf gesellschaftliche Entwicklungen insgesamt. Diskussion und Meinungsaustausch finden innerhalb der  Angebote statt, vielfach auch die Information \u00fcber das Weltgeschehen. Die Gemeinde der monatlichen Facebook-Nutzer etwa ist gr\u00f6\u00dfer als die Zahl aller Muslime oder Chinesen, die einzigen gr\u00f6\u00dferen  Gruppen sind die Christen und die Fu\u00dfballinteressierten. Das soziale Netzwerk ist so einerseits ein privates Unternehmen, zugleich aber auch irgendwie Teil des \u00f6ffentlichen Raumes. Kein Wunder,  dass es sich nicht nur mit Wettbewerbsh\u00fctern auseinandersetzen muss, sondern eben auch mit Fragen der Meinungsfreiheit und Debattenkultur. Eine hilfreiche Erwartungshaltung f\u00fcr alle Beteiligten  kommt von Mark Zuckerberg selbst: \"Wir werden nicht alle Fehler oder Missbrauch verhindern k\u00f6nnen. Aber derzeit machen wir zu viele Fehler, wenn es darum geht, unsere Regeln umzusetzen und den  Missbrauch unserer Plattform zu verhindern.\" Die nun von Facebook angek\u00fcndigte Ver\u00e4nderung des pers\u00f6nlichen Nachrichtenstroms (Newsfeed) ist vor diesem Hintergrund zu sehen. </p><p>Sehr sicher ist: Die Themen Marktmacht, Falschinformation und Sucht im Zusammenhang mit sozialen Netzwerken oder Smartphones werden auf der Agenda bleiben. Das zum Beispiel vom fr\u00fcheren  Google-Chef Eric Schmidt verwendete Bonmot, wonach die Konkurrenz nur \"einen Klick entfernt\" sei, reicht als Entkr\u00e4ftung nicht (mehr). Andererseits ist auch die den gro\u00dfen Tech-Konzernen gerne  zugewiesene Allmacht eine \u00dcbertreibung. Infolge nicht nur der Fortschritte in der K\u00fcnstlichen Intelligenz sind sie einander sogar h\u00e4rtere Wettbewerber geworden - im Bereich der digitalen  Assistenten, Cloud-Angeboten, Musik- und Videodiensten oder mobilen Betriebssystemen. Manchen mag die Moral des Silicon Valley befremden, der gro\u00dfes Zutrauen in die Probleml\u00f6sef\u00e4higkeit von  Technologie, Wissenschaft und dem Wettstreit um die besten Produktideen zugrunde liegt.

Wenn die Entwicklung des deutschen Bankensektors seit der Jahrtausendwende ein klassisches Drama ist, dann hat die Branche inzwischen vier Akte hinter sich gebracht. Im ersten Aufzug legten die Globalisierung des Kreditgewerbes und der Fortfall von Anstaltslast und Gew\u00e4hrtr\u00e4gerhaftung bei Sparkassen und Landesbanken die Basis f\u00fcr den k\u00fcnftigen Konflikt. Im zweiten Akt versch\u00e4rften die Jahre des Booms die Situation, bevor im dritten die Handlung mit dem Platzen der US-Immobilienblase und dem Kollaps von Lehman Brothers 2007 und 2008 ihren H\u00f6hepunkt erreichte. Im vierten Teil sorgte angesichts einer ausgewachsenen Finanz- und Staatsschuldenkrise die Losung \"Whatever it takes\" von Notenbankpr\u00e4sident Mario Draghi f\u00fcr verlangsamende Momente. Im f\u00fcnften Akt steht der klassischen Lehrmeinung zufolge nunmehr die Aufl\u00f6sung des Konflikts durch die Katastrophe bzw. den Untergang der Helden bevor oder aber ein Happy End.</p><p>Wie man es auch wendet: F\u00fcr die Branche hat das Endspiel begonnen. Erstes Indiz: Eine totale Verunsicherung greift um sich. Allerorten beginnen sich Koordinaten, auf die jahrzehntelang Verlass war, zu verschieben. Das gilt zum Beispiel mit Blick auf die Kunden und deren Gewohnheiten. Fr\u00fcher standen diese im Sektor vielleicht auch nicht immer ganz oben auf der Agenda. Damals gab es f\u00fcr Normalb\u00fcrger aber auch kaum eine Alternative zu ihrer Sparkasse, Genossenschaftsbank oder Privatbank. Dies wird sich bald \u00e4ndern.</p><p>Im September wird es ernst</p><p>Zwar haben Fintechs schon bisher hier und dort an der Kundenbasis der Institute geknabbert. Ernst wird es aber Mitte September im neuen Jahr. Dann m\u00fcssen Banken in der Europ\u00e4ischen Union infolge der Richtlinie PSD2 externen Zahlungsdienstleistern Zugang zu Daten von Kunden bereitstellen, wenn diese dies w\u00fcnschen, und zwar auf dem gleichen Service-Niveau wie die Online-Banking-Plattform des kontof\u00fchrenden Zahlungsdienstleisters. Damit sinkt die H\u00fcrde, sich anderen Anbietern im Zahlungsverkehr zuzuwenden. Fr\u00fcher galt der Satz \"Wer den Zahlungsverkehr hat, hat den Kunden\". Der Umkehrschluss ist zul\u00e4ssig.</p><p>Dabei deuten nicht wenige Anzeichen darauf hin, dass k\u00fcnftig nicht mehr nur Fintechs mit putzigen Namen und wenig Durchschlagskraft, sondern die Schwergewichte aus Silicon Valley, Seattle oder China den Banken das Leben schwer machen. Die Plattformen der Datenkraken k\u00f6nnen einen Sog entfalten, in dem dereinst wom\u00f6glich der Kundenstamm mancher Bank verschwindet.</p><p>Tr\u00fcgerische Hoffnung</p><p>Die Kreditwirtschaft hierzulande hat sich lange gerne der Hoffnung hingegeben, dass Big Tech sich h\u00fcten wird, jemals Bankdienste anzubieten, um sich nicht deren Regulierung unterwerfen zu m\u00fcssen. Warum nur beklagen etwa die Sparkassen dann, dass Apple ihnen die Schnittstelle f\u00fcr den Zahlungsverkehr per Near-Field Communication (NFC) im iPhone vorenthalte, w\u00e4hrend Amazon ihnen die Sprachfunktion Alexas f\u00fcr Bankdienstleistungen verwehre?</p><p>W\u00e4hrend neue Wettbewerber die Kundenbasis bedrohen, br\u00f6ckeln infolge der politischen Gro\u00dfwetterlage die Fundamente des Gesch\u00e4fts. Der Brexit ist nur das augenf\u00e4lligste Symptom der Aufl\u00f6sung eines lieb gewonnenen Marktumfelds. Seine Kehrseite zeigt sich im \u00c4quivalenzstreit mit der Schweiz, in dem die EU dieselben Tendenzen zur Isolation an den Tag legt, die sie im Falle Gro\u00dfbritanniens wortreich beklagt. Derweil stellt Italiens Regierung den Zusammenhalt der Europ\u00e4ischen Union auf die Probe, und das erratische Verhalten des US-Pr\u00e4sidenten verst\u00e4rkt auf globaler Ebene die Ungewissheit.</p><p>Regulatorisch wird sich das Bankgesch\u00e4ft ebenfalls ver\u00e4ndern. Nach den Geldw\u00e4scheskandalen allein im abgelaufenen Jahr ist gewiss, dass das Netz der Compliance-Vorgaben noch deutlich dichter werden wird. Man k\u00f6nnte sagen: Die wenigen Kunden, die den Banken noch bleiben, sind den Instituten und deren Aufsehern immer weniger geheuer. Meint es die EU mit ihrem Aktionsplan Sustainable Finance ernst, werden die wohlklingenden Postulate aus Br\u00fcssel zudem \u00fcber kurz oder lang in knallharte Vorgaben m\u00fcnden m\u00fcssen. Nicht einmal die Form des Zinses steht f\u00fcr die Banken derzeit fest. Ab Ende 2019 werden weder Eonia noch Euribor den Vorgaben der EU mehr gerecht, und zumindest was l\u00e4nger laufende Ausreichungen angeht, ist Ersatz noch nicht gefunden. Mit jeder Umstellung aber drohen Reibungsverluste, Bewertungsprobleme und Rechtsunsicherheit. Das Chaos macht auch nicht halt vor dem Notenmonopol der Zentralbanken, wie der Aufstieg der aus jedem regulatorischen Rahmen fallenden Kryptow\u00e4hrungen zeigt.</p><p>Noch ist f\u00fcr die Banken nicht alles verloren: Solange etwa die gro\u00dfen Banken dieser Welt mehr K\u00f6che besch\u00e4ftigen als Kryptow\u00e4hrungsexperten, wie eine Auswertung der Linkedin-Profile in Gro\u00dfbritannien j\u00fcngst zutage f\u00f6rderte, hat der Sektor noch reichlich Spielraum, Unheil abzuwenden, indem er den Einsatz seiner Ressourcen verbessert.</p><p>\u00dcberhaupt scheint der Kostendruck noch lange nicht hoch genug. Dies belegen gerade in der deutschen Kreditwirtschaft Beispiele gro\u00dfen Beharrungsverm\u00f6gens immer dann, wenn Kooperationen in Bereichen scheitern, in denen Banken sich garantiert nicht vom Wettbewerb abheben k\u00f6nnen, sei es in der Wertpapierabwicklung, im Falle von Pl\u00e4nen, ein System f\u00fcr die Identifikation von Kunden (KYC) gemeinsam zu bauen, oder andernorts.</p><p>Was m\u00fcssen Banken tun, au\u00dfer Kosten zu senken? Politisch und regulatorisch hinnehmen, was sie nicht \u00e4ndern k\u00f6nnen, und operativ \u00e4ndern, was sie \u00e4ndern k\u00f6nnen, aber mit Bedacht. Wer nun einen unstillbaren Datenhunger entwickelt, um die Plattformanbieter auf deren Spielfeld zu schlagen, d\u00fcrfte ebenso das Nachsehen haben wie Banken, die sich der neuen Realit\u00e4t verweigern - Plattform-Banking kennt einen Sieger, nicht mehrere. Ob ausgerechnet eines der herk\u00f6mmlichen Kreditinstitute mit oft waghalsiger Spaghetti-IT, \u00fcberschaubaren Analyseinstrumenten und ausbauf\u00e4higer Cybersicherheit auf dem Siegerpodest steht, wird ein vorsichtiger Bankvorstand vielleicht lieber nicht austesten. Im Umgang mit Daten wird Big Tech Banken immer voraus sein. Diese m\u00fcssen daher abw\u00e4gen, welche Daten sie jenseits von PSD2 teilen wollen.</p><p>Gro\u00dfe Banken k\u00f6nnten ihren Bestand dazu nutzen, um etwa dem Einzelhandel dynamische Preise bereitzustellen. Kleinere Banken haben anders als Big Tech die N\u00e4he und noch immer das Vertrauen der Kunden. Volksbanken und Sparkassen demonstrieren, dass dies nach wie vor relativ hohe Preise und Margen erm\u00f6glicht. Dennoch werden gerade viele kleine Banken auf der Strecke bleiben. Dies ist eine Ironie von Markt und Regulierung. Denn zur Entstehung der Finanzkrise, von der sich eine Linie \u00fcber die Staatsschuldenkrise bis zum Populismus und zur momentanen Krise der Demokratie in Europa ziehen l\u00e4sst, hatten diese Banken wie die sp\u00e4ter zur Kasse gebetenen Steuerzahler kaum etwas beigetragen. Doch so l\u00e4uft das Gesch\u00e4ft.</p><p>Ob das Drama f\u00fcr die breite Masse im Sektor in der Katastrophe und nicht im Happy End m\u00fcnden wird? Bis der Vorhang f\u00e4llt, tun Banken gut daran, es mit Nobelpreistr\u00e4ger Bob Dylan zu halten: \"Ich akzeptiere das Chaos. Ich bin mir nicht sicher, ob es mich akzeptiert.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BORZTG-2018249142</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BORZTG2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V43-93Y1-DY1C-71VK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253914</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1199\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Herausgebergemeinschaft Wertpapier-Mitteilungen Keppler, Lehmann GmbH &amp; Co.

Comme l'avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 annonc\u00e9 le Wall Street Journal, lui concentrera son enqu\u00eate sur l'impact de la firme de Mountain View sur la publicit\u00e9 en ligne\u00a0: \u00abElle domine tous les aspects de la publicit\u00e9 sur internet et de la recherche en ligne\u00bb, pr\u00e9cise-t-il. Il \u00e9voque les co\u00fbts croissants pour les annonceurs, et se demande \u00absi les consommateurs ont les meilleures informations\u00bb \u00e0 partir de leurs requ\u00eates sur Google. </p><p>Celui-ci est r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement accus\u00e9 de profiter de son moteur de recherche pour orienter \u00e0 leur insu les consommateurs vers ses propres produits et services. S\u00e9par\u00e9ment, un groupe de procureurs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux men\u00e9 par la procureure g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de New York, Letitia James, organise une enqu\u00eate sur Facebook. \u00abNous agissons comme un seul, aujourd'hui, afin de lancer une enqu\u00eate qui sera juste et compl\u00e8te\u00bb, souligne Karl Racine, procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Columbia. Facebook a d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00fb payer 5 milliards de dollars, d\u00e9but ao\u00fbt, \u00e0 la Federal Trade Commission, le r\u00e9gulateur en charge de la protection des consommateurs, pour manquements \u00e0 ses obligations concernant la protection de la vie priv\u00e9e de ses utilisateurs, suite au scandale Cambridge Analytica. Les acquisitions des messageries Instagram et WhatsApp font \u00e9galement l'objet d'une enqu\u00eate des autorit\u00e9s f\u00e9d\u00e9rales. Amazon est accus\u00e9 de pratiques d\u00e9loyales au d\u00e9triment de vendeurs tiers sur son site. Quant \u00e0 Apple, il est mis en cause par des d\u00e9veloppeurs d'applications mobiles qui lui reprochent de ne distribuer les applications pour iPhone que via sa propre boutique d'applications, son App Store. Google, Facebook, Apple et Amazon font aussi l'objet d'enqu\u00eates du minist\u00e8re de la Justice et la FTC, l\u00e0 encore sur des soup\u00e7ons d'infraction \u00e0 la l\u00e9gislation antitrust.

L'\u00c9tat am\u00e9ricain a adopt\u00e9 la loi de protection des donn\u00e9es la plus stricte des \u00c9tats-Unis, qui vise \u00e0 donner aux consommateurs un plus grand contr\u00f4le sur leurs donn\u00e9es personnelles. Ce faisant, l'\u00c9tat a fait de sa capitale Sacramento l'un des r\u00e9gulateurs les plus stricts de l'industrie technologique mondiale du jour au lendemain. Alors que les l\u00e9gislateurs californiens ont r\u00e9dig\u00e9 la loi et fix\u00e9 le cap de l'\u00e8re num\u00e9rique, la plupart des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s Internet n'ont gu\u00e8re tenu compte de la menace grandissante et n'ont donc apport\u00e9 qu'une partie de leurs consid\u00e9rables ressources de lobbying dans le processus de r\u00e9daction de la loi.</p><p>Google, Facebook et deux grandes associations commerciales de technologie ont investi ensemble seulement 235 000 $ dans le lobbying au cours des trois mois pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant le vote sur le projet de loi. Facebook, qui \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque concentrait toutes ses ressources sur le scandale de Cambridge Analytica, a d\u00e9pens\u00e9 moins de 18 000 dollars en lobbying autour de la loi sur la protection des donn\u00e9es pendant cette p\u00e9riode, selon des documents officiels. Les r\u00e9centes tentatives de l'industrie technologique pour emp\u00eacher l'entr\u00e9e en vigueur de certaines parties de la loi sur la protection des donn\u00e9es en janvier n'ont pas vraiment abouti. Ils montrent \u00e0 quel point la Silicon Valley et sa voisine Sacramento, situ\u00e9e \u00e0 deux heures de route, sont \u00e9loign\u00e9es l'une de l'autre. Mark Zuckerberg et d'autres rois de la Silicon Valley se donnent beaucoup de mal pour faire pression sur Washington. Et ils se battent aussi depuis des ann\u00e9es avec les autorit\u00e9s de r\u00e9gulation europ\u00e9ennes, se d\u00e9fendant contre les restrictions strictes. Apr\u00e8s tout, l'Union europ\u00e9enne dispose de la l\u00e9gislation la plus stricte au monde en mati\u00e8re de protection des donn\u00e9es. Mais c'est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment la r\u00e9ticence de la politique californienne qui a profond\u00e9ment affect\u00e9 les entreprises technologiques, selon les experts.</p><p>Les g\u00e9ants de la Silicon Valley se battent maintenant contre les l\u00e9gislateurs de la Californie, notamment contre les initiatives \u00e9lectorales qui ont lanc\u00e9 deux campagnes de protection de la vie priv\u00e9e en moins de trois ans. \"Les gens pensent que Sacramento est de l'autre c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la lune \", dit le strat\u00e8ge d\u00e9mocratique Andrew Acosta. Les entreprises de technologie filent maintenant leurs fils auparavant minces \u00e0 Sacramento en une toile dense. Cela est d'autant plus vrai que les l\u00e9gislateurs examinent de plus pr\u00e8s les dispositions relatives \u00e0 la protection des donn\u00e9es. Facebook, Google et les associations industrielles TechNet et The Internet Association ont consid\u00e9rablement augment\u00e9 leur budget commun de lobbying en Californie : en 2019 et 2020, de plus de 80 % par rapport au mandat pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent de deux ans.</p><p>Les quatre acteurs ont d\u00e9pens\u00e9 un total de 1,3 million de dollars US entre janvier et septembre 2019 pour influencer les d\u00e9cideurs politiques \u00e0 Sacramento. Facebook vient d'engager l'excellente initi\u00e9e de Sacramento, Mona Pasquil Rogers, qui est maintenant responsable de la strat\u00e9gie californienne de l'entreprise. Mais est-il trop tard pour l'offensive ? Les entreprises technologiques sont d\u00e9j\u00e0 tomb\u00e9es dans l'\u0153il du public. Ce dernier est de plus en plus critique \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du r\u00f4le de la technologie dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et la vie quotidienne. Cela pourrait saper les efforts de lobbying \u00e0 Sacramento, o\u00f9 m\u00eame les r\u00e9publicains \u00e0 l'esprit d'entreprise ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 tir\u00e9 la sonnette d'alarme. L'initiative \u00e9lectorale en Californie, qui permet aux citoyens de soumettre des projets de loi au vote sans l'appui du gouverneur, pourrait cr\u00e9er d'autres impond\u00e9rables.</p><p>\u00c0 la surprise de beaucoup, l'offensive de cette ann\u00e9e par l'industrie technologique n'a pas entra\u00een\u00e9 de changements significatifs dans la nouvelle loi sur la protection des donn\u00e9es. Au contraire, l'avocat de la protection des consommateurs Alastair Mactaggart, qui a particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9daction de la loi, craignait tellement que les efforts de lobbying ne diluent la loi sur la protection des donn\u00e9es qu'il a directement fait pression pour une deuxi\u00e8me initiative \u00e9lectorale pour 2020. La version r\u00e9vis\u00e9e de la loi renforcerait encore la protection des consommateurs - et d\u00e9couragerait les l\u00e9gislateurs d'apporter des changements qui affaibliraient la Loi sur la protection des donn\u00e9es. Cela pourrait expliquer pourquoi les entreprises technologiques - qui n'aiment pas les nouvelles lois californiennes sur la protection de la vie priv\u00e9e - comptent maintenant sur le soutien de Washington. Leur dernier espoir sont les r\u00e8glements des \u00c9tats qui abrogent ou remplacent les lois des diff\u00e9rents \u00c9tats.</p><p>Le mois dernier, une fondation financ\u00e9e par des entreprises de technologie et de t\u00e9l\u00e9communications a aid\u00e9 \u00e0 envoyer une d\u00e9l\u00e9gation de l\u00e9gislateurs californiens \u00e0 Washington. Lors d'entretiens avec des coll\u00e8gues du Congr\u00e8s am\u00e9ricain, un comit\u00e9 a discut\u00e9 des faiblesses de la loi californienne et a soulign\u00e9 les avantages du traitement pr\u00e9f\u00e9rentiel de Washington par rapport aux \u00c9tats, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 l'un des organisateurs \u00e0 \" Politico \".</p><p>Cependant, un examen plus approfondi des donn\u00e9es financi\u00e8res des campagnes montre que la \" big tech \" n'a pas jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le majeur dans les campagnes \u00e9lectorales des candidats. Facebook est de loin l'entreprise qui d\u00e9pense le plus d'argent dans l'industrie des technologies pour la campagne \u00e9lectorale, depuis 2009 d\u00e9j\u00e0 1,7 millions de dollars US. Cette somme n'inclut m\u00eame pas le montant pay\u00e9 par un ancien cadre sup\u00e9rieur de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 pour sa propre campagne pour le poste de procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral en 2010. Selon des documents gouvernementaux, Google a d\u00e9pens\u00e9 959 000 dollars US, alors qu'Apple n'a d\u00e9pens\u00e9 que 256 000 dollars US. \u00c0 titre de comparaison, le groupe de t\u00e9l\u00e9communications AT&amp;T a vers\u00e9 5,3 millions de dollars dans les poches des candidats au cours de cette p\u00e9riode, et le syndicat SEIU a m\u00eame vers\u00e9 6,2 millions de dollars.</p><p>En fait, disent les strat\u00e8ges, certains l\u00e9gislateurs progressistes pourraient m\u00eame accueillir le vent contraire de la part d'entreprises comme Facebook. Si Facebook devait donner une grosse somme d'argent \u00e0 la d\u00e9put\u00e9e Buffy Wicks, qui est un d\u00e9fenseur de la vie priv\u00e9e, dit le strat\u00e8ge Acosta, elle dirait probablement : \" Continuez \", ajoute-t-il : \" Il est significatif que les candidats \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidence d\u00e9nigrent Mark Zuckerberg dans leur campagne. Facebook est en baisse et tout le monde s'engage dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. \"</p><p>Amazon s'est d\u00e9j\u00e0 aventur\u00e9 dans la politique locale et a connu un d\u00e9sastre en mati\u00e8re de relations publiques. L'entreprise a investi pr\u00e8s de 1,5 million de dollars am\u00e9ricains dans un soi-disant Comit\u00e9 d'action politique, une organisation politique priv\u00e9e qui a recueilli des votes pour les membres du Conseil municipal de Seattle li\u00e9s au monde des affaires. Le strat\u00e8ge Steve Maviglio, consultant pour les initiatives des \u00e9lecteurs, consid\u00e8re cependant qu'il est encore plus risqu\u00e9 que les entreprises technologiques ne s'impliquent pas du tout dans la course politique. Il dit : \" Le fait que chacun fasse ses propres affaires aurait rendu possible la loi sur la protection des donn\u00e9es en Californie.</p><p>Maviglio a \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9 par une coalition de la technologie et des t\u00e9l\u00e9communications pour lutter contre l'initiative l\u00e9gislative. Mais au lieu de lui promettre des millions de dollars s'il arr\u00eatait l'initiative, les entreprises ont attendu. Personne n'a voulu faire le premier pas. Ce n'est qu'en f\u00e9vrier 2018, quatre mois apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la p\u00e9tition r\u00e9f\u00e9rendaire, que la premi\u00e8re contribution financi\u00e8re a \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9e. En avril 2018, cependant, Facebook, secou\u00e9 par le scandale de Cambridge Analytica, a annonc\u00e9 qu'il ne voulait plus lutter contre la loi sur la protection des donn\u00e9es. Le projet de loi sur l'initiative citoyenne a obtenu un score \u00e9lev\u00e9 dans les sondages d'opinion. En juin, le gouvernement a adopt\u00e9 \u00e0 l'unanimit\u00e9 la loi sur la protection des donn\u00e9es avant le r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum. Cela signifie que Washington peut continuer \u00e0 y apporter des modifications sans avoir \u00e0 le pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 nouveau \u00e0 l'\u00e9lectorat au pr\u00e9alable. \"Il y a eu un malentendu fondamental sur le fonctionnement de l'initiative \u00e9lectorale et sur qui devait faire quoi \", dit Maviglio. \"Il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 facile de convaincre les l\u00e9gislateurs d'intervenir. Et franchement, c'est exactement la raison pour laquelle le projet de loi a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9 au d\u00e9part. Le gouvernement ne savait tout simplement pas comment il aurait pu intervenir et faire prendre \u00e0 la loi une autre direction\".</p><p>L'ancien conseiller d\u00e9mocrate Roger Salazar souligne le contraste entre les start-up technologiques d'aujourd'hui et les g\u00e9ants du mat\u00e9riel et des logiciels comme Hewlett Packard et Apple qui ont domin\u00e9 la Silicon Valley dans les ann\u00e9es 1980. Il se rappelle que les entreprises de la premi\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9ration embauchaient g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement des gestionnaires de la vieille \u00e9cole.

The UK has seen a 17 per cent rise (2017-18) in hate incidents overall, while religiously motivated hate soared over 40 per cent.

But current laws are unable to stop groups that spread hate and division, but do not advocate violence.</p><p>The Solution:</p><p>Create a new law to designate 'hate groups'. This new tier of hate group designation would be the first of its kind in Europe and would help tackle nonviolent extremist groups that demonise specific groups on the basis of their race, religious, gender, nationality or sexuality.1The Institute's work has consistently highlighted the link between the ideas that underpin nonviolent and violent extremism and has proposed resources for governments to begin defining nonviolent extremism. The new designation would sit alongside proscription but not be linked to violence or terrorism, while related offences would be civil not criminal. Unlike proscription, hate designation would be time-limited and automatically reviewed, conditioned on visible reform of the group. Powers to designate would, like proscription powers, fall under the Home Office's remit and require ministerial sign off. Under designation, hate groups would be limited from appearing on media outlets or engaging with public institutions.</p><p>The Problem: Hate surges around major events</p><p>A steady growth in hate crime has been driven by surges around major events. Often this begins online. Around the 2017 terror attacks in the UK, hate incidents online increased by almost 1,000 per cent, from 4,000 to over 37,500 daily. In the 48-hour period after an event, hate begins to flow offline.2Kim Sadique, James Tangen and Anna Perowne, \"The importance of Narrative in Responding to Hate Incidents Following 'Trigger' Events\", Tell Mama UK, November 2018, accessed July 2019, <url normalizedValue=\"https://tellmamauk.org/wp-content/uploads/resources/Tell\">https://tellmamauk.org/wp-content/uploads/resources/Tell</url> MAMA - Report.pdf</p><p>The Solution:</p><p>Earmark contingency funds to protect communities around major events. Government reacted well to the threats faced by UK Muslims following the Christchurch (New Zealand) terror attack. But hate incidents still took place. A broader fund should increase protections in all public spaces after events, not just minority-specific locations such as places of worship. Access is vital to integration and hate should not be allowed to prevent people from going anywhere.</p><p>Develop an emergency response to online hate after flashpoints, alongside tech companies. The UK government should work with tech companies to develop a consensus response to emergency situations. This could include joint mechanisms for faster content removal or de-prioritisation of problematic content via an additional set of emergency algorithms to nip online hate in the bud before it spills offline. However, any measures taken would need to establish consensus on the trade-off between the security of users and citizens, versus restrictions on free speech. A new or existing government body could be authorised to deem an event major, requiring a more precautionary approach from companies for a set period (for example 48 hours) following an incident. This time-limited inoculation method would prevent the need for broader and potentially less democratic blocks, like the one implemented by the Sri Lankan government in the wake of the April 2019 bombings. International initiatives like the Christchurch Call in May 2019 have already highlighted the need for coordinated approaches to eliminate terrorist and violent extremist content online; an initiative to stop hate online would be a welcome next step as part of the Online Harms White Paper process in the UK.</p><p>The Problem: Religious hate is hard to prosecute</p><p>Hate crime legislation is designed to punish those that seek to divide us.

Under designation, hate groups would be limited from appearing on media outlets or engaging with public institutions.</p><p>The Problem: Hate surges around major events</p><p>A steady growth in hate crime has been driven by surges around major events. Often this begins online. Around the 2017 terror attacks in the UK, hate incidents online increased by almost 1,000 per cent, from 4,000 to over 37,500 daily. In the 48-hour period after an event, hate begins to flow offline.2Kim Sadique, James Tangen and Anna Perowne, \"The importance of Narrative in Responding to Hate Incidents Following 'Trigger' Events\", Tell Mama UK, November 2018, accessed July 2019, <url normalizedValue=\"https://tellmamauk.org/wp-content/uploads/resources/Tell\">https://tellmamauk.org/wp-content/uploads/resources/Tell</url> MAMA - Report.pdf</p><p>The Solution:</p><p>Earmark contingency funds to protect communities around major events. Government reacted well to the threats faced by UK Muslims following the Christchurch (New Zealand) terror attack. But hate incidents still took place. A broader fund should increase protections in all public spaces after events, not just minority-specific locations such as places of worship. Access is vital to integration and hate should not be allowed to prevent people from going anywhere.</p><p>Develop an emergency response to online hate after flashpoints, alongside tech companies. The UK government should work with tech companies to develop a consensus response to emergency situations. This could include joint mechanisms for faster content removal or de-prioritisation of problematic content via an additional set of emergency algorithms to nip online hate in the bud before it spills offline. However, any measures taken would need to establish consensus on the trade-off between the security of users and citizens, versus restrictions on free speech. A new or existing government body could be authorised to deem an event major, requiring a more precautionary approach from companies for a set period (for example 48 hours) following an incident. This time-limited inoculation method would prevent the need for broader and potentially less democratic blocks, like the one implemented by the Sri Lankan government in the wake of the April 2019 bombings. International initiatives like the Christchurch Call in May 2019 have already highlighted the need for coordinated approaches to eliminate terrorist and violent extremist content online; an initiative to stop hate online would be a welcome next step as part of the Online Harms White Paper process in the UK.</p><p>The Problem: Religious hate is hard to prosecute</p><p>Hate crime legislation is designed to punish those that seek to divide us. But currently, the lack of prosecutions and justice for perpetrators does nothing to deter hate, or prove government's commitment to a cohesive society. This is particularly acute for religious hate, where only two per cent of incidents are successfully prosecuted. Legislation does not allow intersectionality to be recorded3\"How can we build community cohesion when hate crime is on the Rise?\", All Party Parliamentary Group on Hate Crime, page 4, February 2019, accessed July 2019, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.appghatecrime.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/APPG%20on%20Hate%20Crime%20Report%20Hate%20Crime%20and%20Community%20Cohesion.pdf\">http://www.appghatecrime.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/APPG%20on%20Hate%20Crime%20Report%20Hate%20Crime%20and%20Community%20Cohesion.pdf</url>, exacerbating the disparity between religious and racial hate. This exposes poor data collection but also risks underplaying religious identity, making people feel it is less important than racial characteristics.</p><p>New Labour tried to equalise protections against religious hatred but was rebuffed by the House of Lords due to concerns about free speech. The Lords objections led to a higher evidence bar and narrower criteria for prosecuting religious as opposed to racial hate.</p><p>The Solution:</p><p>Clearly define terms related to hate crime in law, including hatred and hostility, to bring equal protection. Currently wide definitions in the Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006, and Public Order Act (1986), give a high and varied evidence bar. Language should be consistent, with the same phrasing for religious, racial and other forms of hatred. The UK government should share these new definitions through the Organization for Security and Coordination in Europe (OSCE), supporting efforts to tackle an international phenomenon.</p><p>Review the impact of offline harms. The recent Online Harms White Paper is welcome, but the biggest rise in hate crime has been offline. We rightly curtail freedom of expression when it is threatening or harmful. But harm is not properly understood, especially the unquantified impacts on chances of professional or personal success. Clear guidance would support the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to make the public interest case, and along with definitions, improve both steps of its two-stage test for prosecutions. Better understanding harm will also make it easier for juries by showing how hate intends to marginalise others.</p><p>Featured Article</p><p>arrow_forward</p><p>Extremist Ideologies</p><p>Narratives of Hate: The Spectrum of Far-right Worldviews in the UK</p><p>Introduction</p><p>Introduction</p><p>With rising populism, divisive debates around Brexit and a continual terror threat, the UK in 2019 is polarised.

An important example is the June 2019 report by the Muslim Women's Network on Muslim Women's Experiences of the Criminal Justice System. Problems in prosecutions remain; 28 per cent of racially and religiously motivated offences closed last year without a suspect even being identified.23\"Hate Crime Annual Report 2017-18\", Crown Prosecution Service, October 2018, accessed July 2019,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cps.gov.uk/sites/default/files/documents/publications/cps-hate-crime-report-2018.pdf\">https://www.cps.gov.uk/sites/default/files/documents/publications/cps-hate-crime-report-2018.pdf</url></p><p>format_quote</p><p>I have spoken out against those who spread anti-Semitism and anti-Muslim hatred...[but] Sadly we still hear incidents of intolerance, whether it's a migrant being told they don't belong, a disabled child being verbally abused, a Muslim woman having her veil torn off or anonymous keyboard cowards infecting the internet with hatred.</p><p>Sajid Javid Former Home Secretary - Hate Crime Action Plan Refresh, 16 October 2018</p><p>In 2018, the government updated the Action Plan after little progress. Some interventions like the new hate crime awareness campaign are welcome. The push to raise awareness of offences is both a deterrent and can help improve reporting rates. But interventions lack coherence across all the stages of hate crime. Government needs to take the same attitude to hate crime as its CONTEST strategy does to counter terror: preventing hate crime, protecting the public through better preparations, and pursuing and prosecuting those culpable.</p><p>To meet this, government has three options at its disposal:</p><p>Cut hate off at source by implementing new laws to tackle groups that spread hate;</p><p>Prevent the growth of hate crime by better preparing for flashpoints, making communities feel safe wherever they are, online or offline;</p><p>When hate does happen, strengthen existing laws to ensure equal protection for religious and racial characteristics, better protecting British Muslims who bear the brunt of hate in the UK.</p><p>Cut hate off at source</p><p>Cut hate off at source</p><p>Although authorities have expressed concern about the hatred emerging from nonviolent extremist groups, the grey area between counterterrorism and hate crime laws makes it difficult to address them. Some far-right groups have exploited this loophole, despite ad-hoc attempts to curtail them.</p><p>In 2018, UK Border Force refused three anti-Islam activists entry to the UK. The activists, including the leader of far-right group Generation Identity (GI), had planned to speak at a rally at Speakers' Corner as part of a campaign entitled Defend Europe. Reasons for refusal included the distribution of racist materials and potentially violent content in planned speeches, and other actions that threatened UK society. Despite this, the GI leader's speech was still delivered by UK activists. GI continues to operate across the UK and Europe. Although Facebook banned their main account, local groups still have a presence, while its leader is active on Twitter.</p><p>Similarly, in March 2018 far-right group Britain First's leaders were jailed for religiously aggravated harassment. Sentencing the leaders of Britain First, the prosecutor told the court that \"these defendants were not merely exercising their right to free speech but were instead aiming religiously aggravated abuse at innocent members of the public\".24Kevin Rawlinson, \"Britain First leaders jailed over anti-Muslim hate crimes\", Guardian, 7 March 2018, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/07/britain-first-leaders-convicted-of-anti-muslim-hate-crimes\">https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/07/britain-first-leaders-convicted-of-anti-muslim-hate-crimes</url> Both leaders have been suspended from social media, along with the main Britain First twitter account. But despite these actions and attempts to proscribe the group,25Labour MP Louise Haigh led a call to proscribe Britain First due to supposed connections with Labour MP Jo Cox's murder in 2016. The perpetrator is thought to have shouted the words \"Britain first\" during the attack, while some claimed he was photographed attending a Britain First rally. But again, the clear link to violence was unproven. Britain First is still able to spread its hate via its website, YouTube and on the streets.</p><p>Despite acknowledgement from government and ad-hoc interventions, current law has been unable to stop these groups. This is because proscription is a counter-terrorism tool; this rightly gives a high bar to cross, evidenced by clear connection to violent acts. However, this leaves a gap in tackling groups that spread antipathy towards people of different race, religion, gender or nationality, specifically because of these characteristics, and who might inspire others to commit hate crimes via hate speech. A new law to designate such groups would allow government to tackle hate before it spreads.</p><p>Table 2: Action taken against the far right - shortfalls and solutions</p><p>GroupsGovernment and Civil Society actionShortfallsHate group designation</p><p>Generation IdentityThe Austrian leader of Generation Identity wants to deliver a speech in the UK to a far-right audienceThe Border Agency bars him from entering the UK on the grounds that his speech was likely to damage cohesionGeneration Identity was invited by the BBC to comment after the Christchurch attackDesignation would prevent Generation Identity from being broadcast</p><p>Britain FirstBritain First leaders banged on the windows of the property of Muslim men they thought were connected to a rape trial and screamed \"paedophiles\" and \"foreigners\"Britain First leaders were jailed for religiously aggravated harassmentBritain First was registered as a political party and contested elections until end of 2017 and is applying to register with the Electoral Commission in Northern IrelandDesignation would suspend Britain First from the electoral roll</p><p>Solution</p><p>Implement a new law that makes up for the current gap, to designate groups that spread hate</p><p>A new law should lay out clear criteria that classifies hate groups.

This would bring unity to ad-hoc approaches that have already been adopted, such as banning Britain First members from joining the police or British Prison Service, or no-platforming at universities.</p><p>The government's previous attempts to implement banning orders for extremist groups struggled with the difficulties of defining nonviolent extremism and understanding its harms.28\"Ministers 'struggle to define extremism'\", BBC, 22 July 2016, accessed July 2019, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-36858631\">https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-36858631</url> Consuming nonviolent extremist or hateful material does not inevitably lead to violence. However, as the judge who sentenced Darren Osborne for the 2017 Finsbury Park terror attack stated, Osborne's obsessive viewing of videos from Britain First and other anti-Muslim figures had played a part in his desire to attack Muslims.29Kevin Rawlinson, \"Darren Osborne jailed for life for Finsbury Park terrorist attack\", Guardian, 2 February 2018, accessed July 2019,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/feb/02/finsbury-park-attack-darren-osborne-jailed\">https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/feb/02/finsbury-park-attack-darren-osborne-jailed</url> The government faces the difficult task of recognising the harms that hate groups can cause, even if it is not manifested in violence, without appearing to limit free speech or take draconian measures.</p><p>Hate group status would help to bridge this gap. Designation would be related to proscription criteria but focus on the impact of hate, rather than terrorism and violence. This coordination would improve effectiveness through a consistent benchmark for action. For example, hate groups should always be prohibited from processions using Section 13 of the Public Order Act (1986). Unlike proscription, designation could be repealed and conditioned on reform, so groups would have less incentive to go underground and more incentive to improve their behaviour.</p><p>The below outlines our proposed mechanism and criteria for designating hate groups, based on existing UK government procedures for proscription. Such a designation could also be used to tackle Islamist groups, like Hizb ut-Tahrir Britain, which has been accused of spreading anti-Semitic and homophobic hate.30Our report Narratives of Division: The Spectrum of Islamist Worldviews in the UK provides an in-depth look at Hizb ut-Tahrir Britain's public messaging.31Luciana Berger, MP referred to Hizb ut-Tahrir as an \"anti-Semitic and homophobic organisation\": Luciana Berger, former Labour MP, statement in Parliamentary Hansard, 17 April 2018, <url normalizedValue=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2018-04-17/debates/9D70B2B4-39D7-4241-ACF8-13F7DFD8AEB2/Anti-Semitism?highlight=hizb%20ut%20tahrir%20semitism#contribution-C1B5E17C-F421-400F-ABFF-357AC2ABAAD0\">https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2018-04-17/debates/9D70B2B4-39D7-4241-ACF8-13F7DFD8AEB2/Anti-Semitism?highlight=hizb%20ut%20tahrir%20semitism#contribution-C1B5E17C-F421-400F-ABFF-357AC2ABAAD0</url></p><p>Criteria</p><p>We define a hate group as:</p><p>Spreading intolerance and antipathy towards people of a different race, religion, gender or nationality, specifically because of these characteristics</p><p>Aligning with extremist ideologies (see Appendix, for examples of far-right and Islamist worldviews), though not inciting violence</p><p>Committing hate crimes or inspiring others to do so via hate speech</p><p>Disproportionately blaming specific groups (based on religion, race, gender or nationality) for broader societal issues</p><p>Designation mechanism</p><p>Drawing the line between free speech and hatred remains a difficult task for policymakers, but lack of intervention has resulted in greater intolerance in public discourse.

Poor preparation could further entrench withdrawal, impede integration and mask individuality. The UK government reacted well to the Christchurch attack by doubling funding to protect religious spaces in preparation for the inevitable offline growth in hate. The Places of Worship scheme is designed to protect spaces that are home to minorities. But without visible responses communities can be left feeling vulnerable. This strategy does nothing to show that minorities are safe and welcome in all public spaces.</p><p>Solution</p><p>Develop an emergency response to online hate after flashpoints, alongside tech companies</p><p>The Online Harms White Paper is an encouraging first step to prevent harm from hate speech. Our Institute has previously published on the importance of a new approach to regulating internet companies that is fit for the modern world.37Chris Yiu, A New Deal for Big Tech: Next-Generation Regulation Fit for the Internet Age, Institute for Global Change, 1 November 2013, accessed July 2019, <url normalizedValue=\"https://institute.global/insight/renewing-centre/new-deal-big-tech\">https://institute.global/insight/renewing-centre/new-deal-big-tech</url> Adopting this approach will be vital in preparing for rapid responses to flashpoints and to mitigate the harms caused by surges in online hate.</p><p>Government should work with tech companies, using their expertise to inoculate against the harm online hate causes after major incidents. Discussion should begin by identifying a shared goal in tackling flashpoints, starting from a precautionary position that acknowledges the harms of hate. Any measures taken to reduce hate during flashpoints for example more aggressive content removal or increased downranking for a specified period through additional emergency algorithms would need to establish consensus on the trade-off between potential harm from hate and restrictions on free speech. It would also need to confront issues of capability, such as detecting and assessing content at scale and speed.</p><p>There are already goals for turnaround times. In 2017, half of the violent extremist content on YouTube was removed in two hours.38Susan Wojcicki, \"Official Blog Expanding our work against abuse of our platform\", YouTubeGoogle Blog, 4 December 2017, <url normalizedValue=\"https://youtube.googleblog.com/2017/12/expanding-our-work-against-abuse-of-our.html\">https://youtube.googleblog.com/2017/12/expanding-our-work-against-abuse-of-our.html</url> The European Commission has called for a one-hour removal time for extremist and terror content.39Paresh Dave, \"YouTube, under pressure for problem content, takes down 58 million videos in quarter\", Reuters, 13 December 2018, accessed in July 2019,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-alphabet-google-youtube/youtube-under-pressure-for-problem-content-takes-down-58-million-videos-in-quarter-idUKKBN1OC2F6\">https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-alphabet-google-youtube/youtube-under-pressure-for-problem-content-takes-down-58-million-videos-in-quarter-idUKKBN1OC2F6</url> This paper outlines how to define the grey space of what counts as hatred, particularly against religion, which will further help to clarify how companies should act.</p><p>Beyond how tech companies respond is the question of which incidents are significant enough to prompt a change in how content is handled, and for how long. This call is likely to be beyond the core activities of any new tech regulator, and could instead be handled by government's existing emergency response apparatus or a new government body with powers to deem an incident major. To guard against excessive use of these powers, there could be an automatic time limit (for example 48 hours after an event) and a process to review previous designations. This should explore whether the criteria for designation were correct and followed, and whether compliance or 'best effort' was acceptable. Such a joint response could avoid potentially less democratic measures, such as the Sri Lankan government's blocking of all social media following the April 2019 bombings.</p><p>Figure 5: Current and proposed regulation to prevent online harms</p><p>When hate moves offline, broaden current governments efforts and reserve funding to visibly protect minorities in all public spaces</p><p>While some events are unpredictable, others like elections are known in advance.

Plans to increase policing to respond to hate surging in the event of a No Deal Brexit need to be replicated for other major incidents.</p><p>When hate does happen, prosecute it more effectively</p><p>When hate does happen, prosecute it more effectively</p><p>Legislation around hate crime remains patchy. Prosecutions, especially for religious hate, are challenging because of a high burden of proof, inconsistent legal definitions and poor data collection.41This may be because crimes can be recorded as being motivated by several factors. One study showed that more than half of religious hate crimes reported to the police were also recorded as race hate crimes. While the Home Office acknowledges multiple motivating factors, they fail to provide a breakdown in their official statistics. By ensuring prosecutions reflect the rise in incidents, government can prove its commitment to a cohesive society.42Prosecutions are only one part of a victim's journey toward justice. Others have done important work on victim support, restorative justice and general awareness of criminal proceedings in minority communities.</p><p>There are several laws to prosecute hate crime. The Crime and Disorder Act (CDA) (1998) covers existing criminal offences like assault or harassment if they are motivated by racial or religious reasons. Because of their divisive motivation, they carry higher sentences than the same non-aggravated offence.43The Minister of State for the Home Department listed the legislation prosecutions are brought under for perpetrators of hate crime and racist abuse, HC Deb, 15 July, CW, accessed July 2019. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2016-07-08.42267.hands=public+order+act+1986+prosecutions#g42267.r0\">https://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2016-07-08.42267.hands=public+order+act+1986+prosecutions#g42267.r0</url> Sections 145 and 146 of the Criminal Justice Act can also increase sentences if motivation by hate can be proven. Incitement to racial hatred is prosecuted under the Public Order Act (POA) 1986, while religious hatred is covered under the same Act as amended by the Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006.</p><p>The CDA gives equivalent language to prosecute for both racially or religiously aggravated offences. In the POA , however, the language for incitement, and therefore burden of proof, is different. This is affecting prosecutions; from 2007 to 2012 there were 42 guilty verdicts for racial incitement to hatred, while there were only nine for religious incitement to hatred.44The Minister of State, Ministry of Justice, listed the number of defendants and outcomes of trials under sections 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 29B, 29C, 29D, 29E and 29F of the Public Order Act 1986, HL Deb, 2 April 2014, accessed July 2019, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2014-04-02a.208.1\">https://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2014-04-02a.208.1</url></p><p>Table 4: New Labour tried to increase protections for religious hatred, which were ultimately thwarted by Conservatives in the House of Lords.</p><p>2001-2002New Labour tries to outlaw incitement to religious hatred in Anti-Terrorism Crime and Security Bill, but the clause fails after oppisition from the House of Lords</p><p>2004-2005The House of Lords blocks a new attempt by New Labour to outlaw incitement to religious hatred</p><p>June 2005New Labour introduces the Racial and Religious Hatred Bill</p><p>October 2005The House of Lords waters down New Labour's Bill and removes references to \"abusive and insulting words or behaviour\" and \"likelihood that it will incite racial hatred\"</p><p>February 2006Bill receives Royal Assent</p><p>In the wake of 9/11, concerned with a spike in hate crime, the Labour government tried to increase protections for religion through the Racial and Religious Hatred Bill (2006) (see table 4). Opponents of the Bill were concerned that the proposal would limit freedom to criticise or joke about religion. In the face of a public campaign, the Lords again watered down clauses, limiting protections to \"threatening words or behaviour\". But lawyers warned that free speech provisions in the RRHA were so broad that prosecutors would be deterred from bring forward a case of religious incitement.45\"Religious hatred a crime from October, but exemptions are wide\", The Register, 13 September 207, accessed July 2019, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/09/13/religious_hatred_act/\">https://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/09/13/religious_hatred_act/</url></p><p>These objections led to difference in defining religious incitement and a high bar of evidence to prove it. Besides the ability to ridicule, insult and abuse, the added need to prove intent and motivation behind an attack is a much higher evidence bar to cross, which is not the case for racial incitement.</p><p>To prosecute a crime the CPS has a two-stage test. The first looks to see whether there is enough evidence for both the basic crime (the attack) and the aggravating offence (racial or religious motivation).

Recognising anti-Muslim hatred is not about restricting free speech, but acknowledging the harm that British Muslims are experiencing.

If you use social media, there's only one place you'll go to help you gather everything neatly in a single online scrapbook.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">PWhile the world obsesses about Facebook, Google and Twitter, Pinterest is quietly dominating the world of design, planning and practical ideas.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The company has 700,000 active users in Ireland, who 'pin' 260,000 items every day.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Its global figures make it one of the most powerful online platforms for advertisers; 250 million users a month, two billion searches and three billion Pinterest 'boards'.</p><p>Its financials, though undisclosed, are reportedly at about (EURO)700m revenue with a valuation of around (EURO)11bn, roughly half that of Twitter (which is a few years older).</p><p>Amid such strong numbers (it is only eight years old), the company's co-founder and CEO, Ben Silbermann, is targeting Dublin as an important expansion hub in Europe.</p><p>\"Dublin is our biggest office in Europe and we plan to double its size next year,\" he says in a quiet Iowa accent.</p><p>\"To be honest, we really didn't have that much experience [in selecting a major European office] but we heard from a lot of other companies that they had access to great talent in Dublin, that it had become a little bit of hub,\" he says.</p><p>\"So we ended up following those companies there. It's been a great success so far.\"</p><p>Silbermann's Irish base is being used to leverage a concerted push into the European market, one of the company's strongest - 80pc of sign-ups to Pinterest are outside the US, he says.</p><p>\"A few years ago we were primarily a US-based service,\" he says. \"We made a very dedicated effort to try to grow around the world.</p><p>\"We had a few focus regions and one of them was Western Europe. We've seen great pickup in the UK, France, Ireland and Germany.</p><p>\"So now we're starting to open up the advertising business in those markets as well.\"</p><p>While Europe seems to be taking to Pinterest, it has arguably become a more challenging place to do business for a big American tech company, especially one focused on an online product that naturally lends itself to sharing stuff and advertising.</p><p>GDPR alone has forced some big US firms into a rethink of how they approach their users as 'products' online.</p><p>Does a stricter European climate affect the way Pinterest is designing and building its own service? \"I think where it will affect things is in the future of online advertising,\" says Silbermann.</p><p>\"And in making sure that consumers understand this pretty complicated world of how online advertising works.</p><p>\"It's something that, as a smaller player that's coming at it later than a Facebook or Google, hopefully we can learn from some of the things they've dealt with. Hopefully people will feel like their expectations on how the service works are being met.</p><p>\"Very often, people are more than willing to share if they can see a benefit back. \"Where they become concerned is when they don't realise what's going on. So we've tried to be very clear about that. Everything from our terms of service to features of the product are very clear.\"</p><p>Does he think that Europe is pushing too hard on privacy law, as some other big tech companies have privately grumbled? \"I'm not sure,\" he says. \"You know, I tend to think that laws are passed because people have concerns.</p><p>\"Our position is that we try to listen to those very carefully and stay ahead of that. And then of course we want to make sure we're fully in compliance with all laws and regulations. We invested to make sure that was the case.\"</p><p>One frequent cause of tension between big web companies and regulators is online advertising. For consumers, too, it can be a source of irritation with disruptive or annoying ads souring their experience.</p><p>But whereas we gripe about ads appearing in WhatsApp, we don't seem too fussed about ads on Pinterest.</p><p>Indeed, the platform may be one of the most fortunate services around in that those planning an event may genuinely like to see ads for stuff they're avidly researching.</p><p>\"At its core, there's a basic alignment between what consumers are there to do with the regular product and what advertisers want to do,\" says Silbermann.</p><p>\"Consumers are there to get inspiration to do things in their life. Advertisers are there to be discovered.</p><p>\"One of the top requests that we get from our users is when they see something they like and say, 'I really want to know where I can buy that'.</p><p>\"So in this case, ads can actually fulfil that desire. Now it's a ton of work to actually make sure that we fulfil that promise.\" There is another trope about Pinterest, that it's mainly for women. This appears to be supported by most surveys, which show a female skew in Pinterest's user base of about four to one.</p><p>Is this set to continue? \"It was initially adopted more by women, yeah,\" says Silbermann. \"And then by men. But today, honestly we see both men and women using it.</p><p>\"They use it in quite a similar way, to get inspiration to do something in their life. So kind of runs the gamut from small things like 'what do I cook for dinner' to outfits to bigger projects.</p><p>\"We have a lot of creative professionals who use it for things like making movies. It's a tool. Designers and directors are strong users, he says.</p><p>\"The director of the movie 'Crazy Rich Asians', just came by the office. He said that he used Pinterest for a lot of his set inspiration and designs. That's something that we hear quite a lot.</p><p>\"Last year, some of the writers from [Netflix series] 'Stranger Things' came over to show their boards for inspiration.\"</p><p>Where will Pinterest go next in terms of product development? \"At a high level, I think Pinterest will remain the same for a long time,\" he says. \"It comes back to this idea of giving people inspiration in life.</p><p>\"That said, we're investing in a few areas to make that better. One is that we're really investing heavily in personalisation.</p><p>\"We want to make sure that when you open Pinterest, it feels like everything's been handpicked for you.</p><p>\"So we've invested both in machine learning as a technology platform and specifically in computer vision.\"</p><p>One such feature is the ability to pick part of an image and hunt for similar styles. \"I think computer vision has been something that people have spoken about for years,\" he says.</p><p>\"But it's just getting to that point where it's going mainstream. So we're investing in a pretty big way.\"</p><p>Another thing the company is working on, Silbermann says, is making it possible to do more when you see something that \"inspires\" you on Pinterest.</p><p>\"That means different things for different types of pins for a recipe,\" he says. \"It might mean that you can leave a review or actually buy the product, or be sent directly to a retailer.</p><p>\"This distinguishes Pinterest from being something that just keeps you online to something that can hopefully get you offline to do those things right.\"</p><p>'Dublin is our biggest office in Europe and we plan to double its size next year'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Recipe for success: Ben Silbermann, Co-Founder and CEO of Pinterest says it has invested heavily in machine learning so that the site feels as if it has been 'handpicked' for its users</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRIIND-143410460</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRIIND2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TNX-FJ91-DYTY-C0TT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304313</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1154\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Independent Newspapers Ireland Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Irish Independent</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"40446\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 8, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Wagner[1] Stephen A. Rutenberg[2] Polsinelli PC[3] Polsinelli BitBlog | FinTech [4] As the summer continues to heat up so does the digital asset industry with two major developments.The Libra announcement last month represented a milestone in the cryptocurrency industry. Libra, with the backing of mainstream tech players like Facebook and traditional financial firms like MasterCard, became the first cryptocurrency with the potential to go 'mainstream.' Everyone knows about bitcoin, but even bitcoin still has an aura of inaccessibility to it and the price volatility of bitcoin makes its use as an everyday currency difficult to imagine. </p><p>Libra, on the other hand, with its Facebook backing, access to potentially billions of users, as well its built-in price stability could quickly surpass bitcoin in terms of value and utility. The intense media and government attention that Libra has received, even prior to its launch, demonstrates the power of Facebook and other big tech firms in bringing mainstream attention to cryptocurrencies. That is not to say, however, that the mainstream and regulatory reception of Libra has been positive. Central bankers and finance ministers from the United States, France, and England have spoken out against the coin. President Trump recently tweeted his disdain for cryptocurrencies and suggested that Facebook may need a banking charter. Senators from both parties lit into Facebook executive David Marcus in a recent Senate Banking Committee hearing. Even Mark Cuban, the outspoken tech entrepreneur and star of the reality show 'Shark Tank' panned Libra as a 'big mistake.' Additionally there are many unanswered questions about how Libra will work and where will be it be legal.Setting aside for a moment the strong individual and corporate personalities involved, the largely negative reception to Libra can be viewed both as the natural growing pains of a new technology that threatens the status quo and a sign that that cryptocurrencies still face major legal and technical hurdles to gaining widespread acceptance.On a different note, Blockstack, a company that allows developers to build decentralized apps, announced on July 10, 2019 that it had become the first company ever to offer digital tokens regulated by the SEC. The Blockstack token will not be a currency but rather a digital representation of a security. Blockstack said that it had been granted qualification under SEC's Regulation A+ registration exemption, which allows small issuers to solicit non-accredited investors without all of the hassle of a full IPO. Blockstack's offering, while not as potentially revolutionary to everyday life as Libra, is certainly a breakthrough in legal and regulatory circles for those working for the digitization of assets. However, it's unlikely that the Blockstack approval heralds an opening of the floodgates to SEC-approved digital coin offerings.Notably, a number of companies have tried using the Reg A+ exemption to make initial coin offerings over the past two years with little success. There is no indication from the SEC that Blockstack's approval will change the landscape. The economic case for issuing digital assets via a Reg A+ has not been proven, particularly since the cost of securing the SEC approval will likely prohibit many other would-be ICO contenders from seeking a similar path to market.In sum, with regard to both LIBRA and Blockstack, only time will tell whether the summer of 2019 is remembered not only for its record heat waves but as the moment when the movement to decentralized digital assets and currencies took an important step toward mainstream adaptation.

Libra, with the backing of mainstream tech players like Facebook and traditional financial firms like MasterCard, became the first cryptocurrency with the potential to go 'mainstream.' Everyone knows about bitcoin, but even bitcoin still has an aura of inaccessibility to it and the price volatility of bitcoin makes its use as an everyday currency difficult to imagine. </p><p>Libra, on the other hand, with its Facebook backing, access to potentially billions of users, as well its built-in price stability could quickly surpass bitcoin in terms of value and utility. The intense media and government attention that Libra has received, even prior to its launch, demonstrates the power of Facebook and other big tech firms in bringing mainstream attention to cryptocurrencies. That is not to say, however, that the mainstream and regulatory reception of Libra has been positive. Central bankers and finance ministers from the United States, France, and England have spoken out against the coin. President Trump recently tweeted his disdain for cryptocurrencies and suggested that Facebook may need a banking charter. Senators from both parties lit into Facebook executive David Marcus in a recent Senate Banking Committee hearing. Even Mark Cuban, the outspoken tech entrepreneur and star of the reality show 'Shark Tank' panned Libra as a 'big mistake.' Additionally there are many unanswered questions about how Libra will work and where will be it be legal.Setting aside for a moment the strong individual and corporate personalities involved, the largely negative reception to Libra can be viewed both as the natural growing pains of a new technology that threatens the status quo and a sign that that cryptocurrencies still face major legal and technical hurdles to gaining widespread acceptance.On a different note, Blockstack, a company that allows developers to build decentralized apps, announced on July 10, 2019 that it had become the first company ever to offer digital tokens regulated by the SEC. The Blockstack token will not be a currency but rather a digital representation of a security. Blockstack said that it had been granted qualification under SEC's Regulation A+ registration exemption, which allows small issuers to solicit non-accredited investors without all of the hassle of a full IPO. Blockstack's offering, while not as potentially revolutionary to everyday life as Libra, is certainly a breakthrough in legal and regulatory circles for those working for the digitization of assets. However, it's unlikely that the Blockstack approval heralds an opening of the floodgates to SEC-approved digital coin offerings.Notably, a number of companies have tried using the Reg A+ exemption to make initial coin offerings over the past two years with little success. There is no indication from the SEC that Blockstack's approval will change the landscape. The economic case for issuing digital assets via a Reg A+ has not been proven, particularly since the cost of securing the SEC approval will likely prohibit many other would-be ICO contenders from seeking a similar path to market.In sum, with regard to both LIBRA and Blockstack, only time will tell whether the summer of 2019 is remembered not only for its record heat waves but as the moment when the movement to decentralized digital assets and currencies took an important step toward mainstream adaptation. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-JSUP1054111564594558622251764500170</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">JSUP-5263</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WPH-09G1-JCMN-Y47K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"606\"/><timeReceived>5:35 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>JD Supra</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 31, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Intelis still appealing its antitrust case, which began 15 years ago, even as it has become more powerful than ever in PC chips.</p><p>And despite five years of scrutiny by European regulators, Googleshowcases its own services prominently, such as maps and reviews, in its search results.</p><p>In the formal antitrust charges filed on Wednesday, the European Commission complained only about the results of Google's shopping searches, noting that investigators were examining other types of search. The agency also began an investigation into how Googlebundles its apps with its Android smartphone software, an inquiry that also isn't likely to reach a quick resolution.</p><p>''The remedy issues are great challenges for antitrust,'' said Harry First, a law professor at New York University who has written a book about <person><nameText>Microsoft's </nameText></person>antitrust troubles. ''These companies are big and smart and they know their businesses better than the regulators do.''</p><p>The slow process of regulatory enforcement is often at odds with the speed at which tech companies must move, which means that even the $1.4 billion fine faced by Intelcan seem like a tolerable cost of business to a company that has $14 billion in cash and liquid assets.</p><p>Antitrust issues are not the only legal challenges facing American tech companies in Europe. Regulators and lawmakers are reviewing low-tax arrangements granted to Apple in Ireland and Amazon in Luxembourg, and privacy watchdogs are looking into how Facebook protects people's online data. Policy makers are also investigating whether American Internet platforms have too much control over how Europeans gain access to online services.</p><p>Even if regulators do not require substantial changes in how these companies do business, all of these fights impose a cost. In addition to negative publicity, legal costs and possible penalties, the cases are a distraction, forcing companies to defend an existing business model to regulators when perhaps they should be abandoning it because of a changing market.</p><p>Rapidly changing technology - rather than regulatory pressure - has been far more important historically in weakening the dominance of big tech companies.</p><p>''All the successful firms in the PC and early web businesses missed mobile or were late to it,'' said Timothy Bresnahan, a professor of economics at Stanford who worked for the Justice Department on antitrust matters and has also consulted for Microsoft, Inteland Googleover the years.</p><p>Microsoftand Intel, focused with PCs, both missed the rise of tablet computers and smartphones, allowing companies like Apple, Googleand Qualcomm to become dominant players in mobile devices.</p><p>For Google, mobile apps are now nipping at the primacy of its lucrative web searches as cellphone users pull up Amazon or Yelp to search directly for products or restaurant reviews.</p><p>In a blog post responding to Europe's charges, Googlenoted, ''Today seven out of every eight minutes on mobile devices is spent within apps - in other words, consumers are going to whichever websites or apps serve them best. And they face no friction or costs in switching between them.''</p><p>Still, the watchful eyes of regulators play an important role in keeping companies' power in check, and Google's competitors cheered the European Commission's actions, which have been much tougher than those of American regulators.</p><p>''Googleengages in preferencing and manipulates search results so that consumers see content that benefits Google, not the best content for consumers,'' Stephen Kaufer, chief executive of TripAdvisor, a travel review site, said in a statement. ''Today's announcement by the commissioner is the first step to making search on Googlebetter for consumers.''</p><p>Microsoft, which has played a leading role in organizing industry opposition to Googlein Europe, was similarly pleased.</p><p>''Clearly every company needs to obey the same legal rules of the road,'' the software company said in a statement. ''Today's decision provides to Googlea full opportunity to explain its views at a hearing, and the commission will then have the opportunity to decide whether European legal rules have been respected.''</p><p>Of course, as Microsoftwell knows, that is just the beginning of a long process. Microsofttangled with European regulators off and on for 20 years, starting in 1993, before finally paying its last fine and ending its appeals.</p><p>Some American tech companies have chosen an alternative approach.</p><p>Facebook put itself under European regulatory scrutiny in 2010 by establishing a regional headquarters in Dublin. That means the privacy practices of the social network are generally overseen by Irish regulators, who have traditionally been less confrontational than those in other countries.</p><p>''We have an ongoing dialogue with our regulator, the Irish data protection commissioner, who oversees our compliance with the E.U. data protection directive as implemented under Irish law,'' said Sally Aldous, a Facebook spokeswoman in London. ''We routinely review product and policy updates with them.''</p><p>Europe has stricter privacy laws than the United States, and Facebook says that its conversations with Irish regulators have led to improvements for all of its 1.3 billion global users, including better tools to review and delete individual posts and clearer explanations of the company's privacy practices.</p><p>Facebook argues that under European law, it is insulated from separate oversight by other European countries. Despite that, government watchdogs in at least six nations - France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Belgium and the Netherlands - have opened investigations into whether the company's new privacy policies comply with local rules.</p><p>''We have investigated Google. Now, it's time to focus on Facebook,'' said Mathias Moulin, deputy director of enforcement at the French data protection regulator. ''They are the leader in social networks.''</p><p>Europe's highest court is also hearing a case that focuses on how Facebook moved European data outside the region. And a class-action lawsuit in Austria, which could lead to a fine of around $12 million, contends that Facebook has not respected the online privacy rights of its users.</p><p>Amazon, bowing to concerns raised by Edward J. Snowden's revelations of United States government surveillance of American tech companies, decided last fall to open a data center in Germany for its web services division.</p><p>The company already had a data center in Ireland, but both German and European Union regulations have restrictions on storing some of their citizens' personal data across a national or regional boundary.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-1951914</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5FSB-6FH1-JC85-N3JP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1202\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>International New York Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"04\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>April 17, 2015 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0001X0M</classCode><className>INTEL CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

For instance, the study found that while 56% of publishers trade the majority of their inventory with an ads.txt file attached\u2014an IAB Tech Lab initiative to combat fraud\u2014only 6% of advertisers and 26% of agencies do so.</p><p>Townsend Feehan, CEO, IAB Europe, said the findings were encouraging, given the current heightened scrutiny over how ad tech uses personal data, but also highlighted how stakeholders in the sector will have to address issues such as skills shortages as well as transparency.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s encouraging to see the majority of stakeholders expecting an increase in programmatic investments of up to 80% over the next 12 months,\u201d she added.</p><p>\u201cIt is clear however that talent, the low buy-side adoption of ads.txt and supply chain transparency remain impediments to this growth, and these are areas we will be addressing with our members.\u201d</p><p>The study also reveals a clear shift to hybrid models for programmatic trading as the number of advertisers with in-house operations overtakes the number outsourcing to an agency, alongside an increase in the number using external consultancies. Marketers using consultancies for programmatic buying grew to 7% in 2019, up from zero 12 months beforehand, while 52% said they were considering in-housing in the next 12 months.</p><p>Increased scrutiny over how the ad-tech ecosystem uses the public\u2019s personal data\u2014as symbolized by GDPR-enforcement from May 2018 plus the upcoming California Consumer Privacy Act\u2014has prompted all of the industry\u2019s major platforms to follow suit.</p><p>For instance, earlier this year Google announced its intention to clamp down on tech companies monitoring user behavior within its Chrome browser in ways it deems inappropriate. And while this stops short of Apple and Mozilla\u2019s prohibition of third-party cookies, it is a harbinger of things to come and a move that could be seen as diminishing the interests of independent ad tech.</p><p>Last week, Jordan Mitchell, svp membership and operations at the IAB Tech Lab, proposed that the industry coalesces around new standards for consumer privacy in a way that doesn\u2019t solely advance the competitive interests of the industry\u2019s top players.</p><p>\u201cWe must set ourselves on an orderly path to rethink the cookie\u2014an early, jerry-rigged internet technology that has far outlived its usefulness\u2014and embrace a new paradigm of clear privacy settings and consumer controls tied to a standardized identifier,\u201d he wrote in a blog post.</p><p>Meanwhile, one announcement that stood out among the flurry of Dmexco press releases came from Factual (a company that effectively pressed pause on much of its European offering ahead of GDPR enforcement last year), which said today it was rekindling operations there. Factual was not the only U.S.-based outfit to dial-down European operations ahead of GDPR, with many observers asserting that the legislation only served to consolidate the leading positions of big tech.</p><p>However, the location data company today announced that its audience targeting, measurement and insights products will be available in Europe, with the company claiming to now have aligned its data sourcing methods to privacy regulation in the region.</p><p>\u201cOver the past year, Factual completed its implementation of systems and processes to reintroduce these products under the GDPR,\u201d reads the company\u2019s press release.</p><p>\u201cThe company is now working with a select group of data suppliers, having vetted their compliance systems and processes to verify suppliers are providing data with needed consents from consumers.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ADWEEK-1078198</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ADWEEK2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X1J-C7K1-JC8H-T0GT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7907</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"731\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Mediabistro Holdings, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>adweek.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 11, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Jon Tester, D-Mont., in an interview with American Banker. \"I just think that we need to make sure that they're doing everything right to protect consumers' privacy and their money. And I think that's what's really critically important. I think that the cryptocurrency is going to move forward. We need to make sure that it's done and done right. Facebook has assured us in the hearings \" that they were going to do it right.\"</p><p>Ahead of the Libra hearings, House Financial Services Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters, D-Calif., circulated draft legislation to keep large technology companies from entering the financial services world and developing their own currencies.</p><p>The proposal would prohibit large technology firms with more than $25 billion in annual global revenue from establishing and operating a digital asset that is intended to be used as a \"medium of exchange, unit of account, store of value, or any other similar function.\"</p><p>At the House hearing Wednesday, Waters said her draft \"would prevent large platform utilities like Facebook from becoming financial institutions and block them from creating their own currencies.\"</p><p>That bill would likely meet widespread opposition from Republicans, who warned that efforts to stop Facebook from launching Libra would stifle innovation.</p><p>\"Washington must go beyond the hype and ensure that it is not the place where innovation goes to die,\" said Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., the House panel's top Republican. \"Just because we may not fully understanding the technology proposal does not mean we should immediately call for its prohibition, especially when that proposal is just that, a proposal.\"</p><p>But some Democrats also say legislation stopping tech firms' financial services aims would be inappropriate.</p><p>\"I think that's a bridge too far,\" Rep. Bill Foster, D-Ill., said in an interview Wednesday. \"We are in a situation where the giant banks all have tentative plans to effectively turn themselves into tech companies. The tech companies are rapidly moving into things we have traditionally thought of as banking. So that there are like these pair of goliaths facing off each other across a chasm and we have to make sure that the American public is not crushed in the ensuing fight.\"</p><p>To be sure, nearly all lawmakers on the House Financial Services and Senate Banking panels were critical of Facebook in their questioning of David Marcus, head of the company's Calibra digital wallet. Citing previous scandals at Facebook, they focused on issues such as data security, privacy, anti-money-laundering compliance and a host of other regulatory concerns.</p><p>\"Facebook has shown time after time after time that it's undermined and betrayed the public trust. \" I can't imagine there's anything that would make very many of us comfortable thinking that Facebook had that kind of impact on families' paychecks,\" Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, told reporters Tuesday.</p><p>Brown said legislation to block Facebook from pursuing Libra would be in order \"if they are arrogant enough to just blast ahead on this.\"</p><p>But Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., told American Banker that while he is not necessarily a supporter of Facebook's Libra project, he isn't ready to back legislation to keep big tech firms out of financial services.</p><p>\"I have profound misgivings and concerns about Libra,\" Himes said Wednesday. \"But I'm also not quite ready to jump on a fairly reflexive effort. \" Again, I'm not necessarily a supporter of Libra, but I think innovation is really important. I think we need to have a long and robust conversation, so as of today, I am not a supporter of the legislation.\"</p><p>Aside from the split between lawmakers on whether Facebook should move forward with Libra at all, it's unclear to Congress how Libra would need to be regulated. Both parties appeared skeptical of Facebook's proposed approach.</p><p>Facebook is proposing for Libra's governing association, which includes representatives from the payments and technology industries such as Mastercard, PayPal and eBay, to be regulated by the Swiss Financial Markets Supervisory Authority. Libra would also register with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network as a money-services business.</p><p>Those plans drew questions from lawmakers over concerns that U.S. regulations would be put on the back burner if Libra is regulated in Switzerland. The influence of the individual member firms on the Libra association also gave lawmakers pause.</p><p>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell warned lawmakers earlier this month that the Fed does \"not have oversight over Facebook.\"</p><p>\"The privacy rules that we apply to banks, we have no authority to apply them to Facebook or to Libra,\" Powell told members of the Senate Banking Committee.</p><p>That led Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, to ask whether Congress needs to create a new regulator.</p><p>\"I think that is exactly the question we need to be focused on, one of the many questions we need to be focused on,\" Powell said in response. \"It isn't obvious at all from our current regulatory system that we have in place what we need to provide oversight over this.\"</p><p>Sen. Doug Jones, D-Ala., told American Banker Thursday that establishing a financial regulatory framework for tech firms needs to be \"seriously looked at.\"</p><p>But he added he likely would not support legislation to block major tech companies from operating like banks.</p><p>\"Not just as a broad brush, I wouldn't,\" Jones said. \"But I think we have to look at everything on an individual basis. This is ... an emerging area and I think that we have to do a really good job of trying to figure out where this is going.\"</p><p>Foster said that he wouldn't create another regulator in the cryptocurrency field, but that it might be appropriate for banking regulators to step in.</p><p>\"We don't need another regulator in this,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AMBNKR-0000016c-0a8d-dc12-ad7f-ae8f4d940000-139</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AMBNKR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WM2-6621-JCRW-5363-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303174</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1053\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SourceMedia LLC d/b/a Arizent.

Jon Tester, D-Mont., in an interview with American Banker. \"I just think that we need to make sure that they're doing everything right to protect consumers' privacy and their money. And I think that's what's really critically important. I think that the cryptocurrency is going to move forward. We need to make sure that it's done and done right. Facebook has assured us in the hearings \" that they were going to do it right.\"</p><p>Ahead of the Libra hearings, House Financial Services Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters, D-Calif., circulated draft legislation to keep large technology companies from entering the financial services world and developing their own currencies.</p><p>The proposal would prohibit large technology firms with more than $25 billion in annual global revenue from establishing and operating a digital asset that is intended to be used as a \"medium of exchange, unit of account, store of value, or any other similar function.\"</p><p>At the House hearing Wednesday, Waters said her draft \"would prevent large platform utilities like Facebook from becoming financial institutions and block them from creating their own currencies.\"</p><p>That bill would likely meet widespread opposition from Republicans, who warned that efforts to stop Facebook from launching Libra would stifle innovation.</p><p>\"Washington must go beyond the hype and ensure that it is not the place where innovation goes to die,\" said Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., the House panel's top Republican. \"Just because we may not fully understanding the technology proposal does not mean we should immediately call for its prohibition, especially when that proposal is just that, a proposal.\"</p><p>But some Democrats also say legislation stopping tech firms' financial services aims would be inappropriate.</p><p>\"I think that's a bridge too far,\" Rep. Bill Foster, D-Ill., said in an interview Wednesday. \"We are in a situation where the giant banks all have tentative plans to effectively turn themselves into tech companies. The tech companies are rapidly moving into things we have traditionally thought of as banking. So that there are like these pair of goliaths facing off each other across a chasm and we have to make sure that the American public is not crushed in the ensuing fight.\"</p><p>To be sure, nearly all lawmakers on the House Financial Services and Senate Banking panels were critical of Facebook in their questioning of David Marcus, head of the company's Calibra digital wallet. Citing previous scandals at Facebook, they focused on issues such as data security, privacy, anti-money-laundering compliance and a host of other regulatory concerns.</p><p>\"Facebook has shown time after time after time that it's undermined and betrayed the public trust. \" I can't imagine there's anything that would make very many of us comfortable thinking that Facebook had that kind of impact on families' paychecks,\" Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, told reporters Tuesday.</p><p>Brown said legislation to block Facebook from pursuing Libra would be in order \"if they are arrogant enough to just blast ahead on this.\"</p><p>But Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., told American Banker that while he is not necessarily a supporter of Facebook's Libra project, he isn't ready to back legislation to keep big tech firms out of financial services.</p><p>\"I have profound misgivings and concerns about Libra,\" Himes said Wednesday. \"But I'm also not quite ready to jump on a fairly reflexive effort. \" Again, I'm not necessarily a supporter of Libra, but I think innovation is really important. I think we need to have a long and robust conversation, so as of today, I am not a supporter of the legislation.\"</p><p>Aside from the split between lawmakers on whether Facebook should move forward with Libra at all, it's unclear to Congress how Libra would need to be regulated. Both parties appeared skeptical of Facebook's proposed approach.</p><p>Facebook is proposing for Libra's governing association, which includes representatives from the payments and technology industries such as Mastercard, PayPal and eBay, to be regulated by the Swiss Financial Markets Supervisory Authority. Libra would also register with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network as a money-services business.</p><p>Those plans drew questions from lawmakers over concerns that U.S. regulations would be put on the back burner if Libra is regulated in Switzerland. The influence of the individual member firms on the Libra association also gave lawmakers pause.</p><p>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell warned lawmakers earlier this month that the Fed does \"not have oversight over Facebook.\"</p><p>\"The privacy rules that we apply to banks, we have no authority to apply them to Facebook or to Libra,\" Powell told members of the Senate Banking Committee.</p><p>That led Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, to ask whether Congress needs to create a new regulator.</p><p>\"I think that is exactly the question we need to be focused on, one of the many questions we need to be focused on,\" Powell said in response. \"It isn't obvious at all from our current regulatory system that we have in place what we need to provide oversight over this.\"</p><p>Sen. Doug Jones, D-Ala., told American Banker Thursday that establishing a financial regulatory framework for tech firms needs to be \"seriously looked at.\"</p><p>But he added he likely would not support legislation to block major tech companies from operating like banks.</p><p>\"Not just as a broad brush, I wouldn't,\" Jones said. \"But I think we have to look at everything on an individual basis. This is ... an emerging area and I think that we have to do a really good job of trying to figure out where this is going.\"</p><p>Foster said that he wouldn't create another regulator in the cryptocurrency field, but that it might be appropriate for banking regulators to step in.</p><p>\"We don't need another regulator in this,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AMBNKR-0000016c-0a8d-dc12-ad7f-ae8f4d940000-1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AMBNKR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKY-5S61-JCRW-52JK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303174</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1053\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SourceMedia LLC d/b/a Arizent.

Stuart is off tonight.</p><p>Technology stocks and the new economy triumphed today on Wall Street. Investors picked up computer and Internet-related names and dumped financial and interest-rate sensitive stocks after a report on factory production showed surprising strength.  But aside from economic news, the day was marked by a handful of corporate bombshells.</p><p>Greg Clarkin reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GREG CLARKIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Overall, it was quiet day on Wall Street, but behind the calm, some dramatic hits and misses.  The Dow posted a modest gain of 26 points for the session; the Nasdaq fared better, gaining 48.</p><p>In a sea of winners, there was at least one high-tech nightmare: Qualcomm shares were crushed after an analyst said he sees no good news for the company in the immediate future.  But Lucent jumped on reports it's moving ahead with the spin-off of its microelectronics business.  Hewlett-Packard, IBM, and Intel also gained.</p><p>Another nightmare, this time in the banking business: Wachovia warning that higher interest rates will mean lower earnings.  Wachovia plunged and other financials fell as well, including Dow stock J.P. Morgan.  Also losing ground, Bank of New York, CitiGroup and Bank of America.</p><p>Despite the quiet trading of recent days, stock watchers are encouraged by some trends.</p><p>BERNADETTE MURPHY, KIMELMAN &amp; BAIRD: Right now, surprisingly enough, the New York Composite, which is all stocks listed on the stock exchange, is in the plus column for the year to date and is ahead of the S&amp;P 500 and, of course, the Dow, which is down, and so that might mean that investors are starting to spread their money around into other industries.</p><p>CLARKIN: Overall, traders say investors are content to sit and wait to see the outcome of the Federal Reserve's meeting in late June.</p><p>GREGG HYMOWITZ, ENTRUST CAPITAL: It's really a matter of what you perceive to be the outcome of the economy in the sense that, does the Fed slam on the brakes too hard, in which case you get a hard landing.  If you get a hard landing, there is very few stocks you really want to own.</p><p>You really have to become defensive, you have to own foods -- food stocks, drug stocks, really defensive names.  To the extent the Fed is able to navigate a soft landing, then you could be a little broader in what you wanted to own.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CLARKIN: But many here don't expect to see trading with any real conviction until the Fed meets, and possibly even beyond that. They're saying they want to get a look at quarterly earnings reports before making any big moves -- Willow.</p><p>BAY: Greg, how severe was that profit warning for Wachovia?</p><p>CLARKIN: It was pretty severe, Willow.  That is such a touchy sector, obviously tied in so heavily to interest rates.  Any time you get a major bank, a regional bank saying that their numbers are going to be weaker because of rising rates, well, that set off a real shiver through the financial industry, and we saw banks pretty much of every size as well as the money center banks and even brokerage houses all effected.</p><p>BAY: Greg Clarkin, thank you.</p><p>CLARKIN: Sure.</p><p>BAY: Taking a closer look now at today's markets: the S&amp;P 500 index rose 8 points, it is now in the plus column for the year. Still, more stocks fell than rose on the big board today, 73 stocks hit new 52-week highs; 51 hit new lows.  In the Treasury market, the 10-year note ended the day unchanged, the yield at 6.04 percent; the 30-year bond lost a quarter of a point, the yield tonight at 5.92 percent.</p><p>Bond prices dropped immediately after a report showed unexpected strength at the nation's factories last month.  Industrial output jumped for the 17th straight month in May, blindsiding economists who expected to see a slowdown.</p><p>Kitty Pilgrim has the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KITTY PILGRIM, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Factories are running at a good clip, with output in May up .4 percent.  That was a big surprise. Economists were actually looking for a drop-off of .3 percent.</p><p>BILL HORNBERGER, A.G. EDWARDS: It's really the first piece of data we've seen above consensus in three or four weeks.  You know, most of the data that we've seen in the last month or so has come in on, you know, the softer side, below consensus, arguing that, you know, maybe there is the beginnings of a slowdown in terms of economic activity.</p><p>PILGRIM: Some sectors in the report showed weakness: autos, consumer durables such as appliances, and construction materials.  But energy components were higher -- as might be expected -- and so was technology.</p><p>Adding today, to the picture of health in the economy were the employment data: fewer people lined up for unemployment last week; 296,000 filed new claims for benefits.  Anything below 300,000 suggests a labor market that remains very tight.</p><p>But today's evidence of economic strength follows an array of weak reports.  And industrial production as an economic indicator is not as important as other factors.  For example, housing, retail sales, factory orders all say more about the day-to-day economy.</p><p>LYNN REASER, BANK OF AMERICA ASSET MGMT.: The industrial sector is only one part of the economy and it really has never been the area that has caused all of the overheating.  The major threat in the economy had been more on the service side.</p><p>PILGRIM (on camera): Tomorrow's economic report, housing starts, will hold more weight with economists.  The housing sector is more subject to interest rate changes and has more trickle-down influence on other sectors of the economy.</p><p>Kitty Pilgrim, CNN Financial News, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BAY: Coming up on MONEYLINE: Word of a possible spin-off for Lucent's laser and chip unit fires up the stock.  We'll tell you what the company is saying and what is at stake if a deal goes through.</p><p>Plus, Heinz posts a tasty profit, but does it have the ingredients for a long-term rise?  We'll ask the CEO, William Johnson.</p><p>And as it settles one discrimination suit, Coke finds itself grappling with another.  We'll tell you why a lawyer who's become a household name is challenging one of corporate America's icons. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: More on the big move now in Lucent stock, shares took off even as Lucent officially declined to comment on reports it may spin off its microelectronics unit.  Embattled Lucent gained more than $3.25, or 6 percent.</p><p>Bruce Francis reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BRUCE FRANCIS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Wall Street is cheering the idea that Lucent may spin-off its microelectronics unit, which makes specialized chips for telecommunications.  That fast- growing business could be worth $40 billion or more, analysts say, and has a wide customer base beyond Lucent.</p><p>JIM KEDERSHA, SG COWEN SECURITIES: I think it would be a very good thing for Lucent.  The microelectronics group at Lucent is a major part of the company, but I think it's being undervalued right now by the stock market.  Lucent has -- even though they're a major player in telecom equipment -- the largest -- they've been plagued by some execution issues.</p><p>FRANCIS: That's putting in mildly.  Back in January, Lucent warned that it would miss Wall Street expectations.  The stock lost almost $50 billion in market value in a single session, and has struggled to regain its status as a tech stock star.  The stock began something of a recovery, as the company announced a series of moves starting in March.</p><p>First, a spin-off of its Enterprise Systems unit, which sells telecom equipment to big businesses.  Then, the company decided to put its power supply division up for sale.  That business, which makes devices to keep the juice flowing in everything from cell phones to big network switches, hasn't found a buyer yet.  And Lucent said it would outsource it non-core manufacturing, all in the past three months.  A spin-off of its microelectronics business, some say, would be a logical next step.</p><p>ARIANE MAHLER, DRESDNER KLEINWORT BENSON: Lucent lately has been moving towards a horizontal business model, where they outsource more and more, and strike contracts with the likes of JDS Uniface, they don't need to rely on their own component makers so much, and frankly, they are unlocking a ton of a value for shareholders by spinning off microelectronics.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FRANCIS: This potential move would make the paired-down Lucent more of a pure play on its business selling equipment to telecom companies, like its new $1.5 billion deal with Verizon, the former Bell Atlantic Mobile -- Willow.</p><p>BAY: Bruce, clearly in the short term, it would boost the stock. But are there any concerns that it would weaken Lucent in the longterm?</p><p>FRANCIS: There are some synergies that could be lost between owning one of your big suppliers, the microelectronics unit, and putting those chips into equipment that Lucent makes.  You might not get an early first look at the best new equipment.  And of course there's the Bell Labs that Lucent is built around.  If that gets split up, that might not make Bell Labs quite the engine of innovation that it has been over the past few years.</p><p>BAY: Is a spin-off here likely?</p><p>FRANCIS: I think it looks good.  Of course, this unit is at the intersection of telecom and semiconductors, something that Wall Street really likes right now, despite the virtual shutdown of the capitol market.  And longterm, it could be very good for this spun-off unit, if that does happen.  After all, it was great for Lucent to get spun off from AT&amp;T.  It opened up to a wider customer base.  Analysts say that could happen for this company should it be spun off.</p><p>BAY: Bruce Francis, thanks.</p><p>The legal battle continues in the Microsoft case.  In its latest legal brief, Microsoft told a federal appeals court today, the 19 states who were party to the government's antitrust victory are not allowed to take their case straight to the Supreme Court.  Microsoft says only the U.S. government is entitled to that kind of direct appeal, and the stakes must remain at the appeals court level for now.</p><p>If Microsoft wins this point, the Supreme Court could turn down the case, knowing that the same issues were already being heard by the lower court.  Stand by for the next paper salvo, since the government is sure to respond.  Shares of Microsoft up nearly 2 today.</p><p>Checking tonight's MONEYLINE \"Movers,\" Conexant Systems jumped 6 1/2, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter upgrading it to a strong buy with a $100 price target.  Osicom Technologies plunged more than 16, the biggest percentage loser on the Nasdaq.  The maker of optical networks posted a greater than expected first quarter loss because of declining sales.  And Nortel Networks gained nearly 3.  Bear Stearns initiated coverage of the telecom company with an attractive rating.  The firm said the stock should outperform the market.  Nortel shares are up 34 percent year-to-date.</p><p>Heinz shares edged higher today after the company posted earnings in line with expectations.  It's one of the most exciting times in the otherwise quiet food business, as a wave of consolidation and deal- making sweep the industry.  And today, Heinz president and CEO Bill Johnson said he'd like to enter the fray.  Well, he joins us now.</p><p>Bill, welcome to MONEYLINE.</p><p>WILLIAM JOHNSON, CEO, H.J. HEINZ: Thank you very much.</p><p>BAY: I believe you said that you're going to be an active player in transforming the food industry.  So what is Heinz's strategy? JOHNSON: Well, I think you have to look at it in a couple of ways.  Clearly, there's going to be consolidation in the industry as the Unilever-Bestfoods deal shows, as the sale on Nabisco shows, and there are a number of other smaller transactions in place.  What we will do is participate, in one way or the other, through some kind of consolidation, or pick up the pieces of a consolidation.</p><p>BAY: All right, one way or another: buyer, seller.</p><p>JOHNSON: You never know, could be whatever's beneficial to our shareholders.</p><p>BAY: Now, Bestfoods reportedly considered some alternatives to Unilever.  Heinz was among the names mentioned.  Would that have been a deal that fit your strategy?</p><p>JOHNSON: Well, I certainly wouldn't have wanted to get in the way between Unilever and Bestfoods.  I think it probably would have been not in the best interest of our shareholders.  So, I think at this time, it would not have been in our interests.  But there are plenty of others out there.</p><p>BAY: What about a Nabisco?</p><p>JOHNSON: Well, Nabisco is a great company, with great brands, and businesses that growing rapidly, and would be of great appeal to us, but again, we don't comment specifically what we're going to do. Just stand by.</p><p>BAY: Stand by, OK.  But does this wave of consolidation then put pressure on other companies in the food industry to get a deal of their own done?</p><p>JOHNSON: No, I think we're growing pretty well on our own.  If you look at our business over the last three years and you take out the effects of currency and divestitures, we've grown our topline at seven percent a year.  So, we don't need consolidation.  We don't need to do anything.  We can go very much a standalone basis and still create a lot of shareholder value.</p><p>BAY: You met earnings estimates.  You had a 5 percent jump, as I understand it now, helped by ketchup sales.  I notice you have a ketchup bottle on there.</p><p>JOHNSON: That's right.</p><p>BAY: Does that mean more people were buying ketchup or more people were buying your ketchup?</p><p>JOHNSON: Both.  Clearly, more people are buying our ketchup. Our shares were up all over the globe.  The category is growing all over the globe.  We're appealing to teens and to kids, which is really the great trend now, how they were seen emerging in food shopping.  So our ketchup business is just really on fire.</p><p>BAY: All right, speaking of trends, this is one that you believe is the wave of future.  It is tuna in a pouch.  I have to say it got a ton of reaction in our office today, not all of it positive.  Why are folks going to like this?  It looks kind of weird.</p><p>JOHNSON: Well, I think they're going to like it because there's no drain, there's no odor, there's no mess, there's no hassle.  Once you use this product, you'll never go back to the can.</p><p>BAY: We'll see.  Thank you very much for joining us.</p><p>JOHNSON: You're welcome.  Thank you.</p><p>BAY: Still ahead on MONEYLINE, a surprise announcement from the man guiding Al Gore's White House run.  We'll tell you about the changes in store for the vice president's campaign in our \"News Digest.\"</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: These stocks hit 52-week lows today, including American Eagle, Outfitters -- sorry, American Eagle Outfitters -- Del Monte Foods, iVillage, Loral Space &amp; Communications, and Sabre Group.</p><p>It's peak season for driving, and gas prices are typically sky- high during the summer.  But this year, prices are particularly steep, with drivers in Chicago forking over more than $50 to fill up their gas-guzzling SUVs.</p><p>Government officials are now scrambling to figure out exactly why prices are surging, as Fred Katayama reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FRED KATAYAMA, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Gas prices keep rocketing higher.  A gallon of regular unleaded gas today set motorists back $1.59 in Los Angeles and $2.33 in Chicago, the highest nationwide.  The Midwest is being hit the hardest, and cab drivers and motorists are fuming.</p><p>GEORGE INKETSIAH, TAXI DRIVER: We are having a very bad time, because once upon a time, it took about $14 to $15 to fill this cab, but now, it takes about $30 and over.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If I have to drive to St. Louis, I might consider flying now.  It's cheaper to fly than it is to drive.</p><p>KATAYAMA: And so Illinois Governor George Ryan is calling on the Environmental Protection Agency to suspend its new cleaner gas rules that he says have fueled the higher prices.</p><p>GOV. GEORGE RYAN, ILLINOIS GOVERNOR: The prices went sky high on June 1, and that's when the new regulations were changed by the EPA.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We need an explanation why that's occurring.  Our investigation, our meetings with the petroleum companies have provided no reasonable answer.</p><p>KATAYAMA: The EPA's new regulations for reformulated gas, analysts estimate, add 3 to 7 cents a gallon.</p><p>Oil analysts say pipeline problems in the Midwest have further tightened the gas supply.  And today, President Clinton asked the transportation department to look into those supply problems.  One solution pitched in the past is loosening restrictions on truckers' hours so more gas can be hauled into the region.  Oil experts say other factors driving up prices nationwide include the spike in crude oil prices, the summer driving season, and the reluctance of some refiners to produce cleaner gas because they fear they would infringe on a patent held by Unocal.</p><p>This week, the Federal Trade Commission began looking into whether anticompetitive practices such as price fixing and collusion are contributing to higher prices.</p><p>(on camera): Despite the spike, when adjusted for inflation, a gallon of gas today still costs 95 cents less than it did when prices peaked in 1981.</p><p>Fred Katayama, CNN Financial News, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BAY: Crude oil prices rose slightly today, as traders questioned whether OPEC will increase production to lower prices.  Light Sweet Crude gained ten cents to settle at $32.95 a barrel.</p><p>A dramatic change revamping today for the Al Gore's campaign staff.  More on that now from Joie Chen in Atlanta in tonight's \"MONEYLINE News News Digest.\" -- Joie.</p><p>JOIE CHEN, CNN ANCHOR: Willow, thanks.  The chairman of Al Gore's presidential campaign announced today that he is stepping down for health reasons, he said.  Tony Coelho, who himself took over the campaign nearly a year ago, will be replaced by commerce secretary William Daley.  Despite the change in staff, Gore says it is business as usual.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AL GORE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Bill is a great leader, and Tony was a great leader.  Bill will bring his own style to the campaign.  And but as far as the direction and the focus of campaign, it will be the same.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHEN: Meanwhile, George W. Bush is campaigning again after a five-day break in Maine.  He launched a 72-hour fundraising drive and proposed a plan worth $880 million to help the disabled.</p><p>Also today, the Miami relatives of Elian Gonzalez asked a federal court to reverse a decision which might allow the Cuban boy to return home.  The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruled two weeks ago that Immigration officials could deny Elian an asylum hearing, which was requested by relatives. In Colorado, two massive wildfires are spreading.  They have already devastated over 13,000 acres.  High winds and scorching temperatures are raising the pressure on firefighters.  And in Northern California, at least two deaths are being blamed on record high temperatures.  Power supplies are expected to be pushed to their limit again today, following blackouts last night.</p><p>Finally this hour, in the U.S. Open, Tiger Woods holds the lead at this hour.  He's currently six under par, a stroke up on the field. I'll have those stories and much more ahead on THE WORLD TODAY, coming up at 8:00 p.m. Eastern, 5:00 Pacific.</p><p>In our \"Tech Watch\" tonight, new evidence of sampling music on the Web could actually help conventional CD sales, despite earlier surveys to the contrary.  That word from a survey by Yankovich (ph) Partners, commissioned by the Digital Media Association, a Web music industry group.  After hearing music streamed radio style, 33 percent of the respondents said they'd be more likely to buy CDs in stores, and after downloading songs from the Web, 31 percent would be inclined to spend money on CDs.  Nearly 70 percent of the consumers questioned said hearing a song online has led them to buy that song on CD or cassette at least once.</p><p>Up next, hedge fund legend George Soros says he wants to play it safe.  His plan when MONEYLINE returns.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: Financier George Soros says he's almost done overhauling his world famous hedge fund group, a transition he started in April after his funds took huge losses in technology stocks.  His new flagship fund will be called the Quantum Endowment Fund.  It's set to debut on July 1, with assets of around $6.5 billion.  Once known for its stunning returns, this fund will aim for steady returns of about 15 percent.  Soros says this fund will invest more in real estate and private equity.  When asked about the overhaul in London, the Hungarian-born Soros said -- quote -- \"In my old age, I've become somewhat conservative.  The perception was that I could move markets and that was to my benefit.  The fact is that I can move markets, but it is to my detriment.\"</p><p>MONEYLINE will be back right after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: In tonight's headlines: Wall Street sends techs back into the black.  Sellers kept at bay, despite another disappointment for one of last year's brightest stars.</p><p>It may be harder to make money, but Roger McNamee says there are bargains to be had.  We'll ask the technology bull what he's buying now.</p><p>And more conflict at Coke.  The soft-drink maker settles one discrimination suit, only to be hit with another.  This one has Johnnie Cochran leading the charge. But first, more on our top story: a quantum leap out of Qualcomm. Investors bailed out of the telecom-equipment maker for the second straight day, as yet one more analyst decided to cut the company's profit forecast.  The stock slumped another $9 after falling nearly $11 yesterday.  This week alone, Qualcomm shares have fallen 22 percent.</p><p>But Qualcomm wasn't the only loser today.  Allan Chernoff has more on a day of duds.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ALLAN CHERNOFF, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A humbling day for technology investors.  The stock that was a metaphor for last year's Nasdaq explosion, Qualcomm, imploded today, plunging 13 percent on three times its average volume.  Qualcomm told investors that wireless-handset sales in Korea, a key market, are slowing.  And there are further problems according to Chase H&amp;Q</p><p>ED SNYDER, CHASE H&amp;Q: China is not going to deploy Qualcomm's technology.  That seems to be clear at this point.  So I think we're -- they're in for a bit of rough water certainly over the next quarter or so.</p><p>CHERNOFF: Even before today, Qualcomm stock had been in a dive, losing two-thirds of its value since the first trading day of the year.  It's the flip side of last year's moon shot, when Qualcomm was a \"wireless wonder,\" soaring from 28 1/2 exactly one year ago.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You can never sell at the top, can you?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm very happy I didn't buy it.</p><p>CHERNOFF: The lessons, say market technicians: Don't try to catch a falling stone.</p><p>JEFFREY DEGRAAF, LEHMAN BROTHERS: The trend has been -- for the intermediate term -- has been down.  And that, to us, has been the warning to stay clear of Qualcomm.  As long as the trend's down, as long as it's making a series of lower lows and lower highs, in our opinion, that's a situation from which we're going to stay away from.</p><p>CHERNOFF: And there was more pain to be shared in the banking sector.  Wachovia Corporation warned that earnings for the quarter and the year will fall below forecast, partly due to rising interest rates.</p><p>Investors worry Wachovia's sneeze could turn into an industry cold, so they cashed out of big bank stocks.  Wachovia lost 19 percent of its value today.  Regionals like Union Planters and Mellon Financial were off 8 percent.</p><p>And another former tech high-flyer, CDnow, tumbled on news that one of its board members was resigning.  True, the Dow and Nasdaq posted modest gains, but decliners beat advancers on both markets.  It was a day for recognizing just how fickle Wall Street can be. (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHERNOFF: No one is actually questioning the quality of Qualcomm's CDMA technology, same wireless protocol that investors were crazy about last year.  But when a stock is priced for perfection, as Qualcomm surely was, there is no room for imperfection.  Even after plunging today, the stock's price earnings ratio is 81, about three times the market multiple -- Willow.</p><p>BAY: Allan Chernoff, thanks.</p><p>Today's drop in Qualcomm only underscores how much the market has changed lately.  Investors have become an unforgiving bunch, who are now taking even the slightest bad news as reason to sell.</p><p>Terry Keenan has more in tonight's look \"Behind the Numbers.\"</p><p>TERRY KEENAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Willow, what a difference six months and a bare market in many Nasdaq stocks makes.  Think back to late December.  In the quiet holiday week before the millennium celebration, Walter Piecyk, a 28-year-old analyst at PaineWebber, set off some fireworks with an outrageous millennium prediction of his own, forecasting that Qualcomm stock would soar to $1,000 a share: $250 based on its subsequent four-for-one stock split.  The audacious estimate set off a buying spree of mammoth proportions.  Qualcomm stock soared more than $190 that day alone, a move that added $30 billion to Qualcomm's market value.</p><p>Back then, Piecyk relied on the new math of the new economy in reaching his headline-grabbing target, and investors lapped it up. Rather than focusing on Qualcomm's current business prospects, Piecyk took out his crystal ball and looked forward to the year 2010.  He told me then an investor would be investing in future cash flow.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALTER PIECYK, PAINEWEBBER: The value in Qualcomm is the fact that their technology is going to be the technology of choice for the next decade.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEENAN: Fast forward to today.  Qualcomm shares are trading 55 percent below where they were the day of Piecyk's call, and today suffered another session of aggressive selling.  The reason: for the second day in a row, an analyst cut earnings estimates for the next quarter and for the year.</p><p>It's a stark reminder, says Chuck Hill of First Call, that we're now in a market that is totally unforgiving.  Forget the fluff, he says.  Today's investors want earnings that are up to snuff right now, not smoke-and-mirrors calculations based on business prospects a decade away.</p><p>Piecyk, by the way, was unavailable for an interview today, but he is clinging to his $250 share price target, although extending his time horizon out until June of 2001 -- Willow?</p><p>BAY: Terry, thanks.</p><p>Qualcomm's quake didn't spread to the rest of the markets today, as strong tech stocks helped boost both the Dow and the Nasdaq.  The Dow industrials tacked on another 26 points today, after gaining 66 yesterday.  The blue-chip average closed at 10,714.</p><p>Over on the Nasdaq, strength in computer and chip stocks helped push the composite index up 48 points to 3,845.</p><p>Checking some of the big movers: Lucent up more than 3 1/4, even after the company declined to comment on reports it may spin off its micro-electronics unit.</p><p>Other movers: Viacom and Oracle, up 3 1/2, while J.P. Morgan fell more than 4 3/4.  And General Motors lost 2 1/2.</p><p>Unexpected strength at the nation's factories weighed on bonds today.  Industrial production jumped 0.4 percent in May, slowing from the revised 0.7 percent gain seen in April, but still higher than economists expected.  Treasuries initially sold off on the news, but the 10-year recovered by the close to end unchanged.  The 30-year: down eight tics.</p><p>Overall, it was a quiet day on Wall Street.  But behind the calm, investors have a lot on their minds.</p><p>Greg Clarkin is here with the details from the New York Stock Exchange -- Greg.</p><p>CLARKIN: Hi there, Willow.</p><p>It was a day, really, of modest gains.  And in speaking with many of the traders on the floor of the NYSE here this afternoon, they say that we're looking at a market that really is just drifting, at this point, with no real defined moves.  Now sure you had big moves in some individual issues today: Lucent, as you mentioned.  Coca-Cola was also up nicely.</p><p>On the down side: Wachovia on its profit warning.  But still, traders are here saying what they're getting the sense is that a lot of folks, in their words, are just \"sitting on their hands,\" waiting for a number of events to pass.</p><p>Now here are some of those key events that they're focusing on: Tomorrow's a \"triple-witching\" day here at the NYSE on the Big Board. And basically that just means the expiration -- simultaneous expiration -- of options, futures, contracts, and the like.  And yes, over the years this has become less of an event here and less volatility.  But still it is an event, and these guys like to see events just past.  So they'll be watching that tomorrow carefully for any volatility that it may bring at the beginning of trading and at the close of trading.</p><p>And then the Fed meeting later in the month, and watching to see what Allan Greenspan does with interest rates.  And then beyond that, they want to get a better sense of where corporate profits are going. So they'll be looking for those second quarter earnings report in about three weeks or so.</p><p>Now a lot has been made of the volume recently.  Just is it -- how much lighter is it than it had been in past?  And they're interesting numbers, once you look at them.  The volume for first two weeks of June on the NYSE: about 900 million shares.  Now compare that to March, when it was over one billion average daily volume.  But if you go back to June of last year, it was just 733 million.  So volume actually has increased year over year, but still it is down from the frenzy that we saw back earlier in the year.  And, Willow, it's a similar pattern over on the Nasdaq as well.</p><p>BAY: Greg, thanks.</p><p>CLARKIN: Sure.</p><p>BAY: Coming up, how to make money in a market that feels like it's going nowhere.  Tech bull Roger McNamee is next here on MONEYLINE.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: If it seems that the Nasdaq is struggling to find direction, well, that's because it is.  In the last nine trading sessions, the Nasdaq has failed to follow through on a trend -- up one day, down the next.  In the end, it's gone nowhere.  But our next guest says you can still make money in this market.  He is Roger McNamee.</p><p>Roger, welcome.</p><p>ROGER MCNAMEE, INTEGRAL CAPITAL PARTNERS: Pleasure to be back.</p><p>BAY: So is it safe yet for investors to get back in to techs?</p><p>MCNAMEE: Well, I don't think it's ever safe to go back into tech stocks, but I do think that things have shaken out enough and prices have come down enough that there, in fact, some places to put money if you're prepared to invest in a time horizon that I think is now measured in years rather than days or weeks.</p><p>I think it's very important to get out of mindset of instant gratification and instant riches.  But if you're willing to do that, if you're willing to think in terms of traditional rates of return, where 20 percent in a year seems like a really good rate of return, I think there's actually a lot of tech stocks that can provide you with above average rates of return going forward.</p><p>BAY: All right, so if we rid ourselves of those dreams of instant riches, can we suggest that we think that worse is over, that nightmare of plunges weaken, vanish to.</p><p>MCNAMEE: I wish I could say that that's the case, but I'll tell you, I learned years ago not to try to predict the future, and so it's not at all obvious to me that the worst is over, but I could tell you that a bad thing has happened.</p><p>Any time you take a group like technology, which is, you know, 30 percent of the S&amp;P 500, and bring it down roughly 50 percent on average, for the average stock, I mean, that seems to me to take a huge amount of risk out of the market.  And it was a 30 percent relative correction in techs.  So I think that for tech relative to the market, yes, the worst is over.  Whether you could say that for market as whole, I'm just not prepared to say, but I also don't think it's relevant.  I think we just have to do our best from here.</p><p>BAY: Roger, let's get your take on some names in the news, a stock you like, Microsoft.</p><p>MCNAMEE: Sure.</p><p>BAY: What should investors be worried about?  A breakup, behavorial constraints or the cloud of the appeals process hanging over it?</p><p>MCNAMEE: I'm -- the latter is the one I'm worried about.  If I were Microsoft, I would embrace this, not because it's necessarily the best solution, but because I think it's now politically impossible for government to do anything other than to pursue this to the end, and I think it's really hurting Microsoft to continue to fight.  I think breaking the company into two pieces, as proposed, would result in two very well-positioned companies, and as a consequence, investors would do very well, I think, to see company broken up.</p><p>BAY: And what about right now?  Could they proceed, really proceed with business as usual as they say?</p><p>MCNAMEE: Well, it's pretty clear to me that they can not, because I think they're moral issues.</p><p>BAY: What about Lucent?  The stock rose today on the news that it may spin off its microelectronics unit.  Do you think that's a good move for them?</p><p>MCNAMEE: I think it's a fabulous move, at least from investor perspective.  For Lucent, their principal competitor is Cisco.  Cisco is not making components, and it's very important for Lucent to get totally focused in a way that's more or less comparable to they way Cisco is focused to be able to compete head to head.  The microelectronics business, they're very well positioned, and I think they have a very attractive stock.</p><p>I think it would be a very attractive stock.  It's one I would love to own, and I do think that it's a stand-alone business, and therefore, it's better to go from a less vertically integrated model to something that's a little leaner and meaner, and I think both businesses will be better off.  That said, I think the outlook for Lucent itself as currently constructed is not that great.  So absent this transaction, I wouldn't like the stock much.</p><p>BAY: OK, Roger McNamee, as always, thank you.</p><p>MCNAMEE: Take care.</p><p>BAY: Coming up, the mutual fund company that rode the bull market all the way to the bank gets ready to take on Wall Street. We'll tell you about Janus' plans to go public next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: One of the fastest growing mutual fund companies will soon be hitting the street.  Today, Kansas City Southern, a railroad operator, announced the spin-off of its financial subsidiaries, which includes mutual fund giant Janus.  The new company, Stilwell Financial, will trade on the New York stock exchange under the ticker SV.  The move comes despite objections from Janus management, who would prefer to be their own independent public company.  Either way, investors appear to want to own a part of the red-hot mutual fund company.  Kansas City Southern gained nearly 7 1/2.</p><p>Other companies making moves today: Corning gained 8 3/4. Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette upped its price target to $270, and reiterated its buy rating.  Corning is up nearly 17 percent this week. Fellow fiberoptic equipment maker JDS Uniphase also rose today, up nearly 3 3/4.  Credit Suisse First Boston reiterated its buy rating, saying the stock is a core holding in the industry.  And Immunex gained more than 3.  Banc of America initiated coverage with a strong buy rating and a $51 price target.  Despite today's gain, the stock is off 55 percent from its high of $83.</p><p>Coca-Cola's stock jumped on an upgrade by SalomonSmith Barney. The brokerage said its efforts to localize its operations are paying off.  Coke's stock rose nearly 3, was the Dow's biggest gainer.  Also helping the stock, the company's settlement of long-running racial discrimination case. But just as Coke tried to put this case to rest, it was slapped with another lawsuit.</p><p>Peter Viles has story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PETER VILES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This was a day when Coca-Cola hoped to get a break from controversy.  Under new CEO Doug Daft, the company had reached a settlement in principal of a racial discrimination lawsuit.  Coke released this statement from Carl Ware, the company's highest ranking black executive.</p><p>CARL WARE, COCA-COLA: Consistent with our historic and guiding principals, we will move forward with our important diversity initiatives.  We want to thank the many community leaders who have been and continue to be so tremendously helpful.</p><p>VILES: But then Coke was hit with this, another discrimination suit filed by four black women, seeking $1.5 billion and represented by Johnnie Cochran.  Coke blasted the second suit as -- quote -- \"and eleventh hour act of disruptive legal maneuvering by the other lawyers to seek to prolong the process and forestall real progress.\"</p><p>Cochran blasted back. JOHNNIE COCHRAN, ATTORNEY: We're not going to back off.  We're going to represent them to best of our ability, and we're going to outmaneuver anybody.  We're trying to best represent these clients who claim substantial injuries, and Coke have has to deal with a that. They can run, but they can't hide.</p><p>VILES: Both suits claim black workers at Coke were passed over for promotions in favor of white workers.  In the first suit, workers are represented by lawyers Willie Gary and Cyrus Mehri.  Mehri's best known for winning $176 million in a similar suit against Texaco.  In the second case, other workers are represented by Gary again, who was shut out of settlement talks, and Cochran, who's best know for defending O.J. Simpson.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VILES: When the settlement in the first suit is final, up to 2,000 Coke workers will have a choice: They can accept that settlement, or they can take their chances on another lawsuits.  But this second suit is so ambitious, seeking $375 million per employee, that it could persuade some workers to opt out of the first settlement -- Willow.</p><p>BAY: So, Pete, how long will the settlement process for the first case take?</p><p>VILES: For the first case, the judge has put a timetable table on this.  He wants it done by October 30.</p><p>BAY: Deadline October 30.</p><p>Beaten down for weeks, computer hardware stocks made a comeback today, and they are the focus of tonight's sector report.  Leading the group, Compaq Computer, the most active stock on the New York Stock Exchange.  Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette repeated its buy rating on the stock, citing strong demand for the company's servers.  Compaq jumped more than 2 today to close at 27 3/4.  Also gaining ground, Hewlett- Packard up 3.  It's joining with Softbank to form what's expected to be the largest e-commerce Web site in Japan.  Other computer hardware stocks which also moved higher today include Gateway, IBM, and Apple.</p><p>Still ahead on MONEYLINE, one day after a record securities-fraud bust, the lawyers prepare for the court battle ahead.  We'll have new details after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: Details are emerging today on what prosecutors are calling a record bust for securities fraud.  New York defense lawyers began sizing up the government's case and plotting strategy.</p><p>Allan Dodds Frank has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ALLAN DODDS FRANK, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): In the spring of 1995, the forces of organized crime began an assault on Wall Street that federal law enforcement authorities now call the most widespread securities fraud in history.</p><p>And according to indictments unveiled Wednesday by the U.S. attorney in Manhatttan, one way some defendants gained leverage over an unnamed stock broker by taking over a $40,000 debt he owed.  And several defendants used threats of violence to induce the stock promoter to consent, the government charges.</p><p>Outside federal court today, a defense lawyer speculated that the alleged extortion was apparently one reason that James Labate, an alleged organized crime family associate, was still being held in custody pending a bail hearing Friday.</p><p>MARK WASSERMAN, ATTORNEY FOR JAMES LABATE: I believe there is one allegation of an -- in the indictment regarding an alleged or attempt to extortion.  Obviously, my client denies that allegation. That is an event that occurred, I believe, it's alleged in the indictment, 1995, and that is the only allegation.  There is no allegation of any physical violence to anyone or any act of violence against anyone.</p><p>FRANK: Another defendant still in custody is Robert Lino, who the government has alleged is the top organized crime figure involved. He was not named in the extortion count involving the stock promoter. Lino's lawyer dismisses the notion the government has a case.</p><p>JOSEPH BENFANTE, ATTORNEY FOR ROBERT LINO: Whether my client is a member of an organization or not, he is really not -- I mean, that's not the crux of the charge here, the crux is -- of the charge is what he did in the stock fraud situation and whether he used violence, and I don't think that there's any allegation set forth in the indictment about that, and I don't think that the government has any proof of that.</p><p>FRANK: Another series of charges against the organized crime defendants, that they tried to defraud union pension funds and allegedly bribed a recently retired New York police detective, Stephen Gardell, treasurer of the Detectives Endowment Association.</p><p>JOSEPH TACOPINA, ATTORNEY FOR STEPHEN GARDELL: Nothing that he's accused of done, was ever done, and so, you know, they charge him on some conspiracy law, which means he conspired to do something.  But you would think that one of the things they alleged to have happen, happened, and quite frankly, every single thing they alleged to have happen, never happened.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FRANK: At the bail hearing tomorrow, prosecutors may have to reveal exactly why they believe the defendants still in jail should not be released before their cases go to trial -- Willow.</p><p>BAY: So, Allan, if they are forced to do that, what are they likely to say? FRANK: Well, the government has a thousand hours of tapes of secret conversations.  There have been seven guilty pleas, so that presumably means now cooperating witnesses.  They may have a lot of information they do not want to reveal to the defendants until the last possible moment.</p><p>BAY: Don't want to tip their hands.  Allan Dodds Frank, thank you.</p><p>Now, a correction: In our report last night about the securities fraud indictments, we mistakenly identified Thomas Scotto, president of the Detectives Endowment Association, as one of those indicted.  He was not.  We regret the error and any misunderstanding it may have caused.</p><p>Up next, \"Ahead of the Curve,\" some of what you need to know tonight before the markets open tomorrow.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: Checking some of what could move the markets tomorrow: it is a triple-witching Friday, so watch for increased volatility.  And there is another key economic report coming out.  May housing starts will be released and they are expected to come in slightly lower than last month, at an annual rate of 1.62 million units.  But the picture could be a mixed one.  Request for new building permits are expected to have edged higher.</p><p>On the earnings front, Circuit City expected to report first- quarter profits of 28 cents a share, up 8 cents from last year.  Also keep on eye on Adobe Systems.  It reported better-than-expected earnings after the bell today.  And also, Jabil Circuits, whose earnings were in line with expectations.  Also watch Dow Chemical.  It splits its shares three-for-one at the end of tomorrow's trading day.</p><p>That is MONEYLINE for this Thursday.  I'm Willow Bay. \"CROSSFIRE\" is next.</p><p>TO ORDER A VIDEO OF THIS TRANSCRIPT, PLEASE CALL 800-CNN-NEWS OR USE OUR SECURE ONLINE ORDER FORM LOCATED AT <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.fdch.com\">www.fdch.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2000</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:40H1-3RF0-009B-G1W4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7323\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2000 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"06\" year=\"2000\"><dateText>June 15, 2000;

Yet more uncertainty awaits as they finish the year committed to policing their users' behavior ever more strong-ly-up to a standard that may prove to be untenable.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After having their executives grilled in three congressional hearings over bias, privacy, and \"Russian bots,\" the companies finished the year with their stocks in a slump. Twitter and Google were down about 20 percent compared to their 2018 peaks, a decline mirroring the broader market. Facebook, on the other hand, crashed by some 40 percent, wiping out the gains of nearly two years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The legacy media and Democratic lawmakers have largely focused on the companies' struggles to purge from their platforms foreign actors (mainly Russian) that are meddling in U.S. elections, and to stop user data from getting hacked or improperly shared.</p><p>But conservatives, including President Donald Trump, have repeatedly accused the companies of political bias as a lineup of influential right-leaning users have been booted from the platforms.</p><p>Under pressure from both sides, the companies have plowed ahead on the course of heightened restrictions of content they deem harmful, aligning with the ideology of political correctness in general, with a focus on hate speech.</p><p>While the crackdown on hate speech is led under the banner of protecting people from being disparaged based on their identity, several experts have warned that the definition of hate speech is too vague and broad to be enforced consistently and evenly.</p><p>Deciding Hate</p><p>Hate speech usually refers to derogatory statements based on someone's \"protected characteristics,\" such as race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual orientation, sex, gender, gender identity, serious disease, or disability. The trouble is, no two people seem to agree on what exactly should or shouldn't qualify as hate speech. Facebook has pledged a commitment to \"removing hate speech any time we become aware of it,\" touting the removal of nearly 300,000 posts a month for violations. But the company also acknowledged, in the same blog post, that \"there is no universally accepted answer for when something crosses the line.\"</p><p>Derogatory speech, no matter who is targeted, is protected from government regulation under the First Amendment, unless it directly threatens or incites violence. But the platforms have taken it upon themselves to police statements that may have been meant as mere provocation, generalization, or a personal insult. Facebook, for instance, prohibits \"expressions of contempt\" such as \"I hate,\" \"I don't like,\" or \"X are the worst\" that \"target a person or group of people who share any of the [protected] characteristics.\" Yet the company acknowledges that many expressions that may technically fit the bill are part of legitimate discourse.</p><p>\"To some, crude humor about a religious leader can be considered both blasphemy and hate speech against all followers of that faith,\" it stated. \"To others, a battle of gender-based insults may be a mutually enjoyable way of sharing a laugh.\"</p><p>Ultimately, Facebook acknowledges that its content police, which has tripled since last year to 30,000 strong, has to make a judgment call in each case.</p><p>Former senior Facebook engineer Brian Amerige described Facebook's company climate as a political monoculture, in which \"Facebook's community standards are chaotically, almost randomly, enforced, with escalations and occasional reversals happening when the screw-ups are prominent enough to cause media attention.\"</p><p>He tried to change the culture from within and even received attention from the leadership, but eventually reached an impasse on the issue of hate speech.</p><p>\"Hate speech can't be defined consistently and it can't be implemented reliably, so it ends up being aseries of one-off'pragmatic' decisions,\" he said. \"I think it's a serious strategic misstep for a company whose product's primary value is as a tool for free expression.\"</p><p>What's the Harm</p><p>Proponents of hate speech regulations argue that such statements are harmful, because they may make people feel threatened.</p><p>\"We must continue to make improvements to our service so that everyone feels safe participating in the public conversation-whether they are speaking or simply listening,\" Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said in his Sept. 5 written Congress testimony.</p><p>But what makes people feel threatened can differ from an actual threat.</p><p>\"These companies do have to kind of figure out whether they're trying to protect people from feeling physically threatened, or whether they're trying to protect users from feeling threatened in other ways, emotionally or psychologically,\" said Thomas Healy, a law professor at Seton Hall University and an expert on free speech.</p><p>Another argument for hate speech regulation is that it may eventually create an environment where some people may feel encouraged to commit actual violence. Indeed, oppressive regimes have commonly eliminated their enemies after subjecting them to a barrage of dehumanizing propaganda.</p><p>Yet trying to prevent physical harm that may or may not happen in the future by policing speech of individuals carries its own pernicious consequences.</p><p>\"This has already moved us in a dystopic direction, into the realms of 'Nineteen Eighty Four,'</p><p>'Brave New World,' and 'Minority Report'-the world of thought crimes and precrimes, with people afraid to state their views because they have no idea what will bring them under suspicion, cut them off from modern modes of communication, or put them in jail,\" said William McGowan, a veteran journalist, Epoch Times contributor, and author of several books on the decline and corruption of media.</p><p>Some European countries indeed have laws on books imposing penalties for hate speech, pushing the online platforms to remove such content or perhaps face liabilities themselves.</p><p>Heckler's Veto</p><p>The majority of Americans (52 percent) are against the country becoming more politically correct and are \"upset that there are too many things people can't say anymore,\" according to a Nov. 28-Dec. 4NPR/PBS/Maristpoll.</p><p>But the opposition splits along party lines, with 55 percent of Democrats wanting more political correctness and a mere 14 percent of Republicans wanting the same.</p><p>Since online platforms commonly rely on user reports to alert them of violations, the mechanism appears doomed to produce political bias.</p><p>Not only are left-leaning Americans more in favor of political correctness, but some on the more far-left, progressive spectrum have formed groups that specialize in getting right-leaning voices barred from online platforms.</p><p>That leads to a situation in which a relatively small, organized group can scour someone's social media for anything that approximates hate speech and inundate a tech company with complaints-an online mutation of sorts of the \"heckler's veto\" phenomenon.</p><p>Conservative commentator Ben Shapiro has used the phrase \"heckler's veto\" to describe the situation he and others have faced at college campuses, where some individuals feel the need to not only protest or contest certain invited speakers, but also try to prevent them from speaking in the first place.</p><p>Nearly two-thirds of the attempts to disinvite a speaker have come from the political left, based on 379 incidents over the past 15 years collected by the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE).</p><p>And the ratio has skewed further left recently. Since 2017, FIRE recorded 45 disinvitation attempts, with only six originating from the right.</p><p>The right-leaning civil rights advocacy group stated that the attempts have not only increased in frequency, but are also increasingly successful.</p><p>Opponents were able to cancel invitations to 25 speakers over the past two years, while in 2000-2001, only 10 attempts were recorded by FIRE, with just one being successful.</p><p>Belief in Free Speech</p><p>In a 2016 interview, Healy pointed out that while private companies are not bound by the First Amendment, the principles of free speech have been an important value of the nation.</p><p>\"We rely on counter speech,\" he said. \"If the speech is dangerous or false, we rely on counter speech to correct that.\"</p><p>While the mechanism is not perfect, he acknowledged, it's based on Americans' faith \"that it's superior to government regulation or regulation by Facebook or whatever other entity we're talking about.\"</p><p>While online platforms, in their rhetoric, have uniformly pledged to support free speech, in practice they've been moving away from it, according to a Google internal research document dated in March and later leaked to Breit-bart.</p><p>The document, titled \"The Good Censor,\" argues the \"tech firms have gradually shifted away from unmediated free speech and towards censorship and moderation.\"</p><p>Several competitors have emerged, like Gab and Minds, capitalizing on their commitment to free speech and privacy. Minds has attracted about 200,000 monthly active users, while Gab has released data only on registered users, counting some 800,000. Twitter, on the other hand, has almost 330 million, which is further dwarfed by Facebook's nearly 2.3 billion monthly active users.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ENW-2164086140</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">1576348ENW</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V68-B5D1-JC85-J3YG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11341</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1533\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Epoch Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Epoch Times</publicationName><issueNumber>No. 346</issueNumber><aggregationName>Ethnic NewsWatch</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>December 25, 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Others</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>SETON HALL UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>CC0001OOC</classCode><className>PUBLIC BROADCASTING SERVICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;
