Indecent photographs of children can still be reached \"from common search engines in only three clicks\".</p><p>Chief constable Simon Bailey, the National Police Chiefs' Council lead for child protection and abuse, has described the UK as \"the third greatest consumer in the world of the live streaming of abuse\".</p><p>Since 2016, as many as 450 people a month are being arrested in the UK for abuse-related offences. \"Despite technological advances to detect and prevent online child sexual abuse,\" the study says, \"law enforcement is struggling to keep up.\"</p><p>As many as half a million men may have watched indecent images of children online, it is believed.</p><p>The IICSA is scathing in its criticism of social media companies, finding that \"responses appeared reactive rather than proactive; action seemed driven by a desire to avoid reputational damage rather than to prioritise protection of children\".</p><p>It added: \"We are unconvinced that internet companies fully understand the scale of the problem of livestreaming on their platforms such that they can properly assess whether they employ sufficient numbers of moderators to detect such offending.\"</p><p>They need to ensure \"there are sufficient numbers of human moderators with a specific focus on online child sexual abuse and exploitation\", the report states. \"The value of human moderation is evident from the success achieved by the social network Yubo, whose moderators interrupt livestreams to tell underage users to put their clothes on.\"</p><p>Online grooming appears to be increasing, with up to 10 grooming offences a day, according to research by the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC). \"Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat are frequently named as the most common platforms where grooming takes place,\" the report says.</p><p>The risks have become more widespread because the majority of UK children own a smartphone from around the time they start secondary school. \"Although industry companies either prohibit or discourage children under 13 years old from accessing their platforms or services, the age verification process can be often easily subverted - simply by inputting a false date of birth,\" the IICSA says.</p><p>\"Children aged under 13 years old need additional protection. The industry must do more than rely on children to supply their true age when signing up to a platform. There must be better means of ensuring compliance with the current age restrictions.</p><p>\"The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) frequently encounters images of livestreams which involve children from western backgrounds, the majority of whom are girls aged between seven and 13 years old.\"</p><p>The sums paid to watch - and in some cases direct - the abuse are trivial. Sometimes it costs little more than a pound. The IWF has helped reduce illegal content on UK websites.</p><p>In one of its main recommendations, the report states: \"The government should introduce legislation requiring providers of online services and social media platforms to implement more stringent age verification techniques on all relevant devices.\"</p><p>From September this year, schools will have to include compulsory education in both primary and secondary schools that will help teach children about the need to stay safe online.</p><p>Prof Alexis Jay, the chair of the inquiry, said: \"The serious threat of child sexual abuse facilitated by the internet is an urgent problem which cannot be overstated.</p><p>\"Despite industry advances in technology to detect and combat online facilitated abuse, the risk of immeasurable harm to children and their families shows no sign of diminishing.</p><p>\"Internet companies, law enforcement and government [should] implement vital measures to prioritise the protection of children and prevent abuse facilitated online.\"</p><p>The report makes four recommendations for action the government should take to tackle online abuse:</p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Requiring industry to pre-screen material before it is uploaded to the internet to prevent access to known indecent images of children.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Pressing the WeProtect global alliance to take more action internationally to ensure countries hosting indecent images of children implement legislation and procedures to prevent access.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Introducing legislation requiring providers of online services and social media platforms to implement more stringent age verification techniques on devices.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Publishing, without further delay, the interim code of practice in respect of child sexual abuse and exploitation as proposed by the online harms white paper (published April 2019).</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>The IWF, a UK-based charity responsible for finding and removing child sexual abuse material online, is a core participant in the inquiry.</p><p>Responding to the report, Susie Hargreaves, the IWF's chief executive, said: \"There is no longer any reason not to be decisive on taking action against the predators who exploit and abuse children online.

But when the new offices, apartments and stores go up on the 36-acre Halley Rise development in Northern Virginia and a Metro station opens nearby, the company that operates them hopes the vehicles will speed people on the first or last miles of their daily commutes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The project, a partnership betweenBoston-basedstart-up Optimus Ride and real estate developer Brookfield Properties, is a glimpse of one version of a self-driving future that features squadrons of robotic vehicles that are smaller and slower than traditional cars and that can cart people efficiently over small distances.</p><p>Operating at low speeds - typically under 25 mph - in the confines of a private development is a way of sidestepping some of the technical and legal barriers that apply on the open road. And for a start-up such as Optimus, it offers the chance to compete with big tech firms and automakers. The company says it has completed some 15,000 rides in Reston since launching a few weeks ago.</p><p>\"If you do it here you can validate business models, you can validate the technology,\" said Ryan Chin, Optimus Ride's chief executive and one of its founders. \"You can introduce it in a very safe way. You can get paying customers.\"</p><p>Interest in low-speed autonomous vehicles has exploded in the past year, especially after a self-driving Uber SUV struck and killed a woman last year in Arizona, dampening enthusiasm around autonomous cars. </p><p>Kelley Coyner, the author of a forthcoming study, said she is aware of about 225 projects or proposals in the United States and a couple dozen more in Canada. </p><p>Optimus, a spinoff from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, launched a shuttle service in Brooklyn over the summer and has at least one major direct competitor.</p><p>Traveling under 25 mph means there is less risk of killing someone if a pedestrian is hit, and the vehicle requires less-sophisticated sensors because stopping distances are shorter, said Sam Abuelsamid, an analyst at Navigant Research. But even for slow-speed vehicles, there are still significant technical hurdles to overcome.</p><p>Huei Peng, director of Mcity, an autonomous-vehicle-research center at the University of Michigan, said the technology is advancing, but even low-speed self-driving cars have severe limitations. He compared them to the Wright brothers' early airplanes.</p><p>\"They flew a very short distance: not very high, not very far, not very fast,\" Peng said. \"They were not very exciting. They were not very useful.\"</p><p>Perhaps the most obvious challenge: getting the vehicles to be truly driverless. Optimus uses modified six-seat electric buggies manufactured by Polaris, but two of the seats are occupied by a safety driver and an engineer.</p><p>Chin is confident that his company has solved the fundamental problem of automated driving and said that deploying the vehicles in the real world with crew on board is an important step toward going fully driverless, providing the chance to collect more data. He said the company's goal is to switch from onboard crew to a remote operator managing a squadron of vehicles at one of its sites by next year.</p><p>Seemingly simple problems must be thought through: The shuttles in Reston don't have sensors to alert them if someone opens the door while the vehicles are in motion. How should a vehicle handle a parent loading a child into a stroller? And will vulnerable people feel safe riding alone with strangers?</p><p>Andy Alden, a researcher at the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute, said the autonomous-vehicle industry was beset by \"excessive optimism\" as the navigation technology got better, only to be confronted by the people who use the vehicles or share the roads with them.</p><p>\"There's so many real-life issues,\" he said.</p><p>So, for now, the crew remain on the Optimus shuttles. In Reston on Monday, John Sgueglia sat behind the steering wheel of one of the vehicles, just in case. Engineer Ruijie He sat next to him, a laptop open with its screen showing the world as the shuttle saw it - blobs representing the trucks and people its cameras and lidar sensor could see - as it completed a circuit from parking lot to office building.</p><p>At times, the ride was smooth and it was difficult to tell that no human was in control. The shuttle deftly swerved between a pedestrian and an oncoming vehicle. Other times, the vehicle's robotic brain appeared confused, lingering at an all-way stop and shaking when a group of pedestrians crossed in front.</p><p>From the front seat, He said some of that unusual behavior is purposeful. Inching forward sends a signal regarding where the vehicle is aiming to go, and behaving conservatively at stop signs helps protect against drivers who are in a rush.</p><p>Engineers working on self-driving cars have come to realize that there is a bewildering array of situations they need to be able to accommodate on the road. Human brains are pretty good at adapting to novel situations; robots, not so much.</p><p>Chin said driving in a parking lot can be quite challenging - demonstrated in recent online videos of electric Teslas struggling with a new feature that allows their owners to summon them from parking spaces. Humans on foot pose another problem.</p><p>\"We've learned that pedestrian behavior is somewhat erratic, so we want to keep a safe distance,\" He said.</p><p>Chin said the company has had \"zero incidents.\" (A minor bump reported by the Brooklyn Eagle newspaper happened while one of Optimus's vehicles was being driven manually, the company says.)</p><p>For all the questions yet to be resolved, Chin is keen to point out that today the company has a commercial service with paying customers. He declined to discuss the finances of his arrangement with Brookfield, saying only that it was a two-year agreement to provide three shuttles at the Reston site.</p><p>For Brookfield, a major real estate company with dozens of similar projects, there are two major attractions to working with Optimus: the potential its vehicles could provide developments with less space devoted to money-losing parking and a buzz of excitement from prospective tenants.</p><p>\"They're really intrigued,\" said Greg Meyer, head of Brookfield's Washington region. \"I think most people recognize it's the future.\"</p><p>Academic experts and industry analysts say they expect low-speed autonomous vehicles to be more than novelties or stopgaps on the way to full-speed cars and will create new ways of getting around. They envision fleets connecting to bus and rail lines in big cities, where speeds on the road tend to be low anyway, and others designed to help the elderly and people with disabilities.</p><p>Coyner, the researcher, recently completed a study of low-speed vehicles for the Transportation Research Board, part of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. When she proposed the project in June 2018, Coyner said, there were about a dozen projects underway, but by the time she wrapped up a few weeks ago, there were more like 225.</p><p>\"Low speed is much more ready,\" she said. \"The interest in this exceeds what can be provided.\"</p><p>In the Washington area, a company that makes a 3-D-printed shuttle has a facility at National Harbor and ran a pilot this summer at Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall.</p><p>Early projects were simple tests, said Coyner, who works on mobility at the design firm Stantec, but routes are getting longer - one proposal in Honolulu would feature an 11-mile round trip - and operators are exploring more useful deployments that could complement existing transit.</p><p>For major deployments on city streets, significant questions remain. Low-speed vehicles are not subject to the same safety standards as cars, potentially leaving them vulnerable in mixed traffic. And across the country, there is a patchwork of rules for autonomous vehicles, with federal regulators showing few signs of stepping in.</p><p>Chin recognizes the scale of the challenges and said the solution is to start with projects like the one in Reston.</p><p>\"The real world here is pretty hard,\" he said. \"The real world out there is even harder, and the real world in Times Square is supremely difficult.\"</p><p>\"Our view is, we can't do all of them,\" he said. \"Let's start with places we can get autonomous vehicles to work reasonably in the near term.\"</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:ian.duncan@washpost.com\">ian.duncan@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPCOM-145232daeac011e99c6d436a0df4f31d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X86-92K1-DYX1-H00K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">265544</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1432\"/><timeReceived>1:51 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washingtonpost.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33547\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 13, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00029GX</classCode><className>BROOKFIELD OFFICE PROPERTIES INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS531312 NONRESIDENTIAL PROPERTY MANAGERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS531120 LESSORS OF NONRESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS (EXCEPT MINIWAREHOUSES)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS237210 LAND SUBDIVISION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Transportation Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Parking Facilities</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RURCMEVGMTYyNjAzNDFDM0E0QzBEMjJCNTgxMTc5MUE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUQzM0QzNzNGREY4NDcxOEIyRTk4NTM1OTcwMzcwMUY</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001066</classCode><className>MANAGERS &amp;

But when the new offices, apartments and stores go up on the 36-acre Halley Rise development in Northern Virginia and a Metro station opens nearby, the company that operates them hopes the vehicles will speed people on the first or last miles of their daily commutes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The project, a partnership between   Boston-based   start-up Optimus Ride and real estate developer Brookfield Properties, is a glimpse of one version of a self-driving future that features squadrons of robotic vehicles that are smaller and slower than traditional cars and that can cart people efficiently over small distances.</p><p>Operating at low speeds - typically under 25 mph - in the confines of a private development is a way of sidestepping some of the technical and legal barriers that apply on the open road. And for a start-up such as Optimus, it offers the chance to compete with big tech firms and automakers. The company says it has completed some 15,000 rides in Reston since launching a few weeks ago.</p><p>\"If you do it here you can validate business models, you can validate the technology,\" said Ryan Chin, Optimus Ride's chief executive and one of its founders. \"You can introduce it in a very safe way. You can get paying customers.\"</p><p>Interest in low-speed autonomous vehicles has exploded in the past year, especially after a self-driving Uber SUV struck and killed a woman last year in Arizona, dampening enthusiasm around autonomous cars. </p><p>Kelley Coyner, the author of a forthcoming study, said she is aware of about 225 projects or proposals in the United States and a couple dozen more in Canada. </p><p>Optimus, a spinoff from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, launched a shuttle service in Brooklyn over the summer and has at least one major direct competitor.</p><p>Traveling under 25 mph means there is less risk of killing someone if a pedestrian is hit, and the vehicle requires less-sophisticated sensors because stopping distances are shorter, said Sam Abuelsamid, an analyst at Navigant Research. But even for slow-speed vehicles, there are still significant technical hurdles to overcome.</p><p>Huei Peng, director of Mcity, an autonomous-vehicle-research center at the University of Michigan, said the technology is advancing, but even low-speed self-driving cars have severe limitations. He compared them to the Wright brothers' early airplanes.</p><p>\"They flew a very short distance: not very high, not very far, not very fast,\" Peng said. \"They were not very exciting. They were not very useful.\"</p><p>Perhaps the most obvious challenge: getting the vehicles to be truly driverless. Optimus uses modified six-seat electric buggies manufactured by Polaris, but two of the seats are occupied by a safety driver and an engineer.</p><p>Chin is confident that his company has solved the fundamental problem of automated driving and said that deploying the vehicles in the real world with crew on board is an important step toward going fully driverless, providing the chance to collect more data. He said the company's goal is to switch from onboard crew to a remote operator managing a squadron of vehicles at one of its sites by next year.</p><p>Seemingly simple problems must be thought through: The shuttles in Reston don't have sensors to alert them if someone opens the door while the vehicles are in motion. How should a vehicle handle a parent loading a child into a stroller? And will vulnerable people feel safe riding alone with strangers?</p><p>Andy Alden, a researcher at the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute, said the autonomous-vehicle industry was beset by \"excessive optimism\" as the navigation technology got better, only to be confronted by the people who use the vehicles or share the roads with them.</p><p>\"There's so many real-life issues,\" he said.</p><p>So, for now, the crew remain on the Optimus shuttles. In Reston on Monday, John Sgueglia sat behind the steering wheel of one of the vehicles, just in case. Engineer Ruijie He sat next to him, a laptop open with its screen showing the world as the shuttle saw it - blobs representing the trucks and people its cameras and lidar sensor could see - as it completed a circuit from parking lot to office building.</p><p>At times, the ride was smooth and it was difficult to tell that no human was in control. The shuttle deftly swerved between a pedestrian and an oncoming vehicle. Other times, the vehicle's robotic brain appeared confused, lingering at an all-way stop and shaking when a group of pedestrians crossed in front.</p><p>From the front seat, He said some of that unusual behavior is purposeful. Inching forward sends a signal regarding where the vehicle is aiming to go, and behaving conservatively at stop signs helps protect against drivers who are in a rush.</p><p>Engineers working on self-driving cars have come to realize that there is a bewildering array of situations they need to be able to accommodate on the road. Human brains are pretty good at adapting to novel situations; robots, not so much.</p><p>Chin said driving in a parking lot can be quite challenging - demonstrated in recent online videos of electric Teslas struggling with a new feature that allows their owners to summon them from parking spaces. Humans on foot pose another problem.</p><p>\"We've learned that pedestrian behavior is somewhat erratic, so we want to keep a safe distance,\" He said.</p><p>Chin said the company has had \"zero incidents.\" (A minor bump reported by the Brooklyn Eagle newspaper happened while one of Optimus's vehicles was being driven manually, the company says.)</p><p>For all the questions yet to be resolved, Chin is keen to point out that today the company has a commercial service with paying customers. He declined to discuss the finances of his arrangement with Brookfield, saying only that it was a two-year agreement to provide three shuttles at the Reston site.</p><p>For Brookfield, a major real estate company with dozens of similar projects, there are two major attractions to working with Optimus: the potential its vehicles could provide developments with less space devoted to money-losing parking and a buzz of excitement from prospective tenants.</p><p>\"They're really intrigued,\" said Greg Meyer, head of Brookfield's Washington region. \"I think most people recognize it's the future.\"</p><p>Academic experts and industry analysts say they expect low-speed autonomous vehicles to be more than novelties or stopgaps on the way to full-speed cars and will create new ways of getting around. They envision fleets connecting to bus and rail lines in big cities, where speeds on the road tend to be low anyway, and others designed to help the elderly and people with disabilities.</p><p>Coyner, the researcher, recently completed a study of low-speed vehicles for the Transportation Research Board, part of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. When she proposed the project in June 2018, Coyner said, there were about a dozen projects underway, but by the time she wrapped up a few weeks ago, there were more like 225.</p><p>\"Low speed is much more ready,\" she said. \"The interest in this exceeds what can be provided.\"</p><p>In the Washington area, a company that makes a 3-D-printed shuttle has a facility at National Harbor and ran a pilot this summer at Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall.</p><p>Early projects were simple tests, said Coyner, who works on mobility at the design firm Stantec, but routes are getting longer - one proposal in Honolulu would feature an 11-mile round trip - and operators are exploring more useful deployments that could complement existing transit.</p><p>For major deployments on city streets, significant questions remain. Low-speed vehicles are not subject to the same safety standards as cars, potentially leaving them vulnerable in mixed traffic. And across the country, there is a patchwork of rules for autonomous vehicles, with federal regulators showing few signs of stepping in.</p><p>Chin recognizes the scale of the challenges and said the solution is to start with projects like the one in Reston.</p><p>\"The real world here is pretty hard,\" he said. \"The real world out there is even harder, and the real world in Times Square is supremely difficult.\"</p><p>\"Our view is, we can't do all of them,\" he said. \"Let's start with places we can get autonomous vehicles to work reasonably in the near term.\"</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:ian.duncan@washpost.com\">ian.duncan@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPOST-145232da-eac0-11e9-9c6d-436a0df4f31d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPOST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X87-CC21-JBFW-C00K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8075</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1433\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Post</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12311\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Suburban Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 13, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00029GX</classCode><className>BROOKFIELD OFFICE PROPERTIES INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS531312 NONRESIDENTIAL PROPERTY MANAGERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS531120 LESSORS OF NONRESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS (EXCEPT MINIWAREHOUSES)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS237210 LAND SUBDIVISION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Transportation Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Parking Facilities</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RURCMEVGMTYyNjAzNDFDM0E0QzBEMjJCNTgxMTc5MUE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUQzM0QzNzNGREY4NDcxOEIyRTk4NTM1OTcwMzcwMUY</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001066</classCode><className>MANAGERS &amp;

Uber offers a substantially cheaper service, payment by card and shorter wait-times. TfL have censured Uber on the grounds of safety, in particular focusing on the reporting of sexual assaults. That's a serious issue, but TfL should listen to the women who will always opt for an Uber late at night. Shorter waiting times mean that long walks in search of a main road to hail a cab are no longer necessary, and with every trip logged and tracked by GPS female passengers feel safer.</p><p>Others like the GMB union attack Uber for supposedly exploiting its 40,000 strong force of drivers. They argue that Uber drivers are being denied basic workers' rights like sick pay, holiday leave, and the minimum wage. But, Uber drivers are free to work for other providers, they choose their own hours, and when they were polled last year 80pc said they wouldn't trade additional workers' rights for a reduction in flexibility.\u00a0</p><p>        Sadiq Khan defends TFL over Uber decision       01:22</p><p>Yet, the strongest evidence is that so many drivers stick with Uber, in the face of aggressive competition from rival apps and private-hire firms. Political thinkers often worry that big tech firms such as Amazon, Google and Facebook have become more powerful than governments. They've got it backwards.</p><p>The reason that Facebook refuses the Government's attempts to decrypt WhatsApp messages  isn't because Facebook is all powerful, but because, after the NSA leaks, consumers demand it.

M. Stern at 15 Central Park West, showcasing a ''starchitect'' is part of the arms race that is luxury condo development in Manhattan these days.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The developers of Walker Tower, a luxury condo conversion in Chelsea, have taken it a step further, trumpeting the original designer of the former commercial building, Ralph Walker, whom The New York Times in 1957 called the ''architect of the century.'' They have even erected a small museum about Mr. Walker, who died in 1973, in the tower's sales center.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But across the country, San Francisco offers an intriguing counterpoint: distinctive architecture is conspicuously lacking in the high-rise building boom.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Forty years after it was completed, the 850-foot Transamerica Pyramid remains the most recognizable high-rise tower built in the City by the Bay. Designed by the architect William Pereira, it took a lot of flak from locals during its planning and construction, with detractors sometimes referring to it as a phallic symbol, though their actual wording was more blunt.</p><p>Nevetheless, it became a fixture of the city's skyline. Today it stands mostly alone in a city more interested in conserving its old Victorian-style homes than in making a statement with new development. It is a puzzling phenomenon in a part of the country often seen as an engine of American innovation.</p><p>''People work hard to preserve old things without taking the risk to build something new,'' Mr. Gehry said about San Francisco in a recent phone conversation.</p><p>He was critical of the high-rise building boom under way in San Francisco's South of Market area, where the newly built towers are boxy and utilitarian. ''It's business without heart,'' he said.</p><p>In the past decade, 13 high-rise condo towers of 20 stories or more have been built in San Francisco. Another four such projects have been approved by the city, according to the Mark Company, a real estate marketing and sales firm.</p><p>There is nary a brand-name architecture firm to be found among the towers that have already been built, though Handel Architects did design the sleek Millennium Tower. A new luxury high-rise being designed by Richard Meier is still struggling to get approved by the city after almost five years of development.</p><p>The new buildings South of Market are meant to attract singles and young couples, many of whom are working in the tech industry and don't yet want the hassles of a single-family home. And while higher-end offerings like the Millennium have attracted a few prominent locals -- like the former 49ers quarterback Joe Montana -- foreigners, especially from China, make up a large chunk of the buyers.</p><p>At the Madrone, another high-rise in the newly developed neighborhood of Mission Bay, a young techie apartment owner I spoke with said that the architecture of the building had never really been a consideration.</p><p>That doesn't surprise Mr. Stern, who doesn't see young tech buyers as having the sophistication to care about buildings (though, it must be said, they may have refined tastes in the subtle design touches of the latest smartphones). ''I think it takes them awhile to get over the initial high-dose blast of wealth to realize that wealth can be used more creatively than just buying big shoebox spaces and sticking in foosball games and other things like that,'' Mr. Stern said.</p><p>The young software engineers may not care too much about the quality of architecture where they live, but down in Silicon Valley some big tech firms have tapped world-renowned architects to design their new headquarters.</p><p>Facebook hired Mr. Gehry, 83, for the expansion of its campus in Menlo Park. Mr. Gehry designed a 433,555-square-foot building with a rooftop garden that will be built on stilts. ''It should look like a floating forest where the building peeks from beneath a series of trees,'' said Slater Tow, a Facebook spokesman. ''We are not out to make an architectural statement, we are out to make the most functional building for engineers.''</p><p>It was <person><nameText>Steve Jobs </nameText></person>himself who commissioned Sir Norman Foster to design Apple's new 2.8-million-square-foot headquarters in Cupertino, which Mr. Jobs described as a ''spaceship.''</p><p>Both the Apple and Facebook projects are expected to be completed by the end of 2015.</p><p>But just a commute away in San Francisco, there is little buzz about big-name designers. ''San Francisco is not a place where people shout architects' names on a building,'' said Mary Comerio, a professor in the Graduate School of Architecture at the University of California, Berkeley. ''You get more controversy when that happens.''</p><p>Indeed, developers in San Francisco are loath to take architectural risks because the city's approval process for new development is long and rigorous, perhaps the most onerous in the country, architects say.</p><p>It's hard to fault their caution when you consider how small San Francisco really is -- 47 square miles (Manhattan alone is 23 square miles) -- with much of the area consumed by neighborhoods zoned for single-family homes. More than the pedigree of the architect, the city worries about things like shadows and wind and, of course, earthquakes.</p><p>The earthquake issue is not as tough to navigate as you might think, but it is still a costly concern. The Bay Area remains highly susceptible to earthquakes, and ''seismic readiness'' can add as much as 15 percent to the cost of a new structure, said Mark Sarkisian, director of seismic and structural engineering in the San Francisco office of Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, which built the John Hancock Center and Sears (now Willis) Tower in Chicago.</p><p>Not surprisingly, the science of engineering tall buildings has come a long way in the last 20 years. The structures have special joints to dissipate energy without fracturing during a quake. They can bend, almost like a fishing pole.</p><p>In the South of Market area, the sandy soil creates a bigger risk if a big one hits. So developers need to dig foundations 100 to 125 feet deep, Mr. Sarkisian said.</p><p>All the engineering advances have made newer high-rises less susceptible to collapse than lower-rise brick structures being held together by gravity, experts say.</p><p>But it hasn't been fear of earthquakes that has held up the approval of a residential tower being designed by Mr. Meier's firm for the corner of Market Street and Van Ness Avenue. City planners were concerned about how an early design for the building, currently scheduled to have 37 floors, would affect wind conditions for pedestrians, said Bernhard Karpf, an associate partner at Richard Meier &amp; Partners, who is in charge of the project.</p><p>''They describe that area as having 'hazardous wind conditions,' where people would literally get blown off the street,'' Mr. Karpf said.</p><p>The developer David Choo asked Mr. Meier in 2009 to do something that was ''not your traditional San Francisco architecture,'' Mr. Karpf said. Meier &amp; Partners initially designed a ''free-standing sculptural object'' on the small site. With approval threatened, the firm hired a Canadian company to test a scale model in a wind tunnel, delaying the design process by another year.</p><p>''We had never heard of these kinds of wind regulations,'' Mr. Karpf said. ''It became almost obsessive on the planning board's side to make sure wind is mitigated.''</p><p>Their frustration mounting, the Meier architects asked the Canadian company to give them three or four shapes that would meet the wind requirements. ''We have to move forward,'' Mr. Karpf said he told them. ''We have to find a solution that works. It may look horrible, but let's see if we can reverse the process and turn it into a building.''</p><p>In the end, the slender shape of the building ''was strongly influenced'' by studies in the wind tunnel laboratory, which showed that it would ''actually improve wind conditions in this part of town,'' he said.</p><p>When Mr. Karpf asked Mr. Choo how he could stand to buy a property and still have nothing to show for it some five years later, he shrugged and told the architect, ''That's the way it works in San Francisco.''</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTOS: A proposed tower by Richard Meier at Market and Van Ness.

This means that the Oversight Board, in addition to having such an on-the-nose proper name, falls short in a more important way\u2014its architects imagined that content issues can be tackled substantively without addressing privacy issues. Yet surely the recent scandals that have plagued Facebook and some other tech companies in recent years have shown us that private information issues and harmful-content problems have become intimately connected. We can't turn a blind eye to this connection anymore. </p><p>We need the companies, and the governments of the world, and the communities of users, and the technologists, and the advocates, to unite behind a framework that emphasizes the deeper-than-ever connection between privacy problems and free-speech problems. What we need most now, as we grapple more fiercely with the public-policy questions arising from digital tools and internet platforms, is a unified field theory[2]\u2014or, more properly\u2014a 'Grand Unified Theory[3]' (a.k.a. 'GUT')\u2014of free expression and privacy. But the road to that theory is going to be hard. From the beginning three decades ago when digital civil-liberties emerged as a distinct set of issues that needed public-policy attention, the relationship between freedom of expression and personal privacy in the digital world has been a bit strained. Even the name of the first big conference to bring all the policy people, technologists, government officials, hackers, and computer cops reflected the tension. The first Computers, Freedom and Privacy conference was held in BurlingameCalifornia, in 1991, made sure that attendees knew that 'Privacy' was not just a kind of 'Freedom' but its own thing that deserved its own special attention. The tensions emerged early on. It seemed self-evident to most of us back then that the relationship between freedom of expression (and freedom of assembly and freedom of inquiry) had to have some limits\u2014including limits on what any of us could do with the private information about other people. But while it's conceptually easy to define in fairly clear terms what counts as 'freedom of expression,' the consensus about what counts as a privacy interest is murkier. Because I started out as a free-speech guy, I liked the law-school-endorsed framework of 'privacy torts,' which carved out some fairly narrow privacy exceptions to the broad guarantees of expressive freedom. That 'privacy torts' setup meant that, at least when we talked about 'invasion of privacy,' I could say what counted as such an invasion and what didn't. Privacy in the American system was narrow and easy to grasp. But this wasn't the universal view in the 1990s, and it's certainly not the universal view in 2020. In the developed world, including the developed democracies of the European Union, the balance between privacy and free expression has been struck in a different way. The presumptions in the EU favor greater protection of personal information (and related interests like reputation) and somewhat less protection of what freedom of expression. Sure, the international human-rights source texts like the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (in Article 19) may protect 'freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media regardless of frontiers.' But ranked above those informational rights (in both the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights) is the protection of private information, correspondence, 'honor,' and reputation. This difference balance is reflected in European rules like the General Data Protection Regulation. The emerging international balance, driven by the GDPR, has created new tensions between freedom of expression and what we loosely call 'privacy.' (I use quotation marks because the GDPR regulates not just the use of private information but also the use of 'personal' information that may not be private\u2014like old newspaper reports of government actions to recover social-security debts. This was the issue in the leading 'right to be forgotten' case[4] prior to the GDPR.) Standing by themselves, the emerging international consensus doesn't provide clear rules for resolving those tensions. Don't get me wrong: I think the idea of using international human rights instruments as guidance for content approaches on social-media platforms has its virtues. The advantage is that in international forums and tribunals it gives the companies as strong a defense as one might wish in the international environment for allowing some (presumptively protected) speech to stay up in the face of criticism and removing some (arguably illegal) speech. The disadvantages are harder to grapple with. Countries will differ on what kind of speech is protected, but the internet does not quite honor borders the way some governments would like. (Thailand's lse-majest[5]is a good example.) In addition, some social-media platforms may want to create environments that are more civil, or child-friendly, or whatever, which will entail more content-moderation choices and policies than human-rights frameworks would normally allow. Do we want to say that Facebook or Google *can't* do this? That Twitter should simply be forbidden to tag a presidential tweet as 'unsubstantiated'[6]? Some governments and other stakeholders would disapprove. If a human-rights framework doesn't resolve the free-speech/privacy tensions, what could? Ultimately, I believe that the best remedial frameworks will involve multistakeholderism, but I think they also need to begin with a shared (consensus) ethical framework. I present the argument in condensed form here: \"It's Time to Reframe Our Relationship With Facebook[7].' (I also published a book last year[8] that presents this argument in greater depth.) Can a code of ethics be a GUT of free speech and privacy? I don't think it can, but I do think it can be the seed of one. But it has to be bigger than a single company's initiative\u2014which more or less is the best we can reasonably hope Facebook's Oversight Board (assuming it sets out ethical principles as a product of its work on content cases) will ever be. I try not to be cynical about Facebook, which has plenty of people working on these issues who genuinely mean well, and who are willing to forgo short-term profits to put better rules in place. While it's true at some sufficiently high level that the companies privilege profits over public interest, the fact is that once a company is market-dominant (as Facebook is), it may well trade off short-term profits as part of a grand bargain with governments and regulators. Facebook is rich enough to absorb the costs of compliance with whatever regimes the democratic governments come up with. (A more cynical read of Zuckerberg's public writings in the aftermath of the company's various public writings, is that he wants the governments to get the rules in place, and then FB will comply, as it can afford to do better than most other companies, and then FB's compliance will be a defense against subsequent criticism.) But the main reason I think reform has to come in part at the industry level rather than at the company level, is that company-level reforms, even if well-intended, tend to instantiate a public-policy version of Wittgenstein's \"private language\" problem[9]. Put simply, if the ethical rules are internal to a company, the company can always change them. If they're external to a company, then there's a shared ethical framework we can use to criticize a company that transgresses the standards. But we can't stop at the industry level either\u2014we need governments and users and other stakeholders to be able to step in and say to the tech industries that, hey, your industry-wide standards are still insufficient. You know that industry standards are more likely to be adequate and comprehensive when they're buttressed both by public approval and by law. That's what happened with medical ethics and legal ethics\u2014the frameworks were crafted by the professions but then recognized as codes that deserve to be integrated into our legal system. There's an international consensus that doctors have duties to patients ('First, do no harm') and that lawyers and other professions have 'fiduciary duties' to their clients. I outline how fiduciary approaches might address Big Tech's consumer-trust problems in a series of Techdirt articles that begins here[10]. The 'fiduciary' code-of-ethics approach to free-speech and privacy problems for Big Tech is the only way I see of harmonizing digital privacy and free-speech interests in a way that will leave most stakeholders satisfied (as most stakeholders are now satisfied with medical-ethics frameworks and with lawyers' obligations to protect and serve their clients). Because lawyers and doctors are generally obligated to tell their clients the truth (or, if for some reason they can't, end the relationship and refer the clients to other practitioners), and because they're also obligated to 'do no harm' (e.g., by allowing companies to use personal information in a manipulative way or to violate clients' privacy or autonomy), these professions already have a Grand Unified Theory that protects both speech and privacy in the context of clients relationships with practitioners. Big Tech has a better shot at resolving the contradictory demands on its speech and privacy practices if it aspires to do the same, and if it embraces an industry-wide code of ethics that is acceptable to users (who deserve client protections even if they're not paying for the services in question). Ultimately, if the ethics code is backed by legislators and written into the law, you have something much closer to a Grand Unified Theory that harmonizes privacy, autonomy, and freedom of expression. I'm a big booster of this GUT, and I've been making versions of this argument before now. (Please don't call it 'Godwin-Unified Theory'\u2014having one 'law[11]' named after me is enough.) But here in 2020 we need to do more than argue about this approach\u2014we need to convene and begin to hammer out a consensus about a systematic, harmonized approach that protects human needs for freedom of expression, for privacy, and for autonomy that's reasonably free of psychological-warfare tactics[12] of informational manipulation. The issue is not just false content, and it's not just personal information\u2014open societies[13] have to incorporate a fairly high degree of tolerance for unintentionally false expression and for non-malicious or non-manipulative disclosure or use of personal information. But an open society also needs to promote supporting an ecosystem\u2014a public sphere of discourse\u2014in which neither the manipulative crafting of deceptive and destructive content nor the manipulative targeting of it based on our personal data is the norm. That's an ecosystem that will require commitment from all stakeholders to build\u2014a GUT based not on gut instincts but on critical rationalism, colloquy, and consensus.

Health-software company Allscripts Healthcare Solutions Inc., which bought Practice Fusion for $100 million in 2018, said in a statement that the conduct predated the deal and that Allscripts has \"further strengthened\" compliance at Practice Fusion. The company didn't answer specific questions about the settlement.</p><p>As deaths from opioid overdoses mounted, states and individuals filed lawsuits accusing manufacturers of pushing drugs while downplaying risks. Many millions of pills were dispensed at pain clinics in rural areas, fueling a vigorous street trade.</p><p>The Practice Fusion case shows a more subtle method of reaching drug consumers. Employees estimated internally that the drug company could add almost 3,000 patients and bolster opioid sales by as much as $11.3 million through the partnership. Under the contract, the drugmaker paid Practice Fusion almost $1 million.</p><p>\"The pharmaceutical industry was egregious in advancing and propelling the access of opioids to a wider and wider population,\" said Bertha Madras, a professor at Harvard Medical School who served on the President's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis. She described the Practice Fusion arrangement as \"nefarious and subtle.\"</p><p>Big tech companies have large-scale plans to reinvent healthcare, promising to revolutionize areas such as electronic records, which are a crucial source of data about consumer health. But the Practice Fusion case shows how such plans can be exploited and even provide a new avenue for financial interests to influence treatment.</p><p>--</p><p>Free help</p><p>The San Francisco company was founded in 2005 and became known for its unique model of providing free, ad-supported health-records software to independent doctors. The company says its cloud-based platform has grown to be used in roughly 30,000 practices.</p><p>Groundwork for the deal between the companies began in 2013, according to the statement of facts agreed to by Practice Fusion under a deferred prosecution agreement. The idea was to get the opioid maker's pain drugs to certain kinds of patients: ones who weren't taking opioids or those being prescribed the company's less profitable products. It also aimed to secure longer prescriptions, according to the court papers.</p><p>The companies also agreed to do a research study. But according to an internal Practice Fusion email cited in the court papers, the drug company considered it \"all about marketing.\"</p><p>--</p><p>Shunning guidelines</p><p>Although the settlement doesn't name the drugmaker, Reuters reported this week -- citing unnamed sources -- that it was Purdue. Purdue's opioid offerings also matched the profile of drugs cited in court papers.</p><p>Practice Fusion and Purdue researchers publicly announced in a 2017 research report that they had begun to study an online tool with features identical to those described in the court papers. The research tested pain alerts for roughly 13 million patients over a year.</p><p>Steven Labkoff, the Purdue researcher who presented that study at a 2017 conference, didn't return calls seeking comment.</p><p>In 2016, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention put out new guidelines on opioids and treating patients with chronic pain. The guidelines emphasized non-drug and non-opioid alternatives. When opioids were prescribed, quicker-acting versions were preferable to the long-acting type, the agency said.</p><p>The opioid company and Practice Fusion shared those guidelines internally but \"did not incorporate the recommendations contained in those guidelines,\" according to the court papers.</p><p>Practice Fusion reported to the drug company in 2016 that the project was working as intended, shifting prescriptions to the company's extended-release opioids. The arrangement between Practice Fusion and the opioid company continued even after a lawyer for the drugmaker raised concerns about the substance of the program and started a legal review, according to the papers.</p><p>--</p><p>'Almost inevitable'</p><p>Jamie Weisman, an Atlanta-area dermatologist, learned this week of Practice Fusion's deal with the opioid maker. She has used its platform for five years but doesn't recall seeing that kind of pain alert.</p><p>\"It's evil. There's really no other word for it,\" she said. But \"if you want to model electronic health records as a for-profit system and not regulate them as such and force doctors to be on them, it's almost inevitable that they're going to be manipulated.\"</p><p>Makers of electronic medical records have come under increased scrutiny for their business practices, including by the U.S. Justice Department, as they've grown since the the Affordable Care Act was implemented.</p><p>Practice Fusion had similar agreements with makers of other drugs. The government claimed in its civil case that Practice Fusion struck 14 such deals with pharmaceutical companies from 2013 to 2017. Practice Fusion admitted only to the opioid agreement, and \"there has been no determination of liability\" on civil claims, the Justice Department said in a statement.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: ALTHOUGH it wasn't named in court documents in the Practice Fusion case, Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin, is believed to be the drugmaker that paid the San Francisco firm to try to boost prescriptions.

Under the garb of political ideology, the media in India is still pursuing 'ad hominem' approach towards the situation. In simple terms we can say that the Indian media is prying on the human tragedy and havoc that corona virus is wreaking. Not showing factual report, the media continues to create fear psychosis among the masses for the sake of rising TRP. They are compounding people's problems and miseries, rather than looking at them with apathy. From the corners of palatial offices, media is peddling lies with all impunity, especially after the episode of recent 'Nizamudin Markaz'. Since then, the Indian media is targeting particular community for the spread, thus invoking hatred among people against the community.</p><p>Media did not talk about labourers and workers thrown out of jobs by the 21-day lockout. Their source of income and day-to-day needs of grocery and other things did not touch the media reports. The media did not show how thousands of laborers have left for their villages without money and transport. According to The Wire, 22 workers died while proceeding without food and water on the Indian roads to return to their villages several hundred kilometers away from their place of work. Except, The Wire, no Indian media, has come forward to tell the number of deaths that occurred because of hunger and thirst on barren Indian roads.</p><p>Media, unabashedly, always looking towards the government for financial support in the form of ads or help from a government's friendly business houses are presenting programmers that serve the government and cover their failures. India's media has played a crucial role in protecting country's democracy since its independence from Britain in 1947. But currently journalists are either attacked for being neutral or they succumb to the political powers. Since Narendra Modi came to power in 2014, the media has been highly controlled by the government, especially the airwaves. Modi has shrewdly cultivated the media to build a cult of personality that portrays him as the nation's selfless saviour. At the same time, senior government officials have pressed news outlets - berating editors, cutting off advertising, ordering tax investigations - to ignore the uglier side of his party's campaign to transform India from a tolerant, religiously diverse country into an assertively Hindu one.</p><p>With the corona virus pandemic, BJP led government has gotten more blatant in his attempt to control coverage and, as with other difficult stories, some Indian news organizations seem eager to follow the suit. It is believed that right before announcement of lockdown on 1.3 billion people to avoid spread of corona virus, Modi and his government representatives had met with top news editors and owners and requested them to publish \"inspiring and positive stories\" about the government's efforts. Then, after the lockdown stranded half a million migrant workers, with some dying along the highways, his lawyers persuaded the Supreme Court this week to order all media to \"publish the official version\" of coronavirus developments, although outlets are still allowed to carry independent reporting.</p><p>The Supreme Court of India directed the Media, including print, electronic and social media, to maintain a strong sense of responsibility and ensure that unverified news capable of causing panic is not disseminated. The apex court has noted that the migration of a large number of labourers working in the cities was triggered by panic created by fake news that the lockdown would continue for more than three months. The Court observed that it was not possible for it to overlook the menace of fake news by electronic, print or social media because the panic-driven migration has caused untold suffering to those who acted on such news, causing some to lose their lives. The Court has said in the order that it does not intend to interfere with the free discussion about the pandemic, but at the same time has directed that the Media refer to and publish the official version about the developments. An association of leading broadcasters was quick to admire the court decision, which many intellectuals said was yet another attack on India's constitutionally guaranteed freedom of speech.</p><p>Another dimension to the independence and role of media can be gauged from the hyper-active social media that continues to peddle disinformation and misinformation without any regulation. Facing defeat every moment by the fast-social media, the mainstream media is unable to understand, how to compete with social media which has been swarming its sphere-like locust. In new media, Mobile journalism has produced journalists, having natural temper for news. Hardly trained at eminent media schools, in big labs of cameras, dark rooms and expensive multiple software for mixing and providing the event's background. But the Mobile Journalism is doing much better than tradition electronic media.</p><p>Social media and Mobile journalism also faces a big challenge from \"fake news\", which political parties in their IT studios and some unethical persons produce it on behalf of officials, who are seen now where. The news on Social media goes around into circulation much before the electronic media awakes at the Prime Time by gathering leaders and experts at the panel discussion tables, too much used repeated stale faces appear on TV shows speaking the postman language of their political party.</p><p>Blinkered panel members come for a routine evening walk for a bland panel discussion knowing much before what another opponent member would say to counter. Sometimes they look like a court crier to show that they are doing their job to the best of ability. Media on the panel is a palpable one supporting the anchor or the ruling party's political line. Even some retired army Generals or other ranks play the role of ruling party's spokesman. With social platforms giving rise to misinformation, the seemingly unstoppable rise of big tech and independent voices being squashed by commercial ownership. At a time when factual information is both scarcer and more essential than ever, we believe that each of us deserves access to accurate reporting with integrity at its heart.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily Times.

Fortified with \u201chot\u201d internal company documents, Rep. Jerrold Nadler was building his case at a hearing that seemed almost like a trial for Facebook and three other tech giants over alleged anti-competitive tactics.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cThank you, Mr. Zuckerberg, you\u2019re making my point,\u201d Nadler declared. Then to the \u201cjury:\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s own admission and by the documents we have from the time, Facebook saw Instagram as a threat that could potentially siphon business away from Facebook and so rather than compete with it, Facebook bought it.\u201d</p><p>And then the closing argument: \u201cThis is exactly the type of anti-competitive acquisition that the antitrust laws were designed to prevent. This should never have happened in the first place.\u201d</p><p>The hearing empowered the Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust, led by Rep. David Cicilline, to publicly air information from more than one million internal documents provided by Facebook, Amazon, Google and Apple during the panel's yearlong investigation of Big Tech\u2019s market dominance.</p><p>In doing so, lawmakers provided a rare glimpse inside the likely lines of inquiry being pursued by the Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general as they conduct their own antitrust investigations into the tech companies. All are likely to have access to the same document trove.</p><p>Lawmakers played back words from the documents during last week's hearing, which marked the first time that Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Google\u2019s Sundar Pichai and Apple\u2019s Tim Cook testified (via video) as a group to Congress.</p><p>Sprinkled with colorful language from company executives like \u201cdigital land grab,\u201d \u201cbig video brains\u201d and \u201ckicking butt,\u201d the emails and chat logs, all marked \u201chighly confidential,\" grabbed attention. Looking ahead, the \u201chot documents\u201d don\u2019t by themselves guarantee successful legal action by regulators, legal experts say. But they can be very useful.</p><p>\u201cIt sounds inflammatory but if you really think about it, it\u2019s kind of what you want competitors to be thinking,\u201d says Chad Elder, an antitrust litigation partner in the Bradley law firm\u2019s Nashville office.</p><p>Still, he said, such documents can help competitors that are suing a dominant company, and \u201ccan make the difference sometimes in whether you get to a jury.\u201d</p><p>Hot documents can often be spun either way in antitrust cases. They can be held up by prosecutors or regulators as \u201csmoking gun\u201d evidence of mobster-style tactics to illegally squash competition. But company attorneys may contend they show the sort of vigorous competitive spirit that\u2019s prized in top executives. The companies may accuse prosecutors of pulling a few swaggering emails out of context.</p><p>It\u2019s not illegal in itself for a company to be a monopoly. But it can be a violation of antitrust law for a company at the top of the heap to use its power to kick competitors off the hill.</p><p>For example, there\u2019s the matter of \u201cpredatory pricing.\u201d For a company to set prices below its costs doesn\u2019t violate antitrust law unless it\u2019s part of a strategy to eliminate competitors and then possibly raise its prices over the long term. Below-cost pricing is permissible if it\u2019s done only to maintain or gain market share.</p><p>Bezos was questioned at the hearing about Amazon executives\u2019 exchanges regarding competitor Diapers.com, which Amazon bought in November 2010 for $545 million. A June 2010 email from a high-level executive to Bezos and others said: \u201cWe have already initiated a more aggressive \u2018plan to win\u2019 against Diapers.com.\u2019\u2019</p><p>\"We need to match pricing on these guys no matter what the cost,\u201d the executive wrote in 2009.</p><p>Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon, D-Pa., asked Bezos whether he personally signed off on a plan to raise prices once Amazon had acquired the competitor.</p><p>\u201cWhat I remember is that we matched competitor prices. And I believe we followed Diapers.com,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I can tell you is that the idea of using diapers and products like that to attract new customers ... is a very traditional idea.\u201d</p><p>The Supreme Court, in rulings in recent years, has to some extent limited the influence of internal hot documents in antitrust cases, pointing instead toward tests of anti-competitive conduct such as prices charged by a company and its competitors.</p><p>Internal documents can be useful to investigators for insight into the likely effect of an acquisition or other company action, said George Hay, a law professor and antitrust expert at Cornell University. \u201cThey can help in deciding whether there\u2019s a fire there, not just smoke,\u201d said Hay, a former chief antitrust economist at the Justice Department.</p><p>That\u2019s of interest because federal regulators are delving into the four huge companies\u2019 acquisitions of hundreds of smaller firms, dating back to 2010. The head of the Federal Trade Commission has said that as a result of the review, the government may require tech giants to unwind earlier takeovers and divest assets if the agency finds violations of antitrust law.</p><p>Facebook bought the popular photo-sharing service Instagram for $1 billion in April 2012. Earlier that month, Zuckerberg said in an email: \u201cInstagram can hurt us meaningfully without becoming a huge business.\u201d</p><p>In questioning, Nadler tried to pin him down, without getting yes or no answers. Did he mean the threat was that users might switch from Facebook to Instagram?</p><p>Zuckerberg eventually acknowledged that Instagram was a competitor in mobile photo-sharing and camera apps. \u201cThere were a lot of others at the time,\u201d he added.</p><p>Zuckerberg told Facebook\u2019s chief financial officer in a February 2012 message that with possible acquisitions of Instagram, Path or Foursquare, \u201cWhat we\u2019re really buying is time.\u201d</p><p>In a message sent a short while later, he followed up with a clarification: \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to imply that we\u2019d be buying them to prevent them from competing with us in any way.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>Follow Gordon on Twitter at <url

Fortified with \u201chot\u201d internal company documents, Rep. Jerrold Nadler was building his case at a hearing that seemed almost like a trial for Facebook and three other tech giants over alleged anti-competitive tactics.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cThank you, Mr. Zuckerberg, you\u2019re making my point,\u201d Nadler declared. Then to the \u201cjury:\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s own admission and by the documents we have from the time, Facebook saw Instagram as a threat that could potentially siphon business away from Facebook and so rather than compete with it, Facebook bought it.\u201d</p><p>And then the closing argument: \u201cThis is exactly the type of anti-competitive acquisition that the antitrust laws were designed to prevent. This should never have happened in the first place.\u201d</p><p>The hearing empowered the Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust, led by Rep. David Cicilline, to publicly air information from more than one million internal documents provided by Facebook, Amazon, Google and Apple during the panel's yearlong investigation of Big Tech\u2019s market dominance.</p><p>In doing so, lawmakers provided a rare glimpse inside the likely lines of inquiry being pursued by the Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general as they conduct their own antitrust investigations into the tech companies. All are likely to have access to the same document trove.</p><p>Lawmakers played back words from the documents during last week's hearing, which marked the first time that Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Google\u2019s Sundar Pichai and Apple\u2019s Tim Cook testified (via video) as a group to Congress.</p><p>Sprinkled with colorful language from company executives like \u201cdigital land grab,\u201d \u201cbig video brains\u201d and \u201ckicking butt,\u201d the emails and chat logs, all marked \u201chighly confidential,\" grabbed attention. Looking ahead, the \u201chot documents\u201d don\u2019t by themselves guarantee successful legal action by regulators, legal experts say. But they can be very useful.</p><p>\u201cIt sounds inflammatory but if you really think about it, it\u2019s kind of what you want competitors to be thinking,\u201d says Chad Elder, an antitrust litigation partner in the Bradley law firm\u2019s Nashville office.</p><p>Still, he said, such documents can help competitors that are suing a dominant company, and \u201ccan make the difference sometimes in whether you get to a jury.\u201d</p><p>Hot documents can often be spun either way in antitrust cases. They can be held up by prosecutors or regulators as \u201csmoking gun\u201d evidence of mobster-style tactics to illegally squash competition. But company attorneys may contend they show the sort of vigorous competitive spirit that\u2019s prized in top executives. The companies may accuse prosecutors of pulling a few swaggering emails out of context.</p><p>It\u2019s not illegal in itself for a company to be a monopoly. But it can be a violation of antitrust law for a company at the top of the heap to use its power to kick competitors off the hill.</p><p>For example, there\u2019s the matter of \u201cpredatory pricing.\u201d For a company to set prices below its costs doesn\u2019t violate antitrust law unless it\u2019s part of a strategy to eliminate competitors and then possibly raise its prices over the long term. Below-cost pricing is permissible if it\u2019s done only to maintain or gain market share.</p><p>Bezos was questioned at the hearing about Amazon executives\u2019 exchanges regarding competitor Diapers.com, which Amazon bought in November 2010 for $545 million. A June 2010 email from a high-level executive to Bezos and others said: \u201cWe have already initiated a more aggressive \u2018plan to win\u2019 against Diapers.com.\u2019\u2019</p><p>\"We need to match pricing on these guys no matter what the cost,\u201d the executive wrote in 2009.</p><p>Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon, D-Pa., asked Bezos whether he personally signed off on a plan to raise prices once Amazon had acquired the competitor.</p><p>\u201cWhat I remember is that we matched competitor prices. And I believe we followed Diapers.com,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I can tell you is that the idea of using diapers and products like that to attract new customers ... is a very traditional idea.\u201d</p><p>The Supreme Court, in rulings in recent years, has to some extent limited the influence of internal hot documents in antitrust cases, pointing instead toward tests of anti-competitive conduct such as prices charged by a company and its competitors.</p><p>Internal documents can be useful to investigators for insight into the likely effect of an acquisition or other company action, said George Hay, a law professor and antitrust expert at Cornell University. \u201cThey can help in deciding whether there\u2019s a fire there, not just smoke,\u201d said Hay, a former chief antitrust economist at the Justice Department.</p><p>That\u2019s of interest because federal regulators are delving into the four huge companies\u2019 acquisitions of hundreds of smaller firms, dating back to 2010. The head of the Federal Trade Commission has said that as a result of the review, the government may require tech giants to unwind earlier takeovers and divest assets if the agency finds violations of antitrust law.</p><p>Facebook bought the popular photo-sharing service Instagram for $1 billion in April 2012. Earlier that month, Zuckerberg said in an email: \u201cInstagram can hurt us meaningfully without becoming a huge business.\u201d</p><p>In questioning, Nadler tried to pin him down, without getting yes or no answers. Did he mean the threat was that users might switch from Facebook to Instagram?</p><p>Zuckerberg eventually acknowledged that Instagram was a competitor in mobile photo-sharing and camera apps. \u201cThere were a lot of others at the time,\u201d he added.</p><p>Zuckerberg told Facebook\u2019s chief financial officer in a February 2012 message that with possible acquisitions of Instagram, Path or Foursquare, \u201cWhat we\u2019re really buying is time.\u201d</p><p>In a message sent a short while later, he followed up with a clarification: \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to imply that we\u2019d be buying them to prevent them from competing with us in any way.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>Follow Gordon on Twitter at <url

(Graeme Jennings/Pool via AP)WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The House Judiciary chairman was closing in on his Perry Mason moment with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Fortified with 'hot' internal company documents, Rep. Jerrold Nadler was building his case at a hearing that seemed almost like a trial for Facebook and three other tech giants over alleged anti-competitive tactics. </p><p> 'Thank you, Mr. Zuckerberg, you're making my point,' Nadler declared. Then to the 'jury:' 'By Mr. Zuckerberg's own admission and by the documents we have from the time, Facebook saw Instagram as a threat that could potentially siphon business away from Facebook and so rather than compete with it, Facebook bought it.' And then the closing argument: 'This is exactly the type of anti-competitive acquisition that the antitrust laws were designed to prevent. This should never have happened in the first place.' The hearing empowered the Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust, led by Rep. David Cicilline, to publicly air information from more than one million internal documents provided by Facebook, Amazon, Google and Apple during the panel's yearlong investigation of Big Tech's market dominance.  In doing so, lawmakers provided a rare glimpse inside the likely lines of inquiry being pursued by the Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general as they conduct their own antitrust investigations into the tech companies. All are likely to have access to the same document trove. Lawmakers played back words from the documents during last week's hearing, which marked the first time that Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Google's Sundar Pichai and Apple's Tim Cook testified (via video) as a group to Congress.  Sprinkled with colorful language from company executives like 'digital land grab,' 'big video brains' and 'kicking butt,' the emails and chat logs, all marked 'highly confidential,\" grabbed attention. Looking ahead, the 'hot documents' don't by themselves guarantee successful legal action by regulators, legal experts say. But they can be very useful. (Ad) It made history when advertised its pot in an NFL Stadium. Its processing 10 tons of pot in the world's 2nd oldest legal marijuana market with plans to jump that to 50 tons. Yet, as Canadian pot stocks tanked, investors lost sight solid companies like this one from Washington, State, USA. The smart money knows legal marijuana is still a huge industry. 'It sounds inflammatory but if you really think about it, it's kind of what you want competitors to be thinking,' says Chad Elder, an antitrust litigation partner in the Bradley law firm's Nashville office. Still, he said, such documents can help competitors that are suing a dominant company, and 'can make the difference sometimes in whether you get to a jury.' Hot documents can often be spun either way in antitrust cases. They can be held up by prosecutors or regulators as 'smoking gun' evidence of mobster-style tactics to illegally squash competition. But company attorneys may contend they show the sort of vigorous competitive spirit that's prized in top executives. The companies may accuse prosecutors of pulling a few swaggering emails out of context. It's not illegal in itself for a company to be a monopoly. But it can be a violation of antitrust law for a company at the top of the heap to use its power to kick competitors off the hill. For example, there's the matter of 'predatory pricing.' For a company to set prices below its costs doesn't violate antitrust law unless it's part of a strategy to eliminate competitors and then possibly raise its prices over the long term. Below-cost pricing is permissible if it's done only to maintain or gain market share. Bezos was questioned at the hearing about Amazon executives' exchanges regarding competitor Diapers.com, which Amazon bought in November 2010 for $545 million. A June 2010 email from a high-level executive to Bezos and others said: 'We have already initiated a more aggressive 'plan to win' against Diapers.com.'' \"We need to match pricing on these guys no matter what the cost,' the executive wrote in 2009. Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon, D-Pa., asked Bezos whether he personally signed off on a plan to raise prices once Amazon had acquired the competitor. 'What I remember is that we matched competitor prices. And I believe we followed Diapers.com,' he said. 'What I can tell you is that the idea of using diapers and products like that to attract new customers ... is a very traditional idea.' The Supreme Court, in rulings in recent years, has to some extent limited the influence of internal hot documents in antitrust cases, pointing instead toward tests of anti-competitive conduct such as prices charged by a company and its competitors.  Internal documents can be useful to investigators for insight into the likely effect of an acquisition or other company action, said George Hay, a law professor and antitrust expert at Cornell University. 'They can help in deciding whether there's a fire there, not just smoke,' said Hay, a former chief antitrust economist at the Justice Department.  That's of interest because federal regulators are delving into the four huge companies' acquisitions of hundreds of smaller firms, dating back to 2010. The head of the Federal Trade Commission has said that as a result of the review, the government may require tech giants to unwind earlier takeovers and divest assets if the agency finds violations of antitrust law. Facebook bought the popular photo-sharing service Instagram for $1 billion in April 2012. Earlier that month, Zuckerberg said in an email: 'Instagram can hurt us meaningfully without becoming a huge business.'  In questioning, Nadler tried to pin him down, without getting yes or no answers. Did he mean the threat was that users might switch from Facebook to Instagram? Zuckerberg eventually acknowledged that Instagram was a competitor in mobile photo-sharing and camera apps. 'There were a lot of others at the time,' he added. Zuckerberg told Facebook's chief financial officer in a February 2012 message that with possible acquisitions of Instagram, Path or Foursquare, 'What we're really buying is time.' In a message sent a short while later, he followed up with a clarification: 'I didn't mean to imply that we'd be buying them to prevent them from competing with us in any way.' ___ Follow Gordon on Twitter at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.twitter.com/mgordonap\">http://www.twitter.com/mgordonap</url> Companies Mentioned in This Article 15 Technology Stocks that Analysts Love[1]There are more than 1,100 technology companies traded on public markets in the United States.

Fortified with \"hot\" internal company documents, Rep. Jerrold Nadler was building his case at a hearing that seemed almost like a trial for Facebook and three other tech giants over alleged anti-competitive tactics.    \"Thank you, Mr. Zuckerberg, you're making my point,\" Nadler declared. Then to the \"jury:\"    \"By Mr. Zuckerberg's own admission and by the documents we have from the time, Facebook saw Instagram as a threat that could potentially siphon business away from Facebook and so rather than compete with it, Facebook bought it.\"    And then the closing argument: \"This is exactly the type of anti-competitive acquisition that the antitrust laws were designed to prevent. This should never have happened in the first place.\"    The hearing empowered the Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust, led by Rep. David Cicilline, to publicly air information from more than one million internal documents provided by Facebook, Amazon, Google and Apple during the panel's yearlong investigation of Big Tech's market dominance.    In doing so, lawmakers provided a rare glimpse inside the likely lines of inquiry being pursued by the Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general as they conduct their own antitrust investigations into the tech companies. All are likely to have access to the same document trove.    Lawmakers played back words from the documents during last week's hearing, which marked the first time that Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Google's Sundar Pichai and Apple's Tim Cook testified (via video) as a group to Congress.    Sprinkled with colorful language from company executives like \"digital land grab,\" \"big video brains\" and \"kicking butt,\" the emails and chat logs, all marked \"highly confidential,\" grabbed attention. Looking ahead, the \"hot documents\" don't by themselves guarantee successful legal action by regulators, legal experts say. But they can be very useful.    \"It sounds inflammatory but if you really think about it, it's kind of what you want competitors to be thinking,\" says Chad Elder, an antitrust litigation partner in the Bradley law firm's Nashville office.    Still, he said, such documents can help competitors that are suing a dominant company, and \"can make the difference sometimes in whether you get to a jury.\"    Hot documents can often be spun either way in antitrust cases. They can be held up by prosecutors or regulators as \"smoking gun\" evidence of mobster-style tactics to illegally squash competition. But company attorneys may contend they show the sort of vigorous competitive spirit that's prized in top executives. The companies may accuse prosecutors of pulling a few swaggering emails out of context.    It's not illegal in itself for a company to be a monopoly. But it can be a violation of antitrust law for a company at the top of the heap to use its power to kick competitors off the hill.    For example, there's the matter of \"predatory pricing.\" For a company to set prices below its costs doesn't violate antitrust law unless it's part of a strategy to eliminate competitors and then possibly raise its prices over the long term. Below-cost pricing is permissible if it's done only to maintain or gain market share.    Bezos was questioned at the hearing about Amazon executives' exchanges regarding competitor Diapers.com, which Amazon bought in November 2010 for $545 million. A June 2010 email from a high-level executive to Bezos and others said: \"We have already initiated a more aggressive 'plan to win' against Diapers.com.\"    \"We need to match pricing on these guys no matter what the cost,\" the executive wrote in 2009.    Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon, D-Pa., asked Bezos whether he personally signed off on a plan to raise prices once Amazon had acquired the competitor.    \"What I remember is that we matched competitor prices. And I believe we followed Diapers.com,\" he said. \"What I can tell you is that the idea of using diapers and products like that to attract new customers ... is a very traditional idea.\"    The Supreme Court, in rulings in recent years, has to some extent limited the influence of internal hot documents in antitrust cases, pointing instead toward tests of anti-competitive conduct such as prices charged by a company and its competitors.    Internal documents can be useful to investigators for insight into the likely effect of an acquisition or other company action, said George Hay, a law professor and antitrust expert at Cornell University. \"They can help in deciding whether there's a fire there, not just smoke,\" said Hay, a former chief antitrust economist at the Justice Department.    That's of interest because federal regulators are delving into the four huge companies' acquisitions of hundreds of smaller firms, dating back to 2010. The head of the Federal Trade Commission has said that as a result of the review, the government may require tech giants to unwind earlier takeovers and divest assets if the agency finds violations of antitrust law.    Facebook bought the popular photo-sharing service Instagram for $1 billion in April 2012. Earlier that month, Zuckerberg said in an email: \"Instagram can hurt us meaningfully without becoming a huge business.\"    In questioning, Nadler tried to pin him down, without getting yes or no answers. Did he mean the threat was that users might switch from Facebook to Instagram?    Zuckerberg eventually acknowledged that Instagram was a competitor in mobile photo-sharing and camera apps. \"There were a lot of others at the time,\" he added.    Zuckerberg told Facebook's chief financial officer in a February 2012 message that with possible acquisitions of Instagram, Path or Foursquare, \"What we're really buying is time.\"    In a message sent a short while later, he followed up with a clarification: \"I didn't mean to imply that we'd be buying them to prevent them from competing with us in any way.\"      Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks via video conference during a House Judiciary subcommittee hearing on antitrust on Capitol Hill on Wednesday in Washington. - Graeme Jennings/Pool via AP</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42774093787</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60HT-81W1-JCSC-J2JK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1080\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Hot Springs Sentinel-Record</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 6, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United States</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Americas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Northern America</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

Fortified with \u201chot\u201d internal company documents, Rep. Jerrold Nadler was building his case at a hearing that seemed almost like a trial for Facebook and three other tech giants over alleged anti-competitive tactics.   \u201cThank you, Mr. Zuckerberg, you\u2019re making my point,\u201d Nadler declared. Then to the \u201cjury:\u201d   \u201cBy Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s own admission and by the documents we have from the time, Facebook saw Instagram as a threat that could potentially siphon business away from Facebook and so rather than compete with it, Facebook bought it.\u201d   And then the closing argument: \u201cThis is exactly the type of anti-competitive acquisition that the antitrust laws were designed to prevent. This should never have happened in the first place.\u201d   The hearing empowered the Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust, led by Rep. David Cicilline, to publicly air information from more than one million internal documents provided by Facebook, Amazon, Google and Apple during the panel's yearlong investigation of Big Tech\u2019s market dominance.   In doing so, lawmakers provided a rare glimpse inside the likely lines of inquiry being pursued by the Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general as they conduct their own antitrust investigations into the tech companies. All are likely to have access to the same document trove.   Lawmakers played back words from the documents during last week's hearing, which marked the first time that Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Google\u2019s Sundar Pichai and Apple\u2019s Tim Cook testified (via video) as a group to Congress.   Sprinkled with colorful language from company executives like \u201cdigital land grab,\u201d \u201cbig video brains\u201d and \u201ckicking butt,\u201d the emails and chat logs, all marked \u201chighly confidential,\" grabbed attention. Looking ahead, the \u201chot documents\u201d don\u2019t by themselves guarantee successful legal action by regulators, legal experts say. But they can be very useful.   \u201cIt sounds inflammatory but if you really think about it, it\u2019s kind of what you want competitors to be thinking,\u201d says Chad Elder, an antitrust litigation partner in the Bradley law firm\u2019s Nashville office.   Still, he said, such documents can help competitors that are suing a dominant company, and \u201ccan make the difference sometimes in whether you get to a jury.\u201d   Hot documents can often be spun either way in antitrust cases. They can be held up by prosecutors or regulators as \u201csmoking gun\u201d evidence of mobster-style tactics to illegally squash competition. But company attorneys may contend they show the sort of vigorous competitive spirit that\u2019s prized in top executives. The companies may accuse prosecutors of pulling a few swaggering emails out of context.   It\u2019s not illegal in itself for a company to be a monopoly. But it can be a violation of antitrust law for a company at the top of the heap to use its power to kick competitors off the hill.   For example, there\u2019s the matter of \u201cpredatory pricing.\u201d For a company to set prices below its costs doesn\u2019t violate antitrust law unless it\u2019s part of a strategy to eliminate competitors and then possibly raise its prices over the long term. Below-cost pricing is permissible if it\u2019s done only to maintain or gain market share.   Bezos was questioned at the hearing about Amazon executives\u2019 exchanges regarding competitor Diapers.com, which Amazon bought in November 2010 for $545 million. A June 2010 email from a high-level executive to Bezos and others said: \u201cWe have already initiated a more aggressive \u2018plan to win\u2019 against Diapers.com.\u2019\u2019   \"We need to match pricing on these guys no matter what the cost,\u201d the executive wrote in 2009.   Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon, D-Pa., asked Bezos whether he personally signed off on a plan to raise prices once Amazon had acquired the competitor.   \u201cWhat I remember is that we matched competitor prices. And I believe we followed Diapers.com,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I can tell you is that the idea of using diapers and products like that to attract new customers ... is a very traditional idea.\u201d   The Supreme Court, in rulings in recent years, has to some extent limited the influence of internal hot documents in antitrust cases, pointing instead toward tests of anti-competitive conduct such as prices charged by a company and its competitors.   Internal documents can be useful to investigators for insight into the likely effect of an acquisition or other company action, said George Hay, a law professor and antitrust expert at Cornell University. \u201cThey can help in deciding whether there\u2019s a fire there, not just smoke,\u201d said Hay, a former chief antitrust economist at the Justice Department.   That\u2019s of interest because federal regulators are delving into the four huge companies\u2019 acquisitions of hundreds of smaller firms, dating back to 2010. The head of the Federal Trade Commission has said that as a result of the review, the government may require tech giants to unwind earlier takeovers and divest assets if the agency finds violations of antitrust law.   Facebook bought the popular photo-sharing service Instagram for $1 billion in April 2012. Earlier that month, Zuckerberg said in an email: \u201cInstagram can hurt us meaningfully without becoming a huge business.\u201d   In questioning, Nadler tried to pin him down, without getting yes or no answers. Did he mean the threat was that users might switch from Facebook to Instagram?   Zuckerberg eventually acknowledged that Instagram was a competitor in mobile photo-sharing and camera apps. \u201cThere were a lot of others at the time,\u201d he added.   Zuckerberg told Facebook\u2019s chief financial officer in a February 2012 message that with possible acquisitions of Instagram, Path or Foursquare, \u201cWhat we\u2019re really buying is time.\u201d   In a message sent a short while later, he followed up with a clarification: \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to imply that we\u2019d be buying them to prevent them from competing with us in any way.\u201d   ___   Follow Gordon on Twitter at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.twitter.com/mgordonap\">http://www.twitter.com/mgordonap</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42768979965</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60HP-SNC1-JCSC-J12R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1055\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Click2Houston.com</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 5, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>CC000CTVI</classCode><className>BRADLEY LAW FIRM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Fortified with \u201chot\u201d internal company documents, Rep. Jerrold Nadler was building his case at a hearing that seemed almost like a trial for Facebook and three other tech giants over alleged anti-competitive tactics.      \u201cThank you, Mr. Zuckerberg, you\u2019re making my point,\u201d Nadler declared. Then to the \u201cjury:\u201d      \u201cBy Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s own admission and by the documents we have from the time, Facebook saw Instagram as a threat that could potentially siphon business away from Facebook and so rather than compete with it, Facebook bought it.\u201d      And then the closing argument: \u201cThis is exactly the type of anti-competitive acquisition that the antitrust laws were designed to prevent. This should never have happened in the first place.\u201d      The hearing empowered the Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust, led by Rep. David Cicilline, to publicly air information from more than one million internal documents provided by Facebook, Amazon, Google and Apple during the panel's yearlong investigation of Big Tech\u2019s market dominance.      In doing so, lawmakers provided a rare glimpse inside the likely lines of inquiry being pursued by the Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general as they conduct their own antitrust investigations into the tech companies. All are likely to have access to the same document trove.     Lawmakers played back words from the documents during last week's hearing, which marked the first time that Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Google\u2019s Sundar Pichai and Apple\u2019s Tim Cook testified (via video) as a group to Congress.      Sprinkled with colorful language from company executives like \u201cdigital land grab,\u201d \u201cbig video brains\u201d and \u201ckicking butt,\u201d the emails and chat logs, all marked \u201chighly confidential,\" grabbed attention. Looking ahead, the \u201chot documents\u201d don\u2019t by themselves guarantee successful legal action by regulators, legal experts say. But they can be very useful.      \u201cIt sounds inflammatory but if you really think about it, it\u2019s kind of what you want competitors to be thinking,\u201d says Chad Elder, an antitrust litigation partner in the Bradley law firm\u2019s Nashville office.      Still, he said, such documents can help competitors that are suing a dominant company, and \u201ccan make the difference sometimes in whether you get to a jury.\u201d      Hot documents can often be spun either way in antitrust cases. They can be held up by prosecutors or regulators as \u201csmoking gun\u201d evidence of mobster-style tactics to illegally squash competition. But company attorneys may contend they show the sort of vigorous competitive spirit that\u2019s prized in top executives. The companies may accuse prosecutors of pulling a few swaggering emails out of context.     It\u2019s not illegal in itself for a company to be a monopoly. But it can be a violation of antitrust law for a company at the top of the heap to use its power to kick competitors off the hill.      For example, there\u2019s the matter of \u201cpredatory pricing.\u201d For a company to set prices below its costs doesn\u2019t violate antitrust law unless it\u2019s part of a strategy to eliminate competitors and then possibly raise its prices over the long term. Below-cost pricing is permissible if it\u2019s done only to maintain or gain market share.      Bezos was questioned at the hearing about Amazon executives\u2019 exchanges regarding competitor Diapers.com, which Amazon bought in November 2010 for $545 million. A June 2010 email from a high-level executive to Bezos and others said: \u201cWe have already initiated a more aggressive \u2018plan to win\u2019 against Diapers.com.\u2019\u2019      \"We need to match pricing on these guys no matter what the cost,\u201d the executive wrote in 2009.      Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon, D-Pa., asked Bezos whether he personally signed off on a plan to raise prices once Amazon had acquired the competitor.      \u201cWhat I remember is that we matched competitor prices. And I believe we followed Diapers.com,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I can tell you is that the idea of using diapers and products like that to attract new customers ... is a very traditional idea.\u201d      The Supreme Court, in rulings in recent years, has to some extent limited the influence of internal hot documents in antitrust cases, pointing instead toward tests of anti-competitive conduct such as prices charged by a company and its competitors.      Internal documents can be useful to investigators for insight into the likely effect of an acquisition or other company action, said George Hay, a law professor and antitrust expert at Cornell University. \u201cThey can help in deciding whether there\u2019s a fire there, not just smoke,\u201d said Hay, a former chief antitrust economist at the Justice Department.      That\u2019s of interest because federal regulators are delving into the four huge companies\u2019 acquisitions of hundreds of smaller firms, dating back to 2010. The head of the Federal Trade Commission has said that as a result of the review, the government may require tech giants to unwind earlier takeovers and divest assets if the agency finds violations of antitrust law.      Facebook bought the popular photo-sharing service Instagram for $1 billion in April 2012. Earlier that month, Zuckerberg said in an email: \u201cInstagram can hurt us meaningfully without becoming a huge business.\u201d      In questioning, Nadler tried to pin him down, without getting yes or no answers. Did he mean the threat was that users might switch from Facebook to Instagram?      Zuckerberg eventually acknowledged that Instagram was a competitor in mobile photo-sharing and camera apps. \u201cThere were a lot of others at the time,\u201d he added.      Zuckerberg told Facebook\u2019s chief financial officer in a February 2012 message that with possible acquisitions of Instagram, Path or Foursquare, \u201cWhat we\u2019re really buying is time.\u201d      In a message sent a short while later, he followed up with a clarification: \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to imply that we\u2019d be buying them to prevent them from competing with us in any way.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42768954158</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60HP-SNC1-JCSC-J11H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1056\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Miami Herald</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 5, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>CC000CTVI</classCode><className>BRADLEY LAW FIRM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The lines that separate state-directed and private sector initiatives as well as those between civilian and security uses are so porous they are hard to define. <url normalizedValue=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Cover-Story/Why-China-s-AI-players-are-struggling-to-evolve-beyond-surveillance\"> This article</url> in the Nikkei Asian Review describes the rollout of Beijing\u2019s huge AI ambitions and the ethical issues over data privacy that they raise.</p><p>A small city near China\u2019s border with Vietnam encapsulates Beijing\u2019s approach. The city\u2019s authorities are trying to create a \u201csmart city\u201d. Typically, this involves handing over a huge amount of citizens\u2019 data to China\u2019s big tech companies.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Key implications:</emphasis> \u201cPrivate AI companies in China leverage strategic support from the government to form a collaborative national organism of AI,\u201d said Vilas Dhar, a US-based venture investor and AI expert. \u201cThis integrated ecosystem makes them highly competitive, but also spurs scrutiny by the rest of the world.\u201d</p><p>The size of China\u2019s AI ambitions are startling. The State Council (cabinet) decreed in 2017 that the AI industry would be worth Rmb1tn ($143bn) by 2030. Much of this is intended to be achieved by a \u201cnational team\u201d comprised partly of private companies including Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent, together with voice recognition intelligence company iFlytek.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Upshot:</emphasis> China\u2019s push into AI should not be underestimated. Between 2016 and 2018, Chinese companies filed more AI-related patents than their US counterparts. In 2018 alone, the country was responsible for 30,000 new patent filings in artificial intelligence: a 10-fold increase in just five years, according to research by Nikkei.\u00a0</p><p>Mercedes\u2019 top 10</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">A round-up of the week\u2019s best tech stories from the FT\u2019s Asia tech reporter Mercedes Ruehl.</emphasis></p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>I hit the road in <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Indonesia</emphasis> recently to trace the rise of the \u201csuper app\u201d \u2014 see me doing a piece to camera while balancing on the back of a Gojek food delivery motorbike here and please take a look at our fintech in <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Asia</emphasis> Big Read here.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Oyo, the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Indian</emphasis> hotel chain backed by Japan\u2019s SoftBank, is having trouble in <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">China</emphasis>, where it claims to have 19,000 contracts.

Sobriety returned to Asian tech valuations in the latter part of 2019, blowing much of the froth off the heady exuberance that had characterised investor sentiment, particularly in China.</p><p>Cast your mind back to this time last year. SoftBank\u2019s Vision Fund, which was set up in 2017 and was holding $100bn in assets, was flooding early-stage companies with cash. Sequoia had launched an $8bn global growth fund. Hillhouse Capital raised more than $10bn for a fund that broke KKR\u2019s record for an Asia-focused private equity strategy.</p><p>But now, after the WeWork debacle and concerns surrounding some of Asia\u2019s brightest unicorns (see last week\u2019s newsletter on Paytm), the downdraught is palpable. Jeneration Capital, for instance, has managed to secure discounts of about 20 to 30 per cent on the valuations that its target companies had originally demanded.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Read the article here by Henny Sender, the FT\u2019s chief correspondent, international finance.</emphasis></p><p>Art of the deal</p><p>Gojek, the Indonesian ride-hailing decacorn, has confirmed it will be <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dealstreetasia.com/stories/indonesia-gojek-lifestyle-services-167242/\"> shutting down</url> all but two services from its separate lifestyle division and app, GoLife. The decision was taken following a review of the sluggish performance of the five services that combined have contributed only 10 per cent of total orders on the platform.</p><p>Only GoClean and GoMassage, the house cleaning and home massage services, will be retained in the lifestyle division. These two had accounted for 90 per cent of the orders on the GoLife app, which will continue to operate.\u00a0</p><p>That means the beautician service (GoGlam), the vehicle maintenance service (GoAuto), the home appliances repair service (GoFix), the daily needs delivery service (GoDaily) and a service marketplace feature are all biting the dust.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Elsewhere</emphasis></p><p>Canada-based fusion energy start-up General Fusion has raised $65m in a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dealstreetasia.com/stories/temasek-general-fusion-perfect-day-167185/\"> Series E financing round</url> led by Singapore\u2019s Temasek. General Fusion also secured an additional C$50m (US$38m) from Canada\u2019s Strategic Innovation Fund, it said. The new financing will enable it to formally launch a programme to design, construct and operate a fusion demonstration plant.</p><p>In the spotlight</p><p>The Nasdaq gained another Chinese tech start-up this past week. But the <url normalizedValue=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Startups/China-s-self-flying-taxi-startup-EHang-takes-flight-on-Nasdaq\"> initial public offering by EHang</url>, the autonomous flying taxi start-up, was not about raising money, according to Hu Huazhi, its chairman and founder.\u00a0</p><p>The primary goal was to \u201cincrease the company\u2019s transparency\u201d and boost its international reputation, Mr Hu said. He shrugged off the political risks for US-listed Chinese technology companies amid heightened tensions between the two economies. \u201cMost disputes between [the] two countries were related to information products that might affect people's privacy,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a vehicle provider, we are not subject to such concerns.\u201d</p><p>That said, other Chinese aerial tech companies have raised security concerns in the US. Perhaps that is why EHang shares are down more than 11 per cent nearly a week after going public.</p><p>Smart data</p><p>It\u2019s hard to name a food delivery app that isn\u2019t lossmaking. Uber Eats, DoorDash, Swiggy and Deliveroo may have helped turn delivering meals into a multibillion-dollar industry and cut into restaurants\u2019 profits but making a profit is still an aspiration for many of these companies. Meituan Dianping, China\u2019s top food delivery app, is an exception.\u00a0</p><p>Just 12 months ago, Meituan losses were growing faster than its sales.

They had one hour to persuade delegates from more than 40 countries of their vision: an alternative form of the internet, to replace the technological architecture that has underpinned the web for half a century.</p><p>Whereas today\u2019s internet is owned by everyone and no one, they were in the process of building something very different \u2014 a new infrastructure that could put power back in the hands of nation states, instead of individuals.</p><p>The team who had masterminded the New IP (internet protocol) proposal was from the Chinese telecoms giant <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/254cd19f-4724-4c89-9230-926e8201a823\">Huawei</url>, which had sent the largest delegation of any company to the September meeting. </p><p>At the gathering, held at the International Telecommunications Union, a UN agency that establishes common global standards for technologies, they presented a simple PowerPoint. It didn\u2019t bother with much detail on how this new network would work, or what specific problem it was solving. Instead, it was peppered with images of futuristic technologies, from life-size holograms to self-driving cars.</p><p>The idea was to illustrate that the current internet is a relic that has reached the limits of its technical prowess. It was time, Huawei proposed, for a new global network with a top-down design, and the Chinese should be the ones to build it.</p><p>Governments everywhere seem to agree that today\u2019s model of internet governance \u2014 essentially, lawless self-regulation by private, mostly American companies \u2014 is broken.</p><p>New IP is the latest in a series of efforts to change the way the internet is run, spearheaded by governments that were largely left out when it was founded half a century ago. \u201cThe conflicts surrounding internet governance are the new spaces where political and economic power are unfolding in the 21st century,\u201d wrote the academic Laura DeNardis in her 2014 book <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Global War for Internet Governance</emphasis>. </p><p>The Chinese government in particular has viewed designing internet infrastructure and standards as core to its digital foreign policy, and its censorship tools as proof-of-concept for a more efficient internet, to be exported elsewhere.</p><p>\u201cOf course [China] want a technological infrastructure that gives them the absolute control which they have achieved politically, a design that matches the totalitarian impulse,\u2019\u2019 says Shoshana Zuboff, author of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</emphasis> and a social scientist at Harvard University. \u201cSo that is frightening to me and it should be frightening to every single person.\u201d</p><p>Huawei claims that New IP is being developed purely to meet the technical requirements of a rapidly evolving digital world, and that it has not yet baked a particular governance model into its design. The telecoms giant is leading an ITU group that is focused on future network technology needed by the year 2030, and New IP is being tailored to meet those demands, a spokesperson says.</p><p>What is known about the proposal has come primarily through two jargon-filled documents that have been shared with the FT. These were presented behind closed doors to ITU delegates last September and this February. One is a technical standards proposal, and the other a PowerPoint titled \u201cNew IP: Shaping the Future Network\u201d.</p><p>Despite the might of today\u2019s internet, it has no regulator; instead, power is largely held by a handful of US corporations \u2014 Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook. This lack of central oversight is the very thing that has allowed technologists to transform how we communicate and live but it has also enabled deep fractures in our social order, including the manipulation of public dialogue, the disruption of democracy and the rise of online surveillance.</p><p>Today, in the wake of scandals from <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/adb58fc4-3248-4b80-96fe-53e0d9a49870\"> Cambridge Analytica</url> to the role of Facebook in inciting real-world violence in Myanmar, many experts see the internet as a civic space that requires better public hygiene. Governments \u2014 whether democratic or authoritarian \u2014 are tired of being shut out and are agitating for more influence online. </p><p>The power balance is starting to shift but the scope of what states want varies widely. The US, UK and Europe, for example, are interested in adapting the current system to introduce more regulatory power, and give intelligence agencies greater access to users\u2019 personal data.</p><p>The Chinese New IP proposal is far more radical, and could embed a system of centralised rule enforcement into the technical fabric of the internet. Saudi Arabia, Iran and Russia have previously shown support for Chinese proposals for alternative network technologies, according to sources who were present at ITU meetings. The proposals revealed that the blueprints for this new network have already been drawn up, and construction is under way. Any country will be free to adopt it.</p><p>\u201cRight now we have two versions of the internet \u2014 a market-led capitalist version based on surveillance, which is exploitative; and an authoritarian version also based on surveillance,\u201d Zuboff says. \u201cThe question is: will Europe and North America pull together to construct the legal and technological frameworks for a democratic alternative?\u201d</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The New IP presentation</emphasis> paints a picture of a digital world in 2030 where virtual reality, holographic communication and remote surgery are ubiquitous \u2014 and for which our current network is unfit. Traditional IP protocol is described as \u201cunstable\u201d and \u201cvastly insufficient\u201d, with \u201clots of security, reliability and configuration problems\u201d. </p><p>The documents suggest a new network should instead have a \u201ctop-to-bottom design\u201d and promote data-sharing schemes across governments \u201cthereby serving AI, Big Data and all kinds of other applications\u201d. Many experts fear that under New IP, internet service providers, usually state-owned, would have control and oversight of every device connected to the network and be able to monitor and gate individual access.</p><p>The system is already being built by engineers from \u201cindustry and academia\u201d across \u201cmultiple countries\u201d, Huawei\u2019s team lead Sheng Jiang told the group in September, although he would not reveal who these were due to commercial sensitivities. Among the audience were veterans of the ITU, including mainly government representatives from the UK, the US, Netherlands, Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia and China.</p><p>For some participants, the very idea is anathema. If New IP was legitimised by the ITU, state operators would be able to choose to implement a western internet or a Chinese one, they say. The latter could mean that everyone in those countries would need permission from their internet provider to do anything via the internet \u2014 whether downloading an app or accessing a site \u2014 and administrators could have the power to deny access on a whim. </p><p>Rather than a unified world wide web, citizens could be forced to connect to a patchwork of national internets, each with its own rules \u2014 a concept known in China as cyber sovereignty.</p><p>Recent events in Iran and Saudi Arabia provide a glimpse of what this would look like. These governments blacked out global internet connectivity for prolonged periods during civil unrest, allowing only restricted access to essential services such as banking or healthcare. In Russia, a new <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-50259597\"> \u201csovereign internet\u201d law</url> passed in November enshrined the government\u2019s right to monitor web traffic closely and showed the country\u2019s capability to cleave off from the global web \u2014 a capability that Chinese companies including Huawei helped the Russians build.</p><p>Experts now debate whether China\u2019s vision of its internet governance may be shifting from a defensive one, in which the government wished to be left alone to impose authoritarian internet controls at home, to a more assertive approach, in which the country is openly advocating for others to follow its lead.</p><p>The creators of New IP say that parts of the technology will be ready to be tested by next year. Efforts to persuade delegations of its value will culminate at a major ITU conference due to be held in India in November. To persuade the ITU to approve it within the year, so it can be officially \u201cstandardised\u201d, representatives must reach an internal consensus, based loosely on majority agreement. If the delegates are unable to agree, the proposal will go to a closed-door vote in which only member countries can participate, cutting out the views of industry and civil society.</p><p>This rapid timeline is causing western delegations particular anxiety and demands have been made to slow the process down, according to documents seen by the FT. One participant from the Dutch delegation wrote in an official response, leaked to the FT by multiple sources, that the \u201copen and adaptable nature\u201d of the internet \u2014 both its technical structure and how it is governed \u2014 was fundamental to its success and that he was \u201cespecially concerned\u201d that this model veered away from that philosophy.</p><p>Another stinging rebuke from a UK delegate, also leaked to the FT, declared: \u201cIt is far from clear that technically sound justifications have been made for taking such a radical step. Unless these are forthcoming, reasonable foundations for future work or even continued research activities on these topics are either weak at best, or nonexistent.\u201d</p><p>One of the loudest critics of New IP has been Patrik F\u00e4ltstr\u00f6m, a long-haired maverick engineer, known in his native Sweden as one of the fathers of the internet. In the early 1980s, F\u00e4ltstr\u00f6m was a mathematics student in Stockholm when he was hired to build and test the infrastructure for a new technology that the US government was calling the internet. </p><p>His job was to write a series of protocols that allowed computers to send text between each other. \u201cIn Europe, we were maybe 100 people in Sweden, 100 in the UK, 50 here, 20 there, all of us knew each other. We used to joke that if there was a problem, you knew who to call,\u201d he says.</p><p>Today, F\u00e4ltstr\u00f6m is a digital adviser to the Swedish government and its representative at most major internet standards bodies including the ITU. Thirty years after he helped assemble the building blocks of the internet, he embodies the cyber-libertarian western ideals that were woven into its foundation. </p><p>\u201cInternet architecture makes it very, very hard, almost impossible for whoever is providing internet access to know or regulate what the internet access is used for,\u201d he says. \u201cThat is a problem for law enforcement and others, who would like to have an internet service provider controlling it, so it is not used for illegal activities like pirating movies, or child abuse.</p><p>\u201cBut I am prepared to accept that there will be criminals who do bad things and police will have an inability to fight [all of] it. I accept that sacrifice.\u201d</p><p>For F\u00e4ltstr\u00f6m, the beauty of the internet is its \u201cpermissionless\u201d nature, as demonstrated during the Arab spring. \u201cWe have to remember,\u201d he says, \u201cit is a balance between being able to communicate and control, but people having a voice is always more important.\u201d</p><p>A stark contrast to this view can be found in a river-village called Wuzhen near Shanghai, which is emptied out every autumn to make room for the tech executives, academics and policymakers attending the ambitiously named World Internet Conference. The event was created by the Cyberspace Administration of China in 2014, a year after President Xi Jinping rose to power. A row of world flags greets visitors \u2014 a nod to Xi\u2019s vision of creating \u201ca community of shared future in cyberspace\u201d.</p><p>Tech executives from Apple\u2019s Tim Cook to Qualcomm\u2019s Steve Mollenkopf have spoken there, lending credence to Xi\u2019s attempts to assemble the international tech elite. But in recent years, foreign attendance has dropped off as the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2020/12/29/us-and-china-technology-conflict-heres-why-2020-is-so-critical/#528ebbe175ed\"> US-China tech war</url> intensifies and executives worry about being too closely aligned with Beijing.</p><p>There is precedent for such fears. In the event\u2019s first year, organisers slipped a draft joint statement under guests\u2019 hotel doors at midnight, setting out Xi\u2019s view of each nation\u2019s right to \u201ccyber sovereignty\u201d. Guests were told to get back with any changes before 8am. After protests, the organisers dropped the matter entirely. But the fact that the leadership had tried such a stunt reflected Xi\u2019s digital ambitions.</p><p>In the early 1990s, the Chinese government started developing what is now known as the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jun/29/the-great-firewall-of-china-xi-jinpings-internet-shutdown\"> Great Firewall</url>, a system of internet controls that stops citizens from connecting to banned foreign websites \u2014 from Google to The New York Times \u2014 as well as blocking politically sensitive domestic content and preventing mass organising online.</p><p>Beijing\u2019s technical controls are supported by large teams of government censors as well as those hired by private tech companies such as Baidu and Tencent. Although anyone anywhere in the world can technically host their own website using just a computer and an internet connection, in China one needs to apply for a licence to do so. Telecoms providers and internet platforms are also required to aid the police with the surveillance of \u201ccrimes\u201d, which can include actions such as calling Xi a \u201csteamed bun\u201d in a private chat group, an act punished by two years in prison.</p><p>Despite this, the Chinese internet is not 100 per cent effective at blocking content considered sensitive or dangerous by the government. \u201cThe leaky global internet remains frustrating for Chinese censors, and they\u2019ve dealt with it at great expense and effort, but if you could make those problems go away almost completely by using a more automated and technical process, perhaps like New IP, that would be fantastic for them,\u201d says James Griffiths, author of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Great Firewall of China: How to Build and Control an Alternative Version of the Internet</emphasis>. </p><p>\u201cBuilding a new version of the internet would potentially block more people from gaining politically dangerous knowledge, saving a huge amount of effort, money and manpower from the censorship side. They can pick and choose what controls they want, bake it into the tech and roll it out.\u201d</p><p>Establishing a sophisticated alternative to the western internet would also fit with China\u2019s ambitions to extend its digital footprint globally. \u201cIn the early days of the internet, China was very much a follower and didn\u2019t recognise, like many other countries, how disruptive the internet would be,\u201d says Julia Voo, research director for the China Cyber Policy Initiative at Harvard University\u2019s Belfer Center. </p><p>\u201cAs they realised how important it was, [they] funnelled more resources into developing technologies\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009and we can see their increased influence in many standards organisations like the ITU in the past two or three years.</p><p>\u201cBut the US and others have made a strategic mistake in not seeing the value of growing infrastructure in developing markets,\u201d she adds. \u201cThere is still a lot of infrastructure that needs to be provided and in the past 10 years it has been Chinese companies that have been the ones to provide it, particularly in Africa.\u201d</p><p>Beijing has signed memoranda of understanding on building a \u201cDigital Silk Road\u201d \u2014 or system of advanced IT infrastructure \u2014 with 16 countries. Huawei says it has 91 contracts to provide 5G wireless telecoms equipment worldwide, including 47 from Europe \u2014 despite US warnings that Huawei\u2019s involvement was tantamount to giving the Chinese access to national security secrets, an allegation rejected by the company.</p><p>\u201cIn proving that you can control and intensely surveil your domestic internet and avoid it being used as a tool to rally people against the government, combined with the economic success of its companies, China has made this vision incredibly attractive to regimes \u2014 autocratic and otherwise \u2014 around the world,\u201d says Griffiths.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The ITU was created</emphasis> 155 years ago, making it one of the oldest international organisations in the world, predating even the UN. It is housed in a set of glass-panelled buildings in Geneva\u2019s Place des Nations. On the 10th floor of one is the airy office of Bilel Jamoussi, the Tunisian-born head of the ITU\u2019s study groups \u2014 the units that develop and ratify technical standards.</p><p>The room is lined with an enormous bookcase from which Jamoussi pulls a dusty blue book \u2014 his PhD thesis, penned 25 years ago, about traffic going through the internet. At the time, there was a desire to build a new networking protocol to meet the internet\u2019s growing user base. In the end engineers opted to layer on top of the existing TCP/IP infrastructure. The technology, invented in the late 1970s by computational engineers working for the US defence department, was a way of transmitting messages between computers at the speed of light, using a special addressing system.</p><p>\u201cTwenty-five years ago we had this conversation as a community \u2014 is it TCP/IP or is it something else \u2014 and then a lot of design and development happened to kind of rescue [it],\u201d Jamoussi says. \u201cWe are now, I think, at another turning point, of saying, is that enough, or do we need something new?\u201d</p><p>In its earliest days, the ITU oversaw the first international telegraph networks. Since then, it has grown from 40 nations to 193 and has become the de facto standards body for telecoms networks. Standards produced there legitimise new technologies and systems in the eyes of certain governments \u2014 particularly those in the developing world who don\u2019t participate in other internet bodies. Ultimately, they give a commercial edge to the companies who have built the tech they are based upon.</p><p>Over the past 21 years, Jamoussi has witnessed a geopolitical shift. \u201cThe pendulum has swung to the east, and now we see more participation from China, Japan, Korea,\u201d he says. \u201cTwenty years ago it was Europe and North America that were dominating the products, solutions and standards development, now we have a swing to the east.\u201d</p><p>On one of the ITU\u2019s marble walls, backlit flags are hung, showing the biggest donor nations. The Chinese flag \u2014 currently at number five \u2014 was not there at all a few years ago, an employee explained, but it has been gradually working its way up.</p><p>New IP is the latest grenade thrown into the ITU\u2019s arena, but it is hardly the first internet-related standard to be proposed as an alternative to the original western-designed system. The governments of Russia, Saudi Arabia, China and Iran have been pushing the idea of alternative networks for years, according to participants who wished to remain anonymous.</p><p>\u201cIn the early 2000s, once you saw widespread take-up of the internet, suddenly you had this idea of democratisation, of essentially giving people more control and more information. For authoritarian governments, that was something they weren\u2019t happy with,\u201d says one member of the UK delegation. \u201cAnd so work started, around the early 2000s, particularly in China, and then a bit later in Iran and Russia, around how to create an alternative to the standards and the technologies that were being developed mostly by Americans still.\u201d</p><p>But in recent years, Chinese companies have moved on to New IP. \u201cThere\u2019s a new paradigm, it\u2019s not voice and text and video and people chatting, it\u2019s the real-time controlling of something remotely, or having telepresence, or holograms,\u201d Jamoussi explains. \u201cThose new applications are requiring new solutions. And now it\u2019s more feasible, it\u2019s no longer science fiction, it\u2019s close to being a reality.\u201d</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Spearheading plans for New IP</emphasis> is Richard Li, chief scientist at Futurewei, Huawei\u2019s R&amp;D arm located in California. Li has been working with Huawei engineers based in China, as well as state telecoms companies China Mobile and China Unicom, with the explicit backing of the Chinese government, to develop the technology specifications and standards proposal.</p><p>Having Huawei at the helm will ring alarm bells for many in Europe and the US, where governments have become concerned that Chinese technology is being developed as a vehicle for state espionage. The advent of 5G \u2014 a much higher bandwidth network which will serve as the digital spine for a more automated world \u2014 has led to rising concern that products developed by Huawei will be built with \u201cback doors\u201d for spies in Beijing. </p><p>Last year, the US blacklisted Huawei from selling into its market, and the UK government is embroiled in a parliamentary battle over the company\u2019s involvement in its core telecoms infrastructure.</p><p>The FT reached out to Li to discuss New IP, but Huawei declined the opportunity for him to explain the idea in greater detail. The company said in a statement: \u201cNew IP aims to provide new IP technology solutions that can support\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009future applications such as Internet of Everything, holographic communications, and telemedicine. The research and innovation of New IP is open to scientists and engineers worldwide to participate in and contribute to.\u201d</p><p>Critics argue that the technical claims made in the New IP documentation are either false or unclear, and represent a \u201csolution looking for a problem\u201d. They insist that the current IP system is fit for purpose, even in a rapidly digitising world. \u201cThe way that the internet has developed is through building blocks that are modular and loosely coupled, that\u2019s the brilliance of it,\u201d says Alissa Cooper, chair of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), an industry-dominated standards body in the US.</p><p>In November, Li presented to a small group during an IETF meeting in Singapore, which Cooper attended. \u201c[The current infrastructure] is in pretty stark contrast to what you see in the New IP proposal, which is this kind of monolithic, top-down architecture that wants to tightly couple the applications to the network. This is exactly what the internet was designed not to be,\u201d she says.</p><p>The implications for the average user could be enormous. \u201cYou\u2019re pushing control into the hands of [telecoms] operators which are state-run,\u201d says a UK ITU delegation member. \u201cSo [it means] you can now not only control access to certain types of content online, or track that content online, but you can actually control the access of a device to a network.\u201d</p><p>China is already in the process of building a credit-scoring system for its population, based on online and offline behaviour and past \u201cmisdemeanours\u201d, the delegation member noted. \u201cSo if somebody\u2019s social credit score dipped below a certain amount because they were posting on social media too much, you could actually prevent that phone from connecting to the network.\u201d</p><p>China\u2019s telecoms operators have a wealth of data on their subscribers. By law, customers have to register for a phone number or internet connection using their real name and identification, which is then accessible by other companies such as banks. The country\u2019s cyber-security law also mandates that all \u201cnetwork operators\u201d, which includes telecoms companies, must keep \u201cinternet logs\u201d \u2014 although it is not clear what these entail.</p><p>Jamoussi argues it is not the ITU\u2019s place to judge whether proposals for a new internet architecture are \u201ctop-down\u2019\u201d or could be misused by authoritarian governments. \u201cOf course anything you build, it\u2019s a two-edged sword. You can use anything for good or for bad, and it\u2019s the sovereign decision of every member state,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the ITU we don\u2019t go into that potential misuse of technology, we just focus on, \u2018here is some\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009communication technology problem, here is an aspiration, let\u2019s as a community build a solution to reach that.\u2019 But then how people use it is really up to them.\u201d</p><p>Beijing\u2019s ambitions to build more controls into the internet infrastructure are not seen as a problem by everybody \u2014 merely as the next chapter in its evolution.</p><p>\u201cThe internet was supposed to be a neutral infrastructure, but it has become a politicised arm of control. Increasingly internet infrastructure is being used for policy goals \u2014 to repress people economically, and physically \u2014 we saw it in Kashmir, Myanmar and in the Snowden revelations,\u201d says Niels ten Oever, a former Dutch delegate at the ITU. </p><p>\u201cFor me, the overarching question is: how do we build a public network on privately owned infrastructure? This is the problem we are grappling with. What is the role of the state versus the role of companies?\u201d</p><p>In his view, companies design technologies primarily for profit. \u201cThe internet is dominated by US companies, all data flows there. So, of course, they want to keep that power,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are scared of Chinese repression. We are making caricatures of the Chinese in a borderline imperialist-racist way. But the internet governance today is not working. There is room for an alternative.\u201d</p><p>Wherever our digital future is currently being built, there seems to be global agreement that the time has come for a better version of cyberspace. \u201cI think [some] people would argue that our current model of the internet is deeply flawed, if not broken. At present, there is only one other truly comprehensive and fully realised model out there, China\u2019s,\u201d wrote Griffiths in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Great Firewall of China.</emphasis></p><p>\u201cThe risk is that if we fail to come up with a third model \u2014 one that empowers users and increases democracy and transparency online, and reduces the powers both of big tech and government security services \u2014 then more and more countries will tilt towards the Chinese model, rather than deal with the fallout of the failing Silicon Valley one.\u201d</p><p>Today, the \u201c <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence\"> Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace</url>\u201d \u2014 the guiding principle of the internet \u2014 is starting to look more and more like a relic. The manifesto, written in 1996 by John Perry Barlow, co-founder of the American non-profit Electronic Frontier Foundation, and a Grateful Dead lyricist, was a call to arms.</p><p>\u201cGovernments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I come from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind,\u201d starts the document. \u201cOn behalf of the future, I ask you of the past to leave us alone. You are not welcome among us. You have no sovereignty where we\u00a0gather.\u201d</p><p>That view has now become a throwback to a time before trillion-dollar market capitalisations in the tech industry, critics say. But there is still hope \u2014 and possibly a third alternative to our two internets of today.</p><p>\u201cWhat differentiates us from China now is that in the west, the public can still mobilise and have a say. A lot of this now is down to lawmakers to protect democracy in an age of surveillance, whether it\u2019s market-driven, or authoritarian-driven,\u201d says Zuboff. \u201cThe sleeping giant of democracy is finally stirring, lawmakers are waking up, but they need to feel the public at their backs. We need a western web that will offer the kind of vision of a digital future that is compatible with democracy. This is the work of the next decade.\u201d</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Madhumita Murgia is the FT\u2019s European tech correspondent. Anna Gross is an FT markets reporter.

Traditional banking brands, until recently, have appeared better protected than retailers. No online challengers have achieved real scale. The big banks themselves have either bought or launched most of the more successful products.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But just as supermarkets are still grappling with the idea of launching their own internet challengers, are the conditions now right for banks' digital offshoots to really take off?</p><p>Beno\u00c3\u00aet Legrand, ING's chief innovation officer, talks in Copernican terms about the wider shift from branches to mobiles and laptops, and the greater freedom of choice that follows.</p><p>\"Banks were thinking that they were the centre of the universe and customers revolved around them,\" he says. \"Now the power is shifting from the institution to the customer.\"</p><p>As Legrand admits, banking has high regulatory barriers to entry that have risen further since the 2008 crisis. Moreover, the savings, particularly in current accounts, have not always been so immediately obvious as to justify the hassle of trying low-cost online alternatives. Similarly, margins in current accounts and sometimes mortgages have been insufficiently attractive to attract disruptors.</p><p>Big banks still enjoy some of their traditional reputation for solidity. However, the crisis and its aftermath continue to undermine the trust customers have that big, established banks will act in their interests. Reticence to do banking outside the branch because of safety has largely eroded, while smartphones have made digital banking more convenient and, in some respects, more tangible.</p><p>Some of the banks' online consumer platforms are now a couple of decades old, especially those that originated as telephone banks, like Germany's Comdirect. But banks are reinvigorating them, making these platforms more important to them at group level and to their investor pitch.</p><p> We start with small stakes and little by little we increase them. It's a question of going step-by-step -Francisco Gonz\u00c3\u00a1lez, BBVA</p><p>ING's own digital-only bank continues to grow more rapidly than its branch-based Benelux network \"\" and it is by no means the only one. Banks are sprouting entirely new online brands, such as BNP Paribas's Hello bank! and CaixaBank's imaginBank. Others are effectively new, like Santander's Openbank, relaunched last year. And some are the recipients of more group resources, such as Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale's Boursorama.</p><p>Nor is activity limited to the big continental economies. FirstDirect, which transitioned from telephone to online banking in the early 2000s, is owned by HSBC. It scores far higher than traditional banks for customer satisfaction, although its recent growth has been less spectacular than Boursorama, for example.</p><p>Royal Bank of Scotland, too, is widely rumoured to be preparing to launch a new online bank, with the Sunday Times reporting in August it had mandated mobile-only challenger Starling Bank to assist, triggering speculation of a merger (Starling's chief executive Anne Boden is a former RBS banker). Separately, Clydesdale and Virgin Money, who have already agreed a merger, have both worked on their own new digital banks over the last two years.</p><p>In the eurozone, however, these digital offshoots present a special opportunity because of their greater scope to expand elsewhere in the banking union than the main, often national brand. In addition, the opportunity for a new lease of tech-driven growth is even more of an imperative in eurozone banking, which has been crippled by negative interest rates and bad debts.</p><p>Take Comdirect, one of the few offshoots that is listed. Although it is not looking to expand abroad, simply based on its growth prospects in Germany its shares trade at more than 2.5 times book value, compared with just 0.4 times at Commerzbank.Main threat</p><p>The other thing that concerns many bank chief executives, they tell Euromoney, is the ability to compete with newcomers. It is not just about seeing off mainstream banks entering from elsewhere in the eurozone or indeed funky fintech startups that they can usually buy anyway if they need to. The most worrying potential threat comes from the big US tech firms like Amazon, Facebook and Google. At the same time, in France, deep-pocketed telecoms firms, particularly Orange, are also looking to make an entry.</p><p>Investment in digital platforms such as Boursorama, and building up those brands' reputation, can therefore be more important to the banks' leaders than the chance to make money in the short term.</p><p>As Sophie Heller, BNP Paribas's chief operating officer for retail banking, sees it, it is a long-term war for the best customer experience.</p><p>\"The big tech firms have reinvented customer experience,\" she says. \"They have set new standards of what customers expect in terms of personalization, autonomy, value, transparency and immediacy. That's what we have to do too.\"</p><p>Building up digital-specific brands, however, is not only defensive. It can be a way to attack competitors, perhaps taking clients from less profit-orientated local mutual or savings banks.</p><p>Particularly in the case of projects like Hello bank! and imaginBank, the idea is that these separate offerings can deliver the best of both worlds: the perceived safety of a big bank and the better user experience associated with tech players.</p><p>It is a model that ING has deployed with gusto. Its challenger banks in markets such as Germany and Spain gain net promoter scores way above its Dutch bank \"\" if largely thanks to lower fees. Although this is not without challenges; ING is perhaps the most tantalizing example of how international digital offshoots can outgrow the original branch-based institution.Prominence</p><p>Entering a country via a digital-only arm is now figuring much more prominently in many banks' strategic plans than the cross-border acquisition of an established bank. Increasingly, the M&amp;amp;A option does not seem worth the hidden costs, the risks and the pushback from investors. This is bringing down the price of would-be takeover targets, particularly in less dynamic and more protected banking markets such as Germany.</p><p>Yet EU passporting rules, as well as newer efforts to integrate Europe's banking infrastructure, should make international expansion in the eurozone easier and cheaper for nimbler operators.</p><p>Independent Berlin-based N26 already offers current accounts across the eurozone, for example.</p><p>Founded in 2013, the same year as N26, Hello bank! is another pan-European project, albeit making use of BNP Paribas' various in-country licences and infrastructure.</p><p>Passporting has allowed Commerzbank's Polish subsidiary mBank \"\" by some measures the continent's biggest digital-only bank \"\" to enter the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Commerzbank has even considered turning mBank into a truly pan-European digital lender. In August, it decided not to go ahead with the project (called Copernicus) to avoid extra complexity and to focus on more immediately profitable projects, but it did not discard the possibility in future.</p><p>At Austria's Erste Bank, chief digital officer Peter Bosek says the mostly centralized front-office development of its rapidly growing digital brand, George \"\" as well as the relative ease of acquiring back offices \"\" could allow it to launch more easily in future in countries where Erste does not currently operate. With around 2.5 million customers, George is already spreading to countries in the Erste network, starting with the Czech Republic and Slovakia last year.</p><p> We have all this optionality in the market. We can use all these things in other jurisdictions if we want -Kees van Dijkhuizen,ABN Amro</p><p>On a smaller scale, Italy's Finecobank has used passporting rights and its Italian IT system to enter the UK \"\" although Brexit now clearly poses a big problem.</p><p>As Brexit shows, there is so much uncertainty in all this that the term \"~optionality' is one that is used a lot by the big banks about their investments in new digital arms, especially in the eurozone. It seems they are hedging their bets on whether or not a true banking union \"\" as well as open banking and cloud-based back offices \"\" will really fly.</p><p>One example is Moneyou, an online-only savings platform that ABN Amro launched in Austria, Belgium and Germany after the financial crisis, and which it is considering turning into more of a credit provider. ABN Amro also launched digital small and medium-sized enterprise lender New 10 in late September 2017, shortly before launching a platform for SME foreign exchange and payments called Franx.</p><p>\"We have all this optionality in the market,\" ABN Amro chief executive Kees van Dijkhuizen told Euromoney earlier this year.</p><p>Van Dijkhuizen also points to Prospery, an online mass affluent wealth manager ABN Amro launched in Germany late last year. \"We can use all these things in other jurisdictions if we want,\" he says, emphasizing the relative ease of transferring digital platforms abroad.</p><p>BBVA's interest in Atom Bank in the UK has a similar logic in terms of getting its foot in the door of a cheap and potentially large opportunity, particularly as the UK has already implemented the EU's revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2).</p><p>In March BBVA roughly doubled its investment in the Durham-based lender to \u00a3167 billion, reaching a 39% stake, after the startup attracted \u00a31.3 billion in deposits and lent \u00a31.2 billion to homeowners and small businesses in less than a year. Billed as the UK's first app-only bank in its pre-launch marketing, it could either explode or remain a pin prick, but it gives BBVA exposure and a big say in the bank without legal control.</p><p/><p>BBVA chairman Francisco Gonz\u00c3\u00a1lez</p><p/><p>\"We start with small stakes and little by little we increase them,\" says BBVA chairman Francisco Gonz\u00c3\u00a1lez. \"It's a question of going step-by-step.\"</p><p>Even in the eurozone, however, banks still grumble about the huge disincentive of continued ring-fencing of capital and liquidity by different supervisors, especially in Germany.</p><p>This has been particularly problematic for ING. Pushed by national regulator BaFin's desire to keep its deposits in Germany, ING has had to look for German-based ways to deploy the deposits it gathers through ING DiBa, including those from wholesale banking.</p><p>\"Banking union has not made much difference,\" complains Aris Bogdaneris, head of ING's growth and challenger markets, which includes Germany. \"We still can't move liquidity and capital between local subsidiaries\"\u00a6 Countries don't want you to be just a branch, they want to have control over the banking sector.\"Scope</p><p>Yet the chance to expand abroad quickly, without acquiring a complex and culturally entrenched legacy branch-based system, is also part of Santander's ideas for the future of Openbank. International expansion is just one of the options available to banks as they invest more in online subsidiaries. It is also about trying out back office innovations and piloting new core banking systems.</p><p>For Santander, in particular, the scope for core-banking agility and experimentation is a major part of Openbank. It is one of the first banks around the world to already operate on a cloud-based IT infrastructure. As Openbank serves more than one million customers, but with only about 135 staff, it is an accelerator, or a speedboat to the main bank's supertanker, says Santander chief executive Jos\u00e9 Antonio \u00c3lvarez \"\" using a metaphor bankers often employ for initiatives like this. It also relieves the burden on the main bank's systems.</p><p>\"It gives us plenty of optionality,\" \u00c3lvarez explains, discussing Openbank. \"We can open relatively quickly in a new market in a fully digital way and, perhaps in time, use the new core banking system for the supertanker. It is very scalable.\"</p><p>The speedboat metaphor is also one that Comdirect's chief executive Arno Walter uses to describe its role in the Commerzbank group. \"Comdirect can innovate quicker,\" agrees Comdirect chief financial officer Dietmar von Bl\u00fccher. Recently, Comdirect announced it had become the first bank in Germany to work through the Google home assistant and Amazon's cloud-based Alexa service. So far, those services offer little more than updates on balances or stock prices, but it seems the tech firms might have learnt to appreciate Comdirect's nimbleness relative to older banks.</p><p> It's our sandbox. It's a great tool to try new things -Gonzalo Gort\u00c3\u00a1zar, CaixaBank</p><p>As a transformation vehicle, creating a challenger bank can be less complex and employ fewer people than trying to reform the core business and systems, says Boston Consulting Group's Michal Panowicz. \"The investment in the new challengers can be fairly modest compared to a big bank's budget,\" he adds.</p><p>The 2017 launch by Israel's Bank Leumi of digital offshoot Pepper might be another example. It uses the existing back office but is more targeted at millennials, possibly making it easier to migrate those customers to a new back office later.</p><p>Part of the problem with creating a new digital challenger bank, according to Panowicz, is that banks' complexity \"\" risk and liquidity management, reporting requirements and IT systems \"\" means that duplicating those functions can be costly. \"If a bank is successful in developing a digital roadmap to transform its core systems, there shouldn't be a big business case for developing a de novo challenger,\" he says. On the other hand, he points out, very few banks have succeeded in doing so.</p><p>The strong growth of western European banks between the 1960s and 1980s in terms of their back-office and organizational models has lately proven a burden, says Panowicz, which is partly why some Polish and Turkish banks have advanced further in digital banking in the 21st century. Indeed, mBank (where Panowicz used to work) is Poland's fourth biggest bank by assets and has 5.4 million retail clients.</p><p>Other bankers and consultants say the launch of a new brand can also help readjust processes built around products rather than client segments, making for a more user-friendly front end, even if the core banking system remains the same. Bosek says this is the case at George, which like Hello bank!, uses the group's existing back offices in its various countries but allows Erste to do marketing more targeted to the individual (not just the blanket pushing of mortgages after Christmas, for example).</p><p>Despite piggy-backing on CaixaBank's back office, imaginBank, launched in 2016 is also useful to its parent as a test site for front office app-based innovations, according to insiders. This is because, despite having more than one million customers, its balance sheet is relatively small and it only has a handful of staff dedicated to it. Last year imaginBank launched what it said was the Spanish banking sector's first chatbot, with text and voice conversations using artificial intelligence.</p><p/><p>CaixaBank chief executive Gonzalo Gort\u00c3\u00a1zar</p><p/><p>\"It's our sandbox,\" says CaixaBank chief executive Gonzalo Gort\u00c3\u00a1zar, discussing imaginBank. \"It's a great tool to try new things and move those that work onto CaixaBank.\"</p><p>Others say plugging new digital products into older IT systems creates inefficiencies it would be better to avoid. IT bills for legacy system upgrades can run into the hundreds of millions of euros, notes Brian Ledbetter, a financial services consultant at McKinsey, so experimenting with an alternative is worth the effort. Some first generation internet banks in the UK, for example, have nothing very modern about them \"under the hood\", says Ledbetter.</p><p>By contrast, digital banks based on entirely new systems, like Openbank, could make it easier to migrate customers to a cloud-based platform and eventually run down the legacy system. Compared with replacing the core bank in one go, as Nordea is doing across its countries, this kind of gradual transition might be a slower but more realistic project \"\" especially for a bank like Santander, with much larger transaction volumes than Nordea.</p><p>\"Running a cloud native operation can cost a fraction, maybe half, of what it might be in a legacy IT system,\" Ledbetter says, noting the security can be better too. \"Putting a new bank on the cloud could be a platform hedge for some banks.\"</p><p>UK-based independent Starling Bank is another example of a digital-only lender using a cloud-based IT platform, in its case from Amazon. Bigger banks have also started switching to cloud platforms particularly for app-based services, says Ledbetter.</p><p>The recent IT debacle at TSB has alerted regulators to the dangers of Big Bang-style IT switchovers, so they might prefer banks to do it slowly and cautiously. The tight hold on the market by Amazon and Microsoft could be another concern for regulators, although there are alternatives. For example, ABN Amro's New 10 uses Berlin-based Mumba, which also provides a cloud-based IT system to N26.Corporate cannibalization</p><p>Although banks continue to invest heavily in new online brands, some say this can dilute the focus on the core business and even risk debasing one's own market. This is a particular risk where it is possible for customers to have accounts with both the parent and the offshoot, which is usually true when they operate in the same country.</p><p>The UK's Cooperative Bank has recently broached the possibility of closing Smile \"\" its online offering \"\" to new customers, as it tries to boost its own brand. This could spell the end to the growth of one of Europe's biggest digital bank offshoots.</p><p/><p/><p>To use an airline parallel, these concerns might bring to mind British Airways' ill-fated budget experiment Go, in the 1990s \"\" one of the UK's best-known examples of corporate cannibalization. However, in a sign that big companies are still grappling with the idea of beating new rivals at their own game, last year IAG launched its own budget long-haul airline, Level, after the BA and Iberia holding company failed to buy Norwegian Air.</p><p>One of the world's best-known banks for technology, BBVA, has tried to avoid these kinds of risks. In fact, just as its main domestic rivals CaixaBank and Santander have in the past two years sprouted or relaunched digital brands in Spain, two years ago BBVA folded its old Spanish online arm, Unoe \"\" set up in 2000 and with 1.6 million customers \"\" partly to avoid competition in the group for digital resources, including tech-savvy talent.</p><p>With those clients integrated into the main bank, BBVA's Gonz\u00c3\u00a1lez says its digital development is less of an external project. \"We are the most advanced bank in the world on the digital journey,\" he boasts.</p><p>BBVA has invested in separately branded digital banks, but generally only in countries where it does not already have a big presence, such as the UK. In Finland it bought online SME bank Holvi in 2016. BBVA's San Francisco-based venture capital firm Propel invested $22 million in May in what it said is Brazil's first fully digital bank, Neon, gaining 600,000 customers since its launch July 2016.</p><p>Cannibalization is also less likely in projects such as George, which essentially just reframes Erste Bank products, particularly current accounts and payments. Customers usually know it is the same old reliable silver, albeit newly polished, and Erste is phasing out its purely Erste-branded online banking. There is no Erste app other than George.</p><p>At other banks the degree of cannibalization depends on the business model and often the extent to which they have a separate identity and operating model.</p><p>Finecobank, like its multi-channel peers that originated as online stock brokers such as Boursorama and Comdirect, is one of those more distinct from its parent. Now billing itself to investors as the direct multi-channel arm of UniCredit, more than half its customers today use Fineco as their main transactional bank, spurred by a 2008 merger with Xelion Banca, another UniCredit subsidiary.</p><p>\"We are competing with UniCredit in the same way that we compete with other traditional banks,\" says chief executive Alessandro Foti. He says they exchange knowledge and skills.</p><p>But as Fineco's growth outpaces that of the traditional banks, Foti thinks it will still gain fewer clients from the big systemic lenders, which he thinks will emerge as overall winners as they transition to a multi-channel model, thanks to their better resources and as the Italian sector consolidates. \"The main losers will be the small and medium-sized regional banks,\" he says. \"Those are the banks most seriously affected by the crisis in Italy.\"</p><p>The mid-tier banks have launched their own Fineco-like combinations of online banking and financial adviser networks, most notably Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena's Widiba, which has more than 150,000 clients.</p><p>But even if the number of customers they take from their own firm is not significant, the biggest problem might be the impact on pricing in the market as a whole. This is the most worrisome trend \"\" familiar to airlines and the retail sector \"\" that analysts from Berenberg pointed to in a recent report criticizing Santander's digital strategy.</p><p>For an airline, launching an offshoot can be a means to free itself from a strong trade union in the legacy business, which was previously part of Ryanair's advantage. This is something some banks' senior management might also like to achieve.</p><p>More progressively, McKinsey's Ledbetter says banks can launch a new brand to target a different client sub-segment or an entirely new market. This is the case with Marcus, the US-focused digital-only retail credit firm that Goldman Sachs launched in 2016 and which it is reportedly going to launch in the UK.Young and urban</p><p>European banks' new brands such as Hello bank! and imaginBank are particularly keen to market to 18 to 28-year-olds, partly as banks feel that demographic is most at risk from fintech rivals.</p><p>Even Santander's Openbank, which had a relatively old customer base prior to its relaunch, is targeting what chief executive Ezequiel Szafir says is: \"A whole new segment of young urban professionals.\" Turning to his favoured car industry comparison, he likens it to BMW's ownership of Mini, a young and urban brand.</p><p>As Open Banking rules do even more to boost the competition \"\" laying bare incumbent banks' relative cost versus the quality and feel of their service \"\" some banks are even more concerned to buff up their brands in this way, especially where they have suffered reputational damage.</p><p>It is hard not to see RBS's rumoured plan for a new digital bank in this context. The same might be said of Dutch SME startup New 10, given the reputational damage caused by its parent's SME interest rate derivative sales, for which ABN Amro was fined by the Dutch regulator and forced to pay compensation.</p><p>A new brand might not just make a bank more appealing to younger clients. It can also help attract the kind of young developers who might find it distinctly uncool to work for a big established bank, with all the rigid hierarchies that implies. Bosek says this is the case with Erste's George.</p><p>And just as appealing for many banks, the orientation to millennials \"\" typically a generation less asset-rich than their predecessors \"\" comes with the need and the possibility of lower costs thanks to technology.</p><p>A more cynical observer might conclude these new digital arms are merely a means to cut staffing needs by shutting branches to lower-income customers \"\" often the younger ones anyway. At imaginBank and Hello bank! most customers were previously customers of the traditional bank and much of the rest did not have a bank before. Now 18-year-olds are automatically directed towards the digital offshoot.</p><p>While the new outfits often give customers the benefit of lower fees, the advantage for the bank is that they must do their banking away from the branches, which they can then shrink and focus on higher-end clients.</p><p>Despite a lack of day-to-day banking fees, imaginBank is already profitable, says its director David Urbano, partly because its customers can only do their banking via a mobile phone app. In CaixaBank there are less than 50 people dedicated purely to imaginBank. \"The goal is not just to catch customers from other banks but also to stop them moving and make them more profitable,\" he says.</p><p>This is not to suggest the banks would rather not have these customers at all, however. When Gort\u00c3\u00a1zar talks to Euromoney of imaginBank's more than \"one million millennials\", he evidently does so with pride.</p><p>The typically social-media savvy client of Hello bank! in France, similarly, suggests an upwardly mobile, urban professional customer base, even if that might be a relatively poor one today. It is the same with Boursorama, one of the cheapest banks of its kind in France, which has maintained a tilt towards cities (more than a third of its clients are Parisians, compared with about 18% in the wider population) even though its recent growth push has attracted a higher proportion of young people.</p><p>The longer-term question then is, what happens to those customers when they mature and when more of the wealth of the Baby Boomers and Generation Xers starts being passed on to them?</p><p>Even if new digital brands like imaginBank and Hello bank! are just a stage on the route to a mortgage at the main bank, they are also a reflection of wider corporate concern \"\" as with the car makers and big brewers \"\" about missing out on the millennials as a consumer market.</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUROMO-b19x7hp162dzgs</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUROMO2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TCT-RSW1-JD1P-T327-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">318063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4291\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Euromoney</publicationName><publicationDate month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00083FD</classCode><className>SOCIETE GENERALE SA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0002M0M</classCode><className>BNP PARIBAS SA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC0002OTO</classCode><className>BANCO SANTANDER SA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009DPW</classCode><className>BOURSORAMA SA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS523110 INVESTMENT BANKING &amp;

After nearly 11 hours of talks, a deal on tackling EU debt was done.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Helpless in the face of rising floodwaters. Thai authorities say all areas of the capital will be flooded Thursday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And as Kenya fights armed gangs, it says they're launching raids across the Somali border. Now it seems al-Shabaab wants to talk.</p><p>Clearing the hurdles. European leaders have achieved what many were calling the unachievable. After meeting well into the early hours on Thursday morning, representatives from all 27 EU member countries finally reached an agreement on handling Europe's debt crisis.</p><p>Now, here are some of the details, starting with Greece.</p><p>One of the toughest hurdles was striking a compromise with private investors, but they finally agreed to take a 50 percent loss on Greek bonds. Now, that translates into roughly 100 billion euros and will help significantly reduce Greece's debt load.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERMAN VAN ROMPUY, EUROPEAN COUNCIL PRESIDENT: We want to put Greece on track where, in 2020, it will have reduced its public debt to 120 percent of GDP. Since July, market conditions worsened. The new program includes an extra effort by the official sector, a new EU/IMF program of up to $100 billion will be put in place by the end of the year. It also includes a voluntary contribution by private creditors who had lent to Greece.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STOUT: The European Financial Stability Facility is also getting a boost, and this bailout fund, it's being expanded from its initial rescue power of 440 billion euros, to one trillion euros, or about $1.4 trillion. Now, that will provide an extra buffer if Italy and Spain need emergency aid, but European banks may be feeling the pressure.</p><p>And under the new deal, they must increase their core capital reserves to nine percent. Now, that is to protect against potential losses from future write-downs or defaults.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOSE MANUEL BARROSO, EUROPEAN COMMISSION PRESIDENT: Let me emphasize that our goal is to ensure banks maintain lending to the real economy. The national supervisor of authorities must work to make this happen; namely, with the EBA. And tonight's conclusions also make clear that -- I quote -- \"Banks should be subject to constraints regarding dissolution of dividends and bond (ph) payments until recapitalization is complete,\" because increased responsibility and a fair contribution of the financial sector is also central to our approach.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STOUT: And as the European Union's two anchor economies, France and Germany, each played a high-profile role in leading the negotiations to this point.</p><p>And we have Jim Bittermann in Paris and Fred Pleitgen in Berlin with a look at how Europeans are taking in the news.</p><p>Let's start in Berlin.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: I'm Fred Pleitgen, in Berlin.</p><p>And at this early stage in the game, the Germans are very satisfied with the compromise that was reached at the euro summit in Brussels. However, also, it still is far too early to tell what actual effect all of this is going to have, what effect it's going to have on interest rates for loans for people, but also what effect it could potentially have for economic growth here in Germany. And that's one of the main things that the Germans are very worried about. It's inflation and how all of this could affect economic growth.</p><p>They're worried about their taxpayer dollars. What's happened within the crisis that's going on right now is that the Germans have already had to slash their growth forecast for this year and for the coming year several times.</p><p>When I talk to companies here in this country, they say they're slightly worried about the future, but also, they say that right now, they feel that the economy and their businesses are still fairly robust.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JIM BITTERMANN, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: I'm Jim Bittermann, in Paris.</p><p>The French have long loved to hate their banks. So the fact that bankers here will have to write off Greek debt and come up with more capital won't displease anyone. But there's deep skepticism here that the banks will somehow find ways to pass along their new financial burdens on to their customers with higher fees or interest rates.</p><p>President Sarkozy will appear on the two main television channels tonight to talk about the resolution of the financial crisis. He's almost certain to reassure the citizenry, especially since he's up for reelection next year, that they will not be paying for this. However, one part of the accord consumers will soon be paying for, little noticed in the agreement, are measures to make governments more financially responsible in the future. And the French government is already talking about measures including a new level of value-added tax to reduce its government spending.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STOUT: Now, China's foreign ministry spokeswoman says that Chinese President Hu Jintao and French President Nicolas Sarkozy spoke by telephone on Thursday. She said the two discussed the global economy, as well as next week's Group of 20 summit in France. Mr. Sarkozy has publicly expressed that his hope, that China will contribute to a fund that European leaders are setting up.</p><p>And Jiang Yu speaks for the Chinese Foreign Ministry.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JIANG YU, CHINESE FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESWOMAN (through translator): The Chinese side welcomes the EU summit consensus on the European crisis. We hope it will be conducive to lifting market (INAUDIBLE), promoting the sustainable economic development of the EU and eurozone, and injecting vitality into the European integration. China is ready to work with the international community to promote the stability in the international financial market, and world economic recovery and growth.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STOUT: This deal has broader global implications to varying degrees.</p><p>Our Andrew Stevens, here in Hong Kong, has been following this story, watching the early reaction.</p><p>But first, your thoughts on this deal?</p><p>ANDREW STEVENS, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: Well, I think the important thing here is that there is a deal.</p><p>If you go back to the last weeks, months, years, even, we've been in constant crisis mode. We do now have a deal which has been signed to by all the EU members.</p><p>This is important, Kristie. Is it the deal that draws the big, thick black line under the whole euro crisis? Probably not. Research suggests that a lot of people in the financial industry are saying this is a good step forward.</p><p>What's so crucial here is that Greece, which we've been reporting for so long now about the likelihood of a default, not paying its debts, that default scenario now looks like at least it's been pushed right into the background, because it's got $100 billion in debt relief. This is a good thing.</p><p>The ESFS -- this is the bailout fund -- it looks like it's going to be lifted, as you were saying, to a trillion euros. That's about $1.4 trillion. This is also a very strong message to the markets that Europe is prepared to put their money where their mouth is. But -- and there's a big \"but\" on this one -- is, where's the money going to come from?</p><p>The details, we don't know yet. So how the mechanism of this crisis finally works, we don't know, but certainly it's a big step in the right direction.</p><p>STOUT: You call it a strong message to the markets. How are the markets reacting?</p><p>(STOCK MARKET REPORT)</p><p>STOUT: We have to talk about China next. And the head of the European bailout fund is heading to Beijing on Friday, presumably with cup in hand.</p><p>What is China's role? Will China ride to the rescue?</p><p>STEVENS: Good question. I don't know about going with cup in hand.</p><p>What he wants to see is that ESFS I was telling you about, the bailout fund. Now, the Europeans would like this to be more of an international effort. And what would probably happen is the International Monetary Fund would get involved. So that would take in more money from countries like India and China, specifically.</p><p>What would be the quid pro quo here? What will China get out of this or India? Probably more voting rights in the IMF. This is all speculation at the moment.</p><p>And China is not going to be throwing money in willy-nilly, no doubt. As China has always done, it will drive a hard bargain on this if it needs to.</p><p>The other thing too, though, is it's in China's interest to see Europe growing again. I mean, it's such a huge export money. So China is not going to cut its nose off to spite its face.</p><p>Which brings me just to the final point, Kristie. OK. Crisis over, but the longer issue now is, how does Europe return to growth?</p><p>And this is being masked -- this whole growth story is being masked by the fact we've had a crisis. We've now got underlying growth issues. How does Europe kick-start itself? A lot of people talking about lower interest rates from the European Central Bank fairly soon.</p><p>STOUT: Europe is China's largest trading partner, isn't it?</p><p>STEVENS: Of course, yes.</p><p>STOUT: Andrew Stevens, thank you very much indeed.</p><p>Andrew Stevens there.</p><p>Now, the pressure that had been building in the run-up to this deal, it appears to have gotten the better of some Italian lawmakers. Check it out.</p><p>This was the scene in Italy's lower house of parliament on Wednesday. Lawmakers had been debating pension reform when a brawl broke out, reportedly over televised comments by the house speaker about a party leader's wife. After the brawl, parliament was briefly suspended.</p><p>Now, ahead here on NEWS STREAM, higher and higher. The floodwaters just keep on rising. Can residents in Bangkok get out of their way in time?</p><p>Plus --</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, we're very disappointed that the NTC still hasn't sent anybody down to Sirte to investigate. And their failure to investigate risks invoking the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court. This is a war crime.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STOUT: -- gruesome discoveries in a Libyan city that became a battlefield. What really happened in Sirte as revolutionary fighters ousted Gadhafi loyalists?</p><p>And going after the Taliban on Twitter.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>STOUT: Welcome back.</p><p>Now, it is a slow-moving crisis that is entering a critical new stage. Residents of the sprawling city of Bangkok are being urged to flee as floodwaters inundate houses, businesses and roads. And these new aerials show the extent of the flooding, which is mostly in the north of the city right now. And a huge runoff of water is expected to reach the Thai capital this weekend, at the same time as seasonal high tides.</p><p>Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra now says that all of Bangkok will be flooded by 10 centimeters and one meter of water. And although most of downtown Bangkok is still dry, there is now water on the grounds of the Grand Palace.</p><p>And CNN's Sarah Sidner joins us live from Bangkok.</p><p>And Sara, first, could you describe the scene around you there?</p><p>SARA SIDNER, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Kristie, yes, we're standing out in front of the Grand Palace, one of the most beautiful and adored landmarks here in the city. And what we're seeing are a couple of streets that are starting to get flooded here.</p><p>We are now seeing that water come in to the inner parts of Bangkok, a great concern for the citizens and great concern for Bangkok officials. The governor saying today, look, we can no longer stop this deluge of water from coming into many parts of the city.</p><p>Now, earlier today, we were able to get an aerial view. We went up in a helicopter with the U.S. Navy and Marines, who have been doing daily missions to try and ascertain exactly what is happening with the water, where it's going, how quickly it is moving. And again, what we're seeing is this odd scenario where, you're not seeing necessarily water rushing in, you're seeing waters creeping in.</p><p>But we've seen roads that are being swallowed by water. We are seeing the airport from now, an aerial view. And this is the domestic airport, not the international airport. The international airport, still running. The domestic airport, though, closed. And we're seeing more water ending up on the runways there.</p><p>We also flew over an area that would normally be dry, and what you're seeing is water, just kilometers and kilometers of water going there.</p><p>You're also seeing factories inundated or surrounded by water. We're talking about factories like Toshiba, for example. We're talking about factories like Toyota. And they are having difficulties now distributing things.</p><p>So, making business areas very, very difficult. Thousands of factories either flooded or surrounded by water.</p><p>And, of course, the residents. The residents having to deal with this. Their houses flooded, their belongings ruined, their lives turned upside down.</p><p>More than 300 people have lost their lives so far. We're talking about more than nine million people affected. And more people will be affected because we are waiting for the high tide, which is expected 5:00 (ph) Bangkok time, and then another push on a Friday afternoon.</p><p>So, there is concern, of course, in this city. And we are starting to see some of the water. You heard from the prime minister today, saying that 10 centimeters, somewhere around four inches, to up to a meter will be coming in to almost all of this city. And we are waiting to see exactly how high the waters will go -- Kristie.</p><p>STOUT: You know, Sara, what you're telling us is very, very alarming. And the scene behind you is absolutely amazing. It looks like there is a lake between you and the Grand Palace, and yet, just a moment ago, a bus just went through the water right behind you.</p><p>So, to what extent is Bangkok in crisis mode? To what extent is the city thinking, we're going to get through this and everything's going to be OK?</p><p>SIDNER: Yes, I think it's one of those things that no one can actually predict. Where is it going to get really high floodwaters, and where is it just going to be like it is here? Which is about a little less than a foot, and so cars can still make their way, or buses can still make their way through this area.</p><p>One thing we do know is that there is international help coming in. And I want to share with you what the U.S. says that it's now doing for Bangkok.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KRISTIE KENNEY, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THAILAND: Water pumps, water purifiers like this, all of that sort of thing. We have two helicopters that are flying survey missions, telling people where the floodwaters are and aren't with the Thai military. We have the U.S. Marines, a humanitarian assistance team on the ground.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIDNER: So we are seeing that, and we went with them today and we saw a lot of the help that's being provided from outside and also from inside of the country. But again, the command center where the airport is, where they've put people, they've had to sort of evacuate some of those people because the water is starting to come in. And this is really a wait and watch situation, but we are starting to see water get further and further into the city -- Kristie.</p><p>STOUT: Sara Sidner, joining us live from Bangkok.</p><p>Many thanks indeed for that.</p><p>(WEATHER REPORT)</p><p>STOUT: And coming up next here on NEWS STREAM, lingering questions about apparent atrocities committed in Libya in the aftermath of civil war.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>STOUT: Coming to you live from Hong Kong, you are back watching NEWS STREAM.</p><p>Now, Human Rights Watch wants to know what happened to dozens of men whose bodies have been found in and around the Libyan city of Sirte. That's where Moammar Gadhafi was captured and killed last week.</p><p>And Dan Rivers reports the city may have witnessed a bloodbath. And we warn you, some of the images you're about to see are disturbing.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DAN RIVERS, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): As the dust settles on the Libyan conflict, there are increasing questions about the atrocities that appear to have been perpetrated by militia loyal to the transitional government. These are just some of the bodies found around Moammar Gadhafi's convoy. Some were killed in a battle as the former dictator tried to flee, but some appear to have been executed as prisoners, contrary to the Geneva Conventions.</p><p>(on camera): Plenty of evidence around here of other bodies here, some of which Human Rights Watch claim were also executed. They say there are 95 bodies in this area, and at least 10 of them have been shot at point-blank range.</p><p>(voice-over): We witnessed this during the battle for Sirte, piles of bodies with their hands bound behind their backs, shot through the head, with no clear sense of who they were or who shot them. The bodies lay here for days without any revolutionary forces attempting to bury them.</p><p>But now Human Right Watch investigator Peter Bouckaert says he's found clear evidence some of the victims were Gadhafi officials, and he is concerned they may have been executed by revolutionary forces. This is the aftermath of a massacre at the Mahari Hotel in Sirte, 53 bodies with evidence on the walls that this hotel was occupied by revolutionary brigades before the people were killed.</p><p>PETER BOUCKAERT, HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH: We're very disappointed that the NTC still hasn't sent anybody down to Sirte to investigate, and their failure to investigate risks invoking the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court. This is a war crime.</p><p>RIVERS: The transitional government has promised to bring those responsible to justice.</p><p>AHMED BANI, NTC MILITARY SPOKESMAN (through translator): I assure you that we will not turn a blind eye or forgive any crime that might have been committed during this conflict.</p><p>RIVERS: But the true scale of the killing in Sirte is only now becoming clear. Some 300 bodies have been found so far, with no one from the transitional government attempting to gather evidence before the bodies are removed.</p><p>Dan Rivers, CNN, Tripoli.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STOUT: Now, Twitter is the newest battleground for coalition forces fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan. Our Errol Barnett reports on who may be winning the online war of words.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ERROL BARNETT, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Bullets, bombs and tweets. U.S. forces in Afghanistan, fearing they were losing the information war to the Taliban, are now fighting back with Twitter, using the Web site's short, 140-character messages to get out their side of the story.</p><p>Here's a recent example of what the coalition forces call Taliban propaganda. A tweet from a Taliban spokesman who uses the Twitter name ABalkhi reads, \"Mujahideen bring down U.S. helicopter in Kunar.\" Well, coalition forces fired back with their ISAF media Twitter account, \"We have no reports of any missing helicopters. Take any Taliban reports with a block of salt.\" And later, this one, \"Reports of a shoot-down are false.\"</p><p>The online war of words really started last month, with the Taliban attack on the U.S. Embassy in Kabul. Seven Afghan police officers and civilians were killed, along with six insurgents. But even before the 20-hour gun battle was over, the tweets were flying.</p><p>ISAF media sending this: \"The outcome is inevitable. The question is, how much longer will terrorists put innocent Afghans in harm's way?\"</p><p>ABalkhi fired back in tech speak, \"I don't know. You have been putting them in harm's way for the past 10 years, razed whole villages and markets, and still have the nerve to talk about harm's way.\"</p><p>ISAF media then responded, \"Really? UNAMA reported 80 percent of civilian casualties are caused by insurgent (as in your) activities.\"</p><p>With 14,000 followers on its Twitter account, ISAF media may have the advantage here over Taliban spokesman ABalkhi, who has just 1,700 followers. But a coalition spokesman acknowledges that this war of words is far from over.</p><p>For CNN, I'm Errol Barnett.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STOUT: Now, ahead on NEWS STREAM, the world's population clock is ticking closer and closer to the seven billion mark.</p><p>Plus, the fight against terrorism in Africa takes a new twist between two tense numbers. We'll have a live report from Kenya.</p><p>And what governments are asking Google to keep you from finding.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>STOUT: I'm Kristie Lu Stout in Hong Kong. You're watching News Stream. And these are your world headlines.</p><p>Now European Union leaders have announced a deal to tackle the EuroZone's debt crisis. And the plan has three main elements. Private banks have agreed to write down the value of their holdings of Greek debt by 50 percent, European banks will boost their core capital reserves, and the EU will leverage its bailout fund to give it an effective strength of $1.4 trillion.</p><p>Now people in Bangkok are being urged to flee as the flood stricken Thai capital braces for its highest water levels yet. Thailand's prime minister says all districts of Bangkok will be flooded with some areas seeing water as high as one meter. Now the floods in Thailand have killed 373 people and affected more than 9.5 million.</p><p>Now the death toll from Sunday's massive earthquake in eastern Turkey has now risen to 534, that's according to Turkish officials. There were reports of another earthquake earlier on Thursday near the border with Iraq, but there are no reports of any casualties from that 5.2 magnitude tremor.</p><p>Now one of the largest populations on the planet is celebrating Diwali this week, the festival of lights. Like these people visiting the market in the Indian city Amedabot (ph) had the celebrations.</p><p>Now the population of India, it stands at 1.21 billion right now. And by the year 2030 it is projected that India will become the world's most populous nation. And by next week, according to the UN, the global population will reach 7 billion.</p><p>No one really knows for sure, but the Population Reference Bureau says that nearly 108 billion people have been born throughout history. That means about 6 percent of all the people who were ever born are alive today.</p><p>And all this week, News Stream is examining the issues raised by world population growth. And my guest today is Fred Pearce. He's a journalist and environmental and development consultant. And his latest book, it's called \"People Quake,\" he says the world population is peaking and will soon start to decline. And what's more, he argues that Earth, our planet, it could meet the needs of a larger population if some people consumed less and natural resources were shared more equally.</p><p>Fred Pearce joins me now live from our London studio.</p><p>And Fred, thank you for joining us. And we are counting down to 7 billion. How worried should we be?</p><p>FRED PEARCE, AUTHOR: I think we should be worried in the short-term. It's a lot of extra people that we're having every year. But the good news is that we can, I think, look forward to peak population something about the middle of this century. I think we'll go from about 7 billion now to perhaps 9 billion, perhaps a little more.</p><p>But family sizes -- the good news is that family sizes are coming down so fast that we can look forward to peak population, and maybe decline after that. The average woman today has 2.5 children. That's half as many as her mother and her grandmother had. We used to get up at five and six.</p><p>So fertility levels are coming down really remarkably fast. And if they carry on down as they have (inaudible) already. And we can see good news ahead. We can see light at the end of the tunnel.</p><p>STOUT: You know, it's interesting that you're saying that the population is peaking, because it was just yesterday the United Nations released this report and said by the end of the century the world's total population could rise to more than 10 billion. So what are your thoughts on that? Is the population rising, or is it peaking?</p><p>PEARCE: Well it's certainly rising. The peak is to come. I think most people will agree that by mid-century we'll be at about 9 billion. The question is what happens after that. And the UN has very wide error bars on its projections. So nobody really knows.</p><p>But the evidence is that fertility rates are coming down so fast, people are -- you know many countries have half the number of children that their women were having in a generation. Much of India is now down to 2 children per woman, many parts of Asia even lower. So if Africa follows that path, then by mid-century I think we will see peak population.</p><p>Absolutely nobody knows for sure. And there are big concerns about how African -- how Africa, for instance, can cope with a doubling of its numbers in the next few decades. But we can look forward, I think, with a sort of optimistic hope that we can see peak population. And that would help to solve an awful lot of global environmental problems, not least climate change.</p><p>STOUT: Now in the near-term, we are nearing the 7 billionth person on the planet. Right now, especially looking at consumption habits that are out there, can earth handle that?</p><p>PEARCE: I -- the way we consume now I don't think it can. I think we're already over the limit if everybody wants to live a western style of life and to produce what we need in the western way of doing it. We're going to have to change anyway.</p><p>But the way I look at it, we are diffusing the population bomb. The world's population isn't going to double again as its doubled in the last 40 years. We're diffusing the population bomb, but we haven't begun to diffuse the consumption bomb, that's where the real issues I think are now. How we produce our energy, whether we can recycle those scarce metals, whether we can preserve our soils.</p><p>We know we can feed 10 billion people. We're already producing enough food for that. We just don't know how to distribute it and get it to the people who are hungry. So there is hope out there. We're not up against a sort of doom's day scenario, but we do have to get things right. We do have to manage our planet's resources much more efficiently.</p><p>But if we do that than I do believe that the 8, 9, even 10 billion people that we might have by the end of the century we can give them a good life.</p><p>STOUT: So our focus should be on consumption rather than population. Fred Pearce, thank you very much indeed for joining us here on News Stream.</p><p>And as we count down to the world population hitting the 7 billion mark, we are asking our ireporters to help us visualize that massive number. And we have already had submissions featuring grains of rice or steps on a very long hike. What can you come up with? You can submit your photos or videos to ireport.com and you may see them on CNN.</p><p>Now Kenya's pursuit of Islamic militants in neighboring Somalia is taking a surprising twist. A Kenyan government official tells CNN that leaders of the al Shabaab militant group want to talk. Now Kenyan troops, they swept into Somalia earlier this month to hunt for al Shabaab fighters.</p><p>Now Kenya blames al Shabaab for a string of kidnappings and attacks. And David McKenzie joins me now from Kenya's capital Nairobi.</p><p>And David, they're saying they want to talk, but can al Shabaab be trusted?</p><p>DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, al Shabaab said that it's not talking to the Kenyan government and they've threatened Kenya in fact. And I have to say that the government minister, the government spokesman Afred Mutua just had a press conference. He denied those reports.</p><p>Though I did speak to a Kenyan government very close to this military operation. He said that well the al Shabaab doesn't have time to talk, because, quote, \"they're running for their lives.\" So certainly a contradictory statements coming from the Kenyan government.</p><p>What is becoming apparently and clear is that operation to take on al Shabaab is a very complex operation and some people fear that it'll be a very difficult one indeed.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCKENZIE: Kenyan troops pushing into Somalia, part of a major offensive that took many by surprise. Their stated aim, to take al Shabaab head on.</p><p>The al Qaeda linked militant group has threatened Kenya before. But a recent string of kidnappings here spurred the government into action.</p><p>ALFRED MUTUA, KENYA GOVERNMENT SPOKESMAN: The al Shabaab group poses a clear and present danger, not only to Kenya and this region, but to the entire world. We do believe that the fight against terror cannot be won unless the power and the organization of al Shabaab is dismantled.</p><p>MCKENZIE: Security analysts say that the incursion is a big risk. They point to recent history.</p><p>America's infamous Blackhawk Down mission in the 90s, Ethiopia's U.S.- backed invasion which led to the rise of al Shabaab. And African Union's long and bloody campaign to control Mogadishu.</p><p>RASHID ABDI, SOMALI ANALYST: If there's anything we have learned, you know, in the last couple of years is that foreign domination, especially military domination doesn't work in Somalia.</p><p>MCKENZIE: Kenya's military officials say they want to push on to Kismayo, a key stronghold of al Shabaab.</p><p>But the country's largely conventional army is being hampered by heavy rains, al Shabaab's ability to melt into the background.</p><p>Kenya's key western allies, the U.S. and the UK, were quick to state that they will not give any assistance to this operation. But France says they will give some help.</p><p>The decision to attack was the Kenyan government's alone, it seems. But many worry it will make this country less safe, not more.</p><p>ABDI: You know, if the argument for going in to stop terrorism, the contrary is now the case. Al Shabaab will now have the pretense to strike Kenya.</p><p>MCKENZIE: A series of grenade attacks this week, blamed on al Shabaab, has the country on edge. But the Kenyan government says it has stepped up security and that they have just one aim in Somalia.</p><p>MUTUA: We don't want to go and get stuck in Somalia. When the United States, Ethiopia and others went there, they were trying to support an existing government. Our main objective is to just go in, dismantle the al Shabaab, and get out. So we are very clear objective.</p><p>MCKENZIE: To take out al Shabaab?</p><p>MUTUA: To take out al Shabaab.</p><p>MCKENZIE: The government says that the operation should be over in a matter of months. Some fear that Kenya has stepped into a military quagmire that has haunted this continent for decades.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCKENZIE: Well, some latest news, Kristie, in the northeast of the country near Mandera (ph) on the border of Somalia apparently four people have been killed according to the police here in Kenya. Four people killed who were traveling a government officials who were carrying examination papers in a car. So it's unclear who caused that attack, but certainly worries here in Kenya the internal security as the army and the air force pushes into Somalia to take on al Shabaab -- Kristie.</p><p>STOUT: Very fluid situation. Thank you for giving us the updates. David McKenzie joining us live from Nairobi. Thank you.</p><p>Now China is calling for stricter control of social media sites to promote what it calls a healthy internet culture. And according to a communique from a Communist Party meeting, the central committee will, quote, strengthen guidance and administration of social internet services and regulate the orderly dissemination of information.</p><p>Now this tightening, it came as a part of the government's crackdown on online rumors with special focus on the country's leading microblog Sina Weibo. And we have a lot more on this story for you on our blog. You can check it out, CNN.com/newsstream.</p><p>Now just ahead here on News Stream, like all big tech companies, Google gets calls from governments to take down content. But which countries make the most of those requests? We'll dig into Google's transparency report.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>STOUT: Welcome back.</p><p>Now Google and governments it's an interesting relationship. Now the tech giant has just released its latest transparency report. And its goal is to expose how governments around the world affect our access to information on the Internet. And you can find the report on Google's official blog.</p><p>But here are a few countries that stood out. Now the first half of this year, Brazil made the most content removal requests followed by Germany, the U.S. and South Korea.</p><p>Now joining me now to talk more about the report is News Stream regular Nicolas Thompson, senior editor of the New Yorker. And Nick, always good to see you. And you have trolled through this report. What were the highlights for you?</p><p>NICK THOMPSON, NEW YORKER: There are all sort of interesting things. You can learn a lot about what a country's government cares about by what they've requested to be taken down.</p><p>Some of the things that stuck out is that in Turkey there are all sorts of requests to take down videos on YouTube that showed information about officials' private lives. Google complied with all of those.</p><p>In India, there are all sorts of requests to take down videos that show people insulting religious leaders. Because of India's local laws don't restrict that as much, Google didn't comply with those.</p><p>In Thailand, there are lots of requests to take down videos that were insulting to the monarch. And Google did comply with those.</p><p>The little bit that stuck out the most to me, there's a little nugget in the section on the United States. And it said there was a request to take down a video showing police brutality and another showing -- a request to take down a video showing defamation of a police officer. And then Google specifically says we didn't comply.</p><p>Now why are they saying that? And I think it's partly to show Google's aim with this report is both to kind of poke the countries that have lots of requests and to make it clear that they are doing something their citizens might not agree with. And also to show that sometimes Google objects to this. And it's actually a particularly good time for Google to say that it's not taking down videos of police brutality in this country in the United States is becoming more of an issue. It makes Google look like more of a good guy.</p><p>STOUT: Yeah, it's like Google in superhero mode. \"Don't be evil is the mantra here.\"</p><p>And Google, interesting to know, it's the only internet company that releases this kind of information about its relationship with governments around the world. Do you think it will make a difference by doing so?</p><p>THOMPSON: I think it does make a difference. I think it shows -- I mean, it makes a difference in the way we perceive Google, because it actually shows the import of Google. So when you think about the information that a society gets to see and that gets circulated, it partly depends on what its users feel free to put up, it partly depends on what its government objects to, and it partly depends on Google, right?</p><p>Google has a bunch of people who make very important decisions about the information that can circulate in a society. We're moving into a world where tech companies have a lot of power in a cynic way that they didn't have before. And what's interesting about Google is it's being open about it. It's admitting to it. And it's giving us a lot of information about the choices it makes, so that we can judge those choices.</p><p>STOUT: And while we're talking about Google, your thoughts on the buzz out there that Google has its eyes on a Yahoo takeover. Is it possible? What about the other rivals eying Yahoo? And what would it mean for Microsoft?</p><p>THOMPSON: Well, I think -- I mean, I think that Google can't possibly take over Yahoo, or probably can't even take over a chunk of Yahoo. There's -- there's no way that U.S. regulators would allow the number one search company to take over the number two. It's preposterous. Google is already in all sorts of anti-trust problems at the moment.</p><p>So there are some rumors circulating that Google must have leaked this in order to irritate Microsoft and to drive up the price. Google and Microsoft, they are forever at war with each other.</p><p>I actually think it was probably somebody else who leaked this information. Google probably made some calls, but anybody who is a Yahoo shareholder is interested in a price being a high as possible. So they're interested in heated up the market as much as possible? So they're interested in floating as many rumors as possible.</p><p>So I think Google probably made a call. It's not leading anywhere. And somebody whose got a financial interest and Yahoo made sure the press knew about it.</p><p>STOUT: I love these high tech conspiracy theories.</p><p>Nick Thompson, unfortunately we have to leave it at that. Thank you very much as always for joining us, every week, right here on News Stream. Take care.</p><p>Political candidates in the United States are finding all kinds of ways to communicate to potential voters. And it seems one campaign staffer is sending smoke signals.

The Texas Rangers could have become World Series champions on Wednesday, but the weather got in the way. And here is Pedro Pinto with more -- Pedro.</p><p>PEDRO PINTO, CNN SPORTS CORREPSONDENT: Hey, Kristie. Heavy rain in St. Louis postponed last night's world series contest at Busch Stadium. Both teams are hoping the weather will clear up so they can actually go out there and play some baseball on Thursday.</p><p>It was pretty miserable on Wednesday with officials calling the game off five hours before the first pitch was supposed to be thrown. The rain just didn't stop all day long.</p><p>The Rangers lead the best of seven series three games to two with game 6 now set to be played on Thursday. The Rangers are looking for their first ever World Series title.</p><p>Should the Cardinals stave off elimination, a deciding seventh game will be played on Friday. Both teams' managers said they welcome the rest that they weren't expecting. And they guarantee the players will be ready to go on Thursday.</p><p>Now let's focus our attention on football. Al Sadd have qualified for the final of the Asian Champion's League for the first time since 1989. They did so by knocking out South Korea's Suwon Bluewings.</p><p>The first leg of this tie in Suwon was marred by an ugly brawl. Fortunately, there were no such issues in Doha on Wednesday night. The Bluewings have lost the first leg at home 2-nil but they got back into the semifinal by taking an early lead.</p><p>Great goal, it was as well, Oh Jang-Eun with a fantastic volley, definitely worth another look.</p><p>The home side tried to reestablish their two goal lead in the tie and came close to doing so. Khalfan Ibrahim with the effort that was saved onto the crossbar by Jung Sung-Ryong.</p><p>As time passed, the Bluewings knew they needed to force the issue. And Park Joon-Jin had a shot on target from close range right at the keeper, though.</p><p>The match finished 1-nil Suwon. Not enough for the South Koreans. Al Sadd won 2-1 on aggregate. They'll face Jeonbuk in the final.</p><p>Maria Sharapova has withdrawn from the WTA tour championships after suffering a recurrence of a recent ankle injury during her second match in Istanbul. This means she no longer has a chance to overtake Caroline Wozniaki for the world number one ranking.</p><p>Sharapova made the announcement shortly after losing her second consecutive match on the hard courts of the Turkish capital. She went down to Li Na in straight sets.</p><p>Is was an unexpected score, considering it was actually the Russian that had a 4-1 lead in the first set. Her opponent rebounded well and actually had the lead before Sharapova then forced a tiebreak.</p><p>Again, the Russian had an advantage in the tiebreaker, but failed to hold on. Li Na winning the first set.</p><p>In the second, the French Open champion was on top and managed to seal the deal in the 10th game. Leading 5-4 and serving for the match, she was down 15-40 before prevailing to finish off Sharapova in straight sets.</p><p>Also on Wednesday, Caroline Wozniaki lost surprisingly to Victoria Zvonareva.</p><p>That'll do it for now.

After nearly 11 hours of  talks, a deal on tackling EU debt was done.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Helpless in the face of rising floodwaters.  Thai authorities say all areas  of the capital will be flooded Thursday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> And as Kenya fights armed gangs, it says they're launching raids across the  Somali border.  Now it seems al-Shabaab wants to talk.</p><p> Clearing the hurdles.  European leaders have achieved what many were  calling the unachievable.  After meeting well into the early hours on  Thursday morning, representatives from all 27 EU member countries finally  reached an agreement on handling Europe's debt crisis.</p><p> Now, here are some of the details, starting with Greece.</p><p> One of the toughest hurdles was striking a compromise with private  investors, but they finally agreed to take a 50 percent loss on Greek  bonds.  Now, that translates into roughly 100 billion euros and will help  significantly reduce Greece's debt load.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> HERMAN VAN ROMPUY, EUROPEAN COUNCIL PRESIDENT:  We want to put Greece on  track where, in 2020, it will have reduced its public debt to 120 percent  of GDP.  Since July, market conditions worsened.  The new program includes  an extra effort by the official sector, a new EU/IMF program of up to $100  billion will be put in place by the end of the year.  It also includes a  voluntary contribution by private creditors who had lent to Greece.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> STOUT:  The European Financial Stability Facility is also getting a boost,  and this bailout fund, it's being expanded from its initial rescue power of  440 billion euros, to one trillion euros, or about $1.4 trillion.  Now,  that will provide an extra buffer if Italy and Spain need emergency aid,  but European banks may be feeling the pressure.</p><p> And under the new deal, they must increase their core capital reserves to  nine percent.  Now, that is to protect against potential losses from future  write-downs or defaults.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> JOSE MANUEL BARROSO, EUROPEAN COMMISSION PRESIDENT:  Let me emphasize that  our goal is to ensure banks maintain lending to the real economy.  The  national supervisor of authorities must work to make this happen; namely,  with the EBA.  And tonight's conclusions also make clear that -- I quote --  \"Banks should be subject to constraints regarding dissolution of dividends  and bond (ph) payments until recapitalization is complete,\" because  increased responsibility and a fair contribution of the financial sector is  also central to our approach.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> STOUT:  And as the European Union's two anchor economies, France and  Germany, each played a high-profile role in leading the negotiations to  this point.</p><p> And we have Jim Bittermann in Paris and Fred Pleitgen in Berlin with a look  at how Europeans are taking in the news.</p><p> Let's start in Berlin.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  I'm Fred Pleitgen, in  Berlin.</p><p> And at this early stage in the game, the Germans are very satisfied with  the compromise that was reached at the euro summit in Brussels.  However,  also, it still is far too early to tell what actual effect all of this is  going to have, what effect it's going to have on interest rates for loans  for people, but also what effect it could potentially have for economic  growth here in Germany.  And that's one of the main things that the Germans  are very worried about.  It's inflation and how all of this could affect  economic growth.</p><p> They're worried about their taxpayer dollars.  What's happened within the  crisis that's going on right now is that the Germans have already had to  slash their growth forecast for this year and for the coming year several  times.</p><p> When I talk to companies here in this country, they say they're slightly  worried about the future, but also, they say that right now, they feel that  the economy and their businesses are still fairly robust.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> JIM BITTERMANN, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  I'm Jim Bittermann,  in Paris.</p><p> The French have long loved to hate their banks.  So the fact that bankers  here will have to write off Greek debt and come up with more capital won't  displease anyone.  But there's deep skepticism here that the banks will  somehow find ways to pass along their new financial burdens on to their  customers with higher fees or interest rates.</p><p> President Sarkozy will appear on the two main television channels tonight  to talk about the resolution of the financial crisis.  He's almost certain  to reassure the citizenry, especially since he's up for reelection next  year, that they will not be paying for this.  However, one part of the  accord consumers will soon be paying for, little noticed in the agreement,  are measures to make governments more financially responsible in the  future.  And the French government is already talking about measures  including a new level of value-added tax to reduce its government spending.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> STOUT:  Now, China's foreign ministry spokeswoman says that Chinese  President Hu Jintao and French President Nicolas Sarkozy spoke by telephone  on Thursday.  She said the two discussed the global economy, as well as  next week's Group of 20 summit in France.  Mr. Sarkozy has publicly  expressed that his hope, that China will contribute to a fund that European  leaders are setting up.  </p><p> And Jiang Yu speaks for the Chinese Foreign Ministry.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> JIANG YU, CHINESE FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESWOMAN (through translator):  The  Chinese side welcomes the EU summit consensus on the European crisis.  We  hope it will be conducive to lifting market (INAUDIBLE), promoting the  sustainable economic development of the EU and eurozone, and injecting  vitality into the European integration.  China is ready to work with the  international community to promote the stability in the international  financial market, and world economic recovery and growth.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> STOUT:  This deal has broader global implications to varying degrees.</p><p> Our Andrew Stevens, here in Hong Kong, has been following this story,  watching the early reaction.</p><p> But first, your thoughts on this deal?</p><p> ANDREW STEVENS, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR:  Well, I think the important  thing here is that there is a deal.</p><p> If you go back to the last weeks, months, years, even, we've been in  constant crisis mode.  We do now have a deal which has been signed to by  all the EU members.  </p><p> This is important, Kristie.  Is it the deal that draws the big, thick black  line under the whole euro crisis?  Probably not.  Research suggests that a  lot of people in the financial industry are saying this is a good step  forward.</p><p> What's so crucial here is that Greece, which we've been reporting for so  long now about the likelihood of a default, not paying its debts, that  default scenario now looks like at least it's been pushed right into the  background, because it's got $100 billion in debt relief.  This is a good  thing.</p><p> The ESFS -- this is the bailout fund -- it looks like it's going to be  lifted, as you were saying, to a trillion euros.  That's about $1.4  trillion.  This is also a very strong message to the markets that Europe is  prepared to put their money where their mouth is.  But -- and there's a big  \"but\" on this one -- is, where's the money going to come from?</p><p> The details, we don't know yet.  So how the mechanism of this crisis  finally works, we don't know, but certainly it's a big step in the right  direction.</p><p> STOUT:  You call it a strong message to the markets.  How are the markets  reacting?</p><p> (STOCK MARKET REPORT)</p><p> STOUT:  We have to talk about China next.  And the head of the European  bailout fund is heading to Beijing on Friday, presumably with cup in hand.</p><p> What is China's role?  Will China ride to the rescue?</p><p> STEVENS:  Good question.  I don't know about going with cup in hand.</p><p> What he wants to see is that ESFS I was telling you about, the bailout  fund.  Now, the Europeans would like this to be more of an international  effort.  And what would probably happen is the International Monetary Fund  would get involved.  So that would take in more money from countries like  India and China, specifically.</p><p> What would be the quid pro quo here?  What will China get out of this or  India?  Probably more voting rights in the IMF.  This is all speculation at  the moment.</p><p> And China is not going to be throwing money in willy-nilly, no doubt.  As  China has always done, it will drive a hard bargain on this if it needs to.</p><p> The other thing too, though, is it's in China's interest to see Europe  growing again.  I mean, it's such a huge export money.  So China is not  going to cut its nose off to spite its face.</p><p> Which brings me just to the final point, Kristie.  OK.  Crisis over, but  the longer issue now is, how does Europe return to growth?</p><p> And this is being masked -- this whole growth story is being masked by the  fact we've had a crisis.  We've now got underlying growth issues.  How does  Europe kick-start itself?  A lot of people talking about lower interest  rates from the European Central Bank fairly soon.</p><p> STOUT:  Europe is China's largest trading partner, isn't it?</p><p> STEVENS:  Of course, yes.</p><p> STOUT:  Andrew Stevens, thank you very much indeed.</p><p> Andrew Stevens there.</p><p> Now, the pressure that had been building in the run-up to this deal, it  appears to have gotten the better of some Italian lawmakers.  Check it out.</p><p> This was the scene in Italy's lower house of parliament on Wednesday.   Lawmakers had been debating pension reform when a brawl broke out,  reportedly over televised comments by the house speaker about a party  leader's wife.  After the brawl, parliament was briefly suspended.</p><p> Now, ahead here on NEWS STREAM, higher and higher.  The floodwaters just  keep on rising.  Can residents in Bangkok get out of their way in time?</p><p> Plus -- </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well, we're very disappointed that the NTC still hasn't  sent anybody down to Sirte to investigate.  And their failure to  investigate risks invoking the jurisdiction of the International Criminal  Court.  This is a war crime.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> STOUT:  -- gruesome discoveries in a Libyan city that became a battlefield.   What really happened in Sirte as revolutionary fighters ousted Gadhafi  loyalists?</p><p> And going after the Taliban on Twitter.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> STOUT:  Welcome back.</p><p> Now, it is a slow-moving crisis that is entering a critical new stage.   Residents of the sprawling city of Bangkok are being urged to flee as  floodwaters inundate houses, businesses and roads.  And these new aerials  show the extent of the flooding, which is mostly in the north of the city  right now.  And a huge runoff of water is expected to reach the Thai  capital this weekend, at the same time as seasonal high tides.</p><p> Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra now says that all of Bangkok will be  flooded by 10 centimeters and one meter of water.  And although most of  downtown Bangkok is still dry, there is now water on the grounds of the  Grand Palace.</p><p> And CNN's Sarah Sidner joins us live from Bangkok.</p><p> And Sara, first, could you describe the scene around you there?</p><p> SARA SIDNER, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Kristie, yes, we're standing  out in front of the Grand Palace, one of the most beautiful and adored  landmarks here in the city.  And what we're seeing are a couple of streets  that are starting to get flooded here.</p><p> We are now seeing that water come in to the inner parts of Bangkok, a great  concern for the citizens and great concern for Bangkok officials.  The  governor saying today, look, we can no longer stop this deluge of water  from coming into many parts of the city.</p><p> Now, earlier today, we were able to get an aerial view.  We went up in a  helicopter with the U.S. Navy and Marines, who have been doing daily  missions to try and ascertain exactly what is happening with the water,  where it's going, how quickly it is moving.  And again, what we're seeing  is this odd scenario where, you're not seeing necessarily water rushing in,  you're seeing waters creeping in.</p><p> But we've seen roads that are being swallowed by water.  We are seeing the  airport from now, an aerial view.  And this is the domestic airport, not  the international airport.  The international airport, still running.  The  domestic airport, though, closed.  And we're seeing more water ending up on  the runways there.</p><p> We also flew over an area that would normally be dry, and what you're  seeing is water, just kilometers and kilometers of water going there.  </p><p> You're also seeing factories inundated or surrounded by water.  We're  talking about factories like Toshiba, for example.  We're talking about  factories like Toyota.  And they are having difficulties now distributing  things.</p><p> So, making business areas very, very difficult.  Thousands of factories  either flooded or surrounded by water.</p><p> And, of course, the residents.  The residents having to deal with this.   Their houses flooded, their belongings ruined, their lives turned upside  down.</p><p> More than 300 people have lost their lives so far.  We're talking about  more than nine million people affected.  And more people will be affected  because we are waiting for the high tide, which is expected 5:00 (ph)  Bangkok time, and then another push on a Friday afternoon.</p><p> So, there is concern, of course, in this city.  And we are starting to see  some of the water.  You heard from the prime minister today, saying that 10  centimeters, somewhere around four inches, to up to a meter will be coming  in to almost all of this city.  And we are waiting to see exactly how high  the waters will go -- Kristie.</p><p> STOUT:  You know, Sara, what you're telling us is very, very alarming.  And  the scene behind you is absolutely amazing.  It looks like there is a lake  between you and the Grand Palace, and yet, just a moment ago, a bus just  went through the water right behind you.</p><p> So, to what extent is Bangkok in crisis mode?  To what extent is the city  thinking, we're going to get through this and everything's going to be OK?</p><p> SIDNER:  Yes, I think it's one of those things that no one can actually  predict.  Where is it going to get really high floodwaters, and where is it  just going to be like it is here?  Which is about a little less than a  foot, and so cars can still make their way, or buses can still make their  way through this area.</p><p> One thing we do know is that there is international help coming in.  And I  want to share with you what the U.S. says that it's now doing for Bangkok.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> KRISTIE KENNEY, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THAILAND:  Water pumps, water purifiers  like this, all of that sort of thing.  We have two helicopters that are  flying survey missions, telling people where the floodwaters are and aren't  with the Thai military.  We have the U.S. Marines, a humanitarian  assistance team on the ground.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> SIDNER:  So we are seeing that, and we went with them today and we saw a  lot of the help that's being provided from outside and also from inside of  the country.  But again, the command center where the airport is, where  they've put people, they've had to sort of evacuate some of those people  because the water is starting to come in.  And this is really a wait and  watch situation, but we are starting to see water get further and further  into the city -- Kristie.</p><p> STOUT:  Sara Sidner, joining us live from Bangkok.</p><p> Many thanks indeed for that.</p><p> (WEATHER REPORT)</p><p> STOUT:  And coming up next here on NEWS STREAM, lingering questions about  apparent atrocities committed in Libya in the aftermath of civil war.</p><p> Stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> STOUT:  Coming to you live from Hong Kong, you are back watching NEWS  STREAM.</p><p> Now, Human Rights Watch wants to know what happened to dozens of men whose  bodies have been found in and around the Libyan city of Sirte.  That's  where Moammar Gadhafi was captured and killed last week.</p><p> And Dan Rivers reports the city may have witnessed a bloodbath.  And we  warn you, some of the images you're about to see are disturbing.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> DAN RIVERS, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  As the dust  settles on the Libyan conflict, there are increasing questions about the  atrocities that appear to have been perpetrated by militia loyal to the  transitional government.  These are just some of the bodies found around  Moammar Gadhafi's convoy.  Some were killed in a battle as the former  dictator tried to flee, but some appear to have been executed as prisoners,  contrary to the Geneva Conventions.  </p><p> (on camera):  Plenty of evidence around here of other bodies here, some of  which Human Rights Watch claim were also executed.  They say there are 95  bodies in this area, and at least 10 of them have been shot at point-blank  range.  </p><p> (voice-over):  We witnessed this during the battle for Sirte, piles of  bodies with their hands bound behind their backs, shot through the head,  with no clear sense of who they were or who shot them.  The bodies lay here  for days without any revolutionary forces attempting to bury them.</p><p> But now Human Right Watch investigator Peter Bouckaert says he's found  clear evidence some of the victims were Gadhafi officials, and he is  concerned they may have been executed by revolutionary forces.  This is the  aftermath of a massacre at the Mahari Hotel in Sirte, 53 bodies with  evidence on the walls that this hotel was occupied by revolutionary  brigades before the people were killed.  </p><p> PETER BOUCKAERT, HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH:  We're very disappointed that the NTC  still hasn't sent anybody down to Sirte to investigate, and their failure  to investigate risks invoking the jurisdiction of the International  Criminal Court.  This is a war crime.  </p><p> RIVERS:  The transitional government has promised to bring those  responsible to justice.  </p><p> AHMED BANI, NTC MILITARY SPOKESMAN (through translator):  I assure you that  we will not turn a blind eye or forgive any crime that might have been  committed during this conflict.  </p><p> RIVERS:  But the true scale of the killing in Sirte is only now becoming  clear.  Some 300 bodies have been found so far, with no one from the  transitional government attempting to gather evidence before the bodies are  removed.  </p><p> Dan Rivers, CNN, Tripoli.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> STOUT:  Now, Twitter is the newest battleground for coalition forces  fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan.  Our Errol Barnett reports on who may  be winning the online war of words.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> ERROL BARNETT, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Bullets,  bombs and tweets.  U.S. forces in Afghanistan, fearing they were losing the  information war to the Taliban, are now fighting back with Twitter, using  the Web site's short, 140-character messages to get out their side of the  story.</p><p> Here's a recent example of what the coalition forces call Taliban  propaganda.  A tweet from a Taliban spokesman who uses the Twitter name  ABalkhi reads, \"Mujahideen bring down U.S. helicopter in Kunar.\"  Well,  coalition forces fired back with their ISAF media Twitter account, \"We have  no reports of any missing helicopters.  Take any Taliban reports with a  block of salt.\" And later, this one, \"Reports of a shoot-down are false.\"  </p><p> The online war of words really started last month, with the Taliban attack  on the U.S. Embassy in Kabul.  Seven Afghan police officers and civilians  were killed, along with six insurgents.  But even before the 20-hour gun  battle was over, the tweets were flying.</p><p> ISAF media sending this: \"The outcome is inevitable.  The question is, how  much longer will terrorists put innocent Afghans in harm's way?\"</p><p> ABalkhi fired back in tech speak, \"I don't know.  You have been putting  them in harm's way for the past 10 years, razed whole villages and markets,  and still have the nerve to talk about harm's way.\"</p><p> ISAF media then responded, \"Really?  UNAMA reported 80 percent of civilian  casualties are caused by insurgent (as in your) activities.\"</p><p> With 14,000 followers on its Twitter account, ISAF media may have the  advantage here over Taliban spokesman ABalkhi, who has just 1,700  followers.  But a coalition spokesman acknowledges that this war of words  is far from over.</p><p> For CNN, I'm Errol Barnett.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> STOUT:  Now, ahead on NEWS STREAM, the world's population clock is ticking  closer and closer to the seven billion mark.</p><p> Plus, the fight against terrorism in Africa takes a new twist between two  tense numbers.  We'll have a live report from Kenya.</p><p> And what governments are asking Google to keep you from finding.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> STOUT:  I'm Kristie Lu Stout in Hong Kong.  You're watching News Stream.   And these are your world headlines.</p><p> Now European Union leaders have announced a deal to tackle the EuroZone's  debt crisis.  And the plan has three main elements.  Private banks have  agreed to write down the value of their holdings of Greek debt by 50  percent, European banks will boost their core capital reserves, and the EU  will leverage its bailout fund to give it an effective strength of $1.4  trillion.</p><p> Now people in Bangkok are being urged to flee as the flood stricken Thai  capital braces for its highest water levels yet.  Thailand's prime minister  says all districts of Bangkok will be flooded with some areas seeing water  as high as one meter.  Now the floods in Thailand have killed 373 people  and affected more than 9.5 million.</p><p> Now the death toll from Sunday's massive earthquake in eastern Turkey has  now risen to 534, that's according to Turkish officials.  There were  reports of another earthquake earlier on Thursday near the border with  Iraq, but there are no reports of any casualties from that 5.2 magnitude  tremor.</p><p> Now one of the largest populations on the planet is celebrating Diwali this  week, the festival of lights.  Like these people visiting the market in the  Indian city Amedabot (ph) had the celebrations.</p><p> Now the population of India, it stands at 1.21 billion right now.  And by  the year 2030 it is projected that India will become the world's most  populous nation.  And by next week, according to the UN, the global  population will reach 7 billion.</p><p> No one really knows for sure, but the Population Reference Bureau says that  nearly 108 billion people have been born throughout history.  That means  about 6 percent of all the people who were ever born are alive today.</p><p> And all this week, News Stream is examining the issues raised by world  population growth.  And my guest today is Fred Pearce.  He's a journalist  and environmental and development consultant.  And his latest book, it's  called \"People Quake,\" he says the world population is peaking and will  soon start to decline.  And what's more, he argues that Earth, our planet,  it could meet the needs of a larger population if some people consumed less  and natural resources were shared more equally.</p><p> Fred Pearce joins me now live from our London studio.</p><p> And Fred, thank you for joining us.  And we are counting down to 7 billion.   How worried should we be?</p><p> FRED PEARCE, AUTHOR:  I think we should be worried in the short-term.  It's  a lot of extra people that we're having every year.  But the good news is  that we can, I think, look forward to peak population something about the  middle of this century.  I think we'll go from about 7 billion now to  perhaps 9 billion, perhaps a little more.</p><p> But family sizes -- the good news is that family sizes are coming down so  fast that we can look forward to peak population, and maybe decline after  that.  The average woman today has 2.5 children.  That's half as many as  her mother and her grandmother had.  We used to get up at five and six.</p><p> So fertility levels are coming down really remarkably fast.  And if they  carry on down as they have (inaudible) already.  And we can see good news  ahead.  We can see light at the end of the tunnel.</p><p> STOUT:  You know, it's interesting that you're saying that the population  is peaking, because it was just yesterday the United Nations released this  report and said by the end of the century the world's total population  could rise to more than 10 billion.  So what are your thoughts on that?  Is  the population rising, or is it peaking?</p><p> PEARCE:  Well it's certainly rising.  The peak is to come.  I think most  people will agree that by mid-century we'll be at about 9 billion.  The  question is what happens after that.  And the UN has very wide error bars  on its projections.  So nobody really knows.</p><p> But the evidence is that fertility rates are coming down so fast, people  are -- you know many countries have half the number of children that their  women were having in a generation.  Much of India is now down to 2 children  per woman, many parts of Asia even lower.  So if Africa follows that path,  then by mid-century I think we will see peak population.</p><p> Absolutely nobody knows for sure.  And there are big concerns about how  African -- how Africa, for instance, can cope with a doubling of its  numbers in the next few decades.  But we can look forward, I think, with a  sort of optimistic hope that we can see peak population.  And that would  help to solve an awful lot of global environmental problems, not least  climate change.</p><p> STOUT:  Now in the near-term, we are nearing the 7 billionth person on the  planet.  Right now, especially looking at consumption habits that are out  there, can earth handle that?</p><p> PEARCE:  I -- the way we consume now I don't think it can.  I think we're  already over the limit if everybody wants to live a western style of life  and to produce what we need in the western way of doing it.  We're going to  have to change anyway.</p><p> But the way I look at it, we are diffusing the population bomb.  The  world's population isn't going to double again as its doubled in the last  40 years.  We're diffusing the population bomb, but we haven't begun to  diffuse the consumption bomb, that's where the real issues I think are now.   How we produce our energy, whether we can recycle those scarce metals,  whether we can preserve our soils.</p><p> We know we can feed 10 billion people.  We're already producing enough food  for that.  We just don't know how to distribute it and get it to the people  who are hungry.  So there is hope out there.  We're not up against a sort  of doom's day scenario, but we do have to get things right.  We do have to  manage our planet's resources much more efficiently.</p><p> But if we do that than I do believe that the 8, 9, even 10 billion people  that we might have by the end of the century we can give them a good life.</p><p> STOUT:  So our focus should be on consumption rather than population.  Fred  Pearce, thank you very much indeed for joining us here on News Stream.</p><p> And as we count down to the world population hitting the 7 billion mark, we  are asking our ireporters to help us visualize that massive number.  And we  have already had submissions featuring grains of rice or steps on a very  long hike.  What can you come up with?  You can submit your photos or  videos to ireport.com and you may see them on CNN.</p><p> Now Kenya's pursuit of Islamic militants in neighboring Somalia is taking a  surprising twist.  A Kenyan government official tells CNN that leaders of  the al Shabaab militant group want to talk.  Now Kenyan troops, they swept  into Somalia earlier this month to hunt for al Shabaab fighters.</p><p> Now Kenya blames al Shabaab for a string of kidnappings and attacks.  And  David McKenzie joins me now from Kenya's capital Nairobi.</p><p> And David, they're saying they want to talk, but can al Shabaab be trusted?</p><p> DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, al Shabaab said  that it's not talking to the Kenyan government and they've threatened Kenya  in fact.  And I have to say that the government minister, the government  spokesman Afred Mutua just had a press conference.  He denied those  reports.</p><p> Though I did speak to a Kenyan government very close to this military  operation.  He said that well the al Shabaab doesn't have time to talk,  because, quote, \"they're running for their lives.\"  So certainly a  contradictory statements coming from the Kenyan government.</p><p> What is becoming apparently and clear is that operation to take on al  Shabaab is a very complex operation and some people fear that it'll be a  very difficult one indeed.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MCKENZIE:  Kenyan troops pushing into Somalia, part of a major offensive  that took many by surprise.  Their stated aim, to take al Shabaab head on.</p><p> The al Qaeda linked militant group has threatened Kenya before.  But a  recent string of kidnappings here spurred the government into action.</p><p> ALFRED MUTUA, KENYA GOVERNMENT SPOKESMAN:  The al Shabaab group poses a  clear and present danger, not only to Kenya and this region, but to the  entire world.  We do believe that the fight against terror cannot be won  unless the power and the organization of al Shabaab is dismantled.</p><p> MCKENZIE:  Security analysts say that the incursion is a big risk.  They  point to recent history.</p><p>America's infamous Blackhawk Down mission in the 90s, Ethiopia's U.S.- backed invasion which led to the rise of al Shabaab.  And African Union's  long and bloody campaign to control Mogadishu.</p><p> RASHID ABDI, SOMALI ANALYST:  If there's anything we have learned, you  know, in the last couple of years is that foreign domination, especially  military domination doesn't work in Somalia.</p><p> MCKENZIE:  Kenya's military officials say they want to push on to Kismayo,  a key stronghold of al Shabaab.  </p><p> But the country's largely conventional army is being hampered by heavy  rains, al Shabaab's ability to melt into the background.</p><p> Kenya's key western allies, the U.S. and the UK, were quick to state that  they will not give any assistance to this operation.  But France says they  will give some help.</p><p> The decision to attack was the Kenyan government's alone, it seems.  But  many worry it will make this country less safe, not more.</p><p> ABDI:  You know, if the argument for going in to stop terrorism, the  contrary is now the case.  Al Shabaab will now have the pretense to strike  Kenya.</p><p> MCKENZIE:  A series of grenade attacks this week, blamed on al Shabaab, has  the country on edge.  But the Kenyan government says it has stepped up  security and that they have just one aim in Somalia.</p><p> MUTUA:  We don't want to go and get stuck in Somalia.  When the United  States, Ethiopia and others went there, they were trying to support an  existing government.  Our main objective is to just go in, dismantle the al  Shabaab, and get out.  So we are very clear objective.</p><p> MCKENZIE:  To take out al Shabaab?</p><p> MUTUA:  To take out al Shabaab.</p><p> MCKENZIE:  The government says that the operation should be over in a  matter of months.  Some fear that Kenya has stepped into a military  quagmire that has haunted this continent for decades.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MCKENZIE:  Well, some latest news, Kristie, in the northeast of the country  near Mandera (ph) on the border of Somalia apparently four people have been  killed according to the police here in Kenya.  Four people killed who were  traveling a government officials who were carrying examination papers in a  car.  So it's unclear who caused that attack, but certainly worries here in  Kenya the internal security as the army and the air force pushes into  Somalia to take on al Shabaab -- Kristie.</p><p> STOUT:  Very fluid situation.  Thank you for giving us the updates.  David  McKenzie joining us live from Nairobi.  Thank you.</p><p> Now China is calling for stricter control of social media sites to promote  what it calls a healthy internet culture.  And according to a communique  from a Communist Party meeting, the central committee will, quote,  strengthen guidance and administration of social internet services and  regulate the orderly dissemination of information.</p><p> Now this tightening, it came as a part of the government's crackdown on  online rumors with special focus on the country's leading microblog Sina  Weibo.  And we have a lot more on this story for you on our blog.  You can  check it out, CNN.com/newsstream.</p><p> Now just ahead here on News Stream, like all big tech companies, Google  gets calls from governments to take down content.  But which countries make  the most of those requests?  We'll dig into Google's transparency report.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> STOUT:  Welcome back.</p><p> Now Google and governments it's an interesting relationship.  Now the tech  giant has just released its latest transparency report.  And its goal is to  expose how governments around the world affect our access to information on  the Internet.  And you can find the report on Google's official blog.</p><p> But here are a few countries that stood out.  Now the first half of this  year, Brazil made the most content removal requests followed by Germany,  the U.S. and South Korea.</p><p> Now joining me now to talk more about the report is News Stream regular  Nicolas Thompson, senior editor of the New Yorker.  And Nick, always good  to see you.  And you have trolled through this report.  What were the  highlights for you?</p><p> NICK THOMPSON, NEW YORKER:  There are all sort of interesting things.  You  can learn a lot about what a country's government cares about by what  they've requested to be taken down.</p><p> Some of the things that stuck out is that in Turkey there are all sorts of  requests to take down videos on YouTube that showed information about  officials' private lives.  Google complied with all of those.</p><p> In India, there are all sorts of requests to take down videos that show  people insulting religious leaders.  Because of India's local laws don't  restrict that as much, Google didn't comply with those.</p><p> In Thailand, there are lots of requests to take down videos that were  insulting to the monarch.  And Google did comply with those.</p><p> The little bit that stuck out the most to me, there's a little nugget in  the section on the United States.  And it said there was a request to take  down a video showing police brutality and another showing -- a request to  take down a video showing defamation of a police officer.  And then Google  specifically says we didn't comply.</p><p> Now why are they saying that?  And I think it's partly to show Google's aim  with this report is both to kind of poke the countries that have lots of  requests and to make it clear that they are doing something their citizens  might not agree with.  And also to show that sometimes Google objects to  this.  And it's actually a particularly good time for Google to say that  it's not taking down videos of police brutality in this country in the  United States is becoming more of an issue.  It makes Google look like more  of a good guy.</p><p> STOUT:  Yeah, it's like Google in superhero mode.  \"Don't be evil is the  mantra here.\"</p><p> And Google, interesting to know, it's the only internet company that  releases this kind of information about its relationship with governments  around the world.  Do you think it will make a difference by doing so?</p><p> THOMPSON:  I think it does make a difference.  I think it shows -- I mean,  it makes a difference in the way we perceive Google, because it actually  shows the import of Google.  So when you think about the information that a  society gets to see and that gets circulated, it partly depends on what its  users feel free to put up, it partly depends on what its government objects  to, and it partly depends on Google, right?</p><p>Google has a bunch of people who make very important decisions about the  information that can circulate in a society.  We're moving into a world  where tech companies have a lot of power in a cynic way that they didn't  have before.  And what's interesting about Google is it's being open about  it.  It's admitting to it.  And it's giving us a lot of information about  the choices it makes, so that we can judge those choices.</p><p> STOUT:  And while we're talking about Google, your thoughts on the buzz out  there that Google has its eyes on a Yahoo takeover.  Is it possible?  What  about the other rivals eying Yahoo?  And what would it mean for Microsoft?</p><p> THOMPSON:  Well, I think -- I mean, I think that Google can't possibly take  over Yahoo, or probably can't even take over a chunk of Yahoo.  There's --  there's no way that U.S. regulators would allow the number one search  company to take over the number two.  It's preposterous.  Google is already  in all sorts of anti-trust problems at the moment.</p><p> So there are some rumors circulating that Google must have leaked this in  order to irritate Microsoft and to drive up the price.  Google and  Microsoft, they are forever at war with each other.</p><p> I actually think it was probably somebody else who leaked this information.   Google probably made some calls, but anybody who is a Yahoo shareholder is  interested in a price being a high as possible.  So they're interested in  heated up the market as much as possible?  So they're interested in  floating as many rumors as possible.</p><p> So I think Google probably made a call.  It's not leading anywhere.  And  somebody whose got a financial interest and Yahoo made sure the press knew  about it.</p><p> STOUT:  I love these high tech conspiracy theories.</p><p> Nick Thompson, unfortunately we have to leave it at that.  Thank you very  much as always for joining us, every week, right here on News Stream.  Take  care.</p><p> Political candidates in the United States are finding all kinds of ways to  communicate to potential voters.  And it seems one campaign staffer is  sending smoke signals.  Our Jeanne Moos explains after the break.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> STOUT:  The champagne is still on ice.  The Texas Rangers could have become  World Series champions on Wednesday, but the weather got in the way.  And  here is Pedro Pinto with more -- Pedro.</p><p> PEDRO PINTO, CNN SPORTS CORREPSONDENT:  Hey, Kristie.  Heavy rain in St.  Louis postponed last night's world series contest at Busch Stadium.  Both  teams are hoping the weather will clear up so they can actually go out  there and play some baseball on Thursday.</p><p> It was pretty miserable on Wednesday with officials calling the game off  five hours before the first pitch was supposed to be thrown.  The rain just  didn't stop all day long.</p><p> The Rangers lead the best of seven series three games to two with game 6  now set to be played on Thursday.  The Rangers are looking for their first  ever World Series title.</p><p> Should the Cardinals stave off elimination, a deciding seventh game will be  played on Friday.  Both teams' managers said they welcome the rest that  they weren't expecting.  And they guarantee the players will be ready to go  on Thursday.</p><p> Now let's focus our attention on football.  Al Sadd have qualified for the  final of the Asian Champion's League for the first time since 1989.  They  did so by knocking out South Korea's Suwon Bluewings.</p><p> The first leg of this tie in Suwon was marred by an ugly brawl.   Fortunately, there were no such issues in Doha on Wednesday night.  The  Bluewings have lost the first leg at home 2-nil but they got back into the  semifinal by taking an early lead.</p><p> Great goal, it was as well, Oh Jang-Eun with a fantastic volley, definitely  worth another look.</p><p> The home side tried to reestablish their two goal lead in the tie and came  close to doing so.  Khalfan Ibrahim with the effort that was saved onto the  crossbar by Jung Sung-Ryong.</p><p> As time passed, the Bluewings knew they needed to force the issue.  And   Park Joon-Jin had a shot on target from close range right at the keeper,  though.</p><p> The match finished 1-nil Suwon.  Not enough for the South Koreans.  Al Sadd  won 2-1 on aggregate. They'll face Jeonbuk in the final.</p><p> Maria Sharapova has withdrawn from the WTA tour championships after  suffering a recurrence of a recent ankle injury during her second match in  Istanbul.  This means she no longer has a chance to overtake Caroline  Wozniaki for the world number one ranking.</p><p> Sharapova made the announcement shortly after losing her second consecutive  match on the hard courts of the Turkish capital.  She went down to Li Na in  straight sets.</p><p> Is was an unexpected score, considering it was actually the Russian that  had a 4-1 lead in the first set.  Her opponent rebounded well and actually  had the lead before Sharapova then forced a tiebreak.</p><p> Again, the Russian had an advantage in the tiebreaker, but failed to hold  on.  Li Na winning the first set.</p><p> In the second, the French Open champion was on top and managed to seal the  deal in the 10th game.  Leading 5-4 and serving for the match, she was down  15-40 before prevailing to finish off Sharapova in straight sets.</p><p> Also on Wednesday, Caroline Wozniaki lost surprisingly to Victoria  Zvonareva.</p><p> That'll do it for now.  Kristie, back to you.</p><p> STOUT:  Pedro, thank you.</p><p> Now the U.S. presidential hopeful Herman Cain, he has turned into surprise  frontrunner for the Republican Party's nomination.

After nearly 11 hours of talks, a deal on tackling EU debt was done.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Helpless in the face of rising floodwaters. Thai authorities say all areas of the capital will be flooded Thursday.</p><p/><p>And as Kenya fights armed gangs, it says they're launching raids across the Somali border. Now it seems al-Shabaab wants to talk.</p><p/><p>Clearing the hurdles. European leaders have achieved what many were calling the unachievable. After meeting well into the early hours on Thursday morning, representatives from all 27 EU member countries finally reached an agreement on handling Europe's debt crisis.</p><p/><p>Now, here are some of the details, starting with Greece.</p><p/><p>One of the toughest hurdles was striking a compromise with private investors, but they finally agreed to take a 50 percent loss on Greek bonds. Now, that translates into roughly 100 billion euros and will help significantly reduce Greece's debt load.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>HERMAN VAN ROMPUY, EUROPEAN COUNCIL PRESIDENT: We want to put Greece on track where, in 2020, it will have reduced its public debt to 120 percent of GDP. Since July, market conditions worsened. The new program includes an extra effort by the official sector, a new EU/IMF program of up to $100 billion will be put in place by the end of the year. It also includes a voluntary contribution by private creditors who had lent to Greece.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>STOUT: The European Financial Stability Facility is also getting a boost, and this bailout fund, it's being expanded from its initial rescue power of 440 billion euros, to one trillion euros, or about $1.4 trillion. Now, that will provide an extra buffer if Italy and Spain need emergency aid, but European banks may be feeling the pressure.</p><p/><p>And under the new deal, they must increase their core capital reserves to nine percent. Now, that is to protect against potential losses from future write-downs or defaults.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>JOSE MANUEL BARROSO, EUROPEAN COMMISSION PRESIDENT: Let me emphasize that our goal is to ensure banks maintain lending to the real economy. The national supervisor of authorities must work to make this happen; namely, with the EBA. And tonight's conclusions also make clear that -- I quote -- \"Banks should be subject to constraints regarding dissolution of dividends and bond (ph) payments until recapitalization is complete,\" because increased responsibility and a fair contribution of the financial sector is also central to our approach.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>STOUT: And as the European Union's two anchor economies, France and Germany, each played a high-profile role in leading the negotiations to this point.</p><p/><p>And we have Jim Bittermann in Paris and Fred Pleitgen in Berlin with a look at how Europeans are taking in the news.</p><p/><p>Let's start in Berlin.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: I'm Fred Pleitgen, in Berlin.</p><p/><p>And at this early stage in the game, the Germans are very satisfied with the compromise that was reached at the euro summit in Brussels. However, also, it still is far too early to tell what actual effect all of this is going to have, what effect it's going to have on interest rates for loans for people, but also what effect it could potentially have for economic growth here in Germany. And that's one of the main things that the Germans are very worried about. It's inflation and how all of this could affect economic growth.</p><p/><p>They're worried about their taxpayer dollars. What's happened within the crisis that's going on right now is that the Germans have already had to slash their growth forecast for this year and for the coming year several times.</p><p/><p>When I talk to companies here in this country, they say they're slightly worried about the future, but also, they say that right now, they feel that the economy and their businesses are still fairly robust.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>JIM BITTERMANN, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: I'm Jim Bittermann, in Paris.</p><p/><p>The French have long loved to hate their banks. So the fact that bankers here will have to write off Greek debt and come up with more capital won't displease anyone. But there's deep skepticism here that the banks will somehow find ways to pass along their new financial burdens on to their customers with higher fees or interest rates.</p><p/><p>President Sarkozy will appear on the two main television channels tonight to talk about the resolution of the financial crisis. He's almost certain to reassure the citizenry, especially since he's up for reelection next year, that they will not be paying for this. However, one part of the accord consumers will soon be paying for, little noticed in the agreement, are measures to make governments more financially responsible in the future. And the French government is already talking about measures including a new level of value-added tax to reduce its government spending.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>STOUT: Now, China's foreign ministry spokeswoman says that Chinese President Hu Jintao and French President Nicolas Sarkozy spoke by telephone on Thursday. She said the two discussed the global economy, as well as next week's Group of 20 summit in France. Mr. Sarkozy has publicly expressed that his hope, that China will contribute to a fund that European leaders are setting up.</p><p/><p>And Jiang Yu speaks for the Chinese Foreign Ministry.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>JIANG YU, CHINESE FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESWOMAN (through translator): The Chinese side welcomes the EU summit consensus on the European crisis. We hope it will be conducive to lifting market (INAUDIBLE), promoting the sustainable economic development of the EU and eurozone, and injecting vitality into the European integration. China is ready to work with the international community to promote the stability in the international financial market, and world economic recovery and growth.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>STOUT: This deal has broader global implications to varying degrees.</p><p/><p>Our Andrew Stevens, here in Hong Kong, has been following this story, watching the early reaction.</p><p/><p>But first, your thoughts on this deal?</p><p/><p>ANDREW STEVENS, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: Well, I think the important thing here is that there is a deal.</p><p/><p>If you go back to the last weeks, months, years, even, we've been in constant crisis mode. We do now have a deal which has been signed to by all the EU members.</p><p/><p>This is important, Kristie. Is it the deal that draws the big, thick black line under the whole euro crisis? Probably not. Research suggests that a lot of people in the financial industry are saying this is a good step forward.</p><p/><p>What's so crucial here is that Greece, which we've been reporting for so long now about the likelihood of a default, not paying its debts, that default scenario now looks like at least it's been pushed right into the background, because it's got $100 billion in debt relief. This is a good thing.</p><p/><p>The ESFS -- this is the bailout fund -- it looks like it's going to be lifted, as you were saying, to a trillion euros. That's about $1.4 trillion. This is also a very strong message to the markets that Europe is prepared to put their money where their mouth is. But -- and there's a big \"but\" on this one -- is, where's the money going to come from?</p><p/><p>The details, we don't know yet. So how the mechanism of this crisis finally works, we don't know, but certainly it's a big step in the right direction.</p><p/><p>STOUT: You call it a strong message to the markets. How are the markets reacting?</p><p/><p>(STOCK MARKET REPORT)</p><p/><p>STOUT: We have to talk about China next. And the head of the European bailout fund is heading to Beijing on Friday, presumably with cup in hand.</p><p/><p>What is China's role? Will China ride to the rescue?</p><p/><p>STEVENS: Good question. I don't know about going with cup in hand.</p><p/><p>What he wants to see is that ESFS I was telling you about, the bailout fund. Now, the Europeans would like this to be more of an international effort. And what would probably happen is the International Monetary Fund would get involved. So that would take in more money from countries like India and China, specifically.</p><p/><p>What would be the quid pro quo here? What will China get out of this or India? Probably more voting rights in the IMF. This is all speculation at the moment.</p><p/><p>And China is not going to be throwing money in willy-nilly, no doubt. As China has always done, it will drive a hard bargain on this if it needs to.</p><p/><p>The other thing too, though, is it's in China's interest to see Europe growing again. I mean, it's such a huge export money. So China is not going to cut its nose off to spite its face.</p><p/><p>Which brings me just to the final point, Kristie. OK. Crisis over, but the longer issue now is, how does Europe return to growth?</p><p/><p>And this is being masked -- this whole growth story is being masked by the fact we've had a crisis. We've now got underlying growth issues. How does Europe kick-start itself? A lot of people talking about lower interest rates from the European Central Bank fairly soon.</p><p/><p>STOUT: Europe is China's largest trading partner, isn't it?</p><p/><p>STEVENS: Of course, yes.</p><p/><p>STOUT: Andrew Stevens, thank you very much indeed.</p><p/><p>Andrew Stevens there.</p><p/><p>Now, the pressure that had been building in the run-up to this deal, it appears to have gotten the better of some Italian lawmakers. Check it out.</p><p/><p>This was the scene in Italy's lower house of parliament on Wednesday. Lawmakers had been debating pension reform when a brawl broke out, reportedly over televised comments by the house speaker about a party leader's wife. After the brawl, parliament was briefly suspended.</p><p/><p>Now, ahead here on NEWS STREAM, higher and higher. The floodwaters just keep on rising. Can residents in Bangkok get out of their way in time?</p><p/><p>Plus --</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, we're very disappointed that the NTC still hasn't sent anybody down to Sirte to investigate. And their failure to investigate risks invoking the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court. This is a war crime.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>STOUT: -- gruesome discoveries in a Libyan city that became a battlefield. What really happened in Sirte as revolutionary fighters ousted Gadhafi loyalists?</p><p/><p>And going after the Taliban on Twitter.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>STOUT: Welcome back.</p><p/><p>Now, it is a slow-moving crisis that is entering a critical new stage. Residents of the sprawling city of Bangkok are being urged to flee as floodwaters inundate houses, businesses and roads. And these new aerials show the extent of the flooding, which is mostly in the north of the city right now. And a huge runoff of water is expected to reach the Thai capital this weekend, at the same time as seasonal high tides.</p><p/><p>Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra now says that all of Bangkok will be flooded by 10 centimeters and one meter of water. And although most of downtown Bangkok is still dry, there is now water on the grounds of the Grand Palace.</p><p/><p>And CNN's Sarah Sidner joins us live from Bangkok.</p><p/><p>And Sara, first, could you describe the scene around you there?</p><p/><p>SARA SIDNER, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Kristie, yes, we're standing out in front of the Grand Palace, one of the most beautiful and adored landmarks here in the city. And what we're seeing are a couple of streets that are starting to get flooded here.</p><p/><p>We are now seeing that water come in to the inner parts of Bangkok, a great concern for the citizens and great concern for Bangkok officials. The governor saying today, look, we can no longer stop this deluge of water from coming into many parts of the city.</p><p/><p>Now, earlier today, we were able to get an aerial view. We went up in a helicopter with the U.S. Navy and Marines, who have been doing daily missions to try and ascertain exactly what is happening with the water, where it's going, how quickly it is moving. And again, what we're seeing is this odd scenario where, you're not seeing necessarily water rushing in, you're seeing waters creeping in.</p><p/><p>But we've seen roads that are being swallowed by water. We are seeing the airport from now, an aerial view. And this is the domestic airport, not the international airport. The international airport, still running. The domestic airport, though, closed. And we're seeing more water ending up on the runways there.</p><p/><p>We also flew over an area that would normally be dry, and what you're seeing is water, just kilometers and kilometers of water going there.</p><p/><p>You're also seeing factories inundated or surrounded by water. We're talking about factories like Toshiba, for example. We're talking about factories like Toyota. And they are having difficulties now distributing things.</p><p/><p>So, making business areas very, very difficult. Thousands of factories either flooded or surrounded by water.</p><p/><p>And, of course, the residents. The residents having to deal with this. Their houses flooded, their belongings ruined, their lives turned upside down.</p><p/><p>More than 300 people have lost their lives so far. We're talking about more than nine million people affected. And more people will be affected because we are waiting for the high tide, which is expected 5:00 (ph) Bangkok time, and then another push on a Friday afternoon.</p><p/><p>So, there is concern, of course, in this city. And we are starting to see some of the water. You heard from the prime minister today, saying that 10 centimeters, somewhere around four inches, to up to a meter will be coming in to almost all of this city. And we are waiting to see exactly how high the waters will go -- Kristie.</p><p/><p>STOUT: You know, Sara, what you're telling us is very, very alarming. And the scene behind you is absolutely amazing. It looks like there is a lake between you and the Grand Palace, and yet, just a moment ago, a bus just went through the water right behind you.</p><p/><p>So, to what extent is Bangkok in crisis mode? To what extent is the city thinking, we're going to get through this and everything's going to be OK?</p><p/><p>SIDNER: Yes, I think it's one of those things that no one can actually predict. Where is it going to get really high floodwaters, and where is it just going to be like it is here? Which is about a little less than a foot, and so cars can still make their way, or buses can still make their way through this area.</p><p/><p>One thing we do know is that there is international help coming in. And I want to share with you what the U.S. says that it's now doing for Bangkok.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>KRISTIE KENNEY, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THAILAND: Water pumps, water purifiers like this, all of that sort of thing.

But again, the command center where the airport is, where they've put people, they've had to sort of evacuate some of those people because the water is starting to come in. And this is really a wait and watch situation, but we are starting to see water get further and further into the city -- Kristie.</p><p/><p>STOUT: Sara Sidner, joining us live from Bangkok.</p><p/><p>Many thanks indeed for that.</p><p/><p>(WEATHER REPORT)</p><p/><p>STOUT: And coming up next here on NEWS STREAM, lingering questions about apparent atrocities committed in Libya in the aftermath of civil war.</p><p/><p>Stay with us.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>STOUT: Coming to you live from Hong Kong, you are back watching NEWS STREAM.</p><p/><p>Now, Human Rights Watch wants to know what happened to dozens of men whose bodies have been found in and around the Libyan city of Sirte. That's where Moammar Gadhafi was captured and killed last week.</p><p/><p>And Dan Rivers reports the city may have witnessed a bloodbath. And we warn you, some of the images you're about to see are disturbing.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>DAN RIVERS, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): As the dust settles on the Libyan conflict, there are increasing questions about the atrocities that appear to have been perpetrated by militia loyal to the transitional government. These are just some of the bodies found around Moammar Gadhafi's convoy. Some were killed in a battle as the former dictator tried to flee, but some appear to have been executed as prisoners, contrary to the Geneva Conventions.</p><p/><p>(on camera): Plenty of evidence around here of other bodies here, some of which Human Rights Watch claim were also executed. They say there are 95 bodies in this area, and at least 10 of them have been shot at point-blank range.</p><p/><p>(voice-over): We witnessed this during the battle for Sirte, piles of bodies with their hands bound behind their backs, shot through the head, with no clear sense of who they were or who shot them. The bodies lay here for days without any revolutionary forces attempting to bury them.</p><p/><p>But now Human Right Watch investigator Peter Bouckaert says he's found clear evidence some of the victims were Gadhafi officials, and he is concerned they may have been executed by revolutionary forces. This is the aftermath of a massacre at the Mahari Hotel in Sirte, 53 bodies with evidence on the walls that this hotel was occupied by revolutionary brigades before the people were killed.</p><p/><p>PETER BOUCKAERT, HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH: We're very disappointed that the NTC still hasn't sent anybody down to Sirte to investigate, and their failure to investigate risks invoking the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court. This is a war crime.</p><p/><p>RIVERS: The transitional government has promised to bring those responsible to justice.</p><p/><p>AHMED BANI, NTC MILITARY SPOKESMAN (through translator): I assure you that we will not turn a blind eye or forgive any crime that might have been committed during this conflict.</p><p/><p>RIVERS: But the true scale of the killing in Sirte is only now becoming clear. Some 300 bodies have been found so far, with no one from the transitional government attempting to gather evidence before the bodies are removed.</p><p/><p>Dan Rivers, CNN, Tripoli.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>STOUT: Now, Twitter is the newest battleground for coalition forces fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan. Our Errol Barnett reports on who may be winning the online war of words.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>ERROL BARNETT, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Bullets, bombs and tweets. U.S. forces in Afghanistan, fearing they were losing the information war to the Taliban, are now fighting back with Twitter, using the Web site's short, 140-character messages to get out their side of the story.</p><p/><p>Here's a recent example of what the coalition forces call Taliban propaganda. A tweet from a Taliban spokesman who uses the Twitter name ABalkhi reads, \"Mujahideen bring down U.S. helicopter in Kunar.\" Well, coalition forces fired back with their ISAF media Twitter account, \"We have no reports of any missing helicopters. Take any Taliban reports with a block of salt.\" And later, this one, \"Reports of a shoot-down are false.\"</p><p/><p>The online war of words really started last month, with the Taliban attack on the U.S. Embassy in Kabul. Seven Afghan police officers and civilians were killed, along with six insurgents. But even before the 20-hour gun battle was over, the tweets were flying.</p><p/><p>ISAF media sending this: \"The outcome is inevitable. The question is, how much longer will terrorists put innocent Afghans in harm's way?\"</p><p/><p>ABalkhi fired back in tech speak, \"I don't know. You have been putting them in harm's way for the past 10 years, razed whole villages and markets, and still have the nerve to talk about harm's way.\"</p><p/><p>ISAF media then responded, \"Really? UNAMA reported 80 percent of civilian casualties are caused by insurgent (as in your) activities.\"</p><p/><p>With 14,000 followers on its Twitter account, ISAF media may have the advantage here over Taliban spokesman ABalkhi, who has just 1,700 followers. But a coalition spokesman acknowledges that this war of words is far from over.</p><p/><p>For CNN, I'm Errol Barnett.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>STOUT: Now, ahead on NEWS STREAM, the world's population clock is ticking closer and closer to the seven billion mark.</p><p/><p>Plus, the fight against terrorism in Africa takes a new twist between two tense numbers. We'll have a live report from Kenya.</p><p/><p>And what governments are asking Google to keep you from finding.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>STOUT: I'm Kristie Lu Stout in Hong Kong. You're watching News Stream. And these are your world headlines.</p><p/><p>Now European Union leaders have announced a deal to tackle the EuroZone's debt crisis. And the plan has three main elements. Private banks have agreed to write down the value of their holdings of Greek debt by 50 percent, European banks will boost their core capital reserves, and the EU will leverage its bailout fund to give it an effective strength of $1.4 trillion.</p><p/><p>Now people in Bangkok are being urged to flee as the flood stricken Thai capital braces for its highest water levels yet. Thailand's prime minister says all districts of Bangkok will be flooded with some areas seeing water as high as one meter. Now the floods in Thailand have killed 373 people and affected more than 9.5 million.</p><p/><p>Now the death toll from Sunday's massive earthquake in eastern Turkey has now risen to 534, that's according to Turkish officials. There were reports of another earthquake earlier on Thursday near the border with Iraq, but there are no reports of any casualties from that 5.2 magnitude tremor.</p><p/><p>Now one of the largest populations on the planet is celebrating Diwali this week, the festival of lights. Like these people visiting the market in the Indian city Amedabot (ph) had the celebrations.</p><p/><p>Now the population of India, it stands at 1.21 billion right now. And by the year 2030 it is projected that India will become the world's most populous nation. And by next week, according to the UN, the global population will reach 7 billion.</p><p/><p>No one really knows for sure, but the Population Reference Bureau says that nearly 108 billion people have been born throughout history. That means about 6 percent of all the people who were ever born are alive today.</p><p/><p>And all this week, News Stream is examining the issues raised by world population growth. And my guest today is Fred Pearce. He's a journalist and environmental and development consultant. And his latest book, it's called \"People Quake,\" he says the world population is peaking and will soon start to decline. And what's more, he argues that Earth, our planet, it could meet the needs of a larger population if some people consumed less and natural resources were shared more equally.</p><p/><p>Fred Pearce joins me now live from our London studio.</p><p/><p>And Fred, thank you for joining us. And we are counting down to 7 billion. How worried should we be?</p><p/><p>FRED PEARCE, AUTHOR: I think we should be worried in the short-term. It's a lot of extra people that we're having every year. But the good news is that we can, I think, look forward to peak population something about the middle of this century. I think we'll go from about 7 billion now to perhaps 9 billion, perhaps a little more.</p><p/><p>But family sizes -- the good news is that family sizes are coming down so fast that we can look forward to peak population, and maybe decline after that. The average woman today has 2.5 children. That's half as many as her mother and her grandmother had. We used to get up at five and six.</p><p/><p>So fertility levels are coming down really remarkably fast. And if they carry on down as they have (inaudible) already. And we can see good news ahead. We can see light at the end of the tunnel.</p><p/><p>STOUT: You know, it's interesting that you're saying that the population is peaking, because it was just yesterday the United Nations released this report and said by the end of the century the world's total population could rise to more than 10 billion. So what are your thoughts on that? Is the population rising, or is it peaking?</p><p/><p>PEARCE: Well it's certainly rising. The peak is to come. I think most people will agree that by mid-century we'll be at about 9 billion. The question is what happens after that. And the UN has very wide error bars on its projections. So nobody really knows.</p><p/><p>But the evidence is that fertility rates are coming down so fast, people are -- you know many countries have half the number of children that their women were having in a generation. Much of India is now down to 2 children per woman, many parts of Asia even lower. So if Africa follows that path, then by mid-century I think we will see peak population.</p><p/><p>Absolutely nobody knows for sure. And there are big concerns about how African -- how Africa, for instance, can cope with a doubling of its numbers in the next few decades. But we can look forward, I think, with a sort of optimistic hope that we can see peak population. And that would help to solve an awful lot of global environmental problems, not least climate change.</p><p/><p>STOUT: Now in the near-term, we are nearing the 7 billionth person on the planet. Right now, especially looking at consumption habits that are out there, can earth handle that?</p><p/><p>PEARCE: I -- the way we consume now I don't think it can. I think we're already over the limit if everybody wants to live a western style of life and to produce what we need in the western way of doing it. We're going to have to change anyway.</p><p/><p>But the way I look at it, we are diffusing the population bomb. The world's population isn't going to double again as its doubled in the last 40 years. We're diffusing the population bomb, but we haven't begun to diffuse the consumption bomb, that's where the real issues I think are now. How we produce our energy, whether we can recycle those scarce metals, whether we can preserve our soils.</p><p/><p>We know we can feed 10 billion people. We're already producing enough food for that. We just don't know how to distribute it and get it to the people who are hungry. So there is hope out there. We're not up against a sort of doom's day scenario, but we do have to get things right. We do have to manage our planet's resources much more efficiently.</p><p/><p>But if we do that than I do believe that the 8, 9, even 10 billion people that we might have by the end of the century we can give them a good life.</p><p/><p>STOUT: So our focus should be on consumption rather than population. Fred Pearce, thank you very much indeed for joining us here on News Stream.</p><p/><p>And as we count down to the world population hitting the 7 billion mark, we are asking our ireporters to help us visualize that massive number. And we have already had submissions featuring grains of rice or steps on a very long hike. What can you come up with? You can submit your photos or videos to ireport.com and you may see them on CNN.</p><p/><p>Now Kenya's pursuit of Islamic militants in neighboring Somalia is taking a surprising twist. A Kenyan government official tells CNN that leaders of the al Shabaab militant group want to talk. Now Kenyan troops, they swept into Somalia earlier this month to hunt for al Shabaab fighters.</p><p/><p>Now Kenya blames al Shabaab for a string of kidnappings and attacks. And David McKenzie joins me now from Kenya's capital Nairobi.</p><p/><p>And David, they're saying they want to talk, but can al Shabaab be trusted?</p><p/><p>DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, al Shabaab said that it's not talking to the Kenyan government and they've threatened Kenya in fact. And I have to say that the government minister, the government spokesman Afred Mutua just had a press conference. He denied those reports.</p><p/><p>Though I did speak to a Kenyan government very close to this military operation. He said that well the al Shabaab doesn't have time to talk, because, quote, \"they're running for their lives.\" So certainly a contradictory statements coming from the Kenyan government.</p><p/><p>What is becoming apparently and clear is that operation to take on al Shabaab is a very complex operation and some people fear that it'll be a very difficult one indeed.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>MCKENZIE: Kenyan troops pushing into Somalia, part of a major offensive that took many by surprise. Their stated aim, to take al Shabaab head on.</p><p/><p>The al Qaeda linked militant group has threatened Kenya before. But a recent string of kidnappings here spurred the government into action.</p><p/><p>ALFRED MUTUA, KENYA GOVERNMENT SPOKESMAN: The al Shabaab group poses a clear and present danger, not only to Kenya and this region, but to the entire world. We do believe that the fight against terror cannot be won unless the power and the organization of al Shabaab is dismantled.</p><p/><p>MCKENZIE: Security analysts say that the incursion is a big risk. They point to recent history.</p><p/><p>America's infamous Blackhawk Down mission in the 90s, Ethiopia's U.S.- backed invasion which led to the rise of al Shabaab. And African Union's long and bloody campaign to control Mogadishu.</p><p/><p>RASHID ABDI, SOMALI ANALYST: If there's anything we have learned, you know, in the last couple of years is that foreign domination, especially military domination doesn't work in Somalia.</p><p/><p>MCKENZIE: Kenya's military officials say they want to push on to Kismayo, a key stronghold of al Shabaab.</p><p/><p>But the country's largely conventional army is being hampered by heavy rains, al Shabaab's ability to melt into the background.</p><p/><p>Kenya's key western allies, the U.S. and the UK, were quick to state that they will not give any assistance to this operation. But France says they will give some help.</p><p/><p>The decision to attack was the Kenyan government's alone, it seems. But many worry it will make this country less safe, not more.</p><p/><p>ABDI: You know, if the argument for going in to stop terrorism, the contrary is now the case. Al Shabaab will now have the pretense to strike Kenya.</p><p/><p>MCKENZIE: A series of grenade attacks this week, blamed on al Shabaab, has the country on edge. But the Kenyan government says it has stepped up security and that they have just one aim in Somalia.</p><p/><p>MUTUA: We don't want to go and get stuck in Somalia. When the United States, Ethiopia and others went there, they were trying to support an existing government. Our main objective is to just go in, dismantle the al Shabaab, and get out. So we are very clear objective.</p><p/><p>MCKENZIE: To take out al Shabaab?</p><p/><p>MUTUA: To take out al Shabaab.</p><p/><p>MCKENZIE: The government says that the operation should be over in a matter of months. Some fear that Kenya has stepped into a military quagmire that has haunted this continent for decades.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>MCKENZIE: Well, some latest news, Kristie, in the northeast of the country near Mandera (ph) on the border of Somalia apparently four people have been killed according to the police here in Kenya. Four people killed who were traveling a government officials who were carrying examination papers in a car. So it's unclear who caused that attack, but certainly worries here in Kenya the internal security as the army and the air force pushes into Somalia to take on al Shabaab -- Kristie.</p><p/><p>STOUT: Very fluid situation. Thank you for giving us the updates. David McKenzie joining us live from Nairobi. Thank you.</p><p/><p>Now China is calling for stricter control of social media sites to promote what it calls a healthy internet culture. And according to a communique from a Communist Party meeting, the central committee will, quote, strengthen guidance and administration of social internet services and regulate the orderly dissemination of information.</p><p/><p>Now this tightening, it came as a part of the government's crackdown on online rumors with special focus on the country's leading microblog Sina Weibo. And we have a lot more on this story for you on our blog. You can check it out, CNN.com/newsstream.</p><p/><p>Now just ahead here on News Stream, like all big tech companies, Google gets calls from governments to take down content. But which countries make the most of those requests? We'll dig into Google's transparency report.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>STOUT: Welcome back.</p><p/><p>Now Google and governments it's an interesting relationship. Now the tech giant has just released its latest transparency report. And its goal is to expose how governments around the world affect our access to information on the Internet. And you can find the report on Google's official blog.</p><p/><p>But here are a few countries that stood out. Now the first half of this year, Brazil made the most content removal requests followed by Germany, the U.S. and South Korea.</p><p/><p>Now joining me now to talk more about the report is News Stream regular Nicolas Thompson, senior editor of the New Yorker. And Nick, always good to see you. And you have trolled through this report. What were the highlights for you?</p><p/><p>NICK THOMPSON, NEW YORKER: There are all sort of interesting things. You can learn a lot about what a country's government cares about by what they've requested to be taken down.</p><p/><p>Some of the things that stuck out is that in Turkey there are all sorts of requests to take down videos on YouTube that showed information about officials' private lives. Google complied with all of those.</p><p/><p>In India, there are all sorts of requests to take down videos that show people insulting religious leaders. Because of India's local laws don't restrict that as much, Google didn't comply with those.</p><p/><p>In Thailand, there are lots of requests to take down videos that were insulting to the monarch. And Google did comply with those.</p><p/><p>The little bit that stuck out the most to me, there's a little nugget in the section on the United States. And it said there was a request to take down a video showing police brutality and another showing -- a request to take down a video showing defamation of a police officer. And then Google specifically says we didn't comply.</p><p/><p>Now why are they saying that? And I think it's partly to show Google's aim with this report is both to kind of poke the countries that have lots of requests and to make it clear that they are doing something their citizens might not agree with. And also to show that sometimes Google objects to this. And it's actually a particularly good time for Google to say that it's not taking down videos of police brutality in this country in the United States is becoming more of an issue. It makes Google look like more of a good guy.</p><p/><p>STOUT: Yeah, it's like Google in superhero mode. \"Don't be evil is the mantra here.\"</p><p/><p>And Google, interesting to know, it's the only internet company that releases this kind of information about its relationship with governments around the world. Do you think it will make a difference by doing so?</p><p/><p>THOMPSON: I think it does make a difference. I think it shows -- I mean, it makes a difference in the way we perceive Google, because it actually shows the import of Google. So when you think about the information that a society gets to see and that gets circulated, it partly depends on what its users feel free to put up, it partly depends on what its government objects to, and it partly depends on Google, right?</p><p/><p>Google has a bunch of people who make very important decisions about the information that can circulate in a society. We're moving into a world where tech companies have a lot of power in a cynic way that they didn't have before. And what's interesting about Google is it's being open about it. It's admitting to it. And it's giving us a lot of information about the choices it makes, so that we can judge those choices.</p><p/><p>STOUT: And while we're talking about Google, your thoughts on the buzz out there that Google has its eyes on a Yahoo takeover. Is it possible? What about the other rivals eying Yahoo? And what would it mean for Microsoft?</p><p/><p>THOMPSON: Well, I think -- I mean, I think that Google can't possibly take over Yahoo, or probably can't even take over a chunk of Yahoo. There's -- there's no way that U.S. regulators would allow the number one search company to take over the number two. It's preposterous. Google is already in all sorts of anti-trust problems at the moment.</p><p/><p>So there are some rumors circulating that Google must have leaked this in order to irritate Microsoft and to drive up the price. Google and Microsoft, they are forever at war with each other.</p><p/><p>I actually think it was probably somebody else who leaked this information. Google probably made some calls, but anybody who is a Yahoo shareholder is interested in a price being a high as possible. So they're interested in heated up the market as much as possible? So they're interested in floating as many rumors as possible.</p><p/><p>So I think Google probably made a call. It's not leading anywhere. And somebody whose got a financial interest and Yahoo made sure the press knew about it.</p><p/><p>STOUT: I love these high tech conspiracy theories.</p><p/><p>Nick Thompson, unfortunately we have to leave it at that. Thank you very much as always for joining us, every week, right here on News Stream.

The Texas Rangers could have become World Series champions on Wednesday, but the weather got in the way. And here is Pedro Pinto with more -- Pedro.</p><p/><p>PEDRO PINTO, CNN SPORTS CORREPSONDENT: Hey, Kristie. Heavy rain in St. Louis postponed last night's world series contest at Busch Stadium. Both teams are hoping the weather will clear up so they can actually go out there and play some baseball on Thursday.</p><p/><p>It was pretty miserable on Wednesday with officials calling the game off five hours before the first pitch was supposed to be thrown. The rain just didn't stop all day long.</p><p/><p>The Rangers lead the best of seven series three games to two with game 6 now set to be played on Thursday. The Rangers are looking for their first ever World Series title.</p><p/><p>Should the Cardinals stave off elimination, a deciding seventh game will be played on Friday. Both teams' managers said they welcome the rest that they weren't expecting. And they guarantee the players will be ready to go on Thursday.</p><p/><p>Now let's focus our attention on football. Al Sadd have qualified for the final of the Asian Champion's League for the first time since 1989. They did so by knocking out South Korea's Suwon Bluewings.</p><p/><p>The first leg of this tie in Suwon was marred by an ugly brawl. Fortunately, there were no such issues in Doha on Wednesday night. The Bluewings have lost the first leg at home 2-nil but they got back into the semifinal by taking an early lead.</p><p/><p>Great goal, it was as well, Oh Jang-Eun with a fantastic volley, definitely worth another look.</p><p/><p>The home side tried to reestablish their two goal lead in the tie and came close to doing so. Khalfan Ibrahim with the effort that was saved onto the crossbar by Jung Sung-Ryong.</p><p/><p>As time passed, the Bluewings knew they needed to force the issue. And Park Joon-Jin had a shot on target from close range right at the keeper, though.</p><p/><p>The match finished 1-nil Suwon. Not enough for the South Koreans. Al Sadd won 2-1 on aggregate. They'll face Jeonbuk in the final.</p><p/><p>Maria Sharapova has withdrawn from the WTA tour championships after suffering a recurrence of a recent ankle injury during her second match in Istanbul. This means she no longer has a chance to overtake Caroline Wozniaki for the world number one ranking.</p><p/><p>Sharapova made the announcement shortly after losing her second consecutive match on the hard courts of the Turkish capital. She went down to Li Na in straight sets.</p><p/><p>Is was an unexpected score, considering it was actually the Russian that had a 4-1 lead in the first set. Her opponent rebounded well and actually had the lead before Sharapova then forced a tiebreak.</p><p/><p>Again, the Russian had an advantage in the tiebreaker, but failed to hold on. Li Na winning the first set.</p><p/><p>In the second, the French Open champion was on top and managed to seal the deal in the 10th game. Leading 5-4 and serving for the match, she was down 15-40 before prevailing to finish off Sharapova in straight sets.</p><p/><p>Also on Wednesday, Caroline Wozniaki lost surprisingly to Victoria Zvonareva.</p><p/><p>That'll do it for now.

After nearly 11 hours of  talks, a deal on tackling EU debt was done.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Helpless in the face of rising floodwaters.  Thai authorities say all areas  of the capital will be flooded Thursday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And as Kenya fights armed gangs, it says they're launching raids across the  Somali border.  Now it seems al-Shabaab wants to talk.</p><p>Clearing the hurdles.  European leaders have achieved what many were  calling the unachievable.  After meeting well into the early hours on  Thursday morning, representatives from all 27 EU member countries finally  reached an agreement on handling Europe's debt crisis.</p><p>Now, here are some of the details, starting with Greece.</p><p>One of the toughest hurdles was striking a compromise with private  investors, but they finally agreed to take a 50 percent loss on Greek  bonds.  Now, that translates into roughly 100 billion euros and will help  significantly reduce Greece's debt load.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>HERMAN VAN ROMPUY, EUROPEAN COUNCIL PRESIDENT:  We want to put Greece on  track where, in 2020, it will have reduced its public debt to 120 percent  of GDP.  Since July, market conditions worsened.  The new program includes  an extra effort by the official sector, a new EU/IMF program of up to $100  billion will be put in place by the end of the year.  It also includes a  voluntary contribution by private creditors who had lent to Greece.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>STOUT:  The European Financial Stability Facility is also getting a boost,  and this bailout fund, it's being expanded from its initial rescue power of  440 billion euros, to one trillion euros, or about $1.4 trillion.  Now,  that will provide an extra buffer if Italy and Spain need emergency aid,  but European banks may be feeling the pressure.</p><p>And under the new deal, they must increase their core capital reserves to  nine percent.  Now, that is to protect against potential losses from future  write-downs or defaults.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JOSE MANUEL BARROSO, EUROPEAN COMMISSION PRESIDENT:  Let me emphasize that  our goal is to ensure banks maintain lending to the real economy.  The  national supervisor of authorities must work to make this happen; namely,  with the EBA.  And tonight's conclusions also make clear that -- I quote --  \"Banks should be subject to constraints regarding dissolution of dividends  and bond (ph) payments until recapitalization is complete,\" because  increased responsibility and a fair contribution of the financial sector is  also central to our approach.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>STOUT:  And as the European Union's two anchor economies, France and  Germany, each played a high-profile role in leading the negotiations to  this point.</p><p>And we have Jim Bittermann in Paris and Fred Pleitgen in Berlin with a look  at how Europeans are taking in the news.</p><p>Let's start in Berlin.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  I'm Fred Pleitgen, in  Berlin.</p><p>And at this early stage in the game, the Germans are very satisfied with  the compromise that was reached at the euro summit in Brussels.  However,  also, it still is far too early to tell what actual effect all of this is  going to have, what effect it's going to have on interest rates for loans  for people, but also what effect it could potentially have for economic  growth here in Germany.  And that's one of the main things that the Germans  are very worried about.  It's inflation and how all of this could affect  economic growth.</p><p>They're worried about their taxpayer dollars.  What's happened within the  crisis that's going on right now is that the Germans have already had to  slash their growth forecast for this year and for the coming year several  times.</p><p>When I talk to companies here in this country, they say they're slightly  worried about the future, but also, they say that right now, they feel that  the economy and their businesses are still fairly robust.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>JIM BITTERMANN, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  I'm Jim Bittermann,  in Paris.</p><p>The French have long loved to hate their banks.  So the fact that bankers  here will have to write off Greek debt and come up with more capital won't  displease anyone.  But there's deep skepticism here that the banks will  somehow find ways to pass along their new financial burdens on to their  customers with higher fees or interest rates.</p><p>President Sarkozy will appear on the two main television channels tonight  to talk about the resolution of the financial crisis.  He's almost certain  to reassure the citizenry, especially since he's up for reelection next  year, that they will not be paying for this.  However, one part of the  accord consumers will soon be paying for, little noticed in the agreement,  are measures to make governments more financially responsible in the  future.  And the French government is already talking about measures  including a new level of value-added tax to reduce its government spending.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>STOUT:  Now, China's foreign ministry spokeswoman says that Chinese  President Hu Jintao and French President Nicolas Sarkozy spoke by telephone  on Thursday.  She said the two discussed the global economy, as well as  next week's Group of 20 summit in France.  Mr. Sarkozy has publicly  expressed that his hope, that China will contribute to a fund that European  leaders are setting up.  </p><p>And Jiang Yu speaks for the Chinese Foreign Ministry.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JIANG YU, CHINESE FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESWOMAN (through translator):  The  Chinese side welcomes the EU summit consensus on the European crisis.  We  hope it will be conducive to lifting market (INAUDIBLE), promoting the  sustainable economic development of the EU and eurozone, and injecting  vitality into the European integration.  China is ready to work with the  international community to promote the stability in the international  financial market, and world economic recovery and growth.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>STOUT:  This deal has broader global implications to varying degrees.</p><p>Our Andrew Stevens, here in Hong Kong, has been following this story,  watching the early reaction.</p><p>But first, your thoughts on this deal?</p><p>ANDREW STEVENS, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR:  Well, I think the important  thing here is that there is a deal.</p><p>If you go back to the last weeks, months, years, even, we've been in  constant crisis mode.  We do now have a deal which has been signed to by  all the EU members.  </p><p>This is important, Kristie.  Is it the deal that draws the big, thick black  line under the whole euro crisis?  Probably not.  Research suggests that a  lot of people in the financial industry are saying this is a good step  forward.</p><p>What's so crucial here is that Greece, which we've been reporting for so  long now about the likelihood of a default, not paying its debts, that  default scenario now looks like at least it's been pushed right into the  background, because it's got $100 billion in debt relief.  This is a good  thing.</p><p>The ESFS -- this is the bailout fund -- it looks like it's going to be  lifted, as you were saying, to a trillion euros.  That's about $1.4  trillion.  This is also a very strong message to the markets that Europe is  prepared to put their money where their mouth is.  But -- and there's a big  \"but\" on this one -- is, where's the money going to come from?</p><p>The details, we don't know yet.  So how the mechanism of this crisis  finally works, we don't know, but certainly it's a big step in the right  direction.</p><p>STOUT:  You call it a strong message to the markets.  How are the markets  reacting?</p><p>(STOCK MARKET REPORT)</p><p>STOUT:  We have to talk about China next.  And the head of the European  bailout fund is heading to Beijing on Friday, presumably with cup in hand.</p><p>What is China's role?  Will China ride to the rescue?</p><p>STEVENS:  Good question.  I don't know about going with cup in hand.</p><p>What he wants to see is that ESFS I was telling you about, the bailout  fund.  Now, the Europeans would like this to be more of an international  effort.  And what would probably happen is the International Monetary Fund  would get involved.  So that would take in more money from countries like  India and China, specifically.</p><p>What would be the quid pro quo here?  What will China get out of this or  India?  Probably more voting rights in the IMF.  This is all speculation at  the moment.</p><p>And China is not going to be throwing money in willy-nilly, no doubt.  As  China has always done, it will drive a hard bargain on this if it needs to.</p><p>The other thing too, though, is it's in China's interest to see Europe  growing again.  I mean, it's such a huge export money.  So China is not  going to cut its nose off to spite its face.</p><p>Which brings me just to the final point, Kristie.  OK.  Crisis over, but  the longer issue now is, how does Europe return to growth?</p><p>And this is being masked -- this whole growth story is being masked by the  fact we've had a crisis.  We've now got underlying growth issues.  How does  Europe kick-start itself?  A lot of people talking about lower interest  rates from the European Central Bank fairly soon.</p><p>STOUT:  Europe is China's largest trading partner, isn't it?</p><p>STEVENS:  Of course, yes.</p><p>STOUT:  Andrew Stevens, thank you very much indeed.</p><p>Andrew Stevens there.</p><p>Now, the pressure that had been building in the run-up to this deal, it  appears to have gotten the better of some Italian lawmakers.  Check it out.</p><p>This was the scene in Italy's lower house of parliament on Wednesday.   Lawmakers had been debating pension reform when a brawl broke out,  reportedly over televised comments by the house speaker about a party  leader's wife.  After the brawl, parliament was briefly suspended.</p><p>Now, ahead here on NEWS STREAM, higher and higher.  The floodwaters just  keep on rising.  Can residents in Bangkok get out of their way in time?</p><p>Plus -- </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well, we're very disappointed that the NTC still hasn't  sent anybody down to Sirte to investigate.  And their failure to  investigate risks invoking the jurisdiction of the International Criminal  Court.  This is a war crime.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>STOUT:  -- gruesome discoveries in a Libyan city that became a battlefield.   What really happened in Sirte as revolutionary fighters ousted Gadhafi  loyalists?</p><p>And going after the Taliban on Twitter.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>STOUT:  Welcome back.</p><p>Now, it is a slow-moving crisis that is entering a critical new stage.   Residents of the sprawling city of Bangkok are being urged to flee as  floodwaters inundate houses, businesses and roads.  And these new aerials  show the extent of the flooding, which is mostly in the north of the city  right now.  And a huge runoff of water is expected to reach the Thai  capital this weekend, at the same time as seasonal high tides.</p><p>Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra now says that all of Bangkok will be  flooded by 10 centimeters and one meter of water.  And although most of  downtown Bangkok is still dry, there is now water on the grounds of the  Grand Palace.</p><p>And CNN's Sarah Sidner joins us live from Bangkok.</p><p>And Sara, first, could you describe the scene around you there?</p><p>SARA SIDNER, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Kristie, yes, we're standing  out in front of the Grand Palace, one of the most beautiful and adored  landmarks here in the city.  And what we're seeing are a couple of streets  that are starting to get flooded here.</p><p>We are now seeing that water come in to the inner parts of Bangkok, a great  concern for the citizens and great concern for Bangkok officials.  The  governor saying today, look, we can no longer stop this deluge of water  from coming into many parts of the city.</p><p>Now, earlier today, we were able to get an aerial view.  We went up in a  helicopter with the U.S. Navy and Marines, who have been doing daily  missions to try and ascertain exactly what is happening with the water,  where it's going, how quickly it is moving.  And again, what we're seeing  is this odd scenario where, you're not seeing necessarily water rushing in,  you're seeing waters creeping in.</p><p>But we've seen roads that are being swallowed by water.  We are seeing the  airport from now, an aerial view.  And this is the domestic airport, not  the international airport.  The international airport, still running.  The  domestic airport, though, closed.  And we're seeing more water ending up on  the runways there.</p><p>We also flew over an area that would normally be dry, and what you're  seeing is water, just kilometers and kilometers of water going there.  </p><p>You're also seeing factories inundated or surrounded by water.  We're  talking about factories like Toshiba, for example.  We're talking about  factories like Toyota.  And they are having difficulties now distributing  things.</p><p>So, making business areas very, very difficult.  Thousands of factories  either flooded or surrounded by water.</p><p>And, of course, the residents.  The residents having to deal with this.   Their houses flooded, their belongings ruined, their lives turned upside  down.</p><p>More than 300 people have lost their lives so far.  We're talking about  more than nine million people affected.  And more people will be affected  because we are waiting for the high tide, which is expected 5:00 (ph)  Bangkok time, and then another push on a Friday afternoon.</p><p>So, there is concern, of course, in this city.  And we are starting to see  some of the water.  You heard from the prime minister today, saying that 10  centimeters, somewhere around four inches, to up to a meter will be coming  in to almost all of this city.  And we are waiting to see exactly how high  the waters will go -- Kristie.</p><p>STOUT:  You know, Sara, what you're telling us is very, very alarming.  And  the scene behind you is absolutely amazing.  It looks like there is a lake  between you and the Grand Palace, and yet, just a moment ago, a bus just  went through the water right behind you.</p><p>So, to what extent is Bangkok in crisis mode?  To what extent is the city  thinking, we're going to get through this and everything's going to be OK?</p><p>SIDNER:  Yes, I think it's one of those things that no one can actually  predict.  Where is it going to get really high floodwaters, and where is it  just going to be like it is here?  Which is about a little less than a  foot, and so cars can still make their way, or buses can still make their  way through this area.</p><p>One thing we do know is that there is international help coming in.  And I  want to share with you what the U.S. says that it's now doing for Bangkok.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>KRISTIE KENNEY, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THAILAND:  Water pumps, water purifiers  like this, all of that sort of thing.  We have two helicopters that are  flying survey missions, telling people where the floodwaters are and aren't  with the Thai military.  We have the U.S. Marines, a humanitarian  assistance team on the ground.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SIDNER:  So we are seeing that, and we went with them today and we saw a  lot of the help that's being provided from outside and also from inside of  the country.  But again, the command center where the airport is, where  they've put people, they've had to sort of evacuate some of those people  because the water is starting to come in.  And this is really a wait and  watch situation, but we are starting to see water get further and further  into the city -- Kristie.</p><p>STOUT:  Sara Sidner, joining us live from Bangkok.</p><p>Many thanks indeed for that.</p><p>(WEATHER REPORT)</p><p>STOUT:  And coming up next here on NEWS STREAM, lingering questions about  apparent atrocities committed in Libya in the aftermath of civil war.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>STOUT:  Coming to you live from Hong Kong, you are back watching NEWS  STREAM.</p><p>Now, Human Rights Watch wants to know what happened to dozens of men whose  bodies have been found in and around the Libyan city of Sirte.  That's  where Moammar Gadhafi was captured and killed last week.</p><p>And Dan Rivers reports the city may have witnessed a bloodbath.  And we  warn you, some of the images you're about to see are disturbing.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>DAN RIVERS, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  As the dust  settles on the Libyan conflict, there are increasing questions about the  atrocities that appear to have been perpetrated by militia loyal to the  transitional government.  These are just some of the bodies found around  Moammar Gadhafi's convoy.  Some were killed in a battle as the former  dictator tried to flee, but some appear to have been executed as prisoners,  contrary to the Geneva Conventions.  </p><p>(on camera):  Plenty of evidence around here of other bodies here, some of  which Human Rights Watch claim were also executed.  They say there are 95  bodies in this area, and at least 10 of them have been shot at point-blank  range.  </p><p>(voice-over):  We witnessed this during the battle for Sirte, piles of  bodies with their hands bound behind their backs, shot through the head,  with no clear sense of who they were or who shot them.  The bodies lay here  for days without any revolutionary forces attempting to bury them.</p><p>But now Human Right Watch investigator Peter Bouckaert says he's found  clear evidence some of the victims were Gadhafi officials, and he is  concerned they may have been executed by revolutionary forces.  This is the  aftermath of a massacre at the Mahari Hotel in Sirte, 53 bodies with  evidence on the walls that this hotel was occupied by revolutionary  brigades before the people were killed.  </p><p>PETER BOUCKAERT, HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH:  We're very disappointed that the NTC  still hasn't sent anybody down to Sirte to investigate, and their failure  to investigate risks invoking the jurisdiction of the International  Criminal Court.  This is a war crime.  </p><p>RIVERS:  The transitional government has promised to bring those  responsible to justice.  </p><p>AHMED BANI, NTC MILITARY SPOKESMAN (through translator):  I assure you that  we will not turn a blind eye or forgive any crime that might have been  committed during this conflict.  </p><p>RIVERS:  But the true scale of the killing in Sirte is only now becoming  clear.  Some 300 bodies have been found so far, with no one from the  transitional government attempting to gather evidence before the bodies are  removed.  </p><p>Dan Rivers, CNN, Tripoli.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STOUT:  Now, Twitter is the newest battleground for coalition forces  fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan.  Our Errol Barnett reports on who may  be winning the online war of words.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>ERROL BARNETT, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Bullets,  bombs and tweets.  U.S. forces in Afghanistan, fearing they were losing the  information war to the Taliban, are now fighting back with Twitter, using  the Web site's short, 140-character messages to get out their side of the  story.</p><p>Here's a recent example of what the coalition forces call Taliban  propaganda.  A tweet from a Taliban spokesman who uses the Twitter name  ABalkhi reads, \"Mujahideen bring down U.S. helicopter in Kunar.\"  Well,  coalition forces fired back with their ISAF media Twitter account, \"We have  no reports of any missing helicopters.  Take any Taliban reports with a  block of salt.\" And later, this one, \"Reports of a shoot-down are false.\"  </p><p>The online war of words really started last month, with the Taliban attack  on the U.S. Embassy in Kabul.  Seven Afghan police officers and civilians  were killed, along with six insurgents.  But even before the 20-hour gun  battle was over, the tweets were flying.</p><p>ISAF media sending this: \"The outcome is inevitable.  The question is, how  much longer will terrorists put innocent Afghans in harm's way?\"</p><p>ABalkhi fired back in tech speak, \"I don't know.  You have been putting  them in harm's way for the past 10 years, razed whole villages and markets,  and still have the nerve to talk about harm's way.\"</p><p>ISAF media then responded, \"Really?  UNAMA reported 80 percent of civilian  casualties are caused by insurgent (as in your) activities.\"</p><p>With 14,000 followers on its Twitter account, ISAF media may have the  advantage here over Taliban spokesman ABalkhi, who has just 1,700  followers.  But a coalition spokesman acknowledges that this war of words  is far from over.</p><p>For CNN, I'm Errol Barnett.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>STOUT:  Now, ahead on NEWS STREAM, the world's population clock is ticking  closer and closer to the seven billion mark.</p><p>Plus, the fight against terrorism in Africa takes a new twist between two  tense numbers.  We'll have a live report from Kenya.</p><p>And what governments are asking Google to keep you from finding.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>STOUT:  I'm Kristie Lu Stout in Hong Kong.  You're watching News Stream.   And these are your world headlines.</p><p>Now European Union leaders have announced a deal to tackle the EuroZone's  debt crisis.  And the plan has three main elements.  Private banks have  agreed to write down the value of their holdings of Greek debt by 50  percent, European banks will boost their core capital reserves, and the EU  will leverage its bailout fund to give it an effective strength of $1.4  trillion.</p><p>Now people in Bangkok are being urged to flee as the flood stricken Thai  capital braces for its highest water levels yet.  Thailand's prime minister  says all districts of Bangkok will be flooded with some areas seeing water  as high as one meter.  Now the floods in Thailand have killed 373 people  and affected more than 9.5 million.</p><p>Now the death toll from Sunday's massive earthquake in eastern Turkey has  now risen to 534, that's according to Turkish officials.  There were  reports of another earthquake earlier on Thursday near the border with  Iraq, but there are no reports of any casualties from that 5.2 magnitude  tremor.</p><p>Now one of the largest populations on the planet is celebrating Diwali this  week, the festival of lights.  Like these people visiting the market in the  Indian city Amedabot (ph) had the celebrations.</p><p>Now the population of India, it stands at 1.21 billion right now.  And by  the year 2030 it is projected that India will become the world's most  populous nation.  And by next week, according to the UN, the global  population will reach 7 billion.</p><p>No one really knows for sure, but the Population Reference Bureau says that  nearly 108 billion people have been born throughout history.  That means  about 6 percent of all the people who were ever born are alive today.</p><p>And all this week, News Stream is examining the issues raised by world  population growth.  And my guest today is Fred Pearce.  He's a journalist  and environmental and development consultant.  And his latest book, it's  called \"People Quake,\" he says the world population is peaking and will  soon start to decline.  And what's more, he argues that Earth, our planet,  it could meet the needs of a larger population if some people consumed less  and natural resources were shared more equally.</p><p>Fred Pearce joins me now live from our London studio.</p><p>And Fred, thank you for joining us.  And we are counting down to 7 billion.   How worried should we be?</p><p>FRED PEARCE, AUTHOR:  I think we should be worried in the short-term.  It's  a lot of extra people that we're having every year.  But the good news is  that we can, I think, look forward to peak population something about the  middle of this century.  I think we'll go from about 7 billion now to  perhaps 9 billion, perhaps a little more.</p><p>But family sizes -- the good news is that family sizes are coming down so  fast that we can look forward to peak population, and maybe decline after  that.  The average woman today has 2.5 children.  That's half as many as  her mother and her grandmother had.  We used to get up at five and six.</p><p>So fertility levels are coming down really remarkably fast.  And if they  carry on down as they have (inaudible) already.  And we can see good news  ahead.  We can see light at the end of the tunnel.</p><p>STOUT:  You know, it's interesting that you're saying that the population  is peaking, because it was just yesterday the United Nations released this  report and said by the end of the century the world's total population  could rise to more than 10 billion.  So what are your thoughts on that?  Is  the population rising, or is it peaking?</p><p>PEARCE:  Well it's certainly rising.  The peak is to come.  I think most  people will agree that by mid-century we'll be at about 9 billion.  The  question is what happens after that.  And the UN has very wide error bars  on its projections.  So nobody really knows.</p><p>But the evidence is that fertility rates are coming down so fast, people  are -- you know many countries have half the number of children that their  women were having in a generation.  Much of India is now down to 2 children  per woman, many parts of Asia even lower.  So if Africa follows that path,  then by mid-century I think we will see peak population.</p><p>Absolutely nobody knows for sure.  And there are big concerns about how  African -- how Africa, for instance, can cope with a doubling of its  numbers in the next few decades.  But we can look forward, I think, with a  sort of optimistic hope that we can see peak population.  And that would  help to solve an awful lot of global environmental problems, not least  climate change.</p><p>STOUT:  Now in the near-term, we are nearing the 7 billionth person on the  planet.  Right now, especially looking at consumption habits that are out  there, can earth handle that?</p><p>PEARCE:  I -- the way we consume now I don't think it can.  I think we're  already over the limit if everybody wants to live a western style of life  and to produce what we need in the western way of doing it.  We're going to  have to change anyway.</p><p>But the way I look at it, we are diffusing the population bomb.  The  world's population isn't going to double again as its doubled in the last  40 years.  We're diffusing the population bomb, but we haven't begun to  diffuse the consumption bomb, that's where the real issues I think are now.   How we produce our energy, whether we can recycle those scarce metals,  whether we can preserve our soils.</p><p>We know we can feed 10 billion people.  We're already producing enough food  for that.  We just don't know how to distribute it and get it to the people  who are hungry.  So there is hope out there.  We're not up against a sort  of doom's day scenario, but we do have to get things right.  We do have to  manage our planet's resources much more efficiently.</p><p>But if we do that than I do believe that the 8, 9, even 10 billion people  that we might have by the end of the century we can give them a good life.</p><p>STOUT:  So our focus should be on consumption rather than population.  Fred  Pearce, thank you very much indeed for joining us here on News Stream.</p><p>And as we count down to the world population hitting the 7 billion mark, we  are asking our ireporters to help us visualize that massive number.  And we  have already had submissions featuring grains of rice or steps on a very  long hike.  What can you come up with?  You can submit your photos or  videos to ireport.com and you may see them on CNN.</p><p>Now Kenya's pursuit of Islamic militants in neighboring Somalia is taking a  surprising twist.  A Kenyan government official tells CNN that leaders of  the al Shabaab militant group want to talk.  Now Kenyan troops, they swept  into Somalia earlier this month to hunt for al Shabaab fighters.</p><p>Now Kenya blames al Shabaab for a string of kidnappings and attacks.  And  David McKenzie joins me now from Kenya's capital Nairobi.</p><p>And David, they're saying they want to talk, but can al Shabaab be trusted?</p><p>DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, al Shabaab said  that it's not talking to the Kenyan government and they've threatened Kenya  in fact.  And I have to say that the government minister, the government  spokesman Afred Mutua just had a press conference.  He denied those  reports.</p><p>Though I did speak to a Kenyan government very close to this military  operation.  He said that well the al Shabaab doesn't have time to talk,  because, quote, \"they're running for their lives.\"  So certainly a  contradictory statements coming from the Kenyan government.</p><p>What is becoming apparently and clear is that operation to take on al  Shabaab is a very complex operation and some people fear that it'll be a  very difficult one indeed.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCKENZIE:  Kenyan troops pushing into Somalia, part of a major offensive  that took many by surprise.  Their stated aim, to take al Shabaab head on.</p><p>The al Qaeda linked militant group has threatened Kenya before.  But a  recent string of kidnappings here spurred the government into action.</p><p>ALFRED MUTUA, KENYA GOVERNMENT SPOKESMAN:  The al Shabaab group poses a  clear and present danger, not only to Kenya and this region, but to the  entire world.  We do believe that the fight against terror cannot be won  unless the power and the organization of al Shabaab is dismantled.</p><p>MCKENZIE:  Security analysts say that the incursion is a big risk.  They  point to recent history.</p><p>America's infamous Blackhawk Down mission in the 90s, Ethiopia's U.S.- backed invasion which led to the rise of al Shabaab.  And African Union's  long and bloody campaign to control Mogadishu.</p><p>RASHID ABDI, SOMALI ANALYST:  If there's anything we have learned, you  know, in the last couple of years is that foreign domination, especially  military domination doesn't work in Somalia.</p><p>MCKENZIE:  Kenya's military officials say they want to push on to Kismayo,  a key stronghold of al Shabaab.  </p><p>But the country's largely conventional army is being hampered by heavy  rains, al Shabaab's ability to melt into the background.</p><p>Kenya's key western allies, the U.S. and the UK, were quick to state that  they will not give any assistance to this operation.  But France says they  will give some help.</p><p>The decision to attack was the Kenyan government's alone, it seems.  But  many worry it will make this country less safe, not more.</p><p>ABDI:  You know, if the argument for going in to stop terrorism, the  contrary is now the case.  Al Shabaab will now have the pretense to strike  Kenya.</p><p>MCKENZIE:  A series of grenade attacks this week, blamed on al Shabaab, has  the country on edge.  But the Kenyan government says it has stepped up  security and that they have just one aim in Somalia.</p><p>MUTUA:  We don't want to go and get stuck in Somalia.  When the United  States, Ethiopia and others went there, they were trying to support an  existing government.  Our main objective is to just go in, dismantle the al  Shabaab, and get out.  So we are very clear objective.</p><p>MCKENZIE:  To take out al Shabaab?</p><p>MUTUA:  To take out al Shabaab.</p><p>MCKENZIE:  The government says that the operation should be over in a  matter of months.  Some fear that Kenya has stepped into a military  quagmire that has haunted this continent for decades.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCKENZIE:  Well, some latest news, Kristie, in the northeast of the country  near Mandera (ph) on the border of Somalia apparently four people have been  killed according to the police here in Kenya.  Four people killed who were  traveling a government officials who were carrying examination papers in a  car.  So it's unclear who caused that attack, but certainly worries here in  Kenya the internal security as the army and the air force pushes into  Somalia to take on al Shabaab -- Kristie.</p><p>STOUT:  Very fluid situation.  Thank you for giving us the updates.  David  McKenzie joining us live from Nairobi.  Thank you.</p><p>Now China is calling for stricter control of social media sites to promote  what it calls a healthy internet culture.  And according to a communique  from a Communist Party meeting, the central committee will, quote,  strengthen guidance and administration of social internet services and  regulate the orderly dissemination of information.</p><p>Now this tightening, it came as a part of the government's crackdown on  online rumors with special focus on the country's leading microblog Sina  Weibo.  And we have a lot more on this story for you on our blog.  You can  check it out, CNN.com/newsstream.</p><p>Now just ahead here on News Stream, like all big tech companies, Google  gets calls from governments to take down content.  But which countries make  the most of those requests?  We'll dig into Google's transparency report.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>STOUT:  Welcome back.</p><p>Now Google and governments it's an interesting relationship.  Now the tech  giant has just released its latest transparency report.  And its goal is to  expose how governments around the world affect our access to information on  the Internet.  And you can find the report on Google's official blog.</p><p>But here are a few countries that stood out.  Now the first half of this  year, Brazil made the most content removal requests followed by Germany,  the U.S. and South Korea.</p><p>Now joining me now to talk more about the report is News Stream regular  Nicolas Thompson, senior editor of the New Yorker.  And Nick, always good  to see you.  And you have trolled through this report.  What were the  highlights for you?</p><p>NICK THOMPSON, NEW YORKER:  There are all sort of interesting things.  You  can learn a lot about what a country's government cares about by what  they've requested to be taken down.</p><p>Some of the things that stuck out is that in Turkey there are all sorts of  requests to take down videos on YouTube that showed information about  officials' private lives.  Google complied with all of those.</p><p>In India, there are all sorts of requests to take down videos that show  people insulting religious leaders.  Because of India's local laws don't  restrict that as much, Google didn't comply with those.</p><p>In Thailand, there are lots of requests to take down videos that were  insulting to the monarch.  And Google did comply with those.</p><p>The little bit that stuck out the most to me, there's a little nugget in  the section on the United States.  And it said there was a request to take  down a video showing police brutality and another showing -- a request to  take down a video showing defamation of a police officer.  And then Google  specifically says we didn't comply.</p><p>Now why are they saying that?  And I think it's partly to show Google's aim  with this report is both to kind of poke the countries that have lots of  requests and to make it clear that they are doing something their citizens  might not agree with.  And also to show that sometimes Google objects to  this.  And it's actually a particularly good time for Google to say that  it's not taking down videos of police brutality in this country in the  United States is becoming more of an issue.  It makes Google look like more  of a good guy.</p><p>STOUT:  Yeah, it's like Google in superhero mode.  \"Don't be evil is the  mantra here.\"</p><p>And Google, interesting to know, it's the only internet company that  releases this kind of information about its relationship with governments  around the world.  Do you think it will make a difference by doing so?</p><p>THOMPSON:  I think it does make a difference.  I think it shows -- I mean,  it makes a difference in the way we perceive Google, because it actually  shows the import of Google.  So when you think about the information that a  society gets to see and that gets circulated, it partly depends on what its  users feel free to put up, it partly depends on what its government objects  to, and it partly depends on Google, right?</p><p>Google has a bunch of people who make very important decisions about the  information that can circulate in a society.  We're moving into a world  where tech companies have a lot of power in a cynic way that they didn't  have before.  And what's interesting about Google is it's being open about  it.  It's admitting to it.  And it's giving us a lot of information about  the choices it makes, so that we can judge those choices.</p><p>STOUT:  And while we're talking about Google, your thoughts on the buzz out  there that Google has its eyes on a Yahoo takeover.  Is it possible?  What  about the other rivals eying Yahoo?  And what would it mean for Microsoft?</p><p>THOMPSON:  Well, I think -- I mean, I think that Google can't possibly take  over Yahoo, or probably can't even take over a chunk of Yahoo.  There's --  there's no way that U.S. regulators would allow the number one search  company to take over the number two.  It's preposterous.  Google is already  in all sorts of anti-trust problems at the moment.</p><p>So there are some rumors circulating that Google must have leaked this in  order to irritate Microsoft and to drive up the price.  Google and  Microsoft, they are forever at war with each other.</p><p>I actually think it was probably somebody else who leaked this information.   Google probably made some calls, but anybody who is a Yahoo shareholder is  interested in a price being a high as possible.  So they're interested in  heated up the market as much as possible?  So they're interested in  floating as many rumors as possible.</p><p>So I think Google probably made a call.  It's not leading anywhere.  And  somebody whose got a financial interest and Yahoo made sure the press knew  about it.</p><p>STOUT:  I love these high tech conspiracy theories.</p><p>Nick Thompson, unfortunately we have to leave it at that.  Thank you very  much as always for joining us, every week, right here on News Stream.

The Texas Rangers could have become  World Series champions on Wednesday, but the weather got in the way.  And  here is Pedro Pinto with more -- Pedro.</p><p>PEDRO PINTO, CNN SPORTS CORREPSONDENT:  Hey, Kristie.  Heavy rain in St.  Louis postponed last night's world series contest at Busch Stadium.  Both  teams are hoping the weather will clear up so they can actually go out  there and play some baseball on Thursday.</p><p>It was pretty miserable on Wednesday with officials calling the game off  five hours before the first pitch was supposed to be thrown.  The rain just  didn't stop all day long.</p><p>The Rangers lead the best of seven series three games to two with game 6  now set to be played on Thursday.  The Rangers are looking for their first  ever World Series title.</p><p>Should the Cardinals stave off elimination, a deciding seventh game will be  played on Friday.  Both teams' managers said they welcome the rest that  they weren't expecting.  And they guarantee the players will be ready to go  on Thursday.</p><p>Now let's focus our attention on football.  Al Sadd have qualified for the  final of the Asian Champion's League for the first time since 1989.  They  did so by knocking out South Korea's Suwon Bluewings.</p><p>The first leg of this tie in Suwon was marred by an ugly brawl.   Fortunately, there were no such issues in Doha on Wednesday night.  The  Bluewings have lost the first leg at home 2-nil but they got back into the  semifinal by taking an early lead.</p><p>Great goal, it was as well, Oh Jang-Eun with a fantastic volley, definitely  worth another look.</p><p>The home side tried to reestablish their two goal lead in the tie and came  close to doing so.  Khalfan Ibrahim with the effort that was saved onto the  crossbar by Jung Sung-Ryong.</p><p>As time passed, the Bluewings knew they needed to force the issue.  And   Park Joon-Jin had a shot on target from close range right at the keeper,  though.</p><p>The match finished 1-nil Suwon.  Not enough for the South Koreans.  Al Sadd  won 2-1 on aggregate. They'll face Jeonbuk in the final.</p><p>Maria Sharapova has withdrawn from the WTA tour championships after  suffering a recurrence of a recent ankle injury during her second match in  Istanbul.  This means she no longer has a chance to overtake Caroline  Wozniaki for the world number one ranking.</p><p>Sharapova made the announcement shortly after losing her second consecutive  match on the hard courts of the Turkish capital.  She went down to Li Na in  straight sets.</p><p>Is was an unexpected score, considering it was actually the Russian that  had a 4-1 lead in the first set.  Her opponent rebounded well and actually  had the lead before Sharapova then forced a tiebreak.</p><p>Again, the Russian had an advantage in the tiebreaker, but failed to hold  on.  Li Na winning the first set.</p><p>In the second, the French Open champion was on top and managed to seal the  deal in the 10th game.  Leading 5-4 and serving for the match, she was down  15-40 before prevailing to finish off Sharapova in straight sets.</p><p>Also on Wednesday, Caroline Wozniaki lost surprisingly to Victoria  Zvonareva.</p><p>That'll do it for now.

After nearly 11 hours of talks, a deal on tackling EU debt was done.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Helpless in the face of rising floodwaters. Thai authorities say all areas of the capital will be flooded Thursday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And as Kenya fights armed gangs, it says they're launching raids across the Somali border. Now it seems al-Shabaab wants to talk.</p><p>Clearing the hurdles. European leaders have achieved what many were calling the unachievable. After meeting well into the early hours on Thursday morning, representatives from all 27 EU member countries finally reached an agreement on handling Europe's debt crisis.</p><p>Now, here are some of the details, starting with Greece.</p><p>One of the toughest hurdles was striking a compromise with private investors, but they finally agreed to take a 50 percent loss on Greek bonds. Now, that translates into roughly 100 billion euros and will help significantly reduce Greece's debt load.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERMAN VAN ROMPUY, EUROPEAN COUNCIL PRESIDENT: We want to put Greece on track where, in 2020, it will have reduced its public debt to 120 percent of GDP. Since July, market conditions worsened. The new program includes an extra effort by the official sector, a new EU/IMF program of up to $100 billion will be put in place by the end of the year. It also includes a voluntary contribution by private creditors who had lent to Greece.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STOUT: The European Financial Stability Facility is also getting a boost, and this bailout fund, it's being expanded from its initial rescue power of 440 billion euros, to one trillion euros, or about $1.4 trillion. Now, that will provide an extra buffer if Italy and Spain need emergency aid, but European banks may be feeling the pressure.</p><p>And under the new deal, they must increase their core capital reserves to nine percent. Now, that is to protect against potential losses from future write-downs or defaults.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOSE MANUEL BARROSO, EUROPEAN COMMISSION PRESIDENT: Let me emphasize that our goal is to ensure banks maintain lending to the real economy. The national supervisor of authorities must work to make this happen; namely, with the EBA. And tonight's conclusions also make clear that -- I quote -- \"Banks should be subject to constraints regarding dissolution of dividends and bond (ph) payments until recapitalization is complete,\" because increased responsibility and a fair contribution of the financial sector is also central to our approach.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STOUT: And as the European Union's two anchor economies, France and Germany, each played a high-profile role in leading the negotiations to this point.</p><p>And we have Jim Bittermann in Paris and Fred Pleitgen in Berlin with a look at how Europeans are taking in the news.</p><p>Let's start in Berlin.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: I'm Fred Pleitgen, in Berlin.</p><p>And at this early stage in the game, the Germans are very satisfied with the compromise that was reached at the euro summit in Brussels. However, also, it still is far too early to tell what actual effect all of this is going to have, what effect it's going to have on interest rates for loans for people, but also what effect it could potentially have for economic growth here in Germany. And that's one of the main things that the Germans are very worried about. It's inflation and how all of this could affect economic growth.</p><p>They're worried about their taxpayer dollars. What's happened within the crisis that's going on right now is that the Germans have already had to slash their growth forecast for this year and for the coming year several times.</p><p>When I talk to companies here in this country, they say they're slightly worried about the future, but also, they say that right now, they feel that the economy and their businesses are still fairly robust.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JIM BITTERMANN, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: I'm Jim Bittermann, in Paris.</p><p>The French have long loved to hate their banks. So the fact that bankers here will have to write off Greek debt and come up with more capital won't displease anyone. But there's deep skepticism here that the banks will somehow find ways to pass along their new financial burdens on to their customers with higher fees or interest rates.</p><p>President Sarkozy will appear on the two main television channels tonight to talk about the resolution of the financial crisis. He's almost certain to reassure the citizenry, especially since he's up for reelection next year, that they will not be paying for this. However, one part of the accord consumers will soon be paying for, little noticed in the agreement, are measures to make governments more financially responsible in the future. And the French government is already talking about measures including a new level of value-added tax to reduce its government spending.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STOUT: Now, China's foreign ministry spokeswoman says that Chinese President Hu Jintao and French President Nicolas Sarkozy spoke by telephone on Thursday. She said the two discussed the global economy, as well as next week's Group of 20 summit in France. Mr. Sarkozy has publicly expressed that his hope, that China will contribute to a fund that European leaders are setting up.</p><p>And Jiang Yu speaks for the Chinese Foreign Ministry.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JIANG YU, CHINESE FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESWOMAN (through translator): The Chinese side welcomes the EU summit consensus on the European crisis. We hope it will be conducive to lifting market (INAUDIBLE), promoting the sustainable economic development of the EU and eurozone, and injecting vitality into the European integration. China is ready to work with the international community to promote the stability in the international financial market, and world economic recovery and growth.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STOUT: This deal has broader global implications to varying degrees.</p><p>Our Andrew Stevens, here in Hong Kong, has been following this story, watching the early reaction.</p><p>But first, your thoughts on this deal?</p><p>ANDREW STEVENS, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: Well, I think the important thing here is that there is a deal.</p><p>If you go back to the last weeks, months, years, even, we've been in constant crisis mode. We do now have a deal which has been signed to by all the EU members.</p><p>This is important, Kristie. Is it the deal that draws the big, thick black line under the whole euro crisis? Probably not. Research suggests that a lot of people in the financial industry are saying this is a good step forward.</p><p>What's so crucial here is that Greece, which we've been reporting for so long now about the likelihood of a default, not paying its debts, that default scenario now looks like at least it's been pushed right into the background, because it's got $100 billion in debt relief. This is a good thing.</p><p>The ESFS -- this is the bailout fund -- it looks like it's going to be lifted, as you were saying, to a trillion euros. That's about $1.4 trillion. This is also a very strong message to the markets that Europe is prepared to put their money where their mouth is. But -- and there's a big \"but\" on this one -- is, where's the money going to come from?</p><p>The details, we don't know yet. So how the mechanism of this crisis finally works, we don't know, but certainly it's a big step in the right direction.</p><p>STOUT: You call it a strong message to the markets. How are the markets reacting?</p><p>(STOCK MARKET REPORT)</p><p>STOUT: We have to talk about China next. And the head of the European bailout fund is heading to Beijing on Friday, presumably with cup in hand.</p><p>What is China's role? Will China ride to the rescue?</p><p>STEVENS: Good question. I don't know about going with cup in hand.</p><p>What he wants to see is that ESFS I was telling you about, the bailout fund. Now, the Europeans would like this to be more of an international effort. And what would probably happen is the International Monetary Fund would get involved. So that would take in more money from countries like India and China, specifically.</p><p>What would be the quid pro quo here? What will China get out of this or India? Probably more voting rights in the IMF. This is all speculation at the moment.</p><p>And China is not going to be throwing money in willy-nilly, no doubt. As China has always done, it will drive a hard bargain on this if it needs to.</p><p>The other thing too, though, is it's in China's interest to see Europe growing again. I mean, it's such a huge export money. So China is not going to cut its nose off to spite its face.</p><p>Which brings me just to the final point, Kristie. OK. Crisis over, but the longer issue now is, how does Europe return to growth?</p><p>And this is being masked -- this whole growth story is being masked by the fact we've had a crisis. We've now got underlying growth issues. How does Europe kick-start itself? A lot of people talking about lower interest rates from the European Central Bank fairly soon.</p><p>STOUT: Europe is China's largest trading partner, isn't it?</p><p>STEVENS: Of course, yes.</p><p>STOUT: Andrew Stevens, thank you very much indeed.</p><p>Andrew Stevens there.</p><p>Now, the pressure that had been building in the run-up to this deal, it appears to have gotten the better of some Italian lawmakers. Check it out.</p><p>This was the scene in Italy's lower house of parliament on Wednesday. Lawmakers had been debating pension reform when a brawl broke out, reportedly over televised comments by the house speaker about a party leader's wife. After the brawl, parliament was briefly suspended.</p><p>Now, ahead here on NEWS STREAM, higher and higher. The floodwaters just keep on rising. Can residents in Bangkok get out of their way in time?</p><p>Plus --</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, we're very disappointed that the NTC still hasn't sent anybody down to Sirte to investigate. And their failure to investigate risks invoking the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court. This is a war crime.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STOUT: -- gruesome discoveries in a Libyan city that became a battlefield. What really happened in Sirte as revolutionary fighters ousted Gadhafi loyalists?</p><p>And going after the Taliban on Twitter.</p><p>STOUT: Welcome back.</p><p>Now, it is a slow-moving crisis that is entering a critical new stage. Residents of the sprawling city of Bangkok are being urged to flee as floodwaters inundate houses, businesses and roads. And these new aerials show the extent of the flooding, which is mostly in the north of the city right now. And a huge runoff of water is expected to reach the Thai capital this weekend, at the same time as seasonal high tides.</p><p>Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra now says that all of Bangkok will be flooded by 10 centimeters and one meter of water. And although most of downtown Bangkok is still dry, there is now water on the grounds of the Grand Palace.</p><p>And CNN's Sarah Sidner joins us live from Bangkok.</p><p>And Sara, first, could you describe the scene around you there?</p><p>SARA SIDNER, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Kristie, yes, we're standing out in front of the Grand Palace, one of the most beautiful and adored landmarks here in the city. And what we're seeing are a couple of streets that are starting to get flooded here.</p><p>We are now seeing that water come in to the inner parts of Bangkok, a great concern for the citizens and great concern for Bangkok officials. The governor saying today, look, we can no longer stop this deluge of water from coming into many parts of the city.</p><p>Now, earlier today, we were able to get an aerial view. We went up in a helicopter with the U.S. Navy and Marines, who have been doing daily missions to try and ascertain exactly what is happening with the water, where it's going, how quickly it is moving. And again, what we're seeing is this odd scenario where, you're not seeing necessarily water rushing in, you're seeing waters creeping in.</p><p>But we've seen roads that are being swallowed by water. We are seeing the airport from now, an aerial view. And this is the domestic airport, not the international airport. The international airport, still running. The domestic airport, though, closed. And we're seeing more water ending up on the runways there.</p><p>We also flew over an area that would normally be dry, and what you're seeing is water, just kilometers and kilometers of water going there.</p><p>You're also seeing factories inundated or surrounded by water. We're talking about factories like Toshiba, for example. We're talking about factories like Toyota. And they are having difficulties now distributing things.</p><p>So, making business areas very, very difficult. Thousands of factories either flooded or surrounded by water.</p><p>And, of course, the residents. The residents having to deal with this. Their houses flooded, their belongings ruined, their lives turned upside down.</p><p>More than 300 people have lost their lives so far. We're talking about more than nine million people affected. And more people will be affected because we are waiting for the high tide, which is expected 5:00 (ph) Bangkok time, and then another push on a Friday afternoon.</p><p>So, there is concern, of course, in this city. And we are starting to see some of the water. You heard from the prime minister today, saying that 10 centimeters, somewhere around four inches, to up to a meter will be coming in to almost all of this city. And we are waiting to see exactly how high the waters will go -- Kristie.</p><p>STOUT: You know, Sara, what you're telling us is very, very alarming. And the scene behind you is absolutely amazing. It looks like there is a lake between you and the Grand Palace, and yet, just a moment ago, a bus just went through the water right behind you.</p><p>So, to what extent is Bangkok in crisis mode? To what extent is the city thinking, we're going to get through this and everything's going to be OK?</p><p>SIDNER: Yes, I think it's one of those things that no one can actually predict. Where is it going to get really high floodwaters, and where is it just going to be like it is here? Which is about a little less than a foot, and so cars can still make their way, or buses can still make their way through this area.</p><p>One thing we do know is that there is international help coming in. And I want to share with you what the U.S. says that it's now doing for Bangkok.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KRISTIE KENNEY, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THAILAND: Water pumps, water purifiers like this, all of that sort of thing. We have two helicopters that are flying survey missions, telling people where the floodwaters are and aren't with the Thai military. We have the U.S. Marines, a humanitarian assistance team on the ground.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIDNER: So we are seeing that, and we went with them today and we saw a lot of the help that's being provided from outside and also from inside of the country. But again, the command center where the airport is, where they've put people, they've had to sort of evacuate some of those people because the water is starting to come in. And this is really a wait and watch situation, but we are starting to see water get further and further into the city -- Kristie.</p><p>STOUT: Sara Sidner, joining us live from Bangkok.</p><p>Many thanks indeed for that.</p><p>(WEATHER REPORT)</p><p>STOUT: And coming up next here on NEWS STREAM, lingering questions about apparent atrocities committed in Libya in the aftermath of civil war.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>STOUT: Coming to you live from Hong Kong, you are back watching NEWS STREAM.</p><p>Now, Human Rights Watch wants to know what happened to dozens of men whose bodies have been found in and around the Libyan city of Sirte. That's where Moammar Gadhafi was captured and killed last week.</p><p>And Dan Rivers reports the city may have witnessed a bloodbath. And we warn you, some of the images you're about to see are disturbing.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DAN RIVERS, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): As the dust settles on the Libyan conflict, there are increasing questions about the atrocities that appear to have been perpetrated by militia loyal to the transitional government. These are just some of the bodies found around Moammar Gadhafi's convoy. Some were killed in a battle as the former dictator tried to flee, but some appear to have been executed as prisoners, contrary to the Geneva Conventions.</p><p>(on camera): Plenty of evidence around here of other bodies here, some of which Human Rights Watch claim were also executed. They say there are 95 bodies in this area, and at least 10 of them have been shot at point-blank range.</p><p>(voice-over): We witnessed this during the battle for Sirte, piles of bodies with their hands bound behind their backs, shot through the head, with no clear sense of who they were or who shot them. The bodies lay here for days without any revolutionary forces attempting to bury them.</p><p>But now Human Right Watch investigator Peter Bouckaert says he's found clear evidence some of the victims were Gadhafi officials, and he is concerned they may have been executed by revolutionary forces. This is the aftermath of a massacre at the Mahari Hotel in Sirte, 53 bodies with evidence on the walls that this hotel was occupied by revolutionary brigades before the people were killed.</p><p>PETER BOUCKAERT, HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH: We're very disappointed that the NTC still hasn't sent anybody down to Sirte to investigate, and their failure to investigate risks invoking the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court. This is a war crime.</p><p>RIVERS: The transitional government has promised to bring those responsible to justice.</p><p>AHMED BANI, NTC MILITARY SPOKESMAN (through translator): I assure you that we will not turn a blind eye or forgive any crime that might have been committed during this conflict.</p><p>RIVERS: But the true scale of the killing in Sirte is only now becoming clear. Some 300 bodies have been found so far, with no one from the transitional government attempting to gather evidence before the bodies are removed.</p><p>Dan Rivers, CNN, Tripoli.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STOUT: Now, Twitter is the newest battleground for coalition forces fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan. Our Errol Barnett reports on who may be winning the online war of words.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ERROL BARNETT, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Bullets, bombs and tweets. U.S. forces in Afghanistan, fearing they were losing the information war to the Taliban, are now fighting back with Twitter, using the Web site's short, 140-character messages to get out their side of the story.</p><p>Here's a recent example of what the coalition forces call Taliban propaganda. A tweet from a Taliban spokesman who uses the Twitter name ABalkhi reads, \"Mujahideen bring down U.S. helicopter in Kunar.\" Well, coalition forces fired back with their ISAF media Twitter account, \"We have no reports of any missing helicopters. Take any Taliban reports with a block of salt.\" And later, this one, \"Reports of a shoot-down are false.\"</p><p>The online war of words really started last month, with the Taliban attack on the U.S. Embassy in Kabul. Seven Afghan police officers and civilians were killed, along with six insurgents. But even before the 20-hour gun battle was over, the tweets were flying.</p><p>ISAF media sending this: \"The outcome is inevitable. The question is, how much longer will terrorists put innocent Afghans in harm's way?\"</p><p>ABalkhi fired back in tech speak, \"I don't know. You have been putting them in harm's way for the past 10 years, razed whole villages and markets, and still have the nerve to talk about harm's way.\"</p><p>ISAF media then responded, \"Really? UNAMA reported 80 percent of civilian casualties are caused by insurgent (as in your) activities.\"</p><p>With 14,000 followers on its Twitter account, ISAF media may have the advantage here over Taliban spokesman ABalkhi, who has just 1,700 followers. But a coalition spokesman acknowledges that this war of words is far from over.</p><p>For CNN, I'm Errol Barnett.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STOUT: Now, ahead on NEWS STREAM, the world's population clock is ticking closer and closer to the seven billion mark.</p><p>Plus, the fight against terrorism in Africa takes a new twist between two tense numbers. We'll have a live report from Kenya.</p><p>And what governments are asking Google to keep you from finding.</p><p>STOUT: I'm Kristie Lu Stout in Hong Kong. You're watching News Stream. And these are your world headlines.</p><p>Now European Union leaders have announced a deal to tackle the EuroZone's debt crisis. And the plan has three main elements. Private banks have agreed to write down the value of their holdings of Greek debt by 50 percent, European banks will boost their core capital reserves, and the EU will leverage its bailout fund to give it an effective strength of $1.4 trillion.</p><p>Now people in Bangkok are being urged to flee as the flood stricken Thai capital braces for its highest water levels yet. Thailand's prime minister says all districts of Bangkok will be flooded with some areas seeing water as high as one meter. Now the floods in Thailand have killed 373 people and affected more than 9.5 million.</p><p>Now the death toll from Sunday's massive earthquake in eastern Turkey has now risen to 534, that's according to Turkish officials. There were reports of another earthquake earlier on Thursday near the border with Iraq, but there are no reports of any casualties from that 5.2 magnitude tremor.</p><p>Now one of the largest populations on the planet is celebrating Diwali this week, the festival of lights. Like these people visiting the market in the Indian city Amedabot (ph) had the celebrations.</p><p>Now the population of India, it stands at 1.21 billion right now. And by the year 2030 it is projected that India will become the world's most populous nation. And by next week, according to the UN, the global population will reach 7 billion.</p><p>No one really knows for sure, but the Population Reference Bureau says that nearly 108 billion people have been born throughout history. That means about 6 percent of all the people who were ever born are alive today.</p><p>And all this week, News Stream is examining the issues raised by world population growth. And my guest today is Fred Pearce. He's a journalist and environmental and development consultant. And his latest book, it's called \"People Quake,\" he says the world population is peaking and will soon start to decline. And what's more, he argues that Earth, our planet, it could meet the needs of a larger population if some people consumed less and natural resources were shared more equally.</p><p>Fred Pearce joins me now live from our London studio.</p><p>And Fred, thank you for joining us. And we are counting down to 7 billion. How worried should we be?</p><p>FRED PEARCE, AUTHOR: I think we should be worried in the short-term. It's a lot of extra people that we're having every year. But the good news is that we can, I think, look forward to peak population something about the middle of this century. I think we'll go from about 7 billion now to perhaps 9 billion, perhaps a little more.</p><p>But family sizes -- the good news is that family sizes are coming down so fast that we can look forward to peak population, and maybe decline after that. The average woman today has 2.5 children. That's half as many as her mother and her grandmother had. We used to get up at five and six.</p><p>So fertility levels are coming down really remarkably fast. And if they carry on down as they have (inaudible) already. And we can see good news ahead. We can see light at the end of the tunnel.</p><p>STOUT: You know, it's interesting that you're saying that the population is peaking, because it was just yesterday the United Nations released this report and said by the end of the century the world's total population could rise to more than 10 billion. So what are your thoughts on that? Is the population rising, or is it peaking?</p><p>PEARCE: Well it's certainly rising. The peak is to come. I think most people will agree that by mid-century we'll be at about 9 billion. The question is what happens after that. And the UN has very wide error bars on its projections. So nobody really knows.</p><p>But the evidence is that fertility rates are coming down so fast, people are -- you know many countries have half the number of children that their women were having in a generation. Much of India is now down to 2 children per woman, many parts of Asia even lower. So if Africa follows that path, then by mid-century I think we will see peak population.</p><p>Absolutely nobody knows for sure. And there are big concerns about how African -- how Africa, for instance, can cope with a doubling of its numbers in the next few decades. But we can look forward, I think, with a sort of optimistic hope that we can see peak population. And that would help to solve an awful lot of global environmental problems, not least climate change.</p><p>STOUT: Now in the near-term, we are nearing the 7 billionth person on the planet. Right now, especially looking at consumption habits that are out there, can earth handle that?</p><p>PEARCE: I -- the way we consume now I don't think it can. I think we're already over the limit if everybody wants to live a western style of life and to produce what we need in the western way of doing it. We're going to have to change anyway.</p><p>But the way I look at it, we are diffusing the population bomb. The world's population isn't going to double again as its doubled in the last 40 years. We're diffusing the population bomb, but we haven't begun to diffuse the consumption bomb, that's where the real issues I think are now. How we produce our energy, whether we can recycle those scarce metals, whether we can preserve our soils.</p><p>We know we can feed 10 billion people. We're already producing enough food for that. We just don't know how to distribute it and get it to the people who are hungry. So there is hope out there. We're not up against a sort of doom's day scenario, but we do have to get things right. We do have to manage our planet's resources much more efficiently.</p><p>But if we do that than I do believe that the 8, 9, even 10 billion people that we might have by the end of the century we can give them a good life.</p><p>STOUT: So our focus should be on consumption rather than population. Fred Pearce, thank you very much indeed for joining us here on News Stream.</p><p>And as we count down to the world population hitting the 7 billion mark, we are asking our ireporters to help us visualize that massive number. And we have already had submissions featuring grains of rice or steps on a very long hike. What can you come up with? You can submit your photos or videos to ireport.com and you may see them on CNN.</p><p>Now Kenya's pursuit of Islamic militants in neighboring Somalia is taking a surprising twist. A Kenyan government official tells CNN that leaders of the al Shabaab militant group want to talk. Now Kenyan troops, they swept into Somalia earlier this month to hunt for al Shabaab fighters.</p><p>Now Kenya blames al Shabaab for a string of kidnappings and attacks. And David McKenzie joins me now from Kenya's capital Nairobi.</p><p>And David, they're saying they want to talk, but can al Shabaab be trusted?</p><p>DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, al Shabaab said that it's not talking to the Kenyan government and they've threatened Kenya in fact. And I have to say that the government minister, the government spokesman Afred Mutua just had a press conference. He denied those reports.</p><p>Though I did speak to a Kenyan government very close to this military operation. He said that well the al Shabaab doesn't have time to talk, because, quote, \"they're running for their lives.\" So certainly a contradictory statements coming from the Kenyan government.</p><p>What is becoming apparently and clear is that operation to take on al Shabaab is a very complex operation and some people fear that it'll be a very difficult one indeed.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCKENZIE: Kenyan troops pushing into Somalia, part of a major offensive that took many by surprise. Their stated aim, to take al Shabaab head on.</p><p>The al Qaeda linked militant group has threatened Kenya before. But a recent string of kidnappings here spurred the government into action.</p><p>ALFRED MUTUA, KENYA GOVERNMENT SPOKESMAN: The al Shabaab group poses a clear and present danger, not only to Kenya and this region, but to the entire world. We do believe that the fight against terror cannot be won unless the power and the organization of al Shabaab is dismantled.</p><p>MCKENZIE: Security analysts say that the incursion is a big risk. They point to recent history.</p><p>America's infamous Blackhawk Down mission in the 90s, Ethiopia's U.S.- backed invasion which led to the rise of al Shabaab. And African Union's long and bloody campaign to control Mogadishu.</p><p>RASHID ABDI, SOMALI ANALYST: If there's anything we have learned, you know, in the last couple of years is that foreign domination, especially military domination doesn't work in Somalia.</p><p>MCKENZIE: Kenya's military officials say they want to push on to Kismayo, a key stronghold of al Shabaab.</p><p>But the country's largely conventional army is being hampered by heavy rains, al Shabaab's ability to melt into the background.</p><p>Kenya's key western allies, the U.S. and the UK, were quick to state that they will not give any assistance to this operation. But France says they will give some help.</p><p>The decision to attack was the Kenyan government's alone, it seems. But many worry it will make this country less safe, not more.</p><p>ABDI: You know, if the argument for going in to stop terrorism, the contrary is now the case. Al Shabaab will now have the pretense to strike Kenya.</p><p>MCKENZIE: A series of grenade attacks this week, blamed on al Shabaab, has the country on edge. But the Kenyan government says it has stepped up security and that they have just one aim in Somalia.</p><p>MUTUA: We don't want to go and get stuck in Somalia. When the United States, Ethiopia and others went there, they were trying to support an existing government. Our main objective is to just go in, dismantle the al Shabaab, and get out. So we are very clear objective.</p><p>MCKENZIE: To take out al Shabaab?</p><p>MUTUA: To take out al Shabaab.</p><p>MCKENZIE: The government says that the operation should be over in a matter of months. Some fear that Kenya has stepped into a military quagmire that has haunted this continent for decades.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCKENZIE: Well, some latest news, Kristie, in the northeast of the country near Mandera (ph) on the border of Somalia apparently four people have been killed according to the police here in Kenya. Four people killed who were traveling a government officials who were carrying examination papers in a car. So it's unclear who caused that attack, but certainly worries here in Kenya the internal security as the army and the air force pushes into Somalia to take on al Shabaab -- Kristie.</p><p>STOUT: Very fluid situation. Thank you for giving us the updates. David McKenzie joining us live from Nairobi. Thank you.</p><p>Now China is calling for stricter control of social media sites to promote what it calls a healthy internet culture. And according to a communique from a Communist Party meeting, the central committee will, quote, strengthen guidance and administration of social internet services and regulate the orderly dissemination of information.</p><p>Now this tightening, it came as a part of the government's crackdown on online rumors with special focus on the country's leading microblog Sina Weibo. And we have a lot more on this story for you on our blog. You can check it out, CNN.com/newsstream.</p><p>Now just ahead here on News Stream, like all big tech companies, Google gets calls from governments to take down content. But which countries make the most of those requests? We'll dig into Google's transparency report.</p><p>STOUT: Welcome back.</p><p>Now Google and governments it's an interesting relationship. Now the tech giant has just released its latest transparency report. And its goal is to expose how governments around the world affect our access to information on the Internet. And you can find the report on Google's official blog.</p><p>But here are a few countries that stood out. Now the first half of this year, Brazil made the most content removal requests followed by Germany, the U.S. and South Korea.</p><p>Now joining me now to talk more about the report is News Stream regular Nicolas Thompson, senior editor of the New Yorker. And Nick, always good to see you. And you have trolled through this report. What were the highlights for you?</p><p>NICK THOMPSON, NEW YORKER: There are all sort of interesting things. You can learn a lot about what a country's government cares about by what they've requested to be taken down.</p><p>Some of the things that stuck out is that in Turkey there are all sorts of requests to take down videos on YouTube that showed information about officials' private lives. Google complied with all of those.</p><p>In India, there are all sorts of requests to take down videos that show people insulting religious leaders. Because of India's local laws don't restrict that as much, Google didn't comply with those.</p><p>In Thailand, there are lots of requests to take down videos that were insulting to the monarch. And Google did comply with those.</p><p>The little bit that stuck out the most to me, there's a little nugget in the section on the United States. And it said there was a request to take down a video showing police brutality and another showing -- a request to take down a video showing defamation of a police officer. And then Google specifically says we didn't comply.</p><p>Now why are they saying that? And I think it's partly to show Google's aim with this report is both to kind of poke the countries that have lots of requests and to make it clear that they are doing something their citizens might not agree with. And also to show that sometimes Google objects to this. And it's actually a particularly good time for Google to say that it's not taking down videos of police brutality in this country in the United States is becoming more of an issue. It makes Google look like more of a good guy.</p><p>STOUT: Yeah, it's like Google in superhero mode. \"Don't be evil is the mantra here.\"</p><p>And Google, interesting to know, it's the only internet company that releases this kind of information about its relationship with governments around the world. Do you think it will make a difference by doing so?</p><p>THOMPSON: I think it does make a difference. I think it shows -- I mean, it makes a difference in the way we perceive Google, because it actually shows the import of Google. So when you think about the information that a society gets to see and that gets circulated, it partly depends on what its users feel free to put up, it partly depends on what its government objects to, and it partly depends on Google, right?</p><p>Google has a bunch of people who make very important decisions about the information that can circulate in a society. We're moving into a world where tech companies have a lot of power in a cynic way that they didn't have before. And what's interesting about Google is it's being open about it. It's admitting to it. And it's giving us a lot of information about the choices it makes, so that we can judge those choices.</p><p>STOUT: And while we're talking about Google, your thoughts on the buzz out there that Google has its eyes on a Yahoo takeover. Is it possible? What about the other rivals eying Yahoo? And what would it mean for Microsoft?</p><p>THOMPSON: Well, I think -- I mean, I think that Google can't possibly take over Yahoo, or probably can't even take over a chunk of Yahoo. There's -- there's no way that U.S. regulators would allow the number one search company to take over the number two. It's preposterous. Google is already in all sorts of anti-trust problems at the moment.</p><p>So there are some rumors circulating that Google must have leaked this in order to irritate Microsoft and to drive up the price. Google and Microsoft, they are forever at war with each other.</p><p>I actually think it was probably somebody else who leaked this information. Google probably made some calls, but anybody who is a Yahoo shareholder is interested in a price being a high as possible. So they're interested in heated up the market as much as possible? So they're interested in floating as many rumors as possible.</p><p>So I think Google probably made a call. It's not leading anywhere. And somebody whose got a financial interest and Yahoo made sure the press knew about it.</p><p>STOUT: I love these high tech conspiracy theories.</p><p>Nick Thompson, unfortunately we have to leave it at that. Thank you very much as always for joining us, every week, right here on News Stream. Take care.</p><p>Political candidates in the United States are finding all kinds of ways to communicate to potential voters. And it seems one campaign staffer is sending smoke signals. Our Jeanne Moos explains after the break.</p><p>STOUT: The champagne is still on ice. The Texas Rangers could have become World Series champions on Wednesday, but the weather got in the way. And here is Pedro Pinto with more -- Pedro.</p><p>PEDRO PINTO, CNN SPORTS CORREPSONDENT: Hey, Kristie. Heavy rain in St. Louis postponed last night's world series contest at Busch Stadium. Both teams are hoping the weather will clear up so they can actually go out there and play some baseball on Thursday.</p><p>It was pretty miserable on Wednesday with officials calling the game off five hours before the first pitch was supposed to be thrown. The rain just didn't stop all day long.</p><p>The Rangers lead the best of seven series three games to two with game 6 now set to be played on Thursday. The Rangers are looking for their first ever World Series title.</p><p>Should the Cardinals stave off elimination, a deciding seventh game will be played on Friday. Both teams' managers said they welcome the rest that they weren't expecting. And they guarantee the players will be ready to go on Thursday.</p><p>Now let's focus our attention on football. Al Sadd have qualified for the final of the Asian Champion's League for the first time since 1989. They did so by knocking out South Korea's Suwon Bluewings.</p><p>The first leg of this tie in Suwon was marred by an ugly brawl. Fortunately, there were no such issues in Doha on Wednesday night. The Bluewings have lost the first leg at home 2-nil but they got back into the semifinal by taking an early lead.</p><p>Great goal, it was as well, Oh Jang-Eun with a fantastic volley, definitely worth another look.</p><p>The home side tried to reestablish their two goal lead in the tie and came close to doing so. Khalfan Ibrahim with the effort that was saved onto the crossbar by Jung Sung-Ryong.</p><p>As time passed, the Bluewings knew they needed to force the issue. And Park Joon-Jin had a shot on target from close range right at the keeper, though.</p><p>The match finished 1-nil Suwon. Not enough for the South Koreans. Al Sadd won 2-1 on aggregate. They'll face Jeonbuk in the final.</p><p>Maria Sharapova has withdrawn from the WTA tour championships after suffering a recurrence of a recent ankle injury during her second match in Istanbul. This means she no longer has a chance to overtake Caroline Wozniaki for the world number one ranking.</p><p>Sharapova made the announcement shortly after losing her second consecutive match on the hard courts of the Turkish capital. She went down to Li Na in straight sets.</p><p>Is was an unexpected score, considering it was actually the Russian that had a 4-1 lead in the first set. Her opponent rebounded well and actually had the lead before Sharapova then forced a tiebreak.</p><p>Again, the Russian had an advantage in the tiebreaker, but failed to hold on. Li Na winning the first set.</p><p>In the second, the French Open champion was on top and managed to seal the deal in the 10th game. Leading 5-4 and serving for the match, she was down 15-40 before prevailing to finish off Sharapova in straight sets.</p><p>Also on Wednesday, Caroline Wozniaki lost surprisingly to Victoria Zvonareva.</p><p>That'll do it for now.

'This is a game of leverage being fought on the legal battlefield,' Matt Bilinsky, business attorney at Los Angeles law firm Weinberg Gonser, told TheWrap. He noted that Epic \u2014 which reported $4.2 billion in revenue in 2019, according to VentureBeat[2] \u2014 is one of the only game developers with enough money and clout to challenge goliaths like Apple and Google. The companies got into a public feud[3] on Thursday shortly after Epic started offering a discount on the 'Fortnite' in-game currency called V-Bucks. </p><p>If customers purchased the currency directly from Epic instead of through the App Store, they saved roughly 20% \u2014 and Epic pocketed all the cash instead of paying Apple's standard 30% commission on App Store transactions. Apple promptly booted 'Fortnite' from the App Store, and Epic responded with a lawsuit accusing Apple of antitrust violations for a fee structure that amounted to an unfair monopoly. Later on Thursday, Epic filed a nearly identical suit against Google for removing 'Fortnite' from its Google Play store[4]. Apple said in a statement Thursday it planned to work with Epic to get 'Fortnite' back on the App Store soon \u2014 which Bilinksy said was a sign of just how much power Epic Games has in this battle. 'A lesser publisher wouldn't get that response, they'd get the response from Apple to pretty much screw off,' he said. Also Read: Epic Games Sues Apple for Removing 'Fortnite' From App Store[5] SensorTower mobile analyst Craig Chapple also noted the timing of Epic Games' lawsuits \u2014 and its willingness to take the risk on its most lucrative property. 'It's interesting they're using the popularity of 'Fortnite' to pull the game and try to put some pressure onto Apple at a time when governments are scrutinizing the practices and also some other big games companies are scrutinizing those practices,' he said. 'Fortnite' racked up $1.8 billion in sales last year, according to Nielsen's SuperData \u2014 [6]more than 40% of the company's overall revenues. Epic's San Francisco-based law firm, Faegre Drinker Biddle &amp;#38; Reath, didn't return TheWrap's requests for comment about why the lawsuit was filed now. But experts noted that while U.S. antitrust enforcement has lapsed in the last decade, the European Union has been more aggressive in recent years cracking down on big tech. In March 2019, the EU investigated Apple for antitrust complaints after Spotify sued the company. 'There has been increasing scrutiny of the position that the app stores occupy in the mobile games market and the 30% fee that they charge on all transactions,' Fernandes said. 'It is reasonable to believe that Epic Games had been preparing for this legal dispute for some time and it saw this as a good moment to act.' Bilinksy said there is very little legal precedent to draw from in this case, partly because the United States' overall laws on antitrust remain vague. 'Generally, American antitrust and anti-monopoly law has really loosened up over the past 25 to 30 years,' Bilinsky said. 'The government is far more hesitant, whether under Democrats or Republicans, to impose restrictions for monopolistic practices than they were 50 years ago and that really has come to a head in terms of the tech companies because they're so hard to regulate, because they're not based in the physical world.' Bilinsky added, 'There's the argument to be made that all these major tech companies are establishing de facto monopolies, and the government hasn't really done anything about it.' Also Read: Apple Stock Hits New High on Report of Possible Music, TV Subscription Bundle[7] The gaming industry has long complained about the commissions that Apple and Google have charged \u2014 which Epic's lawsuit [8]described as 'exorbitant' and 'anti-competitive.' 'This is also not the first time that Epic Games has tried to circumvent the app stores transaction fees,' Guilherme Fernandes, market consultant at games and esports analytics company NewZoo, told TheWrap. He noted that 'Fortnite' wasn't available on the Google Play Store for over a year. 'For 18 months, (Epic) offered 'Fortnite' on Android devices through direct download, outside the (Google) Play Store, until it caved in in April, citing the influence that having it available on the official store has on consumers,' Fernandes said. Apple has argued that the 30% fee not only covers hosting a game, but also offers exposure to a wider user base and tools that let developers launch their games quickly. 'A 70-30 split plus all the things you get, and you can easily release your game is a lot better than it was' when the App Store first launched, Chapple said. 'Apple and the App Store have actually done a lot to really grow the mobile games industry into what is now the biggest segment of gaming.' Reps for Apple and Google did not respond to repeated requests for comment about the lawsuits. Others noted that while the fee may seem high, it's not outside the norm within the industry. 'For a centralized repository of apps and app stores that 30% is definitely on the higher end,' Bilinsky said, 'but it is within the gap of what is considered standard.' Also Read: Facebook Could Face $500 Billion in Fines for Illegally Collecting Biometric Data Through Instagram[9] Epic has another advantage in this fight: Unlike other gaming publishers, it also distributes 'Fortnite' on PC, consoles and Android phones. Epic also operates its own marketplace, the Epic Games Store \u2014 where 80% of each transaction returns to the developer. Sweeney has claimed its 20% fee is a fairer deal. Fernandes noted that competition from the Epic Games Store motivated competitor Valve to reconsider how it priced fees on its PC game marketplace, Steam. Epic 'has also taken a similar stance on PC; it introduced its very own Epic Games Store on PC as an alternative to Valve's Steam and its 30% fee on every transaction that took place on PC's largest games platform,' Fernandes said. But even though Epic has a strong infrastructure of its own, it still needs the App Store and could lose a significant amount of money the longer 'Fortnite' is banned. The company said in April that the first-person shooter game reached 350 million players globally. SensorTower estimates the game has been downloaded 133.2 million times on the App Store to date. 'Since it launched in 2018 on the App Store, we estimate it's made $1.2 billion on mobile alone,' Chapple said. There's a good chance Epic will resolve its dispute with Apple and Google long before its case reaches a courtroom \u2014 which could take up to six years, Bilinsky said. For both sides, the risks of a trial may just be too great given the lack of legal precedent. 'In terms of (a court saying) we now determine that this fundamental nature of your business model is an anti-competitive, monopolistic practice that violates antitrust law, and you need to cease nothing's coming to mind,' he said.

They come as the social-media giant fends off accusations of liberal bias.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been hosting informal talks and small, off-the-record dinners with conservative journalists, commentators and at least one Republican lawmaker in recent months to talk about issues like free speech and discuss partnerships.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The dinners, which began in July, are part of Zuckerberg's broader effort to cultivate friends on the right amid outrage by President Donald Trump and his allies over alleged \"bias\" against conservatives at Facebook and other major social media companies. \"I'm under no illusions that he's a conservative but I think he does care about some of our concerns,\" said one person familiar with the gatherings, which multiple sources have confirmed. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">News of the outreach is likely to further fuel suspicions on the left that Zuckerberg is trying to appease the White House and stay out of Trump's crosshairs. The president threatened to sue Facebook and Google in June and has in the past pressured the Justice Department to take action against his perceived foes. </p><p>\"The discussion in Silicon Valley is that Zuckerberg is very concerned about the Justice Department, under Bill Barr, bringing an enforcement action to break up the company,\" said one cybersecurity researcher and former government official based in Silicon Valley. \"So the fear is that Zuckerberg is trying to appease the Trump administration by not cracking down on right-wing propaganda.\"</p><p>Facebook has been criticized in recent days, including by Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, for its ad policy, which exempts politicians from third-party fact-checking and arguably facilitates the spread of disinformation.</p><p>When asked about the gatherings, a senior Trump administration official said \"the White House is looking for meaningful steps from Facebook on a number of fronts,\" including \"competition, free speech for everybody including conservatives, and privacy.\" </p><p>\"Nominal outreach won't cut it,\" the official added.</p><p>As part of the series, Zuckerberg met earlier this year with Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, who insinuated that Facebook had become a monopoly during a congressional hearing last year; Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who has fingered Zuckerberg as contributing to \"the death of free speech in America\"; and conservative radio talk host Hugh Hewitt, who has cautioned against a DOJ enforcement action but has called for a \"new regulatory regime\" to minimize \"big tech bias\" against conservatives. </p><p>CNN commentator Mary Katharine Ham, conservative commentator Ben Shapiro, AEI fellow and former Washington Free Beacon editor Matt Continetti, Town Hall editor and Fox News contributor Guy Benson, and Media Research Center founder Brent Bozell have also attended the dinners, according to the person familiar with the gatherings. Washington Examiner chief political correspondent and Fox News contributor Byron York also confirmed his attendance but declined to disclose the contents of the dinner because there was a prior agreement that it was off-the-record.</p><p>A spokesman for Graham confirmed that the South Carolina senator has spoken with Zuckerberg. Carlson, Continetti, Benson, Bozell and Hewitt declined to comment. Ham and Shapiro did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesperson for Facebook, noting Zuckerberg's recent meetings in Washington with Democrats, said in a statement, \"For years, Mark Zuckerberg has met with elected officials and thought leaders all across the political spectrum.\"</p><p>Each dinner has been hosted at one of Zuckerberg's homes in California, and at least one lasted around two-and-a-half to three hours. The conversations center around \"free expression, unfair treatment of conservatives, the appeals process for real or perceived unfair treatment, fact checking, partnerships, and privacy,\" the source familiar with the meetings said. </p><p>\"My perception of him was more positive than I anticipated,\" this person added, referring to Zuckerberg. \"He was receptive and thoughtful.\"</p><p>\"I've always thought that he wanted to make things right by conservatives,\" said another person familiar with the dinners. \"I think he's been genuine in hoping that might happen. Sometimes I think the headwinds are so strong in Palo Alto that I don't think even he can succeed.\"</p><p>Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has engaged in similar outreach to conservatives in an attempt to gain their trust, and hosted a private dinner in Washington, D.C. with GOP political operatives and commentators in July 2018, according to the Washington Post. </p><p>Facebook changed its policies following Russia's election interference in 2016 in an attempt to halt the spread of false news and foreign-bought ads. But the company has also been working to minimize and correct the appearance of bias in those policies ever since it was reported that the company's employees may have suppressed stories from right-leaning publications and authors in its \"Trending Topics\" section. </p><p>As part of those efforts, the company launched a yearlong \"conservative bias audit\" in 2018, which was conducted by former Sen. Jon Kyl and a team from his law firm Covington and Burling. </p><p>Kyl interviewed 133 conservative lawmakers and groups for the audit, which ended in August and resulted in changes to its advertising policies. It's unclear whether the Zuckerberg dinners are another facet of that project. </p><p>Allegations that Facebook censors conservatives, however, have gone largely unsubstantiated-conservative publications including Fox, Breitbart, and Shapiro's Daily Wire were among the top publishers on Facebook as of this past May, according to data from the social media tracking firm Newswhip. </p><p>Trump's 2016 campaign also took advantage of Facebook's offer to embed employees, who acted as political operatives and provided critical support to the campaign's social media operations, according to a study released in November 2017. (Hillary Clinton's campaign declined a similar offer.) </p><p>Facebook's critics on the left have argued that the company is overcorrecting and trying to curry favor with the Trump administration as it faces increasing scrutiny over its sloppy privacy practices and potential monopoly in social media. \"Facebook made a grave mistake in allowing external political actors to direct an assessment of company policy and practices,\" Henry Fernandez, senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, said after the \"conservative bias\" audit was completed in August. </p><p>The ongoing talks between Zuckerberg and prominent conservatives have attracted the attention of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which conducts oversight on issues related to telecommunications and consumer protection and is \"aware\" of allegations that conservatives \"are trying to work the refs\" ahead of 2020, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. </p><p>The committee's Democrats sent a previously unreported letter to Facebook in June, after a doctored video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi went viral on the platform, asking what the company was doing to address \"the spreading of political disinformation by real accounts.\" </p><p>\"We are concerned that you and your company are not taking these occurrences seriously and are grossly unprepared for the 2020 election,\" they wrote. \"Specifically, we are concerned that there may be a potential conflict of interest between Facebook's bottom line and immediately addressing political disinformation on your platform.\" </p><p>Facebook's vice president of U.S. public policy, Kevin Martin, responded three weeks later in a letter, also obtained by POLITICO. In it, he said the company has been working with third-party fact checkers to \"remove fake accounts, disrupt the financial incentives behind propagating false and misleading information,\" and letting users know \"when they are reading or sharing information (excluding satire and opinion) that has been disputed or debunked.\" </p><p>\"Leading up to 2020 we know that combating misinformation is one of the most important things we can do,\" Martin wrote.</p><p>But the social media giant has come under fire recently for its ad policy, which considers politicians' claims-if made directly on their Facebook page, in an ad or on their website-to be \"direct speech and ineligible for our third-party fact checking program.\" In keeping with that policy, Facebook has allowed a Trump campaign ad making false claims about Joe Biden's ties to Ukraine to remain on the platform.</p><p>Warren, who has proposed breaking up Facebook, Amazon, and other tech giants, tested the limits of that policy last week by releasing an ad making the deliberately false claim that Zuckerberg and Facebook had endorsed Trump's re-election. </p><p>\"If Trump tries to lie in a TV ad, most networks will refuse to air it,\" said the Warren ad. \"But Facebook just cashes Trump's checks. Facebook already helped elect Donald Trump once. Now, they're deliberately allowing a candidate to intentionally lie to the American people. It's time to hold Mark Zuckerberg accountable - add your name if you agree.\"</p><p>Facebook hit back on Saturday night, likening the company's policies on candidate speech to that of the Federal Communications Commission. </p><p>\"The FCC doesn't want broadcast companies censoring candidates' speech,\" the company tweeted. \"We agree it's better to let voters-not companies-decide.\"</p><p>Zuckerberg held a closed-door meeting with half a dozen senators last month to discuss what Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) described at the time as an opportunity for lawmakers to air their concerns about Facebook's role in American democracy directly with the company's founder. On that same trip to Washington, Zuckerberg also met with Trump, Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner and White House social media director Dan Scavino.</p><p>He is due in Washington next week to testify before the House Financial Services Committee, where he's expected to discuss Facebook's controversial cryptocurrency plans.</p><p>After this story was published, Zuckerberg posted on Facebook: \"There's some press today discussing dinners I've had with conservative politicians, media and thinkers. To be clear, I have dinners with lots of people across the spectrum on lots of different issues all the time. Meeting new people and hearing from a wide range of viewpoints is part of learning.

The Danish programmer is a successful entrepreneur who has testified before Congress to argue that Big Tech firms should be more regulated and started an anti-Facebook campaign. He is chief technology officer of Basecamp, which makes workplace collaboration software, and is also the creator of a widely used software development framework called Ruby on Rails.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hansson spoke with The Associated Press to discuss remote work in the age of the pandemic and why Big Tech's power should be limited. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.</p><p> Q: Basecamp is mostly remote. Has the pandemic affected how you work?</p><p> A: So Basecamp has been been remote for about 20 years and we have all the systems and processes in place to be able to make that a pleasant experience. But I think what's important to look at with the pandemic is that it's not just remote work, it's remote work during a pandemic. So we have a lot of parents at the company. About half the people at Basecamp have families who all of a sudden have to deal with childcare at home or a spouse who has to share the one home office there. So the pandemic part of it has definitely been difficult.</p><p> Q: Now we've been doing this for a few months, we've seen many companies basically switch to remote mode. Have you seen other companies making mistakes switching to remote work?</p><p> A: The No. 1 mistake I've seen from other companies suddenly being forced to go remote has been that they tried to recreate the office remotely. So if what happened at the office was a bunch of meetings early on Monday morning, those just turned into some calls.</p><p> And this whole idea that you can recreate the office remotely is a nonstarter. It's not a great way to work. Most companies, when they work in the office, work in a very synchronous way that's dictated around a meeting schedule that mandates where people have to be at a certain time.</p><p> Getting rid of that and switching to an asynchronous work style where people don't have to be at a certain place at a certain time is the key to unlocking both the productivity and the sanity of anyone working remotely during a pandemic.</p><p> Q: You have been critical about companies like Apple and Google being monopolies. Why do you think they're dangerous?</p><p> A: The power that Google, Apple, Amazon, Facebook and others have right now to dictate the terms of the digital economy, to capture the lion's share of all economic activity is unprecedented, astounding and incredibly dangerous.</p><p> From 2000 to 2010, I think most people uncritically looked at these companies with just applause. Oh, isn't Google amazing? Isn't it wonderful we can connect to old classmates on Facebook? Look at all these wonderful devices.

I don't think there's a lot of people who are just cheering on. Oh, isn't Facebook just universally amazing?

When there literally is no choice than to go through, say, the App Store to sell software to iPhone users. All you can do is kick and scream. And Apple knows this.</p><p> What needs to happen is regulatory action, whether that is mandates on these companies' behaviors such as preventing them from monopoly abuses, of dictating terms of payment services, or, in Google's case, opening up their search index to other search engines so that they can use that.</p><p> Q: Can you talk about your Facebook Free campaign? What is it exactly?</p><p> A: So in 2018, well, in advance of what's been going on recently with the advertising boycott, Basecamp came to the conclusion that we should not be voting for more Facebook in the world. We had run some tests, an advertising test in 2017 that used Facebook, and we felt icky doing that.</p><p> The Facebook machine is a massive engine of privacy and exploitation where targeted advertising violates the privacy of the recipients. And we thought, you know, why are we in this? Why are we doing this? Are we doing it just because everyone else is doing it? That's not a good reason. We need to stop.</p><p> So we decided we would not spend any advertising dollars on any of Facebook's platforms. We didn't want more Facebook in the world. In 2020, clearly, we're no longer early on that. And hopefully it will stick and hopefully it will help change what Facebook is and again, not so much because Facebook is afraid of losing this revenue, but because public opinion will be in part turned by this, which will again fuel legislative and regulatory actions so that we get out of this dystopian hellhole that is a Facebook dominated world.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>This photo provided by Metis Communications shows BaseCamp CTO David Heinemeier Hansson.

The Danish programmer is a successful entrepreneur who has testified before Congress to argue that Big Tech firms should be more regulated and started an anti-Facebook campaign. He is chief technology officer of Basecamp, which makes workplace collaboration software, and is also the creator of a widely used software development framework called Ruby on Rails.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hansson spoke with The Associated Press to discuss remote work in the age of the pandemic and why Big Tech\u2019s power should be limited. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.</p><p>Q: Basecamp is mostly remote. Has the pandemic affected how you work?</p><p>A: So Basecamp has been been remote for about 20 years and we have all the systems and processes in place to be able to make that a pleasant experience. But I think what\u2019s important to look at with the pandemic is that it\u2019s not just remote work, it\u2019s remote work during a pandemic. So we have a lot of parents at the company. About half the people at Basecamp have families who all of a sudden have to deal with childcare at home or a spouse who has to share the one home office there. So the pandemic part of it has definitely been difficult.</p><p>Q: Now we\u2019ve been doing this for a few months, we\u2019ve seen many companies basically switch to remote mode. Have you seen other companies making mistakes switching to remote work?</p><p>A: The No. 1 mistake I\u2019ve seen from other companies suddenly being forced to go remote has been that they tried to recreate the office remotely. So if what happened at the office was a bunch of meetings early on Monday morning, those just turned into some calls.</p><p>And this whole idea that you can recreate the office remotely is a nonstarter. It\u2019s not a great way to work. Most companies, when they work in the office, work in a very synchronous way that\u2019s dictated around a meeting schedule that mandates where people have to be at a certain time.</p><p>Getting rid of that and switching to an asynchronous work style where people don\u2019t have to be at a certain place at a certain time is the key to unlocking both the productivity and the sanity of anyone working remotely during a pandemic.</p><p>Q: You have been critical about companies like Apple and Google being monopolies. Why do you think they\u2019re dangerous?</p><p>A: The power that Google, Apple, Amazon, Facebook and others have right now to dictate the terms of the digital economy, to capture the lion\u2019s share of all economic activity is unprecedented, astounding and incredibly dangerous.</p><p>From 2000 to 2010, I think most people uncritically looked at these companies with just applause. Oh, isn\u2019t Google amazing? Isn\u2019t it wonderful we can connect to old classmates on Facebook? Look at all these wonderful devices. Apple is putting out.</p><p>That was the honeymoon phase where these companies faced very little critical reception. That\u2019s not the case anymore. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a lot of people who are just cheering on. Oh, isn\u2019t Facebook just universally amazing? Isn\u2019t it wonderful that Apple has an iron grip on all distribution of software to the iPhones in such a way that they can shake down individual software makers for 30 percent of the revenue?</p><p>I think some of these storylines now have taken over this uncritical applause that these companies used to have.

The Danish programmer is a successful entrepreneur who has testified before Congress to argue that Big Tech firms should be more regulated and started an anti-Facebook campaign. He is chief technology officer of Basecamp, which makes workplace collaboration software, and is also the creator of a widely used software development framework called Ruby on Rails.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hansson spoke with The Associated Press to discuss remote work in the age of the pandemic and why Big Tech\u2019s power should be limited. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.</p><p>Q: Basecamp is mostly remote. Has the pandemic affected how you work?</p><p>A: So Basecamp has been been remote for about 20 years and we have all the systems and processes in place to be able to make that a pleasant experience. But I think what\u2019s important to look at with the pandemic is that it\u2019s not just remote work, it\u2019s remote work during a pandemic. So we have a lot of parents at the company. About half the people at Basecamp have families who all of a sudden have to deal with childcare at home or a spouse who has to share the one home office there. So the pandemic part of it has definitely been difficult.</p><p>Q: Now we\u2019ve been doing this for a few months, we\u2019ve seen many companies basically switch to remote mode. Have you seen other companies making mistakes switching to remote work?</p><p>A: The No. 1 mistake I\u2019ve seen from other companies suddenly being forced to go remote has been that they tried to recreate the office remotely. So if what happened at the office was a bunch of meetings early on Monday morning, those just turned into some calls.</p><p>And this whole idea that you can recreate the office remotely is a nonstarter. It\u2019s not a great way to work. Most companies, when they work in the office, work in a very synchronous way that\u2019s dictated around a meeting schedule that mandates where people have to be at a certain time.</p><p>Getting rid of that and switching to an asynchronous work style where people don\u2019t have to be at a certain place at a certain time is the key to unlocking both the productivity and the sanity of anyone working remotely during a pandemic.</p><p>Q: You have been critical about companies like Apple and Google being monopolies. Why do you think they\u2019re dangerous?</p><p>A: The power that Google, Apple, Amazon, Facebook and others have right now to dictate the terms of the digital economy, to capture the lion\u2019s share of all economic activity is unprecedented, astounding and incredibly dangerous.</p><p>From 2000 to 2010, I think most people uncritically looked at these companies with just applause. Oh, isn\u2019t Google amazing? Isn\u2019t it wonderful we can connect to old classmates on Facebook? Look at all these wonderful devices. Apple is putting out.</p><p>That was the honeymoon phase where these companies faced very little critical reception. That\u2019s not the case anymore. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a lot of people who are just cheering on. Oh, isn\u2019t Facebook just universally amazing? Isn\u2019t it wonderful that Apple has an iron grip on all distribution of software to the iPhones in such a way that they can shake down individual software makers for 30 percent of the revenue?</p><p>I think some of these storylines now have taken over this uncritical applause that these companies used to have. And that\u2019s a huge, powerful and important change that\u2019s paving the way for these regulatory actions. I mean, virtually all energy that goes in to legislation or regulation comes from public perception changing.</p><p>Q: Is the way to fix this through regulation?</p><p>A: I think these companies are now so large that they are to some extent immune from the normal pressures of competitive forces that normal companies operate under. If a normal company that does not have a monopoly continues to do bad things to piss off large numbers of their partners, vendors and customers, those partners, vendors and customers will simply choose another option.</p><p>That can\u2019t happen when you have a monopoly. When there literally is no choice than to go through, say, the App Store to sell software to iPhone users. All you can do is kick and scream. And Apple knows this.</p><p>What needs to happen is regulatory action, whether that is mandates on these companies' behaviors such as preventing them from monopoly abuses, of dictating terms of payment services, or, in Google\u2019s case, opening up their search index to other search engines so that they can use that.</p><p>Q: Can you talk about your Facebook Free campaign? What is it exactly?</p><p>A: So in 2018, well, in advance of what\u2019s been going on recently with the advertising boycott, Basecamp came to the conclusion that we should not be voting for more Facebook in the world. We had run some tests, an advertising test in 2017 that used Facebook, and we felt icky doing that.</p><p>The Facebook machine is a massive engine of privacy and exploitation where targeted advertising violates the privacy of the recipients. And we thought, you know, why are we in this? Why are we doing this? Are we doing it just because everyone else is doing it? That\u2019s not a good reason. We need to stop.</p><p>So we decided we would not spend any advertising dollars on any of Facebook\u2019s platforms. We didn\u2019t want more Facebook in the world. In 2020, clearly, we\u2019re no longer early on that. And hopefully it will stick and hopefully it will help change what Facebook is and again, not so much because Facebook is afraid of losing this revenue, but because public opinion will be in part turned by this, which will again fuel legislative and regulatory actions so that we get out of this dystopian hellhole that is a Facebook dominated world.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APFINL-af14dfd38dec05c9131ad00db930aaa320200803</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APFINL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60H5-WKW1-DYMD-632K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">288311</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"949\"/><timeReceived>6:43 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press Financial Wire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 3, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The Danish programmer is a successful entrepreneur who has testified before Congress to argue that Big Tech firms should be more regulated and started an anti-Facebook campaign. He is chief technology officer of Basecamp, which makes workplace collaboration software, and is also the creator of a widely used software development framework called Ruby on Rails.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hansson spoke with The Associated Press to discuss remote work in the age of the pandemic and why Big Tech\u2019s power should be limited. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.</p><p>Q: Basecamp is mostly remote. Has the pandemic affected how you work?</p><p>A: So Basecamp has been been remote for about 20 years and we have all the systems and processes in place to be able to make that a pleasant experience. But I think what\u2019s important to look at with the pandemic is that it\u2019s not just remote work, it\u2019s remote work during a pandemic. So we have a lot of parents at the company. About half the people at Basecamp have families who all of a sudden have to deal with childcare at home or a spouse who has to share the one home office there. So the pandemic part of it has definitely been difficult.</p><p>Q: Now we\u2019ve been doing this for a few months, we\u2019ve seen many companies basically switch to remote mode. Have you seen other companies making mistakes switching to remote work?</p><p>A: The No. 1 mistake I\u2019ve seen from other companies suddenly being forced to go remote has been that they tried to recreate the office remotely. So if what happened at the office was a bunch of meetings early on Monday morning, those just turned into some calls.</p><p>And this whole idea that you can recreate the office remotely is a nonstarter. It\u2019s not a great way to work. Most companies, when they work in the office, work in a very synchronous way that\u2019s dictated around a meeting schedule that mandates where people have to be at a certain time.</p><p>Getting rid of that and switching to an asynchronous work style where people don\u2019t have to be at a certain place at a certain time is the key to unlocking both the productivity and the sanity of anyone working remotely during a pandemic.</p><p>Q: You have been critical about companies like Apple and Google being monopolies. Why do you think they\u2019re dangerous?</p><p>A: The power that Google, Apple, Amazon, Facebook and others have right now to dictate the terms of the digital economy, to capture the lion\u2019s share of all economic activity is unprecedented, astounding and incredibly dangerous.</p><p>From 2000 to 2010, I think most people uncritically looked at these companies with just applause. Oh, isn\u2019t Google amazing? Isn\u2019t it wonderful we can connect to old classmates on Facebook? Look at all these wonderful devices. Apple is putting out.</p><p>That was the honeymoon phase where these companies faced very little critical reception. That\u2019s not the case anymore. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a lot of people who are just cheering on. Oh, isn\u2019t Facebook just universally amazing? Isn\u2019t it wonderful that Apple has an iron grip on all distribution of software to the iPhones in such a way that they can shake down individual software makers for 30 percent of the revenue?</p><p>I think some of these storylines now have taken over this uncritical applause that these companies used to have. And that\u2019s a huge, powerful and important change that\u2019s paving the way for these regulatory actions. I mean, virtually all energy that goes in to legislation or regulation comes from public perception changing.</p><p>Q: Is the way to fix this through regulation?</p><p>A: I think these companies are now so large that they are to some extent immune from the normal pressures of competitive forces that normal companies operate under. If a normal company that does not have a monopoly continues to do bad things to piss off large numbers of their partners, vendors and customers, those partners, vendors and customers will simply choose another option.</p><p>That can\u2019t happen when you have a monopoly. When there literally is no choice than to go through, say, the App Store to sell software to iPhone users. All you can do is kick and scream. And Apple knows this.</p><p>What needs to happen is regulatory action, whether that is mandates on these companies' behaviors such as preventing them from monopoly abuses, of dictating terms of payment services, or, in Google\u2019s case, opening up their search index to other search engines so that they can use that.</p><p>Q: Can you talk about your Facebook Free campaign? What is it exactly?</p><p>A: So in 2018, well, in advance of what\u2019s been going on recently with the advertising boycott, Basecamp came to the conclusion that we should not be voting for more Facebook in the world. We had run some tests, an advertising test in 2017 that used Facebook, and we felt icky doing that.</p><p>The Facebook machine is a massive engine of privacy and exploitation where targeted advertising violates the privacy of the recipients. And we thought, you know, why are we in this? Why are we doing this? Are we doing it just because everyone else is doing it? That\u2019s not a good reason. We need to stop.</p><p>So we decided we would not spend any advertising dollars on any of Facebook\u2019s platforms. We didn\u2019t want more Facebook in the world. In 2020, clearly, we\u2019re no longer early on that. And hopefully it will stick and hopefully it will help change what Facebook is and again, not so much because Facebook is afraid of losing this revenue, but because public opinion will be in part turned by this, which will again fuel legislative and regulatory actions so that we get out of this dystopian hellhole that is a Facebook dominated world.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APE-af14dfd38dec05c9131ad00db930aaa320200803</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60H5-WK61-JC5B-G4F8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304478</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"949\"/><timeReceived>6:43 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Associated Press</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 3, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The Danish programmer is a successful entrepreneur who has testified before Congress to argue that Big Tech firms should be more regulated and started an anti-Facebook campaign. He is chief technology officer of BaseCamp, which makes workplace collaboration software, and is also the creator of a widely used software development framework called Ruby on Rails. Hansson spoke with The Associated Press to discuss remote work in the age of the pandemic and why Big Tech's power should be limited. The interview has been edited for length and clarity. Q: Basecamp is mostly remote. Has the pandemic affected how you work?  A: So BaseCamp has been been remote for about 20 years and we have all the systems and processes in place to be able to make that a pleasant experience. But I think what's important to look at with the pandemic is that it's not just remote work, it's remote work during a pandemic. So we have a lot of parents at the company. About half the people at BaseCamp have families who all of a sudden have to deal with childcare at home or a spouse who has to share the one home office there. So the pandemic part of it has definitely been difficult.  Q: Now we've been doing this for a few months, we've seen many companies basically switch to remote mode. Have you seen other companies making mistakes switching to remote work?  A: The number one mistake I've seen from other companies suddenly being forced to go remote has been that they tried to recreate the office remotely. So if what happened at the office was a bunch of meetings early on Monday morning, those just turned into some calls.  And this whole idea that you can recreate the office remotely is a nonstarter. It's not a great way to work. Most companies, when they work in the office, work in a very synchronous way that's dictated around a meeting schedule that mandates where people have to be at a certain time. (Ad) Bill Gates sees HUGE potential. And the FDA has just \"fast-tracked\" this new technology Approval could happen any day now, and send shares screaming higher. I'm talking about huge 1,000% gains in as little as a day for this tiny $4 stock.Getting rid of that and switching to an asynchronous work style where people don't have to be at a certain place at a certain time is the key to unlocking both the productivity and the sanity of anyone working remotely during a pandemic.  Q: You have been critical about companies like Apple and Google being monopolies. Why do you think they're dangerous?  A: The power that Google, Apple, Amazon, Facebook and others have right now to dictate the terms of the digital economy, to capture the lion's share of all economic activity is unprecedented, astounding and incredibly dangerous.  From 2000 to 2010, I think most people uncritically looked at these companies with just applause. Oh, isn't Google amazing? Isn't it wonderful we can connect to old classmates on Facebook? Look at all these wonderful devices. Apple is putting out.  That was the honeymoon phase where these companies faced very little critical reception. That's not the case anymore. I don't think there's a lot of people who are just cheering on. Oh, isn't Facebook just universally amazing? Isn't it wonderful that Apple has an iron grip on all distribution of software to the iPhones in such a way that they can shake down individual software makers for 30 percent of the revenue?  I think some of these storylines now have taken over this uncritical applause that these companies used to have. And that's a huge, powerful and important change that's paving the way for these regulatory actions. I mean, virtually all energy that goes in to legislation or regulation comes from public perception changing.  Q: Is the way to fix this through regulation?  A: I think these companies are now so large that they are to some extent immune from the normal pressures of competitive forces that normal companies operate under. If a normal company that does not have a monopoly continues to do bad things to piss off large numbers of their partners, vendors and customers, those partners, vendors and customers will simply choose another option.  That can't happen when you have a monopoly. When there literally is no choice than to go through, say, the App Store to sell software to iPhone users. All you can do is kick and scream. And Apple knows this. T What needs to happen is regulatory action, whether that is mandates on these companies' behaviors such as preventing them from monopoly abuses, of dictating terms of payment services, or, in Google's case, opening up their search index to other search engines so that they can use that.  Q: Can you talk about your Facebook Free campaign? What is it exactly?  A: So in 2018, well, in advance of what's been going on recently with the advertising boycott, BaseCamp came to the conclusion that we should not be voting for more Facebook in the world. We had run some tests, an advertising test in 2017 that used Facebook, and we felt icky doing that.  The Facebook machine is a massive engine of privacy and exploitation where targeted advertising violates the privacy of the recipients. And we thought, you know, why are we in this? Why are we doing this? Are we doing it just because everyone else is doing it? That's not a good reason. We need to stop.  So we decided we would not spend any advertising dollars on any of Facebook's platforms. We didn't want more Facebook in the world. In 2020, clearly, we're no longer early on that. And hopefully it will stick and hopefully it will help change what Facebook is and again, not so much because Facebook is afraid of losing this revenue, but because public opinion will be in part turned by this, which will again fuel legislative and regulatory actions so that we get out of this dystopian hellhole that is a Facebook dominated world. Companies Mentioned in This Article 8 Stocks You Can Count On During Any Crisis[1]Depending on how you look at it, the economic outlook is getting cloudier or clearer. The argument for a cloudy economy is easy to make. Multiple times of day we hear about more Americans testing positive for the novel coronavirus. The worldwide number of positive tests exceeds one million. And unfortunately, it will go higher. We just don't know by how much. But there are two parts to this ongoing situation. The first is the real-time science experiment as the world attempts to flatten the curve. The other is the very real economic impact. And the numbers of the economic carnage are coming in faster than any significant evidence of a flattening curve. The number of unemployed now exceeds six million and will only rise. The government is throwing everything including the kitchen sink at the problem. But it's an experiment in real-time. We won't know the results for some time. But even while we wait for a new normal to return, there are ways for you to profit. There are companies that are keeping our economy going now, and have a business model that sets them up well for success after the pandemic is over.

And that\u2019s a huge, powerful and important change that\u2019s paving the way for these regulatory actions. I mean, virtually all energy that goes in to legislation or regulation comes from public perception changing.</p><p>Q: Is the way to fix this through regulation?</p><p>A: I think these companies are now so large that they are to some extent immune from the normal pressures of competitive forces that normal companies operate under. If a normal company that does not have a monopoly continues to do bad things to piss off large numbers of their partners, vendors and customers, those partners, vendors and customers will simply choose another option.</p><p>That can\u2019t happen when you have a monopoly. When there literally is no choice than to go through, say, the App Store to sell software to iPhone users. All you can do is kick and scream. And Apple knows this. T</p><p>What needs to happen is regulatory action, whether that is mandates on these companies' behaviors such as preventing them from monopoly abuses, of dictating terms of payment services, or, in Google\u2019s case, opening up their search index to other search engines so that they can use that.</p><p>Q: Can you talk about your Facebook Free campaign? What is it exactly?</p><p>A: So in 2018, well, in advance of what\u2019s been going on recently with the advertising boycott, BaseCamp came to the conclusion that we should not be voting for more Facebook in the world. We had run some tests, an advertising test in 2017 that used Facebook, and we felt icky doing that.</p><p>The Facebook machine is a massive engine of privacy and exploitation where targeted advertising violates the privacy of the recipients. And we thought, you know, why are we in this? Why are we doing this? Are we doing it just because everyone else is doing it? That\u2019s not a good reason. We need to stop.</p><p>So we decided we would not spend any advertising dollars on any of Facebook\u2019s platforms. We didn\u2019t want more Facebook in the world. In 2020, clearly, we\u2019re no longer early on that. And hopefully it will stick and hopefully it will help change what Facebook is and again, not so much because Facebook is afraid of losing this revenue, but because public opinion will be in part turned by this, which will again fuel legislative and regulatory actions so that we get out of this dystopian hellhole that is a Facebook dominated world.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APFINL-af14dfd38dec05c9131ad00db930aaa320200802</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APFINL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GY-5RS1-JC5B-G1RG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">288311</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"950\"/><timeReceived>3:01 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press Financial Wire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 2, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The Danish programmer is a successful entrepreneur who has testified before Congress to argue that Big Tech firms should be more regulated and started an anti-Facebook campaign. He is chief technology officer of BaseCamp, which makes workplace collaboration software, and is also the creator of a widely used software development framework called Ruby on Rails.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hansson spoke with The Associated Press to discuss remote work in the age of the pandemic and why Big Tech\u2019s power should be limited. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.</p><p>Q: Basecamp is mostly remote. Has the pandemic affected how you work?</p><p>A: So BaseCamp has been been remote for about 20 years and we have all the systems and processes in place to be able to make that a pleasant experience. But I think what\u2019s important to look at with the pandemic is that it\u2019s not just remote work, it\u2019s remote work during a pandemic. So we have a lot of parents at the company. About half the people at BaseCamp have families who all of a sudden have to deal with childcare at home or a spouse who has to share the one home office there. So the pandemic part of it has definitely been difficult.</p><p>Q: Now we\u2019ve been doing this for a few months, we\u2019ve seen many companies basically switch to remote mode. Have you seen other companies making mistakes switching to remote work?</p><p>A: The number one mistake I\u2019ve seen from other companies suddenly being forced to go remote has been that they tried to recreate the office remotely. So if what happened at the office was a bunch of meetings early on Monday morning, those just turned into some calls.</p><p>And this whole idea that you can recreate the office remotely is a nonstarter. It\u2019s not a great way to work. Most companies, when they work in the office, work in a very synchronous way that\u2019s dictated around a meeting schedule that mandates where people have to be at a certain time.</p><p>Getting rid of that and switching to an asynchronous work style where people don\u2019t have to be at a certain place at a certain time is the key to unlocking both the productivity and the sanity of anyone working remotely during a pandemic.</p><p>Q: You have been critical about companies like Apple and Google being monopolies. Why do you think they\u2019re dangerous?</p><p>A: The power that Google, Apple, Amazon, Facebook and others have right now to dictate the terms of the digital economy, to capture the lion\u2019s share of all economic activity is unprecedented, astounding and incredibly dangerous.</p><p>From 2000 to 2010, I think most people uncritically looked at these companies with just applause. Oh, isn\u2019t Google amazing? Isn\u2019t it wonderful we can connect to old classmates on Facebook? Look at all these wonderful devices. Apple is putting out.</p><p>That was the honeymoon phase where these companies faced very little critical reception. That\u2019s not the case anymore. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a lot of people who are just cheering on. Oh, isn\u2019t Facebook just universally amazing? Isn\u2019t it wonderful that Apple has an iron grip on all distribution of software to the iPhones in such a way that they can shake down individual software makers for 30 percent of the revenue?</p><p>I think some of these storylines now have taken over this uncritical applause that these companies used to have. And that\u2019s a huge, powerful and important change that\u2019s paving the way for these regulatory actions. I mean, virtually all energy that goes in to legislation or regulation comes from public perception changing.</p><p>Q: Is the way to fix this through regulation?</p><p>A: I think these companies are now so large that they are to some extent immune from the normal pressures of competitive forces that normal companies operate under. If a normal company that does not have a monopoly continues to do bad things to piss off large numbers of their partners, vendors and customers, those partners, vendors and customers will simply choose another option.</p><p>That can\u2019t happen when you have a monopoly. When there literally is no choice than to go through, say, the App Store to sell software to iPhone users. All you can do is kick and scream. And Apple knows this. T</p><p>What needs to happen is regulatory action, whether that is mandates on these companies' behaviors such as preventing them from monopoly abuses, of dictating terms of payment services, or, in Google\u2019s case, opening up their search index to other search engines so that they can use that.</p><p>Q: Can you talk about your Facebook Free campaign? What is it exactly?</p><p>A: So in 2018, well, in advance of what\u2019s been going on recently with the advertising boycott, BaseCamp came to the conclusion that we should not be voting for more Facebook in the world. We had run some tests, an advertising test in 2017 that used Facebook, and we felt icky doing that.</p><p>The Facebook machine is a massive engine of privacy and exploitation where targeted advertising violates the privacy of the recipients. And we thought, you know, why are we in this? Why are we doing this? Are we doing it just because everyone else is doing it? That\u2019s not a good reason. We need to stop.</p><p>So we decided we would not spend any advertising dollars on any of Facebook\u2019s platforms. We didn\u2019t want more Facebook in the world. In 2020, clearly, we\u2019re no longer early on that.

The Danish programmer is a successful entrepreneur who has testified before Congress to argue that Big Tech firms should be more regulated and started an anti-Facebook campaign. He is chief technology officer of BaseCamp, which makes workplace collaboration software, and is also the creator of a widely used software development framework called Ruby on Rails.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hansson spoke with The Associated Press to discuss remote work in the age of the pandemic and why Big Tech's power should be limited. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.</p><p> Q: Basecamp is mostly remote. Has the pandemic affected how you work?</p><p> A: So BaseCamp has been been remote for about 20 years and we have all the systems and processes in place to be able to make that a pleasant experience. But I think what's important to look at with the pandemic is that it's not just remote work, it's remote work during a pandemic. So we have a lot of parents at the company. About half the people at BaseCamp have families who all of a sudden have to deal with childcare at home or a spouse who has to share the one home office there. So the pandemic part of it has definitely been difficult.</p><p> Q: Now we've been doing this for a few months, we've seen many companies basically switch to remote mode. Have you seen other companies making mistakes switching to remote work?</p><p> A: The number one mistake I've seen from other companies suddenly being forced to go remote has been that they tried to recreate the office remotely. So if what happened at the office was a bunch of meetings early on Monday morning, those just turned into some calls.</p><p> And this whole idea that you can recreate the office remotely is a nonstarter. It's not a great way to work. Most companies, when they work in the office, work in a very synchronous way that's dictated around a meeting schedule that mandates where people have to be at a certain time.</p><p> Getting rid of that and switching to an asynchronous work style where people don't have to be at a certain place at a certain time is the key to unlocking both the productivity and the sanity of anyone working remotely during a pandemic.</p><p> Q: You have been critical about companies like Apple and Google being monopolies. Why do you think they're dangerous?</p><p> A: The power that Google, Apple, Amazon, Facebook and others have right now to dictate the terms of the digital economy, to capture the lion's share of all economic activity is unprecedented, astounding and incredibly dangerous.</p><p> From 2000 to 2010, I think most people uncritically looked at these companies with just applause. Oh, isn't Google amazing? Isn't it wonderful we can connect to old classmates on Facebook? Look at all these wonderful devices. Apple is putting out.</p><p> That was the honeymoon phase where these companies faced very little critical reception. That's not the case anymore. I don't think there's a lot of people who are just cheering on. Oh, isn't Facebook just universally amazing? Isn't it wonderful that Apple has an iron grip on all distribution of software to the iPhones in such a way that they can shake down individual software makers for 30 percent of the revenue?</p><p> I think some of these storylines now have taken over this uncritical applause that these companies used to have. And that's a huge, powerful and important change that's paving the way for these regulatory actions. I mean, virtually all energy that goes in to legislation or regulation comes from public perception changing.</p><p> Q: Is the way to fix this through regulation?</p><p> A: I think these companies are now so large that they are to some extent immune from the normal pressures of competitive forces that normal companies operate under. If a normal company that does not have a monopoly continues to do bad things to piss off large numbers of their partners, vendors and customers, those partners, vendors and customers will simply choose another option.</p><p> That can't happen when you have a monopoly. When there literally is no choice than to go through, say, the App Store to sell software to iPhone users All you can do is kick and scream. And Apple knows this. T</p><p> What needs to happen is regulatory action, whether that is mandates on these companies' behaviors such as preventing them from monopoly abuses, of dictating terms of payment services, or, in Google's case, opening up their search index to other search engines so that they can use that.</p><p> Q: Can you talk about your Facebook Free campaign? What is it exactly?</p><p> A: So in 2018, well, in advance of what's been going on recently with the advertising boycott, BaseCamp came to the conclusion that we should not be voting for more Facebook in the world. We had run some tests, an advertising test in 2017 that used Facebook, and we felt icky doing that.</p><p> The Facebook machine is a massive engine of privacy and exploitation where targeted advertising violates the privacy of the recipients. And we thought, you know, why are we in this? Why are we doing this? Are we doing it just because everyone else is doing it? That's not a good reason. We need to stop.</p><p> So we decided we would not spend any advertising dollars on any of Facebook's platforms. We didn't want more Facebook in the world. In 2020, clearly, we're no longer early on that. And hopefully it will stick and hopefully it will help change what Facebook is and again, not so much because Facebook is afraid of losing this revenue, but because public opinion will be in part turned by this, which will again fuel legislative and regulatory actions so that we get out of this dystopian hellhole that is a Facebook dominated world.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKOK-af21e665f7e23c3307feeb23bd742edcdfdbb68</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28974E9D92ED57 NWBKOK2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60H4-SJ61-DXVP-V3HP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401975</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"953\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Alva Review-Courier<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

The Danish programmer is a successful entrepreneur who has testified before Congress to argue that Big Tech firms should be more regulated and started an anti-Facebook campaign. He is chief technology officer of BaseCamp, which makes workplace collaboration software, and is also the creator of a widely used software development framework called Ruby on Rails.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hansson spoke with The Associated Press to discuss remote work in the age of the pandemic and why Big Tech\u2019s power should be limited. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.</p><p>Q: Basecamp is mostly remote. Has the pandemic affected how you work?</p><p>A: So BaseCamp has been been remote for about 20 years and we have all the systems and processes in place to be able to make that a pleasant experience. But I think what\u2019s important to look at with the pandemic is that it\u2019s not just remote work, it\u2019s remote work during a pandemic. So we have a lot of parents at the company. About half the people at BaseCamp have families who all of a sudden have to deal with childcare at home or a spouse who has to share the one home office there. So the pandemic part of it has definitely been difficult.</p><p>Q: Now we\u2019ve been doing this for a few months, we\u2019ve seen many companies basically switch to remote mode. Have you seen other companies making mistakes switching to remote work?</p><p>A: The number one mistake I\u2019ve seen from other companies suddenly being forced to go remote has been that they tried to recreate the office remotely. So if what happened at the office was a bunch of meetings early on Monday morning, those just turned into some calls.</p><p>And this whole idea that you can recreate the office remotely is a nonstarter. It\u2019s not a great way to work. Most companies, when they work in the office, work in a very synchronous way that\u2019s dictated around a meeting schedule that mandates where people have to be at a certain time.</p><p>Getting rid of that and switching to an asynchronous work style where people don\u2019t have to be at a certain place at a certain time is the key to unlocking both the productivity and the sanity of anyone working remotely during a pandemic.</p><p>Q: You have been critical about companies like Apple and Google being monopolies. Why do you think they\u2019re dangerous?</p><p>A: The power that Google, Apple, Amazon, Facebook and others have right now to dictate the terms of the digital economy, to capture the lion\u2019s share of all economic activity is unprecedented, astounding and incredibly dangerous.</p><p>From 2000 to 2010, I think most people uncritically looked at these companies with just applause. Oh, isn\u2019t Google amazing? Isn\u2019t it wonderful we can connect to old classmates on Facebook? Look at all these wonderful devices. Apple is putting out.</p><p>That was the honeymoon phase where these companies faced very little critical reception. That\u2019s not the case anymore. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a lot of people who are just cheering on. Oh, isn\u2019t Facebook just universally amazing? Isn\u2019t it wonderful that Apple has an iron grip on all distribution of software to the iPhones in such a way that they can shake down individual software makers for 30 percent of the revenue?</p><p>I think some of these storylines now have taken over this uncritical applause that these companies used to have. And that\u2019s a huge, powerful and important change that\u2019s paving the way for these regulatory actions. I mean, virtually all energy that goes in to legislation or regulation comes from public perception changing.</p><p>Q: Is the way to fix this through regulation?</p><p>A: I think these companies are now so large that they are to some extent immune from the normal pressures of competitive forces that normal companies operate under. If a normal company that does not have a monopoly continues to do bad things to piss off large numbers of their partners, vendors and customers, those partners, vendors and customers will simply choose another option.</p><p>That can\u2019t happen when you have a monopoly. When there literally is no choice than to go through, say, the App Store to sell software to iPhone users. All you can do is kick and scream. And Apple knows this. T</p><p>What needs to happen is regulatory action, whether that is mandates on these companies' behaviors such as preventing them from monopoly abuses, of dictating terms of payment services, or, in Google\u2019s case, opening up their search index to other search engines so that they can use that.</p><p>Q: Can you talk about your Facebook Free campaign? What is it exactly?</p><p>A: So in 2018, well, in advance of what\u2019s been going on recently with the advertising boycott, BaseCamp came to the conclusion that we should not be voting for more Facebook in the world. We had run some tests, an advertising test in 2017 that used Facebook, and we felt icky doing that.</p><p>The Facebook machine is a massive engine of privacy and exploitation where targeted advertising violates the privacy of the recipients. And we thought, you know, why are we in this? Why are we doing this? Are we doing it just because everyone else is doing it? That\u2019s not a good reason. We need to stop.</p><p>So we decided we would not spend any advertising dollars on any of Facebook\u2019s platforms. We didn\u2019t want more Facebook in the world. In 2020, clearly, we\u2019re no longer early on that. And hopefully it will stick and hopefully it will help change what Facebook is and again, not so much because Facebook is afraid of losing this revenue, but because public opinion will be in part turned by this, which will again fuel legislative and regulatory actions so that we get out of this dystopian hellhole that is a Facebook dominated world.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APE-af14dfd38dec05c9131ad00db930aaa320200802</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GY-5RW1-JC5B-G1RV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304478</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"950\"/><timeReceived>3:01 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Associated Press</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 2, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The interview has been edited for length and clarity.</p><p>Q: Basecamp is mostly remote. Has the pandemic affected how you work?</p><p>A:</p><p>So BaseCamp has been been remote for about 20 years and we have all the systems and processes in place to be able to make that a pleasant experience. But I think what's important to look at with the pandemic is that it's not just remote work, it's remote work during a pandemic. So we have a lot of parents at the company.</p><p>About half the people at BaseCamp have families who all of a sudden have to deal with childcare at home or a spouse who has to share the one home office there. So the pandemic part of it has definitely been difficult.</p><p>Q: Now we've been doing this for a few months, we've seen many companies basically switch to remote mode. Have you seen other companies making mistakes switching to remote work?</p><p>A: The number one mistake I've seen from other companies suddenly being forced to go remote has been that they tried to recreate the office remotely.</p><p>So if what happened at the office was a bunch of meetings early on Monday morning, those just turned into some calls.</p><p>And this whole idea that you can recreate the office remotely is a nonstarter.</p><p>It's not a great way to work. Most companies, when they work in the office, work in a very synchronous way that's dictated around a meeting schedule that mandates where people have to be at a certain time.</p><p>Getting rid of that and switching to an asynchronous work style where people don't have to be at a certain place at a certain time is the key to unlocking both the productivity and the sanity of anyone working remotely during a pandemic.

Over that time, they've been begging the federal government to help them survive by forcing the tech giants to share their revenue.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, the Liberals are pledging to do just that. But will that help actually materialize, and will it be enough?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault first raised hopes in the Canadian news industry this month in interviews where he labelled the refusal by tech companies to share ad revenue with publishers as \"immoral and unacceptable.\" He also voiced support for Australia's ongoing effort to force such payments and decried Facebook's obstinance there, in particular, as \"bullying.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Then, just this past Wednesday, the government doubled down on its stance in the throne speech, which was delivered by Gov. General Julie Payette.</p><p>\"Web giants are taking Canadians' money while imposing their own priorities. Things must change and will change,\" she read. \"The government will act to ensure their revenue is shared more fairly with our creators and media and will also require them to contribute to the creation, production and distribution of our stories, on screen, in lyrics, in music and in writing.\"</p><p>The speech lacked specifics, however, leaving some in the embattled media industry to wonder if their optimism might be misplaced.</p><p>\"They've talked about them paying their fair share, but the language has been very ambiguous,\" says Daniel Bernhard, executive director at journalism and broadcasting advocacy group Friends of Canadian Broadcasting. \"I remain hopeful, but I wouldn't call myself expectant or optimistic.\"</p><p>Bernhard points out that the government has been talking tough about the tech industry without meaningful action for years. Until that changes, the Canadian news industry's collective eyes will remain glued to Australia.</p><p>The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission - or ACCC - is in the process of finalizing a code of conduct bill for a parliamentary vote. The rules would require the tech companies to negotiate terms for hosting snippets of news stories on their platforms. If agreements cannot be reached, an arbitrator would determine payments.</p><p>The rules would also require the companies to provide reasonable advance notice of changes to algorithms that would affect news rankings and presentations, to give publishers an adequate chance to adjust their offerings.</p><p>Google has responded by informing users in Australia that the new terms would degrade some of its services. Facebook has gone further by threatening to remove local and international news from its platforms there, which includes Instagram.</p><p>In its assessment published this month, the Dallas-based International News Media Association suggested the companies are making threats because Australia's rules could easily be emulated in other countries.</p><p>\"Because of the global nature of the Big Tech platforms, the highest bar for regulation becomes a global standard,\" the organization said in a blog post. \"The outcome in Australia will become the new bar for every country's publishers seeking an equitable financial relationship with Facebook and others.\"</p><p>The ACCC is being supported by Australian news organizations such as Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. The Canadian government has similarly been lobbied by Canadian publishers including yhe Globe and Mail, Postmedia and Toronto Star parent Torstar, who in May collectively wrote an open letter urging immediate action that would force revenue sharing.</p><p>Advertising revenue at news organizations has been in decline for years and has been exasperated by the COVID-19 pandemic, the publishers said. Conversely, ad revenue has been climbing for the tech companies. Facebook, for example, posted ad revenue of $17.7 billion (U.S.) in the first quarter of 2020, up 17 per cent from $15 billion a year earlier.</p><p>Together, Google and Facebook accounted for 78.3 per cent of the $7.6 billion online advertising market in Canada and about 42 per cent of the total $14 billion in ad spend across all media in 2018, according to the Canadian Media Concentration Research Project (CMCRP).</p><p>At the crux of the dispute are the news-story snippets displayed on Facebook and other online platforms. News publishers say these summaries count as content that they have paid to produce and that are being used to draw users to the platforms.</p><p>\"It's driving eyeballs to their site so they can sell ads,\" says John Hinds, president and chief executive of News Media Canada, a trade association that represents daily, weekly and community newspapers of which all Torstar papers are members and pay fees.</p><p>\"Their business model is based on monetizing our content and we don't get any payment for it.\"</p><p>Facebook says Australia's proposed rules overestimate the value of news content on its platform, which is dwarfed by the traffic it sends back to publishers. The company says it sent 2.3 billion clicks to Australian news websites in the first five months of 2020.</p><p>In both Australia and Canada, the company says it would prefer to support news creation through the various programs it funds.</p><p>In Canada, for example, the company says it has invested $9 million over the past three years in partnerships, including programs with The Canadian Press, the Canadian Journalism Foundation and the Ryerson School of Journalism.</p><p>\"Removing news in Australia is not the outcome we've been working towards, it is our last choice,\" says Kevin Chan, global director and head of public policy for Facebook Canada.</p><p>\"We want to work with news organizations and governments to support the development of sustainable business models.\"</p><p>Other media observers say Australia's approach doesn't address the larger issue, which is that Facebook and Google have too much power when it comes to advertising and competition in general. Governments could be better served by looking at ways to curtail that dominance, which could include further enforcing privacy and antitrust laws.</p><p>\"There's an absolute need to deal with this,\" says Dwayne Winseck, a professor at the School of Journalism and Communication at Carleton University and head of the CMCRP. \"The data and privacy protection part of it is for real and the Australian approach doesn't deal with any of it.\"</p><p>Critics of both the Australian and Canadian stances also say that the countries' respective news industries are only going to hurt themselves by pushing for revenue sharing. If Facebook makes good on its threat to pull news, publishers could see declines in traffic.</p><p>\"If you lose those referrals for which they pay nothing, it seems likely to have an impact on the bottom line,\" says Michael Geist, the Canada Research Chair in internet and e-commerce law at the University of Ottawa. \"It'll be discouraging for many news organizations to find that their content is easily replaceable.\"</p><p>Google supports that view, saying that news-related queries account for a fraction of overall searches and therefore ad revenue. In Canada, news-related queries accounted for just 1.5 per cent of overall searches and $9 million in revenue from clicks on ads against those queries last year. Conversely, the company says it sends users to news sites 24 billion times a month globally.</p><p>A recent analysis by Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al media professor Jean-Hugues Roy suggests such numbers overstate the overall value the platforms deliver to news organizations. Facebook, for example, earns between 35 and 58 times more from news it hosts than publishers do from traffic sent their way, he wrote in a blog post.</p><p>Though many community papers support the Canadian government's stance, some newer, online-first publishers oppose the revenue-sharing plan and don't want to see the tech platforms block snippets because both would likely involve someone having to decide what qualifies as a news organization.</p><p>\"I certainly wouldn't be comfortable with Facebook making that determination,\" says Jesse Brown, publisher of independent news organization Canadaland. \"I have just as many problems with government making that determination.\"</p><p>Either way, media watchers don't expect the Canadian government to act quickly despite its tough posturing, which will likely leave Australia to do the heavy lifting.</p><p>\"Canadian governments have not had a great track record at striking out boldly to set a standard for cultural information,\" says Jeffrey Dvorkin, former director of the journalism program at the University of Toronto Scarborough Campus. \"They're going to wait to see whose heads get chopped off first.\"</p><p>Multinational tech giants keep getting bigger at the expense of domestic media and competitiveness. This ongoing series looks at the challenge for governments,</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2020092658963196</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60XM-RJ61-DY91-K553-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1452\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Toronto Star Newspapers Limited</copyright><publicationName>The Toronto Star</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 26, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>NEWSPAPER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>COLUMN</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

As more than 50 million Americans filed for unemployment insurance, billionaires became $637 billion richer. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's wealth has ballooned by 59 percent. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos' wealth has increased by 39 percent. Walmart's Walton family has added $25 billion.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Big drug company CEOs and their major investors are doing nicely, too. Since the start of the pandemic, Big Pharma has raised prices on 245 prescription drugs, 61 of which are being used to treat COVID-19.</p><p> Apologists say this is the \"free market\" responding to supply and demand \u2014 the barons of Big Tech, online retail and Big Pharma merely providing what consumers desperately need during the pandemic.</p><p> But the market also operates under laws that ban profiteering, price gouging and monopolizing, and that tax excess profits in wartime. Where did these laws go? The Trump administration hasn't enforced them.</p><p> Donald Trump is also ignoring laws that ban trades on insider information. The White House is distributing billions in subsidies and loans to select corporations \u2014 enabling CEOs and boards to load up on stocks and stock options just before deals are announced, then rake in fat profits after stock prices surge.</p><p> Insiders from at least 11 companies have sold shares worth more than $1 billion after such announcements, according to an analysis by the New York Times.</p><p> In late June, a San Francisco company called Vaxart announced that the Trump administration had selected it to develop a coronavirus vaccine. Presto. The value of stock options distributed to company insiders just weeks before increased sixfold, according to the Times. Stock options held by Vaxart's CEO went from $4.3 million to more than $28 million.</p><p> Moderna, based in Cambridge, Mass., has never brought a vaccine to market, but company insiders have sold some $248 million of shares \u2014 most of them after the company was selected in April to receive federal funding. (Moderna plans to sell its vaccine for profit even though taxpayers have footed its research and development.)</p><p> The most blatant instance involves the venerable old camera and film maker, Kodak. On July 28, Trump announced a $765 million loan to the firm to bring drug production back to the United States. He called it \"one of the most important deals in the history of the U.S. pharmaceutical industries,\" even though Kodak isn't even a pharmaceutical company.</p><p> Before the announcement, Kodak had handed its board of directors 240,000 stock options, and just the day before had given its CEO 1.75 million stock options. After Trump's announcement, Kodak shares shot up more than 2,757 percent. Suddenly, the board's stock options were worth about $4 million, and the CEO's about $50 million.</p><p> Is this sort of insider trading against the law? You bet. The Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into the deal, which is now temporarily on hold.</p><p> But the SEC's co-director of enforcement, Steven Peikin, who had been investigating several of the deals involving the White House and corporate insiders, including Kodak, resigned last week without explanation. Another in the lengthening list of independent regulators and inspectors general forced out by Trump?</p><p> This much is clear: Trump and his Republican enablers won't provide $600 per week to tens of millions of Americans who need the money to survive the pandemic, because Trump and the GOP believe the money undermines incentives to work. Yet Trump has no problem letting billionaires illegally profit off the pandemic. He thinks that as long as they buoy the stock market, they're helping the American economy.</p><p> That's pure rubbish. The stock market is not America. The richest 1 percent of Americans own half the value of all shares of stock held by American households. The richest 10 percent own 92 percent. For years now, stock prices have risen largely because profits have been siphoned from the wages of ordinary workers.</p><p> In the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, stock prices are almost back to where they were before the pandemic began. Big corporations and major investors are doing fine. Billionaires are doing better than ever. But most Americans are sinking fast.</p><p> This isn't just unfair. Much of it is illegal.</p><p> *</p><p> Robert Reich, former U.S. Secretary of Labor, is professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley and the author of \"Aftershock: The Next Economy and America's Future.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKOH-b4e2c8e5eb5ee7e72444f694ca8e93cdf4b1e</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289C09C422713A NWBKOH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60K8-GBY1-DXVP-V3D8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401973</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"749\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Sandusky Register<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

We did so because an understanding of the state of those events and affairs is so crucial to business, and because business has such an outsized influence on them. Public policy is, of course, foundational to how businesses operate and how economic developments unfold. And to make that policy and understand its effects, we must have a baseline of facts we can all generally agree upon, a shared vision of where we want to go and what we want to build, and what we need to invest in to build that future. Just this morning, the recent trajectory of current events and public affairs led the House of Representatives to announce two articles of impeachment against the sitting President of the United States. </p><p>That is an historic and monumental announcement, and one we should all keep a close eye on\u2014hopefully going beyond the headlines and chyrons crossing our television screens. But with partisanship and economic inequality at levels unseen since the Gilded Age, fact-based and clear-eyed examinations of current events too often get drowned out in the mudslinging, disinformation, and conspiracy theory that goes unchecked in our always-on information age. As Lewis Lapham wrote in his introduction to the latest issue of Lapham's Quarterly:[T]he incessant bombardment of new and newer news blows away the chance of knowing what most or any of it means, and darkens the approach to the value of our minds. The sound and fury of an instantly shattering Now carries away all thought of what happened yesterday, last week, two hundred or two thousand years ago.In sorting fact from fiction, it is imperative we remember the events and individuals that shaped the present moment. So, regardless of how he leaves office, I find it instructive to remember that the President came to office based largely on his signature policy proposal (if it can be called that) to 'build the wall'\u2014a fiscally irresponsible, physically improbable, and ultimately ineffectual solution to a problem that most economists see a solution to some of our economic challenges, immigration. Using immigration to stoke fear and division in not a new development in the United States\u2014read Erika Lee's recent book, America for Americans: A History of Xenophobia in the United States[1] for a thorough history\u2014but it isn't a solution to the real challenges we face as a nation, and increasingly as a species. What can help is investigating facts, establishing a shared reality, and believing that the truth still matters. That is a conversation worth having, and one that each of the following books helps foster.The Code: Silicon Valley and the Remaking of America[2] by Margaret O'Mara, Penguin Press University of Washington Professor Margaret O'Mara masterfully unfolds the history of Silicon Valley in the pages of The Code, showing how its rise intersected with both big government investment and free-market innovation, how intertwined the 'new economy' is with the old, and how global political forces and a small group of interconnected individuals helped shape it all. Through that story, we gain a greater understanding of how the investment made by the government in advanced electronics and information technology during the Cold War competition between 'American capitalist democracy and Soviet communism' created the conditions for the unprecedented growth of 'a pleasant and sleepy corner of Northern California' into an economic juggernaut that has given us:Three billion smartphones. Two billion social media users. Two trillion-dollar companies. San Francisco's tallest skyscraper, Seattle's biggest employer, the four most expensive corporate campuses on the planet. The richest people in the history of humanity.At a time that we're debating tuition-free higher education, it is instructive to remember that Stanford, the university at the center of Silicon Valley, began as a tuition-free educational institution founded by a railroad tycoon. At a time when the tech industry fights regulation, it is enlightening to learn that the environmental regulations signed into law by Richard Nixon actually created a hundred million dollar industry in the Valley for computer systems that analyzed environmental data. Such historical perspective is abundant in The Code, but the greatest achievement is how it helps us understand the present moment. In detailing how government policy and investment combined with entrepreneurial innovation can shape not only a region, but create an entire industry that reshapes the world and alters human civilization, the book is a great reminder that we can accomplish big things\u2014and do things differently. The next book on our list helps us understand why we should, in fact, do things differently. Don't Be Evil: How Big Tech Betrayed Its Founding Principles\u2014and All of Us[3] by Rana Foroohar, Currency Silicon Valley has always painted its intentions in a utopian hue: to connect humanity, democratize access to information, to disrupt an old order of entrenched power and usher in a new, more equitable and innovative age. But, as global business columnist and associate editor at the Financial Times Rana Foroohar lays out in her new book, 'the supposedly decentralized Internet economy has spawned a handful of ruthless oligopolies that have begun to use their power to undermine start-up growth, job creation, and labor markets.' In a final twist of the knife, the disruption to labor markets and local economies that these firms (and too much business literature) have so lauded over the last decade has created an even greater need for government investment to help lift up those left behind, investment that is dependent on tax revenue, tax revenue that Big Tech firms now actively avoid providing\u2014the kind of investment, again, that the industry's very roots were watered in\u2014by moving their intangible assets to countries in which they won't be taxed. It is a development that mirrors the deregulation of financial institutions that led to the Great Recession\u2014documented so well in Foroohar's previous book, Makers and Takers\u2014also sold as an opportunity for innovation and a new economy that ended in a similarly increased concentration of wealth and risk, political clout and privilege, and a lack of any real accountability. But Foroohar doesn't just point out the many transgressions coming out of Silicon Valley and the challenges they pose to us as a society, she also offers solutions, from a 'national commission on the future of data and digital technology' to a digital New Deal to ensure employment and 'remake the real economy for the digital age.' Moneyland: The Inside Story of the Crooks and Kleptocrats Who Rule the World[4] by Oliver Bullough, St. Martin's Press The financial chicanery described in Oliver Bulluogh's book is far more nefarious. Bullogh's Moneyland is another angle to view the deterioration of the postwar economic order and the rules established at Bretton Woods to govern it, which while far from perfect, at least had the benefit of some semblance of stability. Rather than repair it, that order was upended at first, in Bullough's telling, by a 'EuroBond' market established in 1960s England that made it easier for wealthy individuals to 'offshore' their money. Once that pattern was established, it propagated itself.  Today, the island of Nevis has more registered corporate entities based on it than human beings. St. Kitts pioneered the selling of passports that wealthy individuals use to skirt their own nation's laws. Some poorer nations are now offering diplomatic posts, along with the diplomatic passport and immunity it confers to the super rich, to get their share of this 'investment.' It has created an essentially lawless situation in which national security is undermined by dark money with connections to dictators, oligarchs, and even terrorism that is filtered into the financial institutions of the West\u2014where it is seen as safe (in large part, from prying investigative eyes) and is easily accessible. We need journalists like Oliver Bullough to uncover such corruption and kleptocracy, to help provide the facts that underpin fact-based investigations and dialogue about such transgressions. So it is alarming that Bullough has had an article he worked on and sourced for over two years (about an oligarch who had been able to avoid the 2014 sanctions that resulted from Russian's annexation of Crimea) that has never been read by the public, and a documentary film (about repairing Ukraine after the systematic looting that took place there by Viktor Yanukovych) that has never been shown\u2014both killed due to the threat of legal action in the UK. In light of that, we feel it's even more important to promote this investigative powerhouse of a book. Transaction Man: The Rise of the Deal and the Decline of the American Dream[5] by Nicholas Lemann, Farrar, Straus and Giroux As evidenced in the book's subtitle, Nicholas Lemann's book bemoans the decline of the American Dream. But to many, on both the left and the right, that dream was a nightmare. In the liberal critique, the industrial corporation that once dominated American work and life was seen as a breeding ground for conformity and the birth to the 'Organization Man'\u2014a term popularized by Fortune magazine reporter William H. White's book of the same name. The conservative criticism was that the industrial corporation had become too concerned with social forces rather than market forces, that their only focus should be on maximizing profit, not wellbeing. As the social revolutions of the 1960s and 1970s played out\u2014largely in response to the liberal critique of the system\u2014it was that second criticism, largely emanating from the University of Chicago, that would change the fundamental structure of our economy. Lemann's task in the book is to 'lay out the history of our move from an institution-oriented to a transaction-oriented society.' He does so through the stories of two men: Adolf Berle, who witnessed and warned against the rise of the modern industrial corporation while working on Wall Street in the 1920s, became an economic advisor to FDR and one of the architects of the New Deal, and who eventually championed the role of industrial corporations in creating widely-shared prosperity, and Michael C. Jensen, a graduate of the University of Chicago's economics department who was a prominent early booster of the idea of market efficiency and helped provide the intellectual basis for the shift in the balance of power from state regulation and control of the economy to unfettered financial markets. (A third shift, toward a network-oriented society, is examined through the person of Reid Hoffman at the end of the book.) Transaction Man is a history of the big ideas that have shaped the last century of the American economy, brought home with a story about their effect on the individual communities that make up America. It is about the decline of a New Deal that worked for many, but not all, and resurrecting a largely abandoned political philosophy that helped create social progress within the communities that comprise an ever shifting society: pluralism. Good Economics for Hard Times[6] by Abhijit V. Banerjee ...ther Duflo, PublicAffairs Abhijit V. Banerjee and Esther Duflo are a rare breed: academic economists that can write for a popular audience. They begin their new book focusing on immigration and trade, two topics that have geopolitical implications and spawn intense political debate and acrimony across the globe, but that most economists have reached a general consensus on: that 'immigration is good,' and 'free trade is better.' (There is, of course, a lot more nuance and depth to their case\u2014about 100 pages of it.) They go on to tackle even more existential economic issues: 'the future of growth, the causes of inequality, the challenges of climate change.' One of the larger concerns in regards to the future of growth ties in with Rana Foroohar's examination of Big Tech's disruption of job markets, which Banerhee and Duflo help us understand as the continuation of an ongoing development:Tech moguls are getting desperate to find ideas to solve the problems their technologies might cause. But we don't need to contemplate the future in order to get a sense of what happens when economic growth leaves behind a majority of a country's citizens. This has already happened\u2014in the United States since 1980.Their book is, like the others on this list, a way to cut through the noise of the daily news, to step outside it and examine the broader ground we stand on and understand the terrain both behind and in front of us. It is only through gaining such a bearing that we can make sound judgment and policy\u2014policy, for instance, in regards to how to structure tax cuts:Once again, this underscores the urgent need to set ideology aside and advocate for the things most economists agree on, based on recent research. In a policy world that has mostly abandoned reason, if we do not intervene we risk becoming irrelevant, so let's be clear. Tax cuts for the wealthy do not produce economic growth.On issues ranging from immigration and trade to the rise of automation, inequality, and nationalism worldwide, the simple fact is that 'too many politicians do not try to hide their contempt for the poor and disadvantaged,' and they use that contempt as a way to divide us rather than engage in a debate on the facts before us. It is a debate, the authors suggest, that we must all engage in, that must transcend allegiance to identity politics and put human dignity back at the center of our economic priorities and policy debate, because even these economists believe that 'Economics is too important to be left to economists.'

Here's the backstory of how it happened.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The advertising boycott battering Facebook is unlike anything the social-media giant has faced in its 16-year history: Three days in, 800 companies worldwide have pulled millions of dollars in advertising from the social network, with brands from Coca-Cola to Ford to global conglomerate Unilever demanding that Facebook monitor hate speech more aggressively.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With pullouts mounting and the company's name constantly tied to racism and hate in the news coverage, CEO Mark Zuckerberg responded by livestreaming part of an employee meeting - one of the few times he's done that in the company's history. Then, on Wednesday, Facebook's powerhouse policy and communications chief, former British Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, issued an open letter, titled \"Facebook does not benefit from hate,\" touting its efforts to police its content.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The boycott has emerged as a crucial test for a company that has become a key player in American politics simply because of what it hosts and promotes on its site, and which until recently had been vocally doubling down on its commitment to keeping an open platform for users' speech. </p><p>It is also a behind-the-scenes triumph for a novel coalition of civil rights groups and other advocacy organizations - the architects of the #StopHateForProfit campaign that many of the boycotting companies have signed on to. </p><p>Interviews with leaders of the nine coalition partners reveal how the groups spun up a boycott idea in a matter of days, responding to the George Floyd protests late this spring and using public energy to join together several long-simmering, frustrated efforts to hold Facebook to account for its content. They lobbied corporate leaders in private and, in some cases, shamed companies on social media to join the effort.</p><p>\"[Facebook] is a breeding ground for racial hate groups,\" says Derrick Johnson, president of the NAACP, one of the groups that made up the coalition. Referring to Zuckerberg, he said, \"You can't reason with the guy.\"</p><p>In short order, the coalition has emerged as perhaps Facebook's most formidable antagonist, when little else - not Congress, not European regulators, not public declarations by celebrities that they were deleting their Facebook accounts - has had much effect on how the site operates. And their campaign might offer a blueprint for how activist groups can tackle a modern tech giant: fusing novel pressure tactics with the weight of legacy civil rights groups. </p><p>It remains to be seen whether Facebook will really be dented, either financially or as a brand. The company declined to comment for this article except to point to a statement issued in response to the boycott, saying Facebook \"invest[s] billions of dollars each year to keep our community safe and continuously work[s] with outside experts to review and update our policies,\" and that it is taking steps to address hate. The statement added, \"we know we have more work to do.\" So far, the company hasn't made major concessions, though. And while its stock price has dipped sharply, Zuckerberg - who has long defended the platform as a space for free expression - reportedly has said advertisers would be back \"soon enough.\" Analysts likewise say Facebook can weather the storm; most of its ads come from small and medium-size buyers, not the large corporations making boycott headlines, and Bloomberg researchers predicted Monday that the boycotts could cost Facebook only $250 million in ad sales - a sliver of the company's $77 billion in annual revenue.</p><p>But a look at the origins and dynamics of StopHateForProfit suggests the campaign has at least one insight that people often forget when it comes to a tech behemoth with the Silicon Valley sheen of Facebook: At the end of the day, the social network is just an advertising vehicle, with 98 percent of its revenue coming from ads. And like old-line pressure campaigns against TV networks or newspapers, if you can get to the advertisers, the company has to pay attention.</p><p>While the boycott came together quickly, its roots trace back to the 2016 election. Amid widespread outrage over the role Facebook had played, one complaint was that Russians were using the site to exploit America's racial tensions. But the site wasn't just amplifying them, activists came to believe. It was a petri dish for racism and discrimination; it was growing hate. And, by taking a largely hands-off approach, Facebook wasn't taking the issue seriously, the activists decided. </p><p>In the months after Donald Trump was sworn in as president, civil rights groups and other social justice organizations began quietly comparing notes about their interactions with Facebook and Silicon Valley more broadly.</p><p>\"The conversations started really informally, just collecting information. But what we learned was that we were getting played by Facebook and other big tech companies,\" says Jessica Gonz\u00e1lez, co-CEO of the left-leaning media advocacy organization Free Press. \"They had a very strategic appeasement strategy, where they gave us breadcrumbs, but in a way that made it look like they were doing such great work when in fact hate and disinformation were rampant on their site.\"</p><p>The advocates tried to figure out how to get Facebook and other tech companies to take their complaints more seriously. Campaigns to get users to stay away from the platform, or to allow civil rights groups to alert the companies of hateful activities, largely sputtered. In 2018, Facebook announced it would undergo an audit to better understand how it was affecting communities of color and other marginalized groups, led by Laura Murphy, a highly regarded civil rights advocate. But a pivotal five-week stretch this past fall largely erased whatever goodwill was left.</p><p>On a Tuesday afternoon in late September, Clegg, Facebook's head of policy and communications, announced the company was exempting politicians' ads from its fact-checking process, arguing that the public should be able to see, and vet, what political leaders say. Clegg told me in an interview at the time that it was long-standing policy but that, \"The purpose of it, I hope, was pretty clear, which was: This is what we're doing ahead of 2020. These are our plans.\"</p><p>Facebook's critics took umbrage at both what Clegg said - revealing, they thought, that Facebook failed to grasp the history of American politicians stoking racial divisions - and when he said it. Color of Change, which was founded in the wake of Hurricane Katrina to organize African Americans online, and other groups had been working for months to pull together an event, called \"Civil Rights x Tech,\" with Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg; it was scheduled for just two days after Clegg's speech. At the summit, against a backdrop of soaring brick walls and exposed piping in an events space in Atlanta's West Midtown, Sandberg and Neil Potts, a Facebook public policy director, were pressed on what Clegg had said and reassured the advocates, Gonz\u00e1lez told me.</p><p>Two weeks later, Facebook announced that Zuckerberg would deliver a speech at Georgetown University laying out his thinking on \"free expression.\" He and Clegg previewed the speech with some of the civil rights leaders. Zuckerberg would be doubling down on the politicians' exemption, while daring to draw a connection between Facebook and the importance of free speech in U.S. civil rights history, from Frederick Douglass to Martin Luther King Jr.</p><p>\"I warned him of the perils of doing that,\" says Vanita Gupta, president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. </p><p>Zuckerberg did it anyway, in a dramatic 37-minute speech on Oct. 17 from Georgetown's Gaston Hall. Afterward, the advocates concluded that the CEO believed, deep in his bones, that his commitment to free expression - even if it aligned him with the most virulent strains of American society - was right, regardless of what Sandberg had said in Atlanta. \"[Sandberg] seems sincere. She's certainly good at her job. But the fact of the matter is, at the end of the day, the buck stops with Zuckerberg and the board of directors,\" Gonz\u00e1lez told me.</p><p>After the speech sparked a firestorm, Zuckerberg convened a dinner with civil rights leaders at his home in Palo Alto, Calif., in early November. \"The last time I was in a room with all of those leaders, the other person at the table was Barack Obama,\" Rashad Robinson, executive director of Color of Change, told me last fall. It was a pleasant enough discussion, but he said it solidified for him that civil rights weren't a priority at Facebook's highest levels. </p><p>For Gupta, the fall of 2019 led her to believe Facebook had embraced a moral equivalence between civil rights groups and far-right conservatives, as two constituencies the company simply needed to placate - an approach she says she saw as part of a \"structural deficiency\" Facebook was unwilling to address.</p><p>The advocates went into the winter more worried than ever, and trying to figure out what to do next.</p><p> In late May, after the death of George Floyd at the hands of police in Minneapolis triggered a revival in the Black Lives Matter movement, then protests, then widespread public outrage, civil rights advocates found themselves on a conference call with Zuckerberg that would turn out to be a key moment in developing the boycott plan. </p><p>It started on May 29, when Trump posted - on Twitter and Facebook - a note about a possible federal response to protests in Minnesota: \"Any difficulty and we will assume control, but when the looting starts, the shooting starts.\" Trump would later say he was simply warning that looting can lead to violence, though many saw the tweet as a dog whistle.</p><p>Twitter, which already had begun taking a harder line on Trump's tweets, attached a warning label to the post stating it violated the site's rules against \"glorifying violence,\" but that \"Twitter has determined that it may be in the public's interest for the Tweet to remain accessible.\" Zuckerberg, meanwhile, ruled that Trump's post hadn't violated his site's policies on violence speech, and said that if it had, Facebook would have taken it down. \"Unlike Twitter, we do not have a policy of putting a warning in front of posts that may incite violence because we believe that if a post incites violence, it should be removed regardless of whether it is newsworthy, even if it comes from a politician,\" Zuckerberg wrote on Facebook.</p><p>The swipe at Twitter, which, in the eyes of advocates, had taken the post more seriously, irked them. \"When Mark Zuckerberg criticized Jack Dorsey for that, we realized we had even more of a serious problem than we thought,\" Johnson, the NAACP president, told me. Reports that Zuckerberg had talked over his decision with Trump himself didn't help. </p><p>On Monday, June 1, came the conference call. It was a prescheduled conversation, in which Zuckerberg planned to talk with civil rights leaders about Facebook's preparation for the 2020 election, but the topic of Trump's posts came up too. Trump also had floated theories about how Democrats were trying to \"rig\" the 2020 election by promoting the use of mail-in ballots during the coronavirus pandemic. Facebook had said in a statement that it didn't touch Trump's post because, when it came in elections, it believed in \"robust debate.\" </p><p>\"I'm seeing Mark's face as he's trying to explain to Sherrilyn Ifill\" - president of the NAACP's Legal Defense and Educational Fund - \"why something isn't voter suppression. He's trying to talk down one of the most important voting rights litigators in the country,\" Robinson told me. Gupta says she went into the call eager to hear Zuckerberg's rationale for dealing with the posts. But she told me, \"I was completely dissatisfied with it. It was completely confounding and did not make sense.\"</p><p>For Robinson, it was a turning point. \"What are we doing here? I don't understand why I keep coming to these meetings with you all,\" he remembers saying on the call. \"I said to [Zuckerberg], and Sheryl, and Nick Clegg, and [global policy director] Joel Kaplan, 'I feel like we have to do some other pivot.' I'm saying to them that I'm going to have to go another route.\" Gupta was similarly frustrated, yet she determined that the advocates couldn't just \"throw up our hands and walk away and just say, 'Screw it.'\"</p><p>At those same moments, another set of advocacy groups was beginning to have conversations about where to go next. Among them was Sleeping Giants, a loose, semi-anonymous online collective that calls itself \"a campaign to make bigotry and sexism less profitable.\" The group had developed a reputation for taking down powerful targets with a fairly simple tactic: show their advertisers exactly what their ad dollars are supporting and quickly gin up, using social media, public pressure to get them to stop. Starting in 2016, the group had waged successful campaigns against Breitbart News and Bill O'Reilly.</p><p>Now, as company after company put out its own statement supporting Black Lives Matter amid protests across the country, an opening for a similar strategy emerged with Facebook. If corporations were really serious about fighting racism, then why not back away from advertising on Facebook for hosting racist speech?</p><p>Jim Steyer, who heads Common Sense Media, a group focused on improving the media landscape for families and children, knew Matt Rivitz, one of the two leaders of Sleeping Giants, and they had a conversation with Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League. Along with Common Sense, the ADL began spreading word through progressive political circles that their small coalition was thinking of pushing for a one-month ad boycott of Facebook. </p><p>At the same time, Robinson and Color of Change were contemplating something similar and, after hearing about the ADL-tied effort, decided to join forces. Mozilla - the somewhat strange hybrid of tech company and online advocacy organization, which had long criticized Facebook's handling of its users' data and privacy - had worked with Common Sense in the past, and got pulled in. Others did too: the NAACP, the media advocacy group Free Press and, later, the League of United Latin American Citizens and the National Hispanic Media Coalition. Brenda Victoria Castillo, president of the NHMC, told me her group joined the coalition to make sure Latinx voices were represented - to leverage their strength: \"We have $1.7 trillion buying power, and advertisers listen to those statistics.\" (The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, led by Gupta, has not joined the boycott call. A spokesperson for the group said no one was available to discuss why.)</p><p>\"We felt like, 'What else do we have to lose here?'\" the NAACP's Johnson says. \"We've been speaking out and meeting with the company to no avail. We thought, 'We need to do something.'\"</p><p>Not long after Zuckerberg's conference call, the campaign had a name: #StopHateForProfit. \"It was so quick, it was crazy,\" Rivitz says. \"It was an idea and then it was, 'Hold on, we've got to talk to other people.' And then it was, 'Let's go.'\" They settled on a one-month boycott, a limit they hoped would force corporations to act fast. Plus, even if ad budgets were expected to be down in July anyway, with the country still suffering through the coronavirus and its economic fallout, the tight timeline meant companies could handle whatever lost revenue might come from ditching what is a widely popular means of digital marketing for them.</p><p>Just before it launched, the campaign got a prominent boost. At an online event on June 16, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a strong Facebook critic, said, \"Advertisers have tremendous leverage\" over the company, and \"I would say to them, know your power.\" The next day, StopHateForProfit trumpeted the same message in an ad in the Los Angeles Times. (While he wouldn't tell me if it was a coincidence, Jim Steyer pointed out that he and his brother - billionaire and former presidential candidate Tom Steyer - are close with Pelosi and her staff, and called the speaker's message \"very timely.\")</p><p>The campaign officially began on June 17, with Sleeping Giants tweeting out the #StopHateForProfit hashtag to its more than 300,000 followers, calling on companies to join. Two days later, North Face was the first to sign up, saying it would stay off Facebook \"until stricter policies are put in place to stop racist, violent or hateful content and misinformation from circulating on the platform.\" REI and Patagonia quickly followed. The other coalition partners worked their networks, too, both privately and publicly. The ADL, a Jewish organization founded in 1913, began circulating images showing advertisers Facebook posts alongside their ads. One Geico ad, for example, sat next to a post calling financier and philanthropist George Soros, a frequent target of anti-Semitism, \"the face of evil.\"</p><p>Robinson told me he and Johnson did a video call with the CEO of Ben &amp; Jerry's and discussed the ice cream maker not just joining the boycott, but also calling on Unilever, the multinational conglomerate that owns Ben &amp; Jerry's, to join. On June 23, Ben &amp; Jerry's put out a powerful statement. Three days later, Unilever announced it would stop advertising on not just Facebook and Instagram, but Twitter, too, at least through the end of the year, citing corporate responsibility pledges and \"the polarized atmosphere in the U.S.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, representatives from Mozilla reached out to the tech world, to explain how the company had stopped advertising on Facebook in 2018 and \"how we've reinvested our own marketing dollars,\" Mary Ellen Muckerman, the company's interim chief marketing officer, told me. </p><p>\"You know, it's always, like, 'fly by the seat of your pants and see what works,'\" Rivitz of the launch. But this was a pretty good start.</p><p>So far, the advertiser pull-outs represent only a fraction of Facebook's revenue - analysts said at the start of this week that they still expect the company to have a strong quarter, with some $17 billion in sales - but the PR blitz and creeping sense that the site was becoming toxic to ad buyers got the site's attention.</p><p>The boycott organizers had hoped that keeping the push limited to a month would act as a forming mechanism, pushing Facebook to make quick changes. The coalition came up with 10 specific demands, among them installing a high-level executive with civil rights expertise, doing away with the fact-checking exemption for politicians' speech and creating human points of contact for Facebook users experiencing identity-based harassment. </p><p>On the same day the campaign for the boycott launched, someone close to the situation tells me, Facebook called a rush meeting that pulled in officials from across teams - including its marketing, policy and legal operations - to discuss what to do.</p><p>Then, on June 24, Sandberg emailed Johnson, Greenblatt and Robinson, according to a copy of the email seen by POLITICO. \"At Facebook, we stand against racism and discrimination of any kind,\" she wrote. \"We are working to understand and address the concerns you outlined in your #StopHateforProfit campaign.\" She mentioned the civil rights audit, \"which has been in progress for two years,\" and asked to continue the discussion in a meeting with her and Chris Cox, a Facebook veteran close to Zuckerberg who recently returned to the company to serve as chief product officer. </p><p>Two days later, in a rare move, Zuckerberg opened up the first few minutes of an employee meeting to announce some fairly minor changes to the company's handling of elections and political content, such as banning posts that falsely claim that immigration officials will be visiting polling places and labeling some politicians' posts that violate the site's rules. The company also announced it would undergo a marketing audit that would examine, among other things, how safe its platform is for advertisers. And it removed hundreds of accounts associated with the so-called Boogaloo Boys, a far-right movement that sprung up around the George Floyd protests. The company published a list detailing how it is addressing or otherwise thinking about some of what boycott organizers had asked for. Clegg also issued his open letter, saying both that \"Facebook does not profit from hate\" and \"We may never be able to prevent hate from appearing on Facebook entirely, but we are getting better at stopping it all the time.\" </p><p>The boycott organizers say it's not enough - that the changes are too small and Facebook's explanations too vague to satisfy them yet.</p><p>In response to Sandberg's email, the advocates pressed to meet with Zuckerberg himself, not just Sandberg.

Here's the backstory of how it happened.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The advertising boycott battering Facebook is unlike anything the social-media giant has faced in its 16-year history: Three days in, 800 companies worldwide have pulled millions of dollars in advertising from the social network, with brands from Coca-Cola to Ford to global conglomerate Unilever demanding that Facebook monitor hate speech more aggressively.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With pullouts mounting and the company's name constantly tied to racism and hate in the news coverage, CEO Mark Zuckerberg responded by live-streaming part of an employee meeting - one of the few times he's done that in the company's history. Then, on Wednesday, Facebook's powerhouse policy and communications chief, former British deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, issued an open letter, titled \"Facebook does not benefit from hate,\" touting its efforts to police its content.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The boycott has emerged as a crucial test for a company that has become a key player in American politics simply because of what it hosts and promotes on its site, and which until recently had been vocally doubling down on its commitment to keeping an open platform for users' speech. </p><p>It is also a behind-the-scenes triumph for a novel coalition of civil rights groups and other advocacy organizations - the architects of the #StopHateForProfit campaign that many of the boycotting companies have signed onto. </p><p>Interviews with leaders of the nine coalition partners reveal how the groups spun up a boycott idea in a matter of days, responding to the George Floyd protests late this spring and using public energy to join together several long-simmering, frustrated efforts to hold Facebook to account for its content. They lobbied corporate leaders in private and, in some cases, shamed companies on social media to join the effort.</p><p>\"[Facebook] is a breeding ground for racial hate groups,\" says Derrick Johnson, president of the NAACP, one of the groups that made up the coalition. Referring to Zuckerberg, he said, \"You can't reason with the guy.\"</p><p>In short order, the coalition has emerged as perhaps Facebook's most formidable antagonist, when little else - not Congress, not European regulators, not public declarations by celebrities that they were once and truly deleting their Facebook accounts - has had much effect on how the site operates. And their campaign might offer a blueprint for how activist groups can tackle a modern tech giant: fusing novel pressure tactics with the weight of legacy civil rights groups. </p><p>It remains to be seen whether Facebook will really be dented, either financially or as a brand. The company declined to comment for this article except to point to a statement issued in response to the boycott, saying Facebook \"invest[s] billions of dollars each year to keep our community safe and continuously work[s] with outside experts to review and update our policies,\" and that it is taking steps to address hate. The statement added, \"we know we have more work to do.\" So far, the company hasn't made major concessions, though. And while its stock price has dipped sharply, Zuckerberg - who has long defended the platform as a space for free expression - reportedly has said advertisers would be back \"soon enough.\" Analysts likewise say Facebook can weather the storm; most of its ads come from small and medium-size buyers, not the large corporations making boycott headlines, and Bloomberg researchers predicted Monday that the boycotts could cost Facebook only $250 million in ad sales - a sliver of the company's $77 billion in annual revenue.</p><p>But a look at the origins and dynamics of StopHateForProfit suggests the campaign has at least one insight that people often forget when it comes to a tech behemoth with the Silicon Valley sheen of Facebook: At the end of the day, the social network is just an advertising vehicle, with 98 percent of its revenue coming from ads. And like old-line pressure campaigns against TV networks or newspapers, if you can get to the advertisers, the company has to pay attention.</p><p>While the boycott came together quickly, its roots trace back to the 2016 election. Amid widespread outrage over the role Facebook had played, one complaint was that Russians were using the site to exploit America's racial tensions. But the site wasn't just amplifying them, activists came to believe. It was a petri dish for racism and discrimination; it was growing hate. And, by taking a largely hands-off approach, Facebook wasn't taking the issue seriously, the activists decided. </p><p>In the months after Donald Trump was sworn in as president, civil rights groups and other social justice organizations began quietly comparing notes about their interactions with Facebook and Silicon Valley more broadly.</p><p>\"The conversations started really informally, just collecting information. But what we learned was that we were getting played by Facebook and other big tech companies,\" says Jessica Gonz\u00e1lez, co-CEO of the left-leaning media advocacy organization Free Press. \"They had a very strategic appeasement strategy, where they gave us breadcrumbs, but in a way that made it look like they were doing such great work when in fact hate and disinformation were rampant on their site.\"</p><p>The advocates tried to figure out how to get Facebook and other tech companies to take their complaints more seriously. Campaigns to get users to stay away from the platform, or to allow civil rights groups to alert the companies of hateful activities, largely sputtered. In 2018, Facebook announced it would undergo an audit to better understand how it was affecting communities of color and other marginalized groups, led by Laura Murphy, a highly regarded civil-rights advocate. But a pivotal five-week stretch this past fall largely erased whatever good will was left.</p><p>On a Tuesday afternoon in late September, Clegg, Facebook's head of policy and communications, announced the company was exempting politicians' ads from its fact-checking process, arguing that public should be able to see, and vet, what political leaders say. Clegg told me in an interview at the time that it was long-standing policy but that, \"The purpose of it, I hope, was pretty clear, which was: This is what we're doing ahead of 2020. These are our plans.\"</p><p>Facebook's critics took umbrage at both what Clegg said - revealing, they thought, that Facebook failed to grasp the history of American politicians stoking racial divisions - and when he said it. Color of Change, which was founded in the wake of Hurricane Katrina to organize African Americans online, and other groups had been working for months to pull together an event, called \"Civil Rights x Tech,\" with Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg; it was scheduled for just two days after Clegg's speech. At the summit, against a backdrop of soaring brick walls and exposed piping in an events space in Atlanta's West Midtown, Sandberg and Neil Potts, a Facebook public policy director, were pressed on what Clegg had said and reassured the advocates, Gonz\u00e1lez told me.</p><p>Two weeks later, Facebook announced that Zuckerberg would deliver a speech at Georgetown University laying out his thinking on \"free expression.\" He and Clegg previewed the speech with some of the civil rights leaders. Zuckerberg would be doubling down on the politicians' exemption, while daring to draw a connection between Facebook and the importance of free speech in U.S. civil rights history, from Frederick Douglass to Martin Luther King Jr.</p><p>\"I warned him of the perils of doing that,\" says Vanita Gupta, president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. </p><p>Zuckerberg did it anyway, in a dramatic 37-minute speech on Oct. 17 from Georgetown's Gaston Hall. Afterward, the advocates concluded that the CEO believed, deep in his bones, that his commitment to free expression - even if it aligned him with the most virulent strains of American society - was right, regardless of what Sandberg had said in Atlanta. \"[Sandberg] seems sincere. She's certainly good at her job. But the fact of the matter is, at the end of the day, the buck stops with Zuckerberg and the board of directors,\" Gonz\u00e1lez told me.</p><p>After the speech sparked a firestorm, Zuckerberg convened a dinner with civil rights leaders at his home in Palo Alto in early November. \"The last time I was in a room with all of those leaders, the other person at the table was Barack Obama,\" Rashad Robinson, executive director of Color of Change, told me last fall. It was a pleasant enough discussion, but he said it solidified for him that civil rights weren't a priority at Facebook's highest levels. </p><p>For Gupta, the fall of 2019 led her to believe Facebook had embraced a moral equivalence between civil rights groups and far-right conservatives, as two constituencies the company simply needed to placate - an approach she says she saw as part of a \"structural deficiency\" Facebook was unwilling to address.</p><p>The advocates went into the winter more worried than ever, and trying to figure out what to do next.</p><p> In late May, after the death of George Floyd at the hands of police in Minneapolis triggered a revival in the Black Lives Matter movement, then protests, then widespread public outrage, civil rights advocates found themselves on a conference call with Zuckerberg that would turn out to be a key moment in developing the boycott plan. </p><p>It started on May 29, when President Trump posted - on both Twitter and Facebook - a note about a possible federal response to protests in Minnesota: \"Any difficulty and we will assume control, but when the looting starts, the shooting starts.\" Trump would later say he was simply warning that looting can lead to violence, though many saw the tweet as a dog whistle.</p><p>Twitter, which already had begun taking a harder line on Trump's tweets, attached a warning label to the post stating it violated the site's rules against \"glorifying violence,\" but that \"Twitter has determined that it may be in the public's interest for the Tweet to remain accessible.\" Zuckerberg, meanwhile, ruled that Trump's post hadn't violated his site's policies on violence speech, and said that if it had, Facebook would have taken it down. \"Unlike Twitter, we do not have a policy of putting a warning in front of posts that may incite violence because we believe that if a post incites violence, it should be removed regardless of whether it is newsworthy, even if it comes from a politician,\" Zuckerberg wrote on Facebook.</p><p>The swipe at Twitter, which, in the eyes of advocates, had taken the post more seriously, irked them. \"When Mark Zuckerberg criticized Jack Dorsey for that, we realized we had even more of a serious problem than we thought,\" Johnson, the NAACP president, told me. Reports that Zuckerberg had talked over his decision with Trump himself didn't help. </p><p>On Monday, June 1, came the conference call. It was a pre-scheduled conversation, in which Zuckerberg planned to talk with civil rights leaders about Facebook's preparation for the 2020 election, but the topic of Trump's posts came up too. Trump also had floated theories about how Democrats were trying to \"rig\" the 2020 election by promoting the use of mail-in ballots during the coronavirus pandemic. Facebook had said in a statement that it didn't touch Trump's post because, when it came in elections, it believed in \"robust debate.\" </p><p>\"I'm seeing Mark's face as he's trying to explain to Sherrilyn Ifill\" - the president of the NAACP's Legal Defense and Educational Fund - \"why something isn't voter suppression. He's trying to talk down one of the most important voting rights litigators in the country,\" Robinson told me. Gupta says she went into the call eager to hear Zuckerberg's rationale for dealing with the posts. But she told me, \"I was completely dissatisfied with it. It was completely confounding and did not make sense.\"</p><p>For Robinson, it was a turning point. \"What are we doing here? I don't understand why I keep coming to these meetings with you all,\" he remembers saying on the call. \"I said to [Zuckerberg], and Sheryl, and Nick Clegg, and [global policy director] Joel Kaplan, 'I feel like we have to do some other pivot.' I'm saying to them that I'm going to have to another route.\" Gupta was similarly frustrated, yet she determined that the advocates couldn't just \"throw up our hands and walk away and just say, 'Screw it.'\"</p><p>At those same moments, another set of advocacy groups was beginning to have conversations about where to go next. Among them was Sleeping Giants, a loose, semi-anonymous online collective that calls itself \"a campaign to make bigotry and sexism less profitable.\" The group had developed a reputation for taking down powerful targets with a fairly simple tactic: show their advertisers exactly what their ad dollars are supporting and quickly gin up, using social media, public pressure to get them to stop. Starting in 2016, the group had waged successful campaigns against Breitbart News and Bill O'Reilly.</p><p>Now, as company after company put out its own statement supporting Black Lives Matter amid protests across the country, an opening for a similar strategy emerged with Facebook. If corporations were really serious about fighting racism, then why not back away from advertising on Facebook for hosting racist speech?</p><p>Jim Steyer, who heads Common Sense Media, a group focused on improving the media landscape for families and children, knew Matt Rivitz, one of the two leaders of Sleeping Giants, and they had a conversation with Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League. Along with Common Sense, the ADL began spreading word through progressive political circles that their small coalition was thinking of pushing for a one-month ad boycott of Facebook. </p><p>At the same time, Robinson and Color of Change were contemplating something similar and, after hearing about the ADL-tied effort, decided to join forces. Mozilla - the somewhat strange hybrid of tech company and online advocacy organization, which had long criticized Facebook's handling of its users' data and privacy - had worked with Common Sense in the past, and got pulled in. Others did too: the NAACP, the media advocacy group Free Press and, later, the League of United Latin American Citizens the National Hispanic Media Coalition. Brenda Victoria Castillo, president of the NHMC, told me her group joined the coalition to make sure Latinx voices were represented - to leverage their strength: \"We have $1.7 trillion buying power, and advertisers listen to those statistics.\" (The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, led by Gupta, has not joined the boycott call. A spokesperson for the group said no one was available to discuss why.)</p><p>\"We felt like, 'What else do we have to lose here?'\" the NAACP's Johnson says. \"We've been speaking out and meeting with the company to no avail. We thought, 'We need to do something.'\"</p><p>Not long after Zuckerberg's conference call, the campaign had a name: #StopHateForProfit. \"It was so quick, it was crazy,\" says Rivitz. \"It was an idea and then it was, 'Hold on, we've got to talk to other people.' And then it was, 'Let's go.'\" They settled on a one-month boycott, a limit they hoped would force corporations to act fast. Plus, even if ad budgets were expected to be down in July anyway, with the country still suffering through the coronavirus and its economic fallout, the tight timeline meant companies could handle whatever lost revenue might come from ditching what is a widely popular means of digital marketing for them.</p><p>Just before it launched, the campaign got a prominent boost. At an online event on June 16, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, a strong Facebook critic, said, \"Advertisers have tremendous leverage\" over the company, and \"I would say to them, know your power.\" The next day, StopHateForProfit trumpeted the same message in an ad in the Los Angeles Times. (While he wouldn't tell me if it was a coincidence, Steyer pointed out that he and his brother - billionaire and former presidential candidate Tom Steyer - are close with Pelosi and her staff, and called the speaker's message \"very timely.\")</p><p>The campaign officially began on June 17, with Sleeping Giants tweeting out the #StopHateForProfit hashtag to its more than 300,000 followers, calling on companies to join. Two days later, North Face was the first to sign up, saying it would stay off Facebook \"until stricter policies are put in place to stop racist, violent or hateful content and misinformation from circulating on the platform.\" REI and Patagonia quickly followed. The other coalition partners worked their networks, too, both privately and publicly. The ADL, a Jewish organization founded in 1913, began circulating images showing advertisers Facebook posts alongside which their ads were running. One Geico ad, for example, sat next to a post calling financier and philanthropist George Soros, a frequent target of anti-Semitism, \"the face of evil.\"</p><p>Robinson told me he and Johnson did a video call with the CEO of Ben &amp; Jerry's and discussed the ice cream maker not just joining the boycott, but also calling on Unilever, the multinational conglomerate that owns Ben &amp; Jerry's, to join. On June 23, Ben &amp; Jerry's put out a powerful statement. Three days later, Unilever announced it would stop advertising on not just Facebook and Instagram, but Twitter, too, at least through the end of the year, citing corporate responsibility pledges and \"the polarized atmosphere in the U.S.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, representatives from Mozilla reached out to the tech world, to explain how the company had stopped advertising on Facebook back in 2018 and \"how we've reinvested our own marketing dollars,\" Mary Ellen Zuckerman, the company's interim chief marketing officer, told me. </p><p>\"You know, it's always, like, 'fly by the seat of your pants and see what works,'\" Rivitz of the launch. But this was a pretty good start.</p><p>So far, the advertiser pull-outs represent only a fraction of Facebook's revenue - analysts said at the start of this week that they still expect the company to have a strong quarter, with some $17 billion in sales - but the PR blitz and creeping sense that the site was becoming toxic to ad buyers got the site's attention.</p><p>The boycott organizers had hoped that keeping the push limited to a month would act as a forming mechanism, pushing Facebook to make quick changes. The coalition came up with 10 specific demands, among them installing a high-level executive with civil-rights expertise, doing away with the fact-checking exemption for politicians' speech and creating human points of contact for Facebook users experiencing identity-based harassment. </p><p>On the same day that the campaign for the boycott launched, someone close to the situation tells me, Facebook called a rush meeting that pulled in officials from across teams - including its marketing, policy and legal operations - to discuss what to do.</p><p>Then, on June 24, Sandberg emailed Johnson, Greenblatt and Robinson, according to a copy of the email seen by POLITICO. \"At Facebook, we stand against racism and discrimination of any kind,\" she wrote. \"We are working to understand and address the concerns you outlined in your #StopHateforProfit campaign.\" She mentioned the civil rights audit, \"which has been in progress for two years,\" and asked to continue the discussion in a meeting with her and Chris Cox, a Facebook veteran close to Zuckerberg who recently returned to the company to serve as chief product officer. </p><p>Two days later, in a rare move, Zuckerberg opened up the first few minutes of an employee meeting to announce some fairly minor changes to the company's handling of elections and political content, such as banning posts that falsely claim that that immigration officials will be visiting polling places and labeling some politicians' posts that violate the site's rules. The company also announced that it would undergo a marketing audit that would examine, among other things, how safe its platform is for advertisers. And it removed hundreds of accounts associated with the so-called Boogaloo Boys, a far-right movement that sprung up around the George Floyd protests. The company published a list detailing how it is addressing or otherwise thinking about some of what boycott organizers had asked for. Clegg also issued his open letter, saying both that \"Facebook does not profit from hate\" and \"We may never be able to prevent hate from appearing on Facebook entirely, but we are getting better at stopping it all the time.\" </p><p>The boycott organizers say it's not enough - that the changes are too small and Facebook's explanations too vague to satisfy them yet.</p><p>In response to Sandberg's e-mail, the advocates pressed to meet with Zuckerberg himself, not just Sandberg. On July 1, Facebook said it agreed. The conversation is being scheduled, both sides say, for after the Independence Day holiday.</p><p>When I asked Robinson what he plans to say, he told me that's the wrong way to think about it. Facebook requested the meeting, he points out, putting the onus on them: \"They have our demands.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTCO-341685</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTCO2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:607V-KMD1-JDJ6-K4KX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">334576</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3499\"/><timeReceived>8:30 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Politico.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 29, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002HQ4</classCode><className>UNILEVER PLC/NV</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002J8M</classCode><className>COCA-COLA CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The company has more than 103,000 employees working on high-profile initiatives and secret projects. Business Insider Prime has mapped out some of the key teams and rising stars that comprise the power structure at Alphabet. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[1] Google[2] has come a long way from its days as an internet search engine operating out of a Silicon Valley garage. </p><p>Today, Google is the centerpiece of the Alphabet[3] parent company, a collection of independent companies that generated $137 billion in revenue in 2018. This business empire dominates industries such as online advertising, video streaming, and smartphone software, and it includes some of the leading efforts in cutting-edge technology like self-driving cars, deep learning, and health tech. With more than 103,000 employees, Alphabet is a patchwork of groups and teams, from high-profile initiatives to secret \"skunkworks\" projects. Business Insider Prime[4] has charted out the various power centers and power players in the Alphabet hierarchy. Below are the maps and guides to help navigate the Google and Alphabet empires.Meet the teams, projects and rising stars inside Alphabet:The 14 top executives who lead Alphabet's 'Other Bets,' helping

As an initial step, he'd     assigned a team of McKinsey &amp; Co. consultants to analyze Northern     Virginia's chances of winning based on Amazon's wish list for its new     home: a talented workforce, accessible transportation options, high     quality of life, and a favorable business climate. Using data from 20     distinct categories, the consultants had measured Northern Virginia     against cities they considered top contenders and charted each location's     positives (in green) and negatives (in red) on the heat map for     Moret.</p><p>Although Washington was alive with green for its many favorable     data points, such as its diverse population and dense public-transit     networks, other crucial variables were blocked out in red. The median     rent, for example, was the highest of any site on the heat map, and labor     costs were exorbitant. If Amazon opted for a less expensive metropolitan     area, such as Atlanta, by Moret's estimate it could save a billion dollars     a year in workforce costs alone. On top of that, Virginia's conservative     approach to public incentives would preclude him from offering the     generous deal sweeteners that other states could provide. \"If they make     this decision on costs or on incentives,\" Moret thought, \"we're     dead.\"</p><p>From the outside looking in, there was every reason to believe     that those considerations would play a pivotal role in Amazon's decisions.     The conventional wisdom about the modern knowledge-based economy, as     popularized by Thomas L. Friedman's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The World Is Flat,</emphasis> has held     that tech workers can do their jobs from anywhere. Companies can slash     expenses and drive new profits, the thinking goes, simply by moving from     big cities like San Francisco to mid-tier markets like Louisville or     Wichita. To entice HQ2 to Washington, Moret would have to find a different     playbook.</p><p>For the next six weeks, he worked with state officials, local     politicians, and business leaders to craft Crystal City's bid. Then, over     the following year, he hosted site visits and coordinated discussions with     Amazon executives entirely in secret, as the country waited in     suspense.</p><p>You know the broad outlines of what happened next: On November     13, 2018, Amazon announced it had selected Northern Virginia and, in a     since-abandoned arrangement, New York City-two of the most expensive     regions in contention.</p><p>Critics immediately fumed that the contest was rigged, that     Amazon had political motivations for wanting a bigger Washington-area     footprint. It's a charge that's hard to deny. But even so, there's another     explanation for how the company selected these two pricey locales over     hundreds of lower-cost options. It revolves around a set of ideas     developed by a West Coast economist named Enrico Moretti-ideas that     directly challenge the old world-is-flat consensus.</p><p>The jobs of tomorrow, Moretti's research shows, aren't heading     to affordable markets offering lucrative public subsidies. They're going     to thrumming, dynamic cities that are already home to dense concentrations     of highly educated workers. There are only a few of them, but these     regions, the economist argues, offer employers such as Amazon advantages     even more valuable than tax perks.</p><p>Moretti is not a household name, though his work is     increasingly influential. One of the people he has influenced is Moret,     the man in charge of Northern Virginia's Amazon bid, who considers himself     a disciple. As it happened-and unbeknownst to Moret at the time-Amazon     executives were reading from the same text.</p><p>The story of how Northern Virginia landed the era's biggest     economic-development prize cracks open a window onto the mysterious     corporate sweepstakes that captivated the nation. But more important, it     provides a striking-and troubling-look into the future of our city and     country as a whole.</p><p>To understand how Virginia's team managed to access the     thinking of Amazon's executives, it helps to go back to November 2016,     when Moret was hired by the Commonwealth. At the time, the Virginia     Economic Development Partnership, the top job-development agency in the     state, was in crisis-plagued by haphazard leadership, faulty data     collection, and weak investment controls, and so badly mismanaged that,     according to a state watchdog, it was vulnerable to fraud. Moret had     previously run Louisiana's economic-development department. In Virginia,     his mission was clear: Straighten out the mess.</p><p>The balding, bespectacled Southerner launched a top-to-bottom     review of the state's economy to create a strategic plan. For the first     half of 2017, he drove to nearly every county in the Commonwealth, meeting     with local officials, chambers of commerce, and community leaders to     discuss the state of industry. Virginia's central economic weakness, he     and his staff eventually determined, was over-dependence on the federal     government. The question was how to reposition the Commonwealth for the     future, and Moret knew just the person to call.</p><p>Enrico Moretti had joined UC Berkeley's economics department in     2004, which gave him a first-hand look at the Bay Area's tech boom. Year     after year, he watched in bewilderment as startups and established firms     flocked to a region known for enormous labor costs and stratospherically     expensive real estate. It didn't make any sense. Why would you run a     company in Silicon Valley when-thanks to e-mail and instant messaging and     the slew of communications technologies developed in that very same     valley-you could operate it for a fraction of the cost in Des Moines or     Detroit? The question became the central pursuit of his career. In 2012,     he published a groundbreaking book, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The New Geography of Jobs,</emphasis>     that offered some surprising answers.</p><p>Highly educated workers, Moretti concluded, have become the     knowledge economy's most precious resource. \"In the twentieth century,     competition was about accumulating physical capital,\" he wrote. \"Today it     is about attracting the best human capital.\" But these college and     graduate-school degree holders are not dispersed evenly throughout the     country. Instead, they've been clustering in a handful of already-thriving     cities-places like San Francisco, Raleigh, Minneapolis, and Boston-which,     as a result, have also become magnets for forward-looking     employers.</p><p>The cost of doing business in these \"brain hubs,\" as the     economist called them, is indeed higher, but the brain hubs also offer     something companies can't find anywhere else. By serving as ecosystems for     talented employees to learn from one another, generate fresh ideas, and     spark innovation, they can create productivity gains that more than offset     the extra costs of doing business. At the same time, the development     triggers a powerful feedback loop, with the bigger paychecks and more     abundant employment opportunities driving prosperity throughout the     region.</p><p>Moretti's book-which Barack Obama listed as one of his     favorites of 2018-earned praise from public intellectuals from all     quarters, including liberal <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">New York Times</emphasis> columnist Paul Krugman     as well as its resident conservative, David Brooks. The book also     resonated deeply with Stephen Moret. Growing up, he'd moved from one     struggling Mississippi town to another as his mother, divorced and raising     him and his brother on her own, pursued her career as a pharmacist. Moret     eventually obtained an MBA from Harvard and, after that, a PhD from UPenn.     His experience climbing from the rural South to the Ivy League ignited his     fascination with the intersection of higher education and labor markets.     He drew heavily from Moretti's research for his own dissertation, which     studied how investments in higher ed affected economic growth.</p><p>So naturally, when it came time to reimagine a new economy for     Virginia, Moret wanted the Berkeley economist's input. He called with an     offer, and Moretti accepted.</p><p>The Virginia team worked through much of 2017 and concluded     that the state's biggest opportunity was in the high-tech sector. After     all, as Moretti's work shows, each new tech job creates an additional five     positions in other fields. The economist advised that the best way to lure     more tech employers was to build out the pipeline of highly skilled     employees through investments in education. \"That's education at all     levels,\" Moretti says, \"whether it's pre-K or community college or local     college.\" He also suggested that Virginia partner with a public university     and create a new innovation-and-technology campus, similar to the Cornell     Tech institute in New York.</p><p>By the end of the process, the economist had been a profound     influence on the blueprint for Virginia's economic future. Then, just as     Moret's team was about to release their plan publicly, the big news broke:     Amazon was launching a search for a second headquarters. All the work     Virginia had just done with Moretti was about to become even more     consequential.</p><p>When it was first announced, The grand prize of the HQ2     sweepstakes amounted to a once-in-a-lifetime economic opportunity: 50,000     high-paying jobs and $5 billion of investments. Amazon received bids from     238 places, some of which appeared so desperate that they went to comical     lengths to lure the company. Elected leaders in a Georgia city of 55,000     residents, as you might recall, promised to change its name to Amazon. The     mayor of Kansas City left 1,000 five-star reviews on Amazon products-\"Oh     baby, this baby oil is a real treat!\"-and each one noted the area's     attractiveness as a corporate headquarters. Atlanta offered to build an     Amazon-only lounge at its airport.</p><p>Virginia did all it could to impress Amazon's search committee,     too. In February 2018, just before Amazon executives arrived in the     Washington region for their first site visit, Moret's team conducted a     dress rehearsal at the exact same time and location that their actual     pitch presentation would take place, in order to make sure they accounted     for variables like sunlight and traffic flow. The development firm JBG     Smith plastered the inside of its office-building elevators with life-size     images of the interior of Amazon's Seattle headquarters-\"so that when they     walked in there,\" says CEO Matt Kelly, \"it felt like home.\" (One local     figure spoke to Metro general manager Paul Wiedefeld and urged him to make     sure Amazon got to ride on one of its newest, 7000-Series trains.     Wiedefeld, who says he can't recall whether the official was from     Virginia, Maryland, or the District, responded by explaining that public     transportation doesn't work that way.)</p><p>But when it came to substance, competitors mostly organized     their proposals around public subsidies. Moret's team pitched the area as     a brain hub.</p><p>Remember the heat map? The same McKinsey &amp; Co. analysis     that exposed Northern Virginia's cost problems had also underscored the     region's strength: the intellectual firepower of its workforce. Nearly     half of Northern Virginia/Washington-area residents hold a bachelor's     degree or higher, making it the best-educated labor pool among the top     contenders. And through their work with Moretti, Virginia's team     understood that an abundant supply of highly skilled workers was actually     more valuable to tech firms than infrastructure upgrades or tax giveaways.     In fact, when Moret's team analyzed the Seattle market, they came to     believe that a shortfall of qualified workers was one of the reasons why     Amazon had launched its HQ2 search in the first place. \"So why don't we     build a strategy that really focuses largely on that?\" Moret thought.     \"Let's dramatically expand our tech-talent pipeline.\"</p><p>Northern Virginia's ultimate proposal was centered around an     effort to provide Amazon-or any other tech firm that wanted to come-with     all the educated workers it needed, now and in the future. Moret's team     proposed increasing tech education from kindergarten through 12th grade,     expanding university offerings to produce up to 17,500 new bachelor's     degrees in computer science and related fields, and building a tech campus     that could produce the same number of master's degrees. All told, Virginia     offered Amazon only $550 million in tax breaks and $195 million in     transportation improvements. But it pledged to plow $1.1 billion into tech     schooling. According to Moret, it was the only place in the nation that     made education the centerpiece of its pitch.</p><p>Moret and his colleagues heard nothing for several months after     submitting Virginia's proposal. They were so hungry for information that     they began tracking the online betting markets. At first, things didn't     look good; in January 2018, the Irish bookmaker Paddy Power gave Northern     Virginia 20-to-1 odds of landing HQ2. But around that same time, Moret got     some encouraging intel. Through conversations with company officials, he     says he and his team learned that a number of key Amazon executives had     also read <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The New Geography of Jobs</emphasis>and were influenced by its     ideas. \"Okay,\" he thought, \"we're on to something.\"</p><p>Moret reached out to Moretti, the Berkeley economist, to     discuss what the development meant for the HQ2 search. \"What I really     thought was that ultimately [Amazon's] choice would be based on the type     of underlying economic factors that I describe in the book,\" Moretti says.     \"I always thought that the subsidies were going to be a not-so-important     factor.\"</p><p>At the same time, though, a second headquarters in Crystal City     offered Amazon another benefit. As Washington has become sharply skeptical     of Big Tech and newly concerned about monopolies, Amazon has amassed the     industry's biggest in-house government-relations team and hired President     Obama's former chief spokesman Jay Carney. It's also trying to expand its     government-contracting business by, among other things, pursuing a     $10-billion cloud-computing contract from the Department of Defense. By     plopping HQ2 into Crystal City-right next door to the Pentagon-its     employees could become part of the Washington community, attending     back-yard barbecues and school dance recitals with the very regulatory     staffers and procurement officials whose decisions will determine the     company's future-and the very journalists and political strategists who     might paint the firm as an Evil Empire.</p><p>Moret and his team, in fact, made sure to advertise this unique     advantage in their proposal. \"The high concentration of tech companies,     federal agencies, and supporting organizations offer Amazon the     opportunity to develop valuable future relationships,\" they wrote.     \"Northern Virginia provides an unmatched place for Amazon to locate as it     attempts to influence federal policies, particularly as it delves into     complex areas of federal regulatory authority (e.g. unmanned drones).\"     Moret's team even drew up and provided a helpful map charting Crystal     City's proximity to some of the most powerful agencies in Washington-the     Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission, the FCC.</p><p>Holly Sullivan, the Amazon executive who led the search,     insists that political considerations played no role in the company's     decision and says Moretti's research was one of many sources she and other     executives read. \"I would say this: that the book, along with other     research that we did and items in journals that we read, including     economic-development blogs-all of those factors were sort of taken into     account for us to have a robust discussion.\" Yet her explanation for why     Amazon picked Crystal City might as well have been a blurb on the back of     Moretti's book. \"We needed to find a location that had the day-one     talent,\" she says, \"but also a location that has the resources and the     sort of education ecosystem to build upon that tech-talent     pipeline.\"</p><p>Washington has mostly celebrated HQ2's arrival, and years from     now it will likely be viewed as the moment when the region transitioned     from a company town to something much bigger. But along with this growth,     if Moretti's research proves prescient once again, we'll also experience     the dark side of Big Tech prosperity.</p><p>Even at half its original head count, HQ2 will reshape the     region in ways you've probably already considered. Our 25,000 new     neighbors won't live just in Crystal City; they'll drive up home values in     Penn Quarter and support dry-cleaning businesses in Silver Spring. On a     macro level, HQ2 will establish Washington, once and for all, as a     national tech capital-a development that helps lessen our dangerous     overreliance on Uncle Sam. According to AOL cofounder Steve Case, the     politics of the era mean Amazon won't be the last tech giant to expand     into the area. \"They've always had policy offices [here],\" Case says, \"but     I think they'll start concluding that having more of a significant     presence matters.\" In February, Google announced plans to double its     Virginia workforce as part of an expansion of its data center in     Reston.</p><p>It's exactly the type of \"brain hub\" activity that Enrico     Moretti would expect. But while his book helps explain decisions like     Amazon's, it also reveals the troubling consequences they trigger. As more     and more tech-industry players migrate into brain hubs, the benefits of     the knowledge economy become increasingly concentrated in a few isolated     places. \"A handful of cities with the 'right' industries and a solid base     of human capital keep attracting good employers and offering high wages,\"     he writes, \"while those at the other extreme, cities with the wrong     industries and a limited human capital base, are stuck with dead end jobs     and low average earnings.\" The result, Moretti argues, is an America     segregated not by race but by geography. Big cities keep getting bigger,     rural communities fall further behind.</p><p>This divergence has clear economic implications: Workers in     America's most highly educated cities earn two to three times more than     people working identical jobs in the least educated cities. But the     regional inequality touches everything from personal relationships to     public health. Moretti found that divorce rates in fading industrial     capitals are higher than they are in brain hubs, and the average life     expectancy of a man in Fairfax is a decade and a half longer than one in     Baltimore. According to the economist, the \"balkanization\" of America is     exacerbating the bitter polarization that has gripped our democracy.     \"Geographic segregation raises the number of people who live surrounded by     others like them,\" he writes, \"and this is likely to reinforce extreme     political attitudes.\"</p><p>Geographic resentment will continue to grow, says Brookings     senior fellow Mark Muro, as people in less affluent communities come to     view brain hubs like Washington as home to a distant, economic elite     that's pulling further and further ahead. \"I've been writing some things     raising serious concerns about what this means for the viability of     American consensus,\" Muro says. \"Because it is creating the sense that     there are winners who keep on winning, and most places are doing only     okay.\" As the seat of the federal government <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">and</emphasis> the home of a     booming new high-tech sector, the Washington area will, for many, serve as     a monument to our increasingly unequal nation. The bitterness directed at     Washington may feel ugly now, but it's likely only to     intensify.</p><p>Sullivan, at Amazon, offers a less ominous read. \"My take on     the book is that tech jobs aren't right for all communities,\" she says.     But, she adds, \"I think anytime you're doing a jobs investment of this     magnitude, there are going to be ripple positive impacts that come from     it. And I think that's what's important to recognize.\"</p><p>For his part, Moret says he thought about the unequal     implications of his work throughout the HQ2 process. After all, it was the     chance to improve people's stations in life that attracted him to the     field in the first place. Although he understands how this type of job     migration can widen inequality at the national level, he says HQ2 will     actually help narrow the gap between thriving and struggling communities     in Virginia. He points out that the deal won't benefit just Crystal     City-the educational investments are going to schools and universities     throughout the Commonwealth, supporting residents of urban and rural     communities alike. And of course, as Virginia's economic-development     director, he has a mandate to make sure the state beats out other     regions.</p><p>\"While we would love for all of rural America to win,\" he says,     \"the part of rural America we're most concerned about is the part in     Virginia.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Stephen Moret, Virginia's top jobs-development official-and the architect of its HQ2 bid-in one of the tech giant's new buildings in Crystal City</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Photograph by April Greer</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Photograph of boxes by Jeff Elkins</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>This economist's research was a huge influence on Virginia's HQ2 bid-and what helped differentiate it from competitors.</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Photographs Courtesy of Enrico Moretti</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>A rendering of the pedestrian bridge that Virginia will build between Crystal City and the airport.</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Rendering Courtesy of JBG Smith</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WASHTN-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WASHTN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W6V-35K1-JCDM-K000-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11412</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3621\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Washington Magazine, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Washingtonian</publicationName><publicationDate month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Judicial Watch leads the nation's nonprofit organizations in the number of Freedom of Information Act requests FOIAs it has filed during the last 17 years. So says the FOIA Project, a Syracuse University research program which tracks those requests and who makes them.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There were 626 nonprofit groups which filed the requests during a study period from Jan. 21, 2001, when President George W. Bush assumed office, through July 31, 2018,  all seeking government accountability or insight into specific policy arenas like the environment, immigration and national security.</p><p>Judicial Watch was ranked No. 1 on the list nonprofit or advocacy groups challenging federal government sources with 391 FOIA requests filed during the study's 17-year period.</p><p> In second place was the American Civil Liberties Union with 130 requests, followed by Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (94 requests), Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (88) and Electronic Privacy Information Center (74) to round out the top five organizations.</p><p> \"We've led the way in holding the government to account as both the media and Congress have gone AWOL. Most of what we know about government corruption  from Clinton emails to Deep State abuses  are as a result of our historic FOIA lawsuits,\" says Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton.</p><p> \"The most-sued agency is the Department of Justice, which has been the defendant in 2,312 FOIA suits since 2001. Within the DOJ, the FBI has been the most sued division with 712 suits,\" Mr. Fitton notes, adding that his organization is currently pursuing 41 lawsuits against Justice.</p><p> He also says he cited the Syracuse study because this week is \"Sunshine Week\"  an annual observation organized by the American Society of News Editors and Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press to celebrate access to public information.</p><p> 'I ONLY CARE WHAT YOU THINK'</p><p> It is always interesting to follow the frequent public opinion polls sent out by President Trump's re-election campaign  which remains on message and on target with voters in a unforgiving political marketplace. The latest of these polls is titled \"Mainstream Media Accountability Survey,\" and does not mince words. The 20 questions in the new inquiry tell all. A few samples:</p><p> \"Do you believe the mainstream media has tried to delegitimize the crisis at our southern border? Do you believe reporters like Jim Acosta angle their questions to promote liberal propaganda? On which issues does the mainstream media do the worst job of representing President Trump? Do you believe that the media purposely tries to divide Republicans in order to help elect Democrats? Do you agree with President Trump's strategy of communicating directly with his supporters through Twitter, email, text messages and Facebook videos?\" are among the questions.</p><p> \"The mainstream media have never been more dishonest than they are today. Stories have been reported that have absolutely no basis in fact. Some are so eager to report something negative about our movement, that they don't even seek verification. They are totally out of control!\" Mr. Trump says in his message to respondents.</p><p> \"They have no boundaries or principles. They only seek to undermine and insult anyone associated with my administration and our great movement. The mainstream media can make up fake stories and lie about my administration all they want, but at the end of the day, I only really care what you think,\" the president advises.</p><p> HOWARD OVER BRIAN</p><p> A clash of the media analysis titans? Maybe. But one get a bigger audience than the other.</p><p> \"Fox News Channel's MediaBuzz with Howard Kurtz is the No. 1 media criticism show, which makes CNN's Reliable Sources with Brian Stelter No. 2. The two shows air head-to-head at 11 a.m. ET on Sundays,\" observes A.J. Katz, editor of Adweek's TV Newser blog.</p><p> And the Nielsen Media Research numbers of note: Mr. Kurtz draws an audience of 1.3 million, Mr. Stelter 871,000.</p><p> MR. HOYER'S WISDOM</p><p> The Democratic Party has dozens of new lawmakers on the job, rather than a certain trio who attract extensive media coverage.</p><p> \"We've got 62 new members. Not three,\" House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer tells Fox News.</p><p> \"Hoyer apparently was referring to Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, who regularly have fought the Trump administration's policies since entering Congress,\" the network noted in an analysis.</p><p> ANTITRUST EXPLAINED</p><p> Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Elizabeth Warren is among those who insist that \"big tech\" is bad news for consumers, innovation and property rights. There are now calls to use antitrust law to penalize or quash big tech companies like Facebook, Amazon and Google.</p><p> \"Before we take that step, we need to ask ourselves: Do we need heavy-handed government regulators using antitrust regulation to break up big firms? What will we be losing by hacking apart the nation's most successful companies?\" points out Iain Murray, vice president of strategy for the Competitive Enterprise institute, a nonprofit policy group.</p><p> \"History is rife with examples of once-dominant large companies, like CompuServe and Nokia, which fell from their positions of power because they were unable to innovate enough to compete in the free market. The truth is that government intervention does more to create barriers to entry that entrench powerful incumbent corporations than the free market, which forces companies to innovate in order to grow their business and prosper,\" Mr. Murray explains.</p><p> That said, his organization has launched a comprehensive video and information source for consumers brave enough to approach the complex matter.

Ted Cruz. In a hearing titled \"Stifling Free Speech: Technology Censorship and the Public Discourse,\" the Texas Republican intends to determine if jumbo tech companies are censoring conservatives.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"They will be investigating whether social media is suppressing conservative thought and free speech,\" Chuck Konzelman, the film's writer and director, told The Hollywood Reporter, an industry publication.</p><p> The movie is based on the true story of Abby Johnson, a Planned Parenthood clinic director who resigned after witnessing an abortion on ultrasound in graphic detail. She went on to become a dedicated pro-life advocate. The film itself was produced on a $6 million budget and distributed by Pure Flix, which specializes in Christian-themed productions. The film's producers also released \"Planned from the Start,\" a devotional book for women who regret they have had an abortion.</p><p> The project won instant and surprising box office support, having earned $12.5 million since its March 29 release despite sparse media coverage and an R rating. Twitter also suspended the film's account, later reinstating it following a public outcry.</p><p> \"The ridicule of the mainstream media and Hollywood is to be expected. But big tech's attempted censorship of the story during its opening weekend is deeply troubling and revealing. I have repeatedly asked tech companies for basic data on how many voices on their social platforms are silenced and to what extent it is politically targeted. I intend to keep asking these questions, and hold them accountable,\" Mr. Cruz told The Reporter.</p><p> Mr. Konzelman also questioned the timing of the Twitter suspension.</p><p> \"As far as I'm concerned, it's part of a systematic bias against conservative media. We were on Twitter for nine months and an error occurred on opening weekend?\" he noted.</p><p> Representatives of Twitter and Facebook plus sociology and legal experts are expected to testify, along with Marilyn Musgrave, vice president of government affairs for the pro-life group Susan B. Anthony List. The hearing will be live-streamed at 2:30 p.m. ET at Judiciary.senate.gov.</p><p> UNCOVERING THE COVER-UP</p><p> Intricate details regarding Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state continue to emerge.</p><p> \"Judicial Watch uncovered new 'cover-up' records on the illicit Clinton email system that further demonstrate the sham nature of the FBI/DOJ 'investigation' of her. These shocking new documents show that various Obama agencies were protecting Hillary Clinton from the consequences of her misconduct. It is well past time for the DOJ to stop shielding Hillary Clinton and hold her fully accountable to the rule of law,\" says Tom Fitton, president of the watchdog group, which has uncovered 422 pages of relevant FBI documents</p><p> He says they show \"evidence of 'cover-up' discussions related to the Clinton email system within Platte River Networks, one of the vendors who managed the Clinton email system. The documents also show Intelligence Community Inspector General Charles McCullough forwarding 'concerns' about classified information in former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's emails.\"</p><p> The documents also contain Mrs. Clinton's 2009 classified information Non-Disclosure Agreement bearing her signature.</p><p>Judicial Watch obtained the documents after filing a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against the Justice Department in October 2016.</p><p> BIDEN STILL THE KINGPIN</p><p> Despite ongoing reports that he is too physically familiar with women, former Vice President Joe Biden still aces the opinion polls. So says a gargantuan Morning Consult survey of 13,644 likely primary Democratic voters in the key states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina conducted the first week of April. Mr. Biden won 35% of the vote.</p><p> Sen. Bernard Sanders is in second place with 23%, followed by Sen. Kamala Harris (9%), Beto O'Rourke (8%); Sen. Elizabeth Warren (7%) Pete Buttigieg (5%), Sen. Cory Booker (4%), Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (both 2%) and Gov. Steve Bullock (1%)  to round out the top 10.</p><p> WEATHER OR NOT</p><p> Not so much global warming this week.</p><p> \"Winter ended weeks ago, but for many it will feel like January as a storm threatens multiple impacts, including as much as 24 inches of snow in some places,\" AccuWeather advised Tuesday. \"After first sweeping through the West, the storm will rapidly strengthen across the nation's heartland around Wednesday and Thursday, bringing everything from damaging winds to heavy snow, rain and a renewed risk of severe weather.\"</p><p> FOXIFIED</p><p> Fox News Channel remains the top dog, now dominating the ratings across the entire cable realm for the 13th week in a row, according to Nielsen Media Research. And the numbers: Fox News drew 2.3 million prime-time viewers, compared to 1.2 million for MSNBC, 1.2 million for HGTV, 1.1 million for USA Network and 1 million for TBS Network  rounding out the top five. CNN was in 15th place, with 745,000 viewers.</p><p> In addition, presentations of \"Hannity,\" \" Tucker Carlson Tonight,\" \"The Ingraham Angle\" and \"The Five\" claimed 17 of the top 30 cable telecasts overall in total viewers. MSNBC's \"The Rachel Maddow Show\" is now down 17% since March and down 34% compared to ratings in April 2018.</p><p> POLL DU JOUR</p><p> \u2022 56% of Americans want the federal government to \"regulate social media companies\";

In return, Outbrain\u2019s shareholders would receive shares representing 30% of the combined company plus $250 million in cash. </p><p>The company\u2019s board of directors was to consist of both Outbrain and Taboola representatives with equal oversight of the planned integration.</p><p>The pair pitched the proposed union as benefitting the industry by offering advertisers greater scale with a combination of their data science teams facilitating more rapid product development. This was a \u201conce in a lifetime\u201d opportunity, Singolda told Adweek last October. </p><p>Given Outbrain and Taboola\u2019s dominance of the content recommendation market, some publishing sources expressed concerns over exactly how the proposed entity would operate. </p><p>The two competed intensely for years\u2014often by matching, if not bettering\u2014the revenue guarantees of their rivals when it came to contract negotiations with publishers. Some questioned if this would limit the choice of monetization partners for publishers. </p><p>Expectation were lofty, so the pair had to seek the approval of regulators in key markets, including Israel and the U.K. And despite the U.S. Justice Department giving the merger the all clear\u2014the DoJ has Big Tech in its crosshairs\u2014the others saw potential concerns. </p><p>The U.K.\u2019s\u00a0 Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) launched \u201can in-depth investigation\u201d\u00a0after an initial probe in July, and the Israel Competition Authority\u2019s investigation was still ongoing. </p><p>Sources familiar with both sides of the proposed merger said regulatory scrutiny took much longer that was previously expected, developments that brought pressure on its financing. The original financing deal with the banks participating expired in August. </p><p>Similar to the rest of the online media industry, the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic also threw a wrench in the works. </p><p>As the ferocity of the cuts hit in late Q1 and early Q2, many ad-tech companies cited force majeure in an attempt to curb earlier revenue guarantees to publishers. Taboola also employed the tactic.</p><p>In a June 29 blog post, Singolda wrote, \u201cWe\u2019ve had to ask our publisher partners to work with us through these challenging times by temporarily switching from a revenue guarantee to shared revenue.\u201d </p><p>One source discussed how this could have played a role in the narrative that a combination of the two would harm publishers\u2019 monetization options.</p><p>All of this transpired as the date for both parties to unilaterally walk away from the original agreement\u2014Oct. 3, 2020\u2014approached. </p><p>One source told Adweek that Taboola attempted to renegotiate the earlier agreed-upon fee of $250 million to approximately $100 million. That was deemed unacceptable by Outbrain, sources said. </p><p>Sources familiar with the thinking of Outbrain\u2019s leadership indicated the proposed renegotiated terms of any such deal would have been a stock-only offer with a \u201ccertain amount of back and forth\u201d taking place in the past month. </p><p>\u201cOnce they attempted to renege on the original deal, the investors insisted on the $250 million \u2026 and just said, \u2018No\u2019,\u201d a source said. It appears there is little hope for a rapprochement. </p><p>Meanwhile, sources noted how the sudden collapse in ad spend as the Covid-19 pandemic took hold has seemingly altered the priorities of both Outbrain and Taboola\u2019s potential client base, as many publishers have attempted to double down on improving their subscription revenue businesses. </p><p>Given that many in the publishing sector are attempting to pursue the more healthy margins of premium subscriptions\u2014which makes revenue forecasting more sustainable\u2014just how customary will promoted content revenue models be? </p><p>\u201cThey found a niche for seven to 10 years, but now there we\u2019re all focused on subscriptions, almost everybody is like, \u2018How can I make money not selling ads?\u2019 their business model starts to break down,\u201d one publisher source said. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ADWEEK-1196937</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ADWEEK2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60T5-S4M1-DYRK-H000-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7907</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"740\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Mediabistro Holdings, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>adweek.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 9, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;
