Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.) issued the following statement on the House's vote on the Save the Internet Act:</p><p>\"The internet isn't broken, so why are liberals trying to fix it? In this legislation, House Democrats want to give federal entities nearly unlimited authority to regulate the internet, which is why I voted against it. I support the bipartisan and commonsense 'bright line' rules for net neutrality - no blocking, no throttling and no paid prioritization - that protect consumers, but the Save the Internet Act reaches far beyond these commonsense protections. In rural districts like mine, this bill would slow down or reduce network expansion, a critical delay as I fight to expand broadband connectivity in remote areas.</p><p>\"This isn't even the first time we've had a net neutrality debate. When President Trump first announced he was repealing regulations, liberals would not stop talking about how this would radically change the internet as we knew it. But when the regulations ceased, these doomsday predictions fell flat. Life continued uninterrupted, and Americans enjoyed affordable and reliable internet access.</p><p>\"This so-called attempt to 'save the internet' has nothing to do with better internet service; it's a gift to edge providers who want to market personal data. GOP members have introduced at least three bills that would protect consumers without overbearing government involvement - let's focus our attention on those practical solutions instead.\"</p><p>Background:</p><p>The Save the Internet Act would:</p><p>* Allow the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to set prices, sanction investments and dictate how broadband companies interact with their customers.</p><p>* Lay the groundwork for taxing and overregulating the internet.</p><p>* Require FCC approval for development of new 5G and other innovative technologies, which would discourage, delay or block them altogether.</p><p>* Limit access for rural Americans. Studies show that 80 percent of providers in rural areas incurred additional expenses when complying with the Obama-era net neutrality regulations, which led to delayed or reduced network expansion.</p><p>* Allow big tech corporations like Facebook and Google to undermine American families' privacy.</p><p>Read this original document at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://westerman.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/westerman-statement-net-neutrality-vote\">https://westerman.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/westerman-statement-net-neutrality-vote</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GOVPUB-COSHM4109CML141197</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VVT-D411-JCCP-051J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"392\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Congressional Documents and Publications</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 10, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Report</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Statistics</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Hundreds of Facebook pages had been set up, populated with content aimed at inciting hatred against the Rohingyas and forcing hundreds of thousands to flee the genocide taking place. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">However, the tipping point on what seems to be acceptable internet discourse and content appeared to come last month, when an Australian gunman live-streamed a mass shooting at two Christchurch mosques. Three weeks later, sweeping legislation conceived and passed in five days was enacted in Australia to punish social media companies that fail to remove \"abhorrent, violent material\" on their platforms \"expeditiously\". </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Under Australia's new legislation, employees of social media sites face up to three years in prison and the companies involved could be fined up to 10 per cent of their annual profit. </p><p>Australia is not alone. Governments around the world, including the UK and Singapore, have moved to take a more active role in deciding what constitutes acceptable content in an era where social media content is king and anything can be shared at the push of a button. </p><p>\"It's dystopian, but I think China's [regulation method] is going to be the future,\" said Aram Sinnreich, an associate professor at American University's School of Communication, referring to the \"Great Firewall\" that blocks foreign social media platforms and censors content deemed politically sensitive or disruptive to public order. </p><p>For the West and many other countries, government regulation of social media is uncharted territory. Proposals to regulate for the sake of public interest have been met with fears that it would impede freedom of expression, even as platforms like Facebook - which eventually removed the anti-Rohingya sites - agree that internet companies should be \"accountable for enforcing standards on harmful content\". </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/australasia/article/3003087/new-zealand-bans-manifesto-accused-christchurch-killer\">Should New Zealand ban manifesto of accused Christchurch killer?</url></p><p>Experts say that the core of the issue is that while internet companies like Facebook and some governments want to do the right thing in the name of public interest, nobody has come up with a solution that would do so without potentially affecting rights like free speech. </p><p>The dangers of allowing a platform to self-regulate were highlighted when a Bloomberg report recently found that video-streaming platform YouTube's top executives, focused on increasing the amount of time users spent watching its videos, allowed its algorithm to recommend videos bordering on hate speech or pushing conspiracy theories as these videos tended to attract large numbers of views. </p><p>\"At the beginning, governments intended for platforms to self-regulate, but obviously this has not worked,\" said Fu King-wa, an associate professor at the University of Hong Kong's Journalism and Media Studies Centre. </p><p>\"Now governments around the world are taking it seriously to [protect] social media in their local communities, not just from inappropriate content, but also from disinformation especially when it comes from another country.\" </p><p>Singapore, always circumspect about how media can be used to inflame religious and racial fault lines, earlier this month unveiled a draft law aimed at punishing individuals and social media sites from maliciously spreading online falsehoods. </p><p>Individuals in Singapore who fabricate news or refuse to comply when asked to remove falsehoods could face a decade in prison or fines of up S$20,000 (US$14,765). Firms can be fined up to S$1 million. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/southeast-asia/article/3006144/chinas-internet-laws-are-catching-across-world-washington\">Why Southeast Asia internet laws are starting to look like China's</url></p><p>The UK last week released the Online Harms White Paper which proposed broad social media regulations, including instituting a new regulator with enforcement powers to fine companies and executives who breach the \"code of practice\" by failing to remove content promoting terrorism, hate crimes and self-harm. </p><p>The origins of the fight against inappropriate content and disinformation can be traced back to 2016, amid discoveries of Russian interference and hoards of fake news sites originating in Macedonia, aimed at influencing the US elections and Brexit. That was when the potential for social media platforms to be used maliciously to influence society came to the forefront of social consciousness.  </p><p>Social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter are inherently vulnerable to disinformation because they allow individuals to target advertisements and content at specific groups of people based on characteristics like age, gender, education-level and even political and religious beliefs. </p><p>\"The kind of disinformation campaigns we've seen are endemic to the platform and cannot be stopped without changing the entire platform and business models,\" said Sinnreich. </p><p>He pointed out that the worst case scenario for democratic countries would be if governments implement social media regulations, thereby creating the apparatus for a totalitarian state to exist, allowing political leaders to control access to the internet. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/tech/policy/article/3005252/no-smoking-no-tattoos-or-bikinis-inside-chinas-war-clean-internet\">No bikinis in the bedroom: China's war to 'clean up' the internet</url></p><p>The complex nature of how social media platforms are structured have led some to believe that these companies are now too big to fail. US presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has called for the government to break up big tech companies like Amazon, Google and Facebook. Her argument is that they wield too much power by monopolising the market and using private information for profit, which in turn allows foreign actors to exert social control. </p><p>Facebook and other platforms have moved to tighten advertising rules to prevent such misuse. In March Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg called for governments to play a more active role in regulating the internet. \"Lawmakers often tell me we have too much power over speech, and frankly I agree,\" said Zuckerberg in a statement. \"I've come to believe that we shouldn't make so many important decisions about speech on our own.\" </p><p>The Facebook founder proposed a standardised approach when it comes to deciding what counts as harmful content and to regulate political advertisements online. </p><p>The question of whether social media can and should be regulated has sparked debate around the world, primarily because such regulations are uncharted territory. Traditionally, in many countries, free speech, the press and advertising are considered separate and may have different regulations. But social media platforms today are a combination of everything - from interpersonal communication, content publishing and even advertising. </p><p>\"Platforms are kind of like vertically-integrated chimera, like a beast made up of many different other beasts,\" said Sinnreich. </p><p>Imposing a regulation on a platform might be applicable for one type of content, such as advertising, but the same regulation may be inappropriate for other functions such as private messages between users, he pointed out. </p><p>\"Platforms are so opaque that it's impossible for regulators to figure out where one begins and the other ends ... it's hard to regulate uniformly, but it's also hard to regulate piecemeal,\" he said. </p><p>The global trend towards regulating online content has provoked fears of censorship and restrictions on free speech and civil liberties. In the case of broadly-defined regulation, this might inadvertently cause platforms to err on the side of caution and go overboard in censoring themselves. </p><p>\"When lawmakers create new rules that have never been tested by courts - like Australia's new law or the rules proposed in the UK's White Paper - and then tell platforms to enforce them, we can only expect that a broad swathe of perfectly legal speech is going to disappear,\" said Daphne Keller, director of intermediary liability at the Stanford Centre for Internet and Society. </p><p>\"Even lawmakers telling platforms to enforce existing laws should expect bad results when they impose such heavy penalties on platforms. The incentive is to silence anything that falls in a grey area, or anything that an accuser claims is illegal.\" </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3006107/chinese-game-throne-fans-resigned-final-season-censorship\">Chinese Game of Throne fans resigned to final season censorship</url></p><p>In some cases, critics say such laws and legislation place too much power in the hands of governments to decide what kind of content is acceptable. </p><p>Singapore's draft law, for example, has been criticised because it relies on the Singapore government deciding whether the news in question is factual, and gives it the power to issue mandatory corrections. </p><p>The government has said the law is targeted only at those who deliberately fabricate news and those who spread it without knowing the truth \"don't have to be concerned\". </p><p>The Southeast Asian island state already ranks poorly in terms of press freedom, at No. 151 out of 180 countries and regions, compared to China's ranking of 176th. </p><p>Ultimately, comprehensive social media regulations should be accompanied by a mechanism where platforms and individuals have the opportunity to challenge removals and penalties can be imposed on those who abuse the system. </p><p>\"Every country faces the problem of regulating and protecting speech. Ultimately, it's a constitutional and political issue,\" said Lei Ya-wen, assistant professor of sociology at Harvard University. </p><p>\"One major difference between how China deals with the problem and how many other countries deal with it is whether citizens have functioning legal channels to dispute the government's administrative decisions, judicial decisions, regulations, and laws.\" </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Additional reporting by Meng Jing</emphasis></p><p>Copyright (c) 2019.

At the moment he is just looking northwards.</p><p>                     John Gemmell                   </p><p>                     Wem, Shropshire                   </p><p>                     Critics of 24-hour lights proved right                   </p><p>Just a while ago there was correspondence about the amount of electricity apparently being wasted by keeping all the lights switched on for 24 hours a day.</p><p>We were told that this was for security reasons and a HMRC spokesperson was adamant as to the necessity for this practice, advising us that there was no alternative.</p><p>Well, so much for such a statement, it hasn't gone unnoticed that there was in fact an alternative after all.</p><p>The lighting has since been reduced to a fraction of the intensity that it once was.</p><p>Top marks for those who highlighted the problem and bottom marks for the HMRC official who tried to defend it.</p><p>                     Brian Francis                   </p><p>Grangetown, Cardiff                   </p><p>                     HS2 could fall foul of our pothole problem                   </p><p>The Prime Minister has just given the go-ahead for the HS2 project.</p><p>HS2 has to be a part of a national integrated transport network and unless the whole network is functioning efficiently, the knock-on effect would seriously challenge the justification for building HS2.</p><p>The brochure for the proposed HS2 train is claiming a journey time saving of about 30 minutes between London and Birmingham.</p><p>That saving is on the HS2 train's journey between the station in London and the station in Birmingham, but that doesn't account for the journey that a passengers will be making.</p><p>The train journey is only a part of a passenger's journey, which may begin from a location that is miles from the departure station and end in a location which is miles from the arrival station.</p><p>These journeys to and from the stations are the cause of my concern, which is that the usual ongoing delays, traffic jams and roadworks on existing roads that frequently disrupt road travel plans will still be there, and will virtually cancel out the time saved on the train journey. Has anyone seen a strategic plan for the urgent work needed to rectify the appalling state of our pothole-ridden roads</p><p>If a passenger's journey start is close to the departure station and journey's end is close to the arrivals station, then that 30 minutes may be reasonably claimed as significant. But the vast majority will not be close for one reason or the other, and on that basis alone, the cost justification for HS2 appears flawed.</p><p>It would be a good idea if the Prime Minister could fend off his critics by ordering and funding a plan to repair properly the roads in Wales.</p><p>                     Kevin Granville                   </p><p>                     Peterson-super-Ely                   </p><p>                     We ignore biblical teaching at our peril                   </p><p>The stark juxtaposition of two letters in Tuesday's Western Mail highlighted a serious problem in today's society.</p><p>Mr Mike Beech and his friend experienced extreme embarrassment as they endured obscene behaviour and foul language on a ferry to Ireland.</p><p>The letter from Steve Denton commented on the apparent delight of Ms Jane Bryant, Assembly Member for Newport West, and Pride Cymru at the success achieved by LGBTQ+ in the cancellation of a UK evangelical tour by Franklin Graham, the son of Dr Billy Graham, on the grounds that his views about sexual, gender and extreme religious issues mirrored the principles expressed in the book of all books, the Bible.</p><p>Those principles are the antithesis of the behaviour and language Mr Beech experienced but which are commonplace in many Welsh towns and cities.</p><p>Among other things, the Bible teaches standards of decency, human dignity, respect for all others, sexual morality, national equality, tolerance, love, forgiveness, parental guidance and discipline, self-control, etc, etc. Tragically, it seems that our society has little or no interest in fostering those principles but insists upon bombarding us even in our homes with drama, reality shows and so-called entertainment that frequently exemplify the degrading behaviour and speech Mr Beech refers to.</p><p>What we are seeing in our land today is the direct result of recent generations' refusal to accept or even hear the Bible's blueprint for human beliefs and practice, let alone teach those values to our children. The wholesale collapse of moral standards in the UK is at risk until or unless the right to address the issue is given, and responded to freely and positively.</p><p>When will it dawn upon us as parents, grandparents, teachers, political leaders and all who exercise influence on our young people that we are responsible right now and will remain guilty until such time as we return to the God upon Whom we all depend for life itself, and listen to what He has to say about the state of our nation</p><p> Mr Graham has spent the past 40-plus years working his socks off to bring physical relief to people suffering from extreme famine, war, disease and poverty in over 100 countries, as CEO and chairman of a relief organisation, Samaritan's Purse.</p><p>                     Geoffrey Dodge                   </p><p>                     Usk                   </p><p>                     Tech firms have duty to safeguard children                   </p><p>I'm hugely encouraged by the landmark plans afoot to give Ofcom powers to regulate social networks. The safety of children online has been compromised for too long, but this breakthrough could pave the way in setting a global standard in protecting children in their digital worlds.</p><p>The plans announced by the UK Government highlight a commitment to leading change by standing up to big tech firms.</p><p>Now, Ofcom must be given the necessary powers, allowing it to enforce substantial fines on social networks not doing enough to prevent adults grooming children on their sites.</p><p>The internet is a wonderful place for young people to learn and social networks form a big part of their friendships, enabling them to seek support from peers. However, no longer should children be exposed to harmful content and abuse because of a slapdash approach by tech giants.</p><p>In just two years 2017-18 to 2018-19 there were 7,500 online grooming crimes recorded by police in England and Wales.</p><p>It's gone on too long and social networks must not be allowed to continue dragging their heels.

Good afternoon, everybody. Welcome to Western Unionpresentation at the Goldman SachsTechnology Internet Conference. My name is Jim Schneider. I'm the payments analyst here at Goldman in research. And it's my pleasure to introduce Western Uniontoday. We're really, really happy to have CEO, Hikmet Ersek; and CFO, Raj Agrawal, with us today from the company. Welcome, guys.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">RAJESH K. AGRAWAL, EXECUTIVE VP &amp; CFO, THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY: Thank you.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HIKMET ERSEK, PRESIDENT, CEO &amp; DIRECTOR, THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY: Hi.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>JAMES EDWARD SCHNEIDER: Macro. I think, Hikmet, one thing that we're trying to do with all of our companies at the conference. And I think the top thing on all investors' minds right now is the macro environment and what you're seeing. You operate in over 200 countries, so you probably have the best handle on the pulse of this than almost anybody else here. So can you give us an idea of the trends, what you're seeing in the major markets and corridors right now at a broad level?</p><p>HIKMET ERSEK: It's not a big change since 2018, but maybe a little bit more cautious than 2018. Especially coming the last quarter in 2018, we could see some of the -- a little bit slower, growing slower. However, generally, I would say that in our guidance, everything is planned in our guidance. U.S. has a good economic environment. Europe is stable. Parts of Europe, Southern Europe has some challenges, but Europe generally, U.K., France and Germany, they are key countries for us and doing pretty well. As you know, Asia is doing well, but it's not an outbound country for us. The oil prices in the Middle East helped our business to stabilize. We implemented some pricing actions last year there, which is going to be on -- it's going to be 12 months now in the second quarter. We see some turnaround there. Also, the transactions are coming better, and people are using remittance market, sending back money home. I would say the biggest question is the currency volatility. It is volatile. Strong euro doesn't help our -- in our business in the reported base because, as you know, most of our transactions are -- adopted dollars on. And so that is -- has an impact to our reported numbers. However, constant currency, I would say, general the business is stable, resilient and customers are using us.</p><p>JAMES EDWARD SCHNEIDER: Yes. And then there has been some discussion by some of your competitors or peers, I would say, more in the payments world that kind of -- that are tied more to retail commerce that the travel-related trends, especially whether that's being the strength of the dollar or whatever it is, those are getting impacted. I'm just kind of curious, I mean, most of your trends are clearly tied to migration and labor, but I'm curious whether you're seeing any kind of knock-on impacts of the cross-border travel and the -- for example, people coming to U.S. on business.</p><p>HIKMET ERSEK: Well, on the -- as you said, our customers are mainly migrant background, and they do use our service, they continue to use our services. Even the -- during the high volatility of currencies, customers use us, right. I mean, they send back money home what they earned, and that helps us. The transaction strength has been quite strong. And even the principal amount, we were growing by 7% constant currency last quarter, which shows that we're a stable business. And so the customers are continuing to use us, and we don't see big impact. The very strong growth is coming from new customer segment from westernunion.com, our digital channel. It grew by 25% last quarter in transaction terms and over 22% revenue terms. So it's a quite strong. We are gaining new customer segments. 80% of the customers are still new to our digital channels, which gives us new opportunities. And these customers are also customers who travel. They have bank account. They are bank customers. Because to do an online transaction, you need a credit card or debit card or a bank account. And there are different customer segments than our existing customers, so we don't see that big change there.</p><p>JAMES EDWARD SCHNEIDER: Very good. And then relative to the guidance you provided, low single-digit constant currency revenue growth for 2019. If you just think of beyond the macro piece, which is clearly out of your control, what are the factors that kind of could trade to the high or low end of that guidance range? What are the company-specific drivers that you see?</p><p>RAJESH K. AGRAWAL: Yes. I mean, we gave an outlook just for everyone's benefit of low single-digit constant currency growth, and that excludes the impact of anything related to -- from an Argentina inflation standpoint. Obviously, we continue to believe that our retail business will be a flattish-type growth, maybe low single digits over time, not necessarily just this year. Digital continues to have a really strong growth track record, and it's more than $500 million now. We do need to get better performance from our payments businesses, Jim. WUBS, the B2B business improved in the fourth quarter, so that's positive. It's a good step in the right direction. However, our bill payment businesses have been a little bit mixed, right. So with the devaluation of the Argentine peso, that impacts the dollar results in Argentina. Our Speedpay business was negative in the fourth quarter. So some of those things need to be better for us to be at the higher end of our outlook. We think digital is going to keep driving the key part of our consumer business. That's really where our big focus is, and it's becoming a bigger and bigger piece of that now.</p><p>HIKMET ERSEK: Yes. And part of that is also you have to think about the domestic -- yes, domestic money transfer business. Yes, domestic money transfer business is about 80% of our revenue. It's a declining business, but it impacts on the U.S. We don't have domestic money transfer business globally. Main business is our cross-border, cross-currency businesses. And U.S. domestic business has been under price pressure from Zelle and Venmo, and -- but still, they are customers. They still want to get cash, so it's about 80% of our business and had an impact also on our growth rates. But generally, I feel very confident if it comes to the cross-border, cross-currency, I don't see also any price pressure there. It's very stable. So short term, I believe that there's no price pressure there also.</p><p>JAMES EDWARD SCHNEIDER: Yes. If you think broadly about the competitive environment, and not necessarily in pricing, but more just in terms of market share kind of shifts, maybe talk about how the competitive landscape has changed, if at all, over the last 2 to 3 years. I mean, clearly, there was a lot of excitement about the digital-only players. A few years ago, some of them I don't think have kind of gotten the scale they had potentially hoped. And then you have the more traditional players like MoneyGram and Euronet. So maybe just kind of help us understand how that universe is -- keep evolving from a broad level and what are the -- kind of the private players are getting stronger or weaker?</p><p>HIKMET ERSEK: Well, first of all, since 2012, or '10, '12, the business model has changed. The regulatory environment changed totally. And all your customers has to be done by the money transfer companies, not only by agents. With that, we invested a huge in our compliance programs and technology and artificial intelligence. So now your customers operating 20,000 corridors is done by our compliance machine, I would say, or cross-border platform. And doing that has changed the business model and gave us in the beginning some costs, but now it's a competitive advantage. We're operating in 200 countries, 20,000 corridors and not many companies can do that. They really hit the wall sometimes to enter a country or keep the business there. That's changed totally, but we're seeing resilience. We have seen this single-digit growth over the few years came from keeping the business there and really, again, in market share from -- based on our strength, based on our compliance environment, based on our platform. The second thing was that the traditional competitors definitely have to invest also like MoneyGram or Euronet or others have to invest also in the compliance environment and on the platform, the technology, but we started early. And we see the benefits now of that -- our compliance costs have been stable to last few years, and we are starting to put artificial intelligence technology high. We know your customer. We know the behavior of the customers. The fraud controls are getting much better. And you really comply with the global regulations in 200 countries and territories. That's a big competitive advantage we're investing in, in that case. In the digital environment -- I'm sorry, on the traditional part, basically, the competitors are going to continue to be corridor specialists. A Moroccan bank operating from France to Morocco, Mexican bank operating U.S. to Mexico. All these things will continue. That was always the case, right. That has not changed. On the digital environment, there has been in the past year, entrants in the market with the lower price environment, but it's also -- they've been only operating in certain corridors, and they could only drop money in certain way on their nonaccount. Our biggest advantage is that on the receive side, we pay out in cash or a nonaccount or on a wallet in minutes. So I can use my phone and really send money from my phone to different corridors to 200 countries immediately in 20,000 corridors and in a very efficient way. So the growth has been built on our existing capabilities. It's not that we created a new company, westernunion.com. We only sat on our existing capabilities and went globally. Now we are in 60 countries with our digital westernunion.com. And I always say to Raj, I want to be in 200 countries soon, to connect in 200 countries also with digital, not only with retail, also with digital. The other thing is also our platform now has been that effective to the compliance and settlement and technology investment, but white labeling started. The people are interested now in our platform can really collect exotic currencies like we announced during the -- Amazon announced actually. We are on the platform of Amazon for supporting their products, paid by quote, collecting funds, exotic currencies, for the goods they -- for the customers they buy. So our platform has been early -- we invest in early years. The board has supported that. We invested, as you know, in 2012, didn't do -- environment didn't do very well, but we feel much more confident to take the company to the next step.</p><p>JAMES EDWARD SCHNEIDER: Yes. I guess I did want to ask about your network of agents for a second. I think you have a network of, I believe, it's over 550,000 agents at this point. How many of these agents have kind of exclusive arrangements? And has the numbers of those agents with exclusives kind of changed over time? And I guess kind of where do you see those broad kind of agent commission as a percent of revenue kind of going directionally? And how do you think about the overall agent strategy at this point?</p><p>HIKMET ERSEK: So there are 2 answers on that. First of all, the exclusives there has been there most importantly that we did not lose exclusivity on the send agents, which are most important one because once the money is in the system, it's safe in the system, right. It doesn't -- so the main agent, we never lost an agent in the last 20 years, I believe.</p><p>RAJESH K. AGRAWAL: Yes. But what we say, our top 40 agents have been with us for an average of 20 years. So...</p><p>HIKMET ERSEK: And they deliver the main of our revenues, right. Main of our revenues comes from the top 40 agents. And so that's very important. I think the agent relationship has been for many, many years, and that has not changed. And I don't see that, that's going to change. Our contract has been multiyear contracts. And there has been not any big -- actually, we are gaining agents. We just signed Albertsons and which is a huge network, combining with our -- that was only in the U.S. And so it is important to know that agent relationship is good. The agent commissions will go down over the years, I believe. There are 2 reasons for that. First of all, the mix. We are starting payout to our agents who have accounts, account payout, right. It's a lower cost. So there is no (inaudible) there. It's pay a lower cost. The second thing is also -- as the business model, as I mentioned earlier, has changed, there's less responsibility to know your customer on all these sites, where we take the compliance costs. I think the costs are coming down over the year, which has been the fact over the years, the costs really coming down. So but 60% of our costs are variable costs and main part of that are agent commissions. I mean, I'm ready to pay the agents more if the revenue comes higher. That will help us. But generally, the agents' commissions are coming down.</p><p>JAMES EDWARD SCHNEIDER: Yes. But it's really -- you're saying driven by those 2 factors. It's the mix in terms of the account base, and it's also the fact that you're taking more of the compliance and putting it on yourself.</p><p>HIKMET ERSEK: Yes, I mean, our compliance cost has been stable, about $200 million, most of them are fixed. but still, the agents are in the payout side doing less, and then that's the formula.</p><p>JAMES EDWARD SCHNEIDER: Yes, yes. I do want to talk about the -- go back to the digital business which you kind of started to touch on. I think it's still -- last quarter, it was 21.2% revenue growth. I think it's 12% now of your overall C2C business. You talked about new markets and getting into more new markets from, I believe, 60 you said right now and then extending beyond that. What are the new markets that you kind of have seen the most incremental traction on in terms of corridors over the last year as you built enough new ones? And then where are the ones over the next year or 2 you are most excited about opening?</p><p>HIKMET ERSEK: Well, the good news is that there are still room in the existing markets and the growth is coming from the existing markets, especially from North America and European Union. That's very strong. And the interesting thing on the online business is that once you download your app or you register, you use more often our services. The retail customers are using less and their online customers are using much more our services and more often. So that's big news. The existing business has still -- the U.S. and European Union has still room to grow, and I think that's going to continue to happen on the digital business that drives the growth. The new countries are new. They grow very fast, extremely fast, but they don't have the absolute numbers yet to count on that. The new countries are -- I'm very excited about Gulf states. They just launched in the Gulf states, as you know, the Gulf states are a huge remittance market, especially to South Asia, but also to Asia and Africa. And we've just launched there the new -- our new apps from the Gulf states. That's a growth area. And that's going to continue to add on our growth. Now we are in 60 countries, and we hopefully to be in soon in 200 countries. And like we did in retail business, we started the retail business, I remember, I think, 19 years with the [company] in U.S., Canada and U.K., then Continental Europe, then Middle East, then Africa, all these things, and we are doing the same with our online westernunion.com business.</p><p>JAMES EDWARD SCHNEIDER: Today, in the 60-plus markets that we're in, we cover about 75% of the outbound principal opportunity.</p><p>JAMES EDWARD SCHNEIDER: 75% penetration on principals?</p><p>RAJESH K. AGRAWAL: No, 75% of the opportunity for outbound money transfer from digital is covered by the 60-plus markets that we're in. So there's a long tail, right. But we want to be everywhere in the world. Because long term, that is going to become a bigger opportunity for us, so -- but we have quite strong coverage, 60-plus market plus a lot of other territories that where customers can access these 60 country sites.</p><p>JAMES EDWARD SCHNEIDER: Got it. But the Gulf states sounds like the biggest near term kind of...</p><p>HIKMET ERSEK: Well, actually, Europe is still huge. Russia is huge. There is still room, and now we just started in Europe expansion, actually 2 years ago. I mean, we've been in U.K. and Germany, France, maybe more than a few years, but expansion in Europe just started. These are really going to add -- and then Middle East is just new but has a huge future.</p><p>JAMES EDWARD SCHNEIDER: I think you talked about leveraging your kind of global network to launch the new initiatives you referred to before the whole Amazon partnership. And I think it's shop global and paying local is what you call it. What was the background behind that partnership? How did it get kind of off the ground? And how has it performed so far?</p><p>HIKMET ERSEK: Well, we just started the partnership, we are testing. Our scheme is that, as I had mentioned earlier, we invested heavily in our platform. And our platform was serving only a certain customer level, was best seen in branded products serving C2C customers, and we did that. And then we realized over the years that our platform can also be used by different people, different customers. The first were the banks. They started this, especially to serve their customers in exotic currencies. As you know, we settled -- we pay out in 137 currencies, right. And not many banks do have that access. But if you want to walk to a bank and you want to send money to Vietnam or to Egypt, you suddenly got stuck, right. And the costs were higher and everything and they say, \"Okay, can I use my brand and use platform to drop money in Egypt or to drop money in Vietnam.\" Right. if that started -- the idea started, we said okay, Scotiabank, I mentioned it several times, was one of the first one and then Swiss Post was one of the -- also first one. It started with that idea we said, our platform can serve more than [what we're seeing] in branded customer without cannibalizing our business, and that turned out to be the right thing to do. And so what we are doing now is that offering our platform to customers, to clients like Amazon. Amazon, it's their product. It's their price. It's there to be only like a processor. And we are collecting. The people are buying online. They get a quote, and they go with that quote within 48 hours to a location. We collect the money in local currency and then Amazon gets settled and sends the goods to the customer. And that's the way how Amazon, I believe, wants to expand that. We have just started few weeks ago in 10 countries, and then we tested it. So tests are doing pretty well. We had also our learnings, right. I mean, some locations we only paid out in cash but then had to collect funds. That funds, as I see it, have to change. We have to train them, and we had to be in last mile. Look, people are connected worldwide now. They got connected. They can shop, if they're online, with smartphone from a small island in the Philippines, but they don't have the international currency to buy things. They don't have the international cards. They only have local cards or local cash. But they are connected. They want to buy our global good, and that connection is we're seeing the strength that came to that agreement.</p><p>JAMES EDWARD SCHNEIDER: That's very interesting. And then, I guess, maybe kind of going back to the digital piece as well. I mean, any look at the Apple App Store or iTunes Store, you can see that you've got a really good rating in terms of the usability of the platform. And it certainly ranked among top of the market, can you maybe talk about these advantages you see from either technology perspective or scale perspective or compliance perspective relative to some of these digital competitors that you see. Is it just a matter of reach? Is it also technology? How do you think about the dimensions of that? And are any of these ad-based guys kind of a significant worry for you in terms of competitive edge, because it seems like you're way bigger than all of them and still growing very quickly.</p><p>HIKMET ERSEK: Look, if you talk about FinTech, it's called FinTech, 50-50, Fin, 50-50 -- 50%, tech; 50%, Fin. Some people forget it's all -- they believe it's 100% tech. It's not. You have to connect the needs of the customer with the technology. That's what we have done, and that's probably the most important thing. I encourage everyone here to download the Western Unionapp or -- also the audience, I'd really encourage that and test it, so you don't even (inaudible) transaction. If I go on my Western Unionapp, I can choose immediately 200 countries to send money from my bank. It's not a big tech surprise. You have to be in 200 countries to send. You have to have the licenses in 200 countries. Then you send money. You have to collect money from your bank. So if you have a collection system, how do you collect the money? You can collect money from your account. You can collect money from your debit card. You can collect from your credit card, plus we have staged transaction also. If you can't stage your transaction, go to a location-paying cash on your mobile. So combining that fund collection and fund-out model on a device technically, it's something special that Western Unioncan do it in 200 countries globally. That brought us to high ratings. It's not only the usage and obviously, we had to be all of those, that we listen to the customers, how to develop the apps and how to really be in a better situation. But the secret sauce of combining FinTech is probably what we're seeing has been doing that [167] years very well, and that's why we are leading in the digital area. I mean, we have now more than $0.5 billion revenue. As you said, it's 12% of our revenue, but it's growing very fast, 20% and contributing to our growth.</p><p>JAMES EDWARD SCHNEIDER: Yes. And then you've mentioned many times before about how a lot of those digital customers are actually net new to your platform. How do you think about where all those customers are coming from? Are they coming from just simply like a web search? Are they coming from just kind of the inbound from an app store? Are they coming -- some of them kind of coming off from the traditional cash business? How do you think about analyzing that?</p><p>HIKMET ERSEK: Some of them are coming from cash business. About 80% are new, very clear. And it's always surprising year-over-year has been 80% new to us. What we do is probably we are the best ethnic marketing company of the world. We do ethnic marketing different to a Filipino in Italy than a Filipino in the U.S. We do ethnic marketing differently to Ukrainian in Germany than a Ukrainian in the U.K. Mexican, it's different. And that's exact -- and the digital environment helps us actually doing ethnic marketing in a much better way. We communicate to them in the host country in their languages. We promote in their digital environment in their languages our promotions. If you Google that, you will go -- in Turkish, in Germany, you'll get it immediately the Western Unionapp. So that -- the marketing environment is huge. And in fact, the most of our marketing dollars has now shift to digital growth. And Raj can talk about the profitability of our -- the digital business, but the growth comes from investing really in the marketing and technology environment on that environment. These customers are second, third generation of -- most of them are migrants. They'll have their global -- they are global citizens. They'll have their relatives back home. They'll want to support them, and -- but some of them, I'm sure that some of you are global citizen here. And they want to support their loved one, and they don't have time to go to a location. And while they do it right there, analytics reports here, they can also [oversee the] transactions. That's the environment we are covering today.</p><p>JAMES EDWARD SCHNEIDER: Yes. So I want to put you in this for a second, Raj. I mean, I kind of want to switch to the financials a little bit and maybe kind of -- you mentioned investment areas. I want to ask about kind of R&amp;D investment priorities and kind of product development. How do you think about like your overall budget and spend envelope for all of the activities? And kind of what are the top 2 or 3 priorities you have right now?</p><p>RAJESH K. AGRAWAL: Yes. The top priority is very clear. It's a lot about digital, so investing in digital growth and expansion. And it's not just we [got comm], it's all the other channels and things that go with it. So more account funding capabilities, more account payout capabilities, more mobile. We have 35 of the 60 countries that are mobile enabled today. We want to be mobile everywhere in the world just like we want to have dot-com everywhere in the world. We want it to be mobile enabled. As we see that, about 75% of transactions initiated on wu.com are done on a mobile device, even though it's not in every single country yet. So all of that takes time and money and resources and people, and so that's our #1 priority is to grow our digital business all around the world as fast as we can. And we've said that we want to be in 200 countries and territories with all these different channels and capabilities in the next few years. We haven't given a specific time line, but the next few years. Secondly, I would say it's other offshoots of what we can do digitally. So other kinds of cross-border payment opportunities, like the Amazon relationship that Hikmet talked about earlier. We can leverage our cross-border platform for other kinds of use cases that we don't have that visible today. I mean, it took us several decades to create what we created with the technology, the compliance, the ability to settle everywhere in the world in minutes, and that's something that we can leverage for other's use. We also are investing in privacy and information security and other basic things that are required. So those are, I would say, the top priorities that we have. And obviously, in a low-growth environment that we're in and with the negative currency impact, it makes it a little bit harder to get margin expansion, right, with all of the things that we want to invest in, but then we also have this low-growth environment that we're in. So we have to just balance those things as we move along.</p><p>JAMES EDWARD SCHNEIDER: Yes. So in that sense, I want to ask about, which is margins. And so clearly, you've now completed the WU Way program. So I believe, $70 million of incremental savings dropping through. Can we just talk about the different levers you have? Is there anything more to pull on from a cost rationalization perspective without damaging the investment priorities that you have? And maybe talk about what the level of revenue growth is that you need, to actually drive some more margin expansion in the business?</p><p>RAJESH K. AGRAWAL: Sure. We're always looking for cost-efficiency opportunities. And again in a low-growth environment, it's more challenging to get the margin expansion. But with respect to our WU Way programs, we achieved $70 million run rate in savings last year, and we've basically completed the formalized part of our program where we took some charges a couple of years ago, and that's really the run rate. So we're not going to necessarily call out additional savings as we move forward, but we're absolutely focused on finding more operating efficiencies. If you look at our biggest cost item, it's commission costs in the business, right. And so we'll keep looking for opportunities there. We've done a good job, as you mentioned earlier, of bringing those costs down. Compliance costs have been relatively stable. And we're going to keep rolling out Lean in our organization. Throughout the organization, we are training everyone in our organization on Lean principles and Lean management, and -- but that's going to really go to funding things that we want to invest in. And so that's really how we think about overall margins. If we can get mid-single-digit type of revenue growth, that's really where we need to be to get the leverage on our cost structure. Real, real growth, right, not constant currency dollars, but real reported...</p><p>JAMES EDWARD SCHNEIDER: Real dollars.</p><p>RAJESH K. AGRAWAL: Real dollars. Yes. Some of it you can actually...</p><p>JAMES EDWARD SCHNEIDER: (inaudible) domicile.</p><p>RAJESH K. AGRAWAL: Yes, exactly. So if we can get mid-single-digit type of growth that gives us a lot more flexibility in what we do for the bottom line.</p><p>JAMES EDWARD SCHNEIDER: Yes. I wanted to ask about M&amp;A and also kind of just the way the portfolio management of the business, make sure we ask that because we've been getting a lot of questions from investors about that topic. So if you think about the acquisition side of the balance sheet for a second, can we talk about the leverage level you feel comfortable at? And the kind of transactions you might consider in terms of acquisitions, whether they be incremental technology tuck-ins or anything incremental from like a kind of services or diversification perspective, what are the things that you kind of think about in terms of opportunities for Western Unionto just kind of diversify the business beyond what you have been today?</p><p>HIKMET ERSEK: I can go first, if you like.</p><p>JAMES EDWARD SCHNEIDER: Sure.</p><p>HIKMET ERSEK: Look, we're always looking for acquisitional opportunities. Obviously, we have a strong balance sheet that allows us to look around. But it should have to be aligned with our strategy. And some of the multiples, [I've said], we need is not there yet to find that golden acquisitional opportunity. If somebody knows the idea, I'm more than happy to listen, but we have the balance sheet and we are looking for that any time. Look, we are also looking at our existing portfolio, and we are looking where we are very much focused on the cross-border, cross-currency, C2B-, B2C-, C2C-related transactions, and that's what we are doing day by day and operating pretty well. Out of the core business, we may look at some opportunities to drive the shareholder value. Could be different in the different parts of the portfolio businesses, right, but our focus is going to continue to be on the C2B and B2C and C2C, and that's where we are focused on.</p><p>RAJESH K. AGRAWAL: If you look at the platform we created over the last several decades, it's actually very hard for someone to replicate that, including ourselves. When we think about acquisition, it has to really advance the ball for us, right. So could we have more mobile capabilities in a year instead of 3, 4 years that it might take us? Or could we have account payout globally in 200 markets instead of over the next few years? Can we do it overnight? So those are the kinds of things we could consider, but nothing has really presented itself that would really be so much more than what we have. We can keep going at it organically, which is to build out and just leverage the platform. But if there's something else that can complement that, we'd certainly consider it, but obviously nothing's presented itself with that large, at least.</p><p>JAMES EDWARD SCHNEIDER: Yes. I mean, just in terms of the existing portfolio, you've kind of like you've talked about the B2B business, whether that could be if you consider strategic alternative there, what's the calculus that you're using to evaluate that? Is it simply kind of price and return for you get? Is there -- what level of strategic alignment between what that business does today and maybe the rest of your business? And is that less or more than it was 3 or 4 years ago?</p><p>HIKMET ERSEK: I think we're very much focused on executing the business. Last quarter has been coming better than the previous quarters. I think the team is doing a good job, but we'll do everything to drive the shareholder value and the right price. We will look at that, and that's our focus. Raj and I are focused constantly on that. And the calculation is based really on the shareholder value and every calculation we will take. But the team is doing a good job the last quarter. The volatility helped a little bit, but also our payments part helped a lot. The university payments, the verticals to drive the growth. And we've seen a strong growth on the B2B business there. But again, we will do -- we are looking at everything to drive the shareholder value.</p><p>JAMES EDWARD SCHNEIDER: Yes. And then finally, maybe just kind of like leave it on the buyback side. And clearly, that's been a scenario we've executed pretty much nonstop over the past several years, I think like a little over $400 million return on the buyback side this past year. Failing all that in terms of acquisitions or divestitures, is there anything kind of more that you would want or could do on the buyback side beyond what you've already done?</p><p>HIKMET ERSEK: We've been giving back almost 100% of our free cash flow through both dividends and buybacks. Dividends are well over $300 million a year. Buybacks, as you said, have been in the $400 million to $500 million range. So really just comes down to how we allocate our capital. We want to keep investing in the business for all the growth opportunities that we talked about, given it's obviously a very high priority and a big use of our cash flow. We'd like to do the right kind of acquisition, but nothing major is presenting itself at least at this stage, and then we've been giving back everything else through buybacks.</p><p>HIKMET ERSEK: Plus increase of 5% on dividends...</p><p>RAJESH K. AGRAWAL: Yes, we just increased our dividend by 5%, so it's a key important use of our cash. And so we'll just -- we always look at those -- or in that order of priorities in how we spend our cash. You could certainly -- if you had the right kind of acquisition opportunity you could certainly flex your debt structure a bit, right, in the short term. You always get some room from the rating agency standpoint to do that. And so those kinds of things we would certainly want to evaluate.</p><p>JAMES EDWARD SCHNEIDER: I think, unfortunately, we're out of time, but thank you, Raj. Thank you for being here. We appreciate it.</p><p>RAJESH K. AGRAWAL: Thank you very much.</p><p>HIKMET ERSEK: Thank you very much.</p><p>RAJESH K. AGRAWAL: Thanks, Jim.</p><p>JAMES EDWARD SCHNEIDER: Thanks so much.

The deal would see two of America's largest money transfer and remittance services join forces.</p><p>Colorado-based Western Union has reportedly made a takeover offer for MoneyGram, but no decision has been made, and the acquirer could opt to proceed without a deal. Neither party has commented on the deal.</p><p>At the end of the first quarter of 2020, MoneyGram's total revenues were down roughly 7-8%</p><p>Dallas-based MoneyGram has suffered due to the global coronavirus lockdowns. Over the years, the firm has allocated a large portion of its technology efforts to digital kiosks, rather than website or mobile app development.</p><p>In the first quarter of this year, just 18% of MoneyGram's money was transacted digitally. The firm still relies heavily on physical channels - many of which are currently shut due to various countries' continued lockdown measures.</p><p>Traditional remittance firms face an increasingly competitive landscape. With business models built heavily around fees, both Western Union and MoneyGram have had to pivot to compete with fintechs like TransferWise which offer digital-only money transfer services at a discounted rate.</p><p>Policy makers and governments around the globe have also long been keen to cut the fees firms can charge for sending money, putting further pressure on these long-standing business models to change and adapt. According to the World Bank, it costs on average $6.79 for every $100 sent overseas.</p><p>At the end of the first quarter of 2020, MoneyGram's total revenues were down roughly 7-8%. But hours after reports on the takeover bid emerged on Monday, MoneyGram shares rose as high as 74% in late trading.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: </emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fintechfutures.com/2020/03/western-union-signs-up-integral-for-bankfx-system/\">Western Union signs up Integral for BankFX system</url></p><p>Western Union is not the first to eye up MoneyGram</p><p>On closing, MoneyGram's market value finished on about $176.5 million, with about $878 million still in debt. Western Union's stocks rose 3.5%, finishing on a much larger market value of $8.5 billion.</p><p>Despite the public perception that MoneyGram is Western Union's slightly smaller sibling, the two firms are on opposite ends of the valuation spectrum, with TransferWise, Remitly, and WorldRemit all topping MoneyGram's valuation.</p><p>In a surprise decision last year, the money transfer service decided to sell 10% of its equity to blockchain solution provider Ripple in a $50 million deal. MoneyGram's transfer flows make XRP - the Ripple coin - more valuable, hence the investment.</p><p>But after experiencing some market volatility due to its affiliations with Ripple, MoneyGram's valuation eventually settled to back down to pre-Ripple levels.</p><p>Western Union is not the first to eye up MoneyGram. Chinese Big Tech Ant Financial agreed to acquire the remittance firm back in 2017, but the deal was abandoned when US national security regulators pushed back on the deal.</p><p>In 2007, Euronet had offered to buy the remittance firm, but MoneyGram kept stalling on the deal until its stock started to free fall and Euronet terminated its offer. It threw its hat into the ring again in 2017, and even hired lobbyists to prevent a Chinese business like Ant Financial from buying it instead.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read next: </emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fintechfutures.com/2020/03/western-union-refunds-153m-for-scam-victims/\">Western Union refunds $153m for scam victims</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fintechfutures.com/files/2019/08/MoneyGram.jpg?x92426\">Link to Image</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fintechfutures.com/files/2020/06/western-union-1.jpg?x92426\">Link to Image</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FNTECH-15209423</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FNTECH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60C9-G6K1-JBSJ-V1HJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">472844</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"551\"/><timeReceived>10:13 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Informal PLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Fintechfutures.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19127\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 2, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0009SYG</classCode><className>WESTERN UNION CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS522320 FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS PROCESSING, RESERVE &amp;

But importantly, they would encourage, not stifle innovation.''</p><p>The intervention comes after Chancellor Philip Hammond announced on Monday that online tech giants such as Amazon and Google will be slapped with a new digital services tax as part of a package of measures meant to ease the burden on the beleaguered high street.</p><p>As part of the Autumn Budget, he said a 2% UK digital services tax would come into force in April 2020 and is expected to raise \u00a3400 million a year.</p><p>It will only be paid by profitable companies that generate at least \u00a3500 million a year in global revenues.</p><p>It applies to income firms generate through providing search engines, social media platforms and online marketplaces.</p><p>As well as powers governing tax and the buying out of smaller competitors, the report also suggests allowing the regulators to:</p><p>- Set and enforce standards on tech firms, with the power to impose sanctions for ``reckless or negligent behaviour''.</p><p>- Ensure firms create tools that allow consumers to ``search, control and export data'' shared with online services, with extra transparency and information over third party usage.</p><p>- Create ``safe harbours'' to test ways of overcoming ``economic and social challenges'', and be able to recommend the removal or reform of ``obsolete rules that inhibit innovation or the public interest''.</p><p>Mr Blair wrote that ``This competitive edge will be key'', adding: ``Many parts of the developing world have begun to converge economically with Europe, while China is vying with the US.</p><p>``This should not be a zero-sum game; it is simply the new reality.''</p><p>Report author Chris Yiu said that anti-globalisation sentiment was being compounded by ``a backward-looking turn against technology''.</p><p>He added: ``There is no question that the tech sector has brought much of the current firestorm on itself, but politicians and policymakers are complicit too.</p><p>``Today, the internet is not just another sector: it has escaped into and disrupted all of them.</p><p>``To find a sustainable solution, policymakers need to understand how the world has changed.

That's the lesson, again, of the latest bank scandal.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fast and cheap international money transfers symbolise the global mobility and tech-connectedness possible in the gig economy. These payment systems allow foreign workers to easily remit wages home and let aged pensioners retire securely anywhere in the world. But these systems also expose the underbelly of globalisation when targeted by international criminals. This is why Westpac will pay a huge financial penalty for its systemic breaches of the laws that help the authorities stop the wash of dirty money around the globe.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Westpac has admitted to breaching reporting and record-keeping requirements in relation to 23 million transactions between 2013 and 2018. These include failing to report 19.5 million international transfers worth $11 billion due to a programming glitch in the automated reporting systems. It also failed to do due diligence on 16 overseas banks it has international transfer arrangements with. By choosing the faster and cheaper LitePay remittance system - to work around the SWIFT global payment system judged too slow and expensive to handle low value, large volume transfers - Westpac is accused of allowing banks in high-risk jurisdictions to access Australia's banking system and facilitating money laundering. As detailed in regulator AUSTRAC's statement of claim, Westpac cannot trace where funds originated in significant numbers of transfers.</p><p>AUSTRAC says that Westpac's failures mean that it has been prevented from doing its job and detecting suspicious and criminal activity. The most distressing aspect of the AUSTRAC case is that more than 3000 transfers on Westpac's payment systems may have been used to fund child pornography. In 2013 Westpac was made aware by both the regulator and its own risk assessments about links between alleged child exploitation and frequent low value transfers to the Philippines and south-east Asia. Then in June 2016, senior management was specifically briefed by AUSTRAC on how such payment patterns were consistent with \"child exploitation typologies\". But it was only in June 2018 that an effective detection control scenario - which is still deemed incomplete by the regulator - was established to identify suspicious patterns of low value regular payments over the LitePay system.</p><p>This new banking scandal - which comes soon after CBA's record $700 million fine for its anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism breaches - will add to the regulatory pressures that are distracting Australia's reputation-battered banks from focusing on core commercial functions. Without making excuses, the distractions including falling margins in a low interest rate world, mixed messages from the government about driving investment and from ASIC about responsible lending, and the myriad social issues from climate change to diversity that bankers are meant to solve. Maybe the judgment will be that some countries are too risky to stay in the international transfer business. Modern banks are supposed to be customer-focused and establish flexible systems that make transactions as seamless as possible including across national borders. But it has long been the reality that international transfers can raise red flags for criminal activity, and banks have an integral role to play alongside regulators and the police in law enforcement.</p><p>AUSTRAC blames \"indifference\" by Westpac's senior management and inadequate oversight by the board for the bank's financial crime controls being five years out of date and unsatisfactory. CEO Brian Hartzer rejects the claim the bank didn't care. He also says he first heard about child exploitation on Wednesday morning, and that he won't resign. Westpac partially self-reported its breaches, has admitted guilt, and will seek to settle rather than fight the AUSTRAC case. But why, despite the warnings in 2013 and 2016, did nothing happen until 2018 to flag payments suspected of paying for child porn? The timeline appears to damn Westpac's leadership.</p><p>No system is ever foolproof, especially when complex big-tech platforms digitise more and more of the economy. But failing to tackle systemic failings is another matter. If the chain of command works, flawed systems can be fixed before a crisis occurs, if they get the right attention from senior management and boards. Relevant therefore remains Graeme Samuel's excoriating review of CBA's culture of widespread complacency, overconfidence, excessive complexity and insularity.</p><p>The true test of the culture of an institution is not only whether red flags are waved but are acted upon. This is the message that should once again reverberate round the nation's C-suites and boardrooms as Westpac awaits the size of the fine that it will pay for its inaction on dirty money.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-1520208929</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XJJ-GHK1-DY19-C2CX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"788\"/><timeReceived>00:00 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

These payment systems allow foreign workers to easily remit wages home and let aged pensioners retire securely anywhere in the world. But these systems also expose the underbelly of globalisation when targeted by international criminals. This is why Westpac will pay a huge financial penalty for its systemic breaches of the laws that help stop the wash of dirty money around the globe.</p><p>Westpac has admitted to breaching reporting and record-keeping requirements in relation to 23 million transactions between 2013 and 2018. This includes failing to report 19.5 million international transfers worth $11 billion due to a programming glitch in the automated reporting systems. It also failed to do due diligence on 16 overseas banks it has international transfer arrangements with. By choosing the faster and cheaper LitePay remittance system - to work around the SWIFT global payment system, judged to be too slow and expensive to handle low-value, large-volume transfers - Westpac is accused of allowing banks in high-risk jurisdictions to access Australia's banking system and of facilitating money laundering. Regulator AUSTRAC's statement of claim says Westpac cannot trace where funds originated from in significant numbers of transfers. The most distressing aspect of the AUSTRAC case is that more than 3000 transfers may have been used to fund child pornography.</p><p>In 2013, Westpac was made aware of links between alleged child exploitation and frequent low-value transfers to the Philippines and south-east Asia. And then, in June 2016, senior management was briefed by AUSTRAC on how such payment patterns were consistent with \"child exploitation typologies\". But only in June 2018 was an effective detection control scenario - still deemed incomplete by the regulator - established to identify suspicious low-value regular payments.</p><p>This new banking scandal - which comes soon after CBA's record $700 million fine for its anti-money-laundering and counter-terrorism breaches - will add to the regulatory pressures distracting reputation-battered banks from their core commercial functions. Without making excuses, the distractions include falling margins in a low-interest-rate world, mixed messages from the government about driving investment and from ASIC about responsible lending, and the myriad social issues that bankers are meant to solve. Maybe some countries are just too risky to stay in the international transfer business. Modern banks aspire to be flexible and make all transactions as seamless as possible for customers. But international transfers have long raised red flags for criminal activity, and banks have an integral role to play alongside regulators and the police in law enforcement.</p><p>AUSTRAC blames \"indifference\" among Westpac's senior management and inadequate oversight by the board for the bank's financial crime controls being five years out of date and unsatisfactory. CEO Brian Hartzer rejects the claim the bank didn't care. He also says he first heard about child exploitation on Wednesday morning, and that he won't resign. Westpac partially self-reported, and will seek to settle, rather than fight, the AUSTRAC case. But why, despite the 2013 and 2016 warnings, did nothing happen until 2018 to flag payments suspected of being connected to child porn? The timeline appears to damn Westpac's leadership.</p><p>No system is foolproof, especially when complex big tech platforms are digitising the economy. But failing to tackle systemic failings is another matter. Graeme Samuel's excoriating review of CBA's complacent, insular, and overly cocky culture therefore remains relevant.</p><p>The true test of the culture of an institution is not only whether red flags are waved but whether they are acted upon. This message should reverberate round C-suites and boardrooms as Westpac awaits its penalty for inaction on dirty money.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc782j4eamaxix7al48kv</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XJJ-G5H1-F0J6-J1V9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"663\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

We are part of a large ecosystem consisting of many players including policy makers, regulators, educators, big tech companies and start-ups - and that's before we even talk about our staff and our customers,\" he said.</p><p>\"The problem is that the players in this ecosystem are often out of step with each other. We are like a bunch of diverse people at a dance, but each dancer has a different tune in their head and moves to their own rhythm.</p><p>\"We spend a lot of time looking at our feet, rather than at the dynamics of the dance floor. As a result, heads bump and toes get stepped on.\"</p><p>Open banking</p><p>One of the most pressing issues for the big banks in the immediate future is the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/business/banking-and-finance/financial-services/banks-and-fintechs-welcome-governments-open-banking-plan-20180509-h0zvf7\">introduction of so-called open banking</url>, which is the first stage of opening up access to citizens of the data held on them by organisations across sectors.</p><p>By July 1 next year banks will be required to make data available on all credit and debit cards, deposit and transaction accounts, which will also include application programming interfaces for fintech start-ups to create new products.</p><p>Mr Curran said Westpac was supportive of open banking and wanted to make it work, but warned there was still a significant amount of work that needed to be done, which was hampered by regulatory uncertainty and a lack of understanding among the broader population of the privacy impacts.</p><p>He said technical, regulatory and service standards were not yet clear and balanced and said if regulators didn't co-ordinate fully or consult with affected parties it would lead to significant duplication, poor integration and greater complexity across organisations.</p><p>Data privacy</p><p>\"I have over 600 people working in my cyber security team, because protecting the data is a massive part of what we need to do, but in open banking we will be making some of that data available to a small company that actually just wants data because data is their business ... even though that is not what they tell customers,\" Mr Curran said.</p><p>\"If we don't get privacy and cyber things right as we go into open banking, it's very hard to fix it once it's broken. We're rushing pretty fast, [but] we need a clearer conversation with the community about what this means.\"</p><p>He said Millennials in particular were often relaxed about the idea of sharing their data until they personally experienced the reality of being hacked and having their digital identity stolen.</p><p>He said Westpac saw a few hundred cases of identity theft each month, and it took a significant toll on the victims. Maintaining security standards in the open era remains a big challenge.</p><p>\"Being hacked and losing 50 bucks is one thing, but when you lose your digital identity that's completely different,\" Mr Curran said.</p><p>\"If someone says you've got to change your email address tomorrow, the effort to do that is massive, but if you've actually lost your entire digital identity it is one of those things that until you experience it, it's not [considered] a big problem.</p><p>\"The obligation of people like me and the roles of the banks and other areas, that still hold a significant degree of trust in the community, is to actually protect that.\"</p><p>Mr Curran has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/technology/westpac-tech-chief-warns-of-automation-career-carnage-without-structural-change-20170810-gxtfwd\">previously spoken out about the shortage of Australians with relevant technology skills</url>, with the onus on both business and the education system to change to match the changing workforce requirements.</p><p>He cited recent Deloitte estimates that demand for tech workers would grow by almost 100,000 by 2023, as a big opportunity for the local workforce, which was currently being missed.</p><p>\"There are fewer than 5000 domestic graduates from tech degrees each year, so the only way we'll reach workforce targets is by either importing labour or sending work offshore, much as we've done for the past five years. We now have a broken supply-and-demand equation,\" Mr Curran said.</p><p>\"Our best and brightest kids are still signing up to become doctors and accountants and lawyers, when we know that there will be a decreasing need for all these professions because of the digital revolution ... We need more of our young people - and especially young women - coming into the workforce with skills in artificial intelligence, data science, cyber and even blockchain.\"</p><p>Big tech problems</p><p>In his speech Mr Curran also took aim at the lack of consideration given by major global tech suppliers to Australian customer needs. Westpac spent over $1 billion with big tech firms like IBM, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft and Oracle, but said they didn't always receive the focus needed.</p><p>\"Big tech companies sometimes complain that we call them suppliers rather than partners, but we do this because it's true. We are treated as customers not true partners and long-time collaborators,\" he said.</p><p>\"I can turn up after a weekend and discover that 30 staff, who were working with my team on Friday aren't there on a Monday, because of a decision we didn't know about made in some offshore intergalactic HQ.</p><p>\"I'd like to see Big Tech genuinely transform and become less of a performer and more of the partner they claim they want to be; responding to our aspirations, becoming more flexible, and aligning more closely to our strategic goals.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-1029922544</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TJ3-VK81-JBJ7-N1HC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1081\"/><timeReceived>05:59 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

The United States Federal Trade Commission and the New York State Attorney General \u2014 who together brought the case against Google \u2014 now require YouTube to obtain consent from parents before collecting or sharing personal information.

We have no way of knowing how this depth of data collection may be used in years to come.In March 2019,U.S. senators Ed Markey and Josh Hawley introduced a bipartisan bill to update COPPA , banning targeting ads to children, extending privacy protections to 13- to 15-year-olds so data cannot be collected without user permission and an 'Eraser Button' that would allowparents and kids to delete personal information.<br/><br/>Read more:<br/>ClassDojo raises concerns about children's rights<br/><br/>This proposed update to COPPA is crucial legislation which Canadians should be studying - in addition tothe European Union's General Data Protection Regulation- as again, there are multiple documented instances of Alphabet's subsidiaries failing to protect children's privacy. This legislation, if passed, would have enormous impact on the revenue of the digital ad market for Google and Facebook, as digital ad revenue in the U.S. totalled $107 billion in 2018 [https://marketingland.com/iab-u-s-digital-ad-revenues-top-100-billion-for-first-time-reaching-107-5-billion-in-2018-260546.] We should anticipate sustained resistance from Alphabet's subsidiary companies and the other major platforms.A focus on how we can ensure the consistent protection of the data privacy of children and youth must be central to our discussions of technology globally and to Justin Trudeau's proposedDigital Charternationally in Canada.

Disclosure information is available on the original site.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">___</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Author: Siobhan O'Flynn, Lecturer, University of Toronto</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Google recently agreed to pay a US$170 million fine for illegally gathering children's personal data on YouTube without parental consent, which is a violation under the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The United States Federal Trade Commission and the New York State Attorney General - who together brought the case against Google - now require YouTube to obtain consent from parents before collecting or sharing personal information. In addition, creators of child-directed content must self-identify to restrict the delivery of targeted ads.</p><p>The $170 million fine is a pittance given Alphabet Inc.'s (Google's holding company) valuation of more than US$700 billion.</p><p>Our digital identities comprise data collected across our activities, making personal or identifying information irrelevant. Children today are subjugated to a scale of data collection and targeting that we cannot fathom. Right now, we also have no clue about the consequences, and regulatory protections to data-proof their futures are far from certain.</p><p>My ongoing research on how big tech and media conglomerates are using dark pattern design to bypass privacy regulations protecting personal information has revealed how vulnerable children are to data collection and how Canada's legislation in particular is failing them.</p><p>Incomprehensible scale</p><p>For adults and children, Google has access to everything from search queries to online purchases to any app and website associated with gmail accounts - including deleted accounts - or linked via cross-browser finger-printing.</p><p>As a parent, you create a network of cross-connections when you input information to make purchases for your child online or set up accounts for your child on apps and websites. Added to this is all your child's activity on YouTube and YouTube Kids, search data to clicks on recommended videos to rewinds and duration of play time.</p><p>Then add cross-browser fingerprinting and most recently, Google's \"GDPR workaround,\" secret buried web tracking pages that act as pseudonymous markers that track user activity across the web.</p><p>This latter violation of data privacy was revealed in a complaint to the Irish Data Protection Commission filed the same day Google's fine was made public.</p><p>We are talking about vast fields of data, the scale of which is difficult to comprehend; this data is used to feed Google's artificial intelligence recommendation algorithms that now steer everything from employment application processes to dating apps.</p><p>Children in the United States and Canada have another significant, persistent arena where information is being produced by them and collected by Google. Google entered the educational sphere in 2012, and now dominates educational technology market in the U.S., giving Google unprecedented parent-sanctioned access to children's data through kindergarten to Grade 12.</p><p>Dominance in the educational sphere</p><p>Alphabet Inc. dominates child-directed and child-featured content online through YouTube Kids and has now colonized online educational spaces through Google Docs, G-Suite, Chromebooks and the associated Gmail accounts for children that are required for use.</p><p>This means that Google's access to children's data spans entertainment (YouTube and YouTube Kids), search and purchase histories (via associated parental accounts), and educational sectors.</p><p>The uptake numbers in the educational technology sphere are staggering. Between 2012 and 2016, Google Chromebooks went from less than one per cent of the U.S. school market to over 50 per cent - more than 30 million Chromebooks are currently being used in American classrooms.</p><p>By 2017, more than 58 per cent of devices purchased for U.S. schools were Google devices; more than 80 million instructors and children use them globally.</p><p>Given Google's history of privacy violations, it's no surprise that Google's rollout of Chromebooks again violated children's data privacy. Initially, Google resisted complying with the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), providing links to its security policies, which FERPA rejected.</p><p>In 2015, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) filed an FTC complaint</p><p>because Chromebook default settings initially allowed Google to collect user data including \"Web browsing histories, search-engine results, YouTube viewing habits and saved passwords.\"</p><p>Harry Brignull, a user experience specialist, coined the term \"dark pattern\" to describe a \"user interface that has been carefully crafted to trick users into doing things, such as buying insurance with their purchase or signing up for recurring bills.\"</p><p>Gmail accounts for children remain a standard practice in schools today. Standard practice continues to be that children are enrolled by schools en masse into Gmail accounts, often without parental consent, using their full names, and \"into other services that collect data without any notification.\" This data collection is presented as benign, optimizing your child's experience, enriching education, democratizing access to 21st century online resources.</p><p>Updating the laws</p><p>What Google has done is create a dynamic, adaptive system of data collection that has already colonized our children's futures, given what we now know of how ad targeting can manipulate behaviour. We have no way of knowing how this depth of data collection may be used in years to come.</p><p>In March 2019, U.S. senators Ed Markey and Josh Hawley introduced a bipartisan bill to update COPPA, banning targeting ads to children, extending privacy protections to 13- to 15-year-olds so data cannot be collected without user permission and an \"eraser button\" that would allow parents and kids to delete personal information.</p><p>This proposed update to COPPA is crucial legislation that Canadians should be studying - in addition to the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation - as again, there are multiple documented instances of Alphabet's subsidiaries failing to protect children's privacy.</p><p>This legislation, if passed, would have enormous impact on the revenue of the digital ad market for Google and Facebook, as digital ad revenue in the U.S. totalled $107 billion in 2018 We should anticipate sustained resistance from Alphabet's subsidiary companies and the other major platforms.</p><p>A focus on how we can ensure the consistent protection of the data privacy of children and youth must be central to our discussions of technology globally and to Justin Trudeau's proposed Digital Charter nationally in Canada.</p><p>___</p><p>This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Google entered the educational sphere in 2012, and now dominates educational technology market in the U.S., giving Google unprecedented parent-sanctioned access to children\u2019s data from kindergarten through to Grade 12.</p><p>The uptake numbers in the educational technology sphere are staggering. Between 2012 and 2016, Google Chromebooks went from less than one per cent of the U.S. school market to more than 50 per cent \u2014 more than 30 million Chromebooks are currently being used in American classrooms.</p><p>By 2017, more than 58 per cent of devices purchased for U.S. schools were Google devices; more than 80 million instructors and children use them globally.</p><p>Given Google\u2019s history of privacy violations, it\u2019s no surprise that Google\u2019s rollout of Chromebooks again violated children\u2019s data privacy. Initially, Google resisted complying with the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), providing links to its security policies, which FERPA rejected.</p><p>In 2015, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) filed an FTC complaint because Chromebook default settings initially allowed Google to collect user data including \u201cweb browsing histories, search-engine results, YouTube viewing habits and saved passwords.\u201d</p><p>Harry Brignull, a user experience specialist, coined the term \u201cdark pattern\u201d to describe a \u201cuser interface that has been carefully crafted to trick users into doing things, such as buying insurance with their purchase or signing up for recurring bills.\u201d</p><p>Gmail accounts for children remain a standard practice in schools today. Standard practice continues to be that children are enrolled by schools en masse into Gmail accounts, often without parental consent, using their full names, and \u201cinto other services that collect data without any notification.\u201d This data collection is presented as benign, optimizing your child\u2019s experience, enriching education, democratizing access to 21st-century online resources.</p><p>What Google has done is create a dynamic, adaptive system of data collection that has already colonized our children\u2019s futures, given what we now know of how ad targeting can manipulate behaviour. We have no way of knowing how this depth of data collection may be used in years to come.</p><p>In March, U.S. senators Ed Markey and Josh Hawley introduced a bipartisan bill to update COPPA, banning targeting ads to children, extending privacy protections to 13- to 15-year-olds so data cannot be collected without user permission and an \u201ceraser button\u201d that would allow parents and kids to delete personal information.</p><p>This proposed update to COPPA is crucial legislation that Canadians should be studying \u2014 in addition to the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation \u2014 as again, there are multiple documented instances of Alphabet\u2019s subsidiaries failing to protect children\u2019s privacy.</p><p>This legislation, if passed, would have an enormous effect on the revenue of the digital ad market for Google and Facebook, as digital ad revenue in the U.S. totalled US$107 billion in 2018. We should anticipate sustained resistance from Alphabet\u2019s subsidiary companies and the other major platforms.</p><p>A focus on how we can ensure the consistent protection of the data privacy of children and youth must be central to our discussions of technology globally and to Justin Trudeau\u2019s proposed Digital Charter nationally in Canada.</p><p>Siobhan O\u2019Flynn is a lecturer at the University of Toronto.</p><p>This article has been edited for length; the full version can be seen at winnipegfreepress.com or theconversation.com/ca.</p><p>Credit: Siobhan O'Flynn</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WFRPRS-2303526142</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WFRPRS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X81-0481-DY0W-406B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">315706</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"985\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 F.P.

You can <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/privacy-project?action=click&amp;amp;module=inline&amp;amp;pgtype=Article\">sign up here</url>.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This week\u2019s Privacy Project newsletter is a pre-debate conversation with the former entrepreneur and current presidential candidate Andrew Yang. I wanted to speak to Yang since he\u2019s the only candidate to address data privacy as a campaign policy issue. He\u2019s a proponent of an idea that\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/privacy-project?action=click&amp;amp;module=inline&amp;amp;pgtype=Article\">somewhat controversial</url> among privacy professionals, which is that we should own our own data. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Our short conversation turned out to be pretty sprawling, touching on subjects like data dignity, whether Facebook should be able to run political ads, whether any of us have free will and what his proposed Department of the Attention Economy might look like. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This is a condensed and edited version of our conversation:</p><p>You\u2019re the only candidate who has decided to make privacy a campaign issue. How\u2019d you get there?</p><p>I\u2019m an avid user of the internet and I understand that users are completely at the mercy of tech companies in terms of what happens to our data. They pretend it\u2019s our choice. In reality, 99.9 percent of people scroll down and hit \u201cI agree.\u201d The trade we\u2019re making is for cost and convenience, but in return we\u2019re forfeiting our data. </p><p> That data is packaged and sold and resold and we are none the wiser. We occasionally get notifications of a data breach and think, \u201cOh, snap, should I change my password?\u201d That\u2019s an irritation but what\u2019s going on with our data is much bigger than that. </p><p>I was talking to a researcher recently and she described a concept called data dignity, which I thought really says it all. Right now we\u2019re being systematically deprived of our dignity and we think it is fine because we\u2019re getting these incredible services. Perhaps that worked in the early stages of the internet. But now we\u2019re waking up to the fact that the trade is much more serious and profound than we originally realized.</p><p>Your idea is to think less in terms of privacy and more in terms of property \u2014 that all this data we shed earns money for big tech companies, so we should receive a share of the economic value generated from that data. You never explicitly say we should get paid for it. Do you think we should be getting that money back in the form of a data dividend?</p><p>Yes, I think we should be getting paid in a data dividend. Every time we post a photo or interact with a social media company we\u2019re putting information out there and that information should still be ours. If somebody is profiting from our data and we decide willingly to partner with a company that\u2019s making use of this information, then that\u2019s only fair as long as we get a slice. Right now we\u2019re unaware of the value that\u2019s changing hands and we\u2019re definitely not getting a data check in the mail every season.</p><p>There are plenty of critiques when it comes to owning our own data. The first is that our data is shared (a conversation on social media, for example, has two participants) so it\u2019s hard to parse out who owns what. Also, the notion of how scores of companies pay out data dividends to millions of Americans is a logistical nightmare. Is it worth the hassle?</p><p>It\u2019s actually a fairly trivial administrative barrier in the sense that almost half of Americans are right now receiving direct transfers from the government in some form, via checks or deposits. I guarantee you that if it was reversed and it was tech companies that needed to extract tolls from millions of consumers there\u2019d be zero issue with the administrative barrier. The company would be like, \u201cI need your credit card.\u201d </p><p>One of the more substantial critiques of data ownership is that if you treat data as purely a property right, it means that you can sell that right. If we treat privacy as a property right what that means is that we essentially have that right to trade it. And the problem is that it could worsen financial inequities. People with less income might be more willing to trade their important personal data for a small payment, while those who are better off can say, \u201cI don\u2019t need the dividend. I\u2019ll keep my data.\u201d How do you balance that?</p><p>There\u2019d be less of a sense of desperation in a society where there\u2019s a freedom dividend and everyone\u2019s getting $1,000 per month. But it is the case that certain people\u2019s data is worth more than others\u2019 data. And if you look right now there are many people with different preferences. There are people out there choosing to share the intimate details of their lives with millions of people; some make a living off it. So, if individuals want to share their data or information or even their private lives with other people, then that\u2019s their prerogative. </p><p>Some of the plans you outline for data are quite broad and amount to \u201cData needs to be owned by the people.\u201d Some companies already subscribe to this but, in practice, we\u2019re still at their mercy. Does the extent of your plan amount to more than just saying, \u201cYou can have your data deleted?\u201d</p><p>What\u2019s going to happen in real life is you\u2019re going to use these companies. Things will happen behind the scenes while you\u2019re busy living your life. And then, if you want to, you can go and delete your data. That\u2019s a reasonable estimation of how it would work for many people. What I\u2019m suggesting is that we can do better. But it\u2019s not like individual consumers can band together to make this happen. Government needs to be a counterweight to the massive power and information inequities between us and the technology companies.</p><p>What I think most people would want is a place they could go to see what\u2019s happening to their data, the option to delete their data and a record or log of all the times it trades hands. Then the companies do their thing and people would live with greater confidence that, if there are abuses, they\u2019ll be made aware of that and can always pull the plug.</p><p>We\u2019ve become like rats in a maze where we\u2019re constantly hit by messages from these companies know everything about us. They know more about us than our families do. We\u2019re responding to stimuli and we think we\u2019re making choices. But it\u2019s because we\u2019ve shared so much over time that they have a keen sense of what we want. There\u2019s something fundamental at stake here, which is: What does human agency look like? What are our rights as citizens? </p><p>Do you think Facebook should be allowed to run political ads?</p><p>Ideally, there\u2019d be greater transparency with political content where you\u2019d have a better sense of who is actually advertising to you. But our campaign finance system allows \u201csuper PACs\u201d and funding sources that are shady. It\u2019s one reason we\u2019re struggling. There are a lot of interconnected problems.</p><p>Does it bother you that, if you win the nomination, President Trump could lie in advertisements on Facebook and the company would allow it? Does that feel like an unfair advantage \u2014 that Facebook isn\u2019t properly monitoring that?</p><p>We all saw what happened in 2016. It\u2019s clear that a foreign power influenced the election in large part because of Facebook. And it\u2019s an open question whether things have changed between this last election and this one. I\u2019m sure Facebook has been trying to stamp out certain forms of interference and misinformation. But I\u2019m equally certain there are many forms that will persist.</p><p>[If you\u2019re online \u2014 and, well, you are \u2014 chances are someone is using your information. We\u2019ll tell you what you can do about it. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/privacy-project?action=click&amp;amp;module=inline&amp;amp;pgtype=Article\">Sign up for our limited-run newsletter</url>.]</p><p>You<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/privacy-project?action=click&amp;amp;module=inline&amp;amp;pgtype=Article\">tweeted a few months ago</url> after Facebook was issued a fine by the Federal Trade Commission about creating a new government agency called the Department of the Attention Economy. What might that look like and how is it different than, say, giving the F.T.C. more teeth to go after Facebook?</p><p>[Laughing] Sorry. I was laughing about the F.T.C. Anyway.</p><p>We\u2019re seeing record levels of anxiety and depression among teenagers, particularly teenage girls, that\u2019s hand in hand with a surge in smartphone adoption and social media apps. So what do you do about that?</p><p> I\u2019m friends with Tristan Harris, who talks about how we have some of the smartest engineers in this country turning supercomputers into dopamine delivery devices. Tristan started the nonprofit called Time Well Spent, which consults with various companies about ways to make apps healthier. But if you\u2019re one of these companies, you have financial incentives tied to maximal engagement and scaling back on that will hurt your bottom line. </p><p>The question is how do you take the learning of a design ethicist, like Tristan Harris, and get it into the guts of social media apps? The answer is that it won\u2019t happen on its own because the financial incentives are overpowering. So you need a sophisticated Department of the Attention Economy that says, \u201cHere are the 20 design choices you\u2019re making and you need to make 10 of them differently.\u201d</p><p>The reason I laughed before is that if you think you can have, say, five more regulators at the F.T.C. ... they\u2019re not going to know what to do. You need a domain expert, like Tristan, to discern what the issues are and what the appropriate responses would be. We\u2019re decades behind on this challenge. We all know Washington doesn\u2019t understand technology very well. This Department of the Attention Economy would safeguard the health of our kids, but also provide that counterweight so we feel like we\u2019re in good hands with the technology companies. </p><p>There\u2019s this guy named Albert Wenger who talks about the idea that time will be the new money. If time is the new money, then you need somebody paying attention to how we\u2019re spending our time. On a more human level, what\u2019s more valuable than our time? Nothing. Again, a number of financial incentives push us to spend time in certain ways. That\u2019s fine if it\u2019s our choice. But, in many cases, we might not have the full independence and agency.</p><p>Would you base the agency outside of Washington?</p><p>Yeah, it\u2019d have to be in Silicon Valley. I doubt I can get my design ethicists to move to D.C.</p><p>Like other media companies, The Times collects data on its visitors when they read stories like this one.

And as Wednesday afternoon\u2019s news of Facebook banning hundreds of pages and groups advocating the deranged QAnon conspiracy theory should suggest, respondents to the survey released Wednesday morning by the Pew Research Center weren\u2019t wrong overall.      But the study\u2019s second major finding\u2014that Republicans are far more likely to allege this interference\u2014shows that this view isn\u2019t just a dispassionate observation. It\u2019s the product of politicians selling a story of repression by the social platforms they\u2019ve often used well for voter outreach.    \u201cMajorities in both major parties believe censorship is likely occurring, but this belief is especially common \u2013 and growing \u2013 among Republicans,\u201d the report from Pew, a Washington-based non-profit, observes.       Specifically, while 59% of U.S. adults who identify as Democrats or lean towards that party think social platforms intentionally suppress political speech, a full 90% of Republicans and those who lean Republican hold that view.     And GOP perspectives were more entrenched, with 60% of respondents rating this alleged censorship \u201cvery likely\u201d and 31% seeing it \u201csomewhat likely.\u201d Among Dems and leaners, 40% put themselves in the \u201csomewhat likely\u201d bucket\u201d and 19% chose \u201cvery likely.\u201d    Where could Republican voters have gotten such a view? Rewind to the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s July 29 grilling of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google CEO Sundar Pichai\u2014and remember how GOP lawmakers lambasted those executives for anti-conservative bias .     \u201cBig Tech is out to get conservatives,\u201d declared Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), echoing complaints by President Trump that fueled last month\u2019s announcement of a scheme for federal regulation of social platforms .     But the actual cases of alleged interference cited by Jordan (who has over 1.5 million followers on Twitter and 348,000-plus on Facebook) and others at the hearing proved no such plot.      Many involved platforms enforcing published rules banning novel-coronavirus misinformation. Others involved right-wing publications with histories of inaccuracy, such as Gateway Pundit and Breitbart News.     (Democratic members mostly focused on antitrust issues, sometimes in comparably unfounded ways .)    But the tech CEOs could never bring themselves to state directly that they don\u2019t want to open their platforms to conspiracists and cranks.     Facebook\u2019s Zuckerberg leaned into the phrase he\u2019s been repeating since at least 2016 : \u201cWe want to be a platform for all ideas.\u201d     That\u2019s nonsense. If Facebook really welcomed \u201call ideas,\u201d it would not have a lengthy community-standards document defining and banning various forms of hate speech . It would accept Nazis and ISIS and let a thousand other toxic ideological flowers bloom.     In the real world, Facebook does no such thing. As is its right\u2014notwithstanding inaccurate media coverage and attacks from Democrats and Republicans suggesting Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which holds social sites mostly immune from their users\u2019 posts, requires its political neutrality.    \u201cCDA 230\u201d\u2014which Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has said should be revoked outright \u2014does not, leaving social sites free to zap legal speech they find revolting.     I certainly hope Facebook management is repulsed by the QAnon lie about a global conspiracy of pedophilia and cannibalism\u2014one the FBI judged a domestic-terrorism risk last year and that has inspired real-world violence .     ut Facebook advertisers\u2019 views matter too. And they generally don\u2019t see hate speech as a brand-safe environment.     Over 1,000 of them boycotted Facebook in July to protest its inaction on that front, after which boycott organizers gave the network a failing grade .    It\u2019s unclear if that effort pushed Facebook to act against QAnon or announce last week\u2019s move to demote news sites owned or run by political actors .     It should be clear that even as social networks struggle to deal with cults that their own algorithms helped amplify , we\u2019ll see more attempts by politicians to work their social-media refs.     Especially as more of these candidates enter conspiracy-theory territory.     Florida\u2019s primary Tuesday saw the Islamophobic Laura Loomer, whose bigoted rants led not just major social networks but even Uber and Lyft to ban her , win the GOP nod in in a Democratic district. Two other House Republican candidates, Colorado\u2019s Lauren Boebert and Georgia\u2019s Marjorie Taylor Greene, not only endorse the absurd QAnon thesis but will probably win their general elections .     And Thursday evening, President Trump responded to a question about QAnon by essentially playing footsie with that cult .     \u201cI don\u2019t know much about the movement, other than I understand they like me very much, which I appreciate,\u201d he said during a White House briefing. \u201cI\u2019ve heard these are people that love our country.\u201d    When we inevitably see QAnon crackdowns denounced as liberal tech elites trampling free speech, don\u2019t expect disingenuous defenses like Zuckerberg\u2019s \u201cwe want to be a platform for all ideas\u201d to persuade anybody.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42883619632</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60MX-BS01-JCSC-J0TW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"922\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Forbes.com</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 20, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United States</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Americas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Northern America</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Protected Rights</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Communications Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEQxMkU0NzE2OEE2NDIxNEE3QzU0NjU2MDRERUNGNDE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Communications Decency Act</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0ZFRThGRDIyOERDNDRBNzlCRUMzNkNBMDIzRDU5NTc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkEyQUE3Q0ZGNTBBNDZBQkI4Qjg5MjlFREFGQjZENDM</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

He is sitting, wide-eyed, intense, in his office in a co-working space in downtown San Francisco. \"Unless you've felt it, unless you've cried over the fact that we really thought we were making the world a better place with the internet \u2026\" He pauses. \"We 100pc believed that.\" Humanity, he says, is living through \"two super old stories\". One: \"Be careful what you wish for, because you'll get it.\" And two: \"Creators losing control of their creations.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mr Raskin should know, because he is one of those Dr Frankensteins. As the son of Silicon Valley royalty (or at least nobility), he spent years merrily building products that he believed were changing the world. They did, but not in the way he imagined. Now he is at the centre of the tech backlash as one of the public faces of the Centre for Humane Technology, a non-profit group founded with former Google product manager Tristan Harris, which is steadily gathering influence in Silicon Valley.</p><p>Their cause has already notched up one partial victory. In 2013, Mr Harris spread around a presentation inside Google warning that its design practices were making people more anxious and more distracted. By 2016 he had left Google to campaign full time under the slogan \"time well spent\". Just two years later, Mark Zuckerberg adopted that mantra as the new goal of Facebook's news feed algorithms, and Google and Apple added new time management features to their smartphones. It was a start, but not quite the revolution that Mr Harris had hoped for.</p><p>So now he and Mr Raskin are preaching a new gospel, which they call \"human downgrading\". At a jazz hall in San Francisco last month, they gathered an audience of celebrities (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), activists (Wael Ghonim, a computer engineer who helped kick-start the Arab Spring in Egypt) and tech luminaries (including Rob Goldman, Facebook's vice president of advertising) and told them that the tech industry is culpable for the cultural equivalent of climate change. Addiction, distraction, disinformation, polarisation and radicalisation; all these \"hurricanes\", they argued, have one common cause.</p><p>The cause is that we now spend large portions of our lives inside social networks, which are run by private companies for profit. That might be fine if their profits were aligned with our interests, but instead they are part of an \"extractive attention economy\" which makes money by capturing our time. That has created a \"race to the bottom of the brainstem\", in which increasingly sophisticated AI tools are devoted to exploiting what Mr Raskin calls the \"soft underbelly of our animal minds\". They even propose that these AIs may be learning to make us more anxious and more confused, because these qualities make us better customers. And so, as Mr Harris put it, we are at a \"civilisational moment\", just years away from \"the end of human agency\".</p><p>That was not what Mr Raskin imagined when he first started fooling around with computers as a child. \"I've always been a recreational weirdo,\" he says. His father was Jef Raskin, a pioneer of computer interface design and father of the Apple MacIntosh who skirmished with Steve Jobs over whether the new machine should display bitmap images (Raskin senior was in favour; he wanted users to be able to compose music). Aza followed in his footsteps, co-founding four companies which were acquired by the likes of Google and Mozilla, usually focusing on how to make computers grant users' wishes.</p><p>\"Always there was a vision to make the world a better place,\" he says. \"The assumption [was that] if you want to change the world and make it better, the best way to do that is to make an app or a start-up.\" One company, Massive Health, used many of the same psychological tricks employed by Snapchat and Instagram, such as \"aspirational\" social groups and daily login to increase exercising of users by 11pc. Slowly, however, he felt a \"shadow\" creeping up behind him. The realisation started to hit that these techniques are very powerful. \"They're agnostic about what kind of goal they're pointed at,\" he says. By 2017, he had completely lost faith, and was plunged into \"Kierkegaardian despair - your past has been robbed of its meaning\".</p><p>One big regret is his invention of the infinite scroll (though others have also claimed credit). Once, long ago, internet users had to actually click \"next\" when they got to the bottom of a web page. Mr Raskin, inspired by the smooth scrolling of Google Maps, fixed all that, making the page just load new content automatically like the magic porridge pot of lore. This feature was swiftly \"weaponized\" to keep us endlessly refreshing our apps like gamblers desperately tugging the lever of a slot machine, and today Mr Raskin calculates, conservatively, that his invention wastes an 200,000 human lifetimes every day.</p><p>In this account, the techopalypse is a story of blind faith and perverse incentives - of cold intelligences, whether human or artificial, spinning out of control. Mr Raskin says that tech workers were wary of an \"Orwellian dystopia\", in which fear rules and information is restricted, but didn't notice they were creating a \"Huxley dystopia\" in which information is too abundant to be useful and pleasure keeps us tranquillised. Founders optimised their companies to make profits, companies optimised their AI to capture users' attention, and those AIs optimised for shock, jealousy and anxiety. All along, the humans told themselves they were giving people what they wanted, whereas really they were shaping their desires.</p><p>Just look, Mr Raskin says, at the crisis of self-esteem on social media (he and Harris blame social networks for a huge rise in teenage depression, though a recent study of 12,000 British teenagers concluded that the effect is \"tiny\"). \"If I want to keep you as a user coming back, it's a lot of work to grab your attention every time,\" he explains. \"But if I could modify your identity so you do it for me, that's way more efficient. If I could undermine your self-esteem so that you need the validation and you're addicted to attention, that would be neat. How about if I showed you every day that people liked you better if only you looked a little different?\" No wonder, he says, that 55pc of American plastic surgeons have encountered at least one patient seeking surgery so they can look better in selfies.</p><p>Or take YouTube's recommendation engine. You might expect a nefarious human trying to keep people on YouTube as long as possible to promote content that says no other media source can be trusted. Funnily enough, that is exactly what YouTube often promotes.</p><p>Perhaps this story gives Silicon Valley too much credit. After all, Sean Parker, Facebook's first president, tells it differently, saying that he and Mark Zuckerberg knew exactly what they were doing, and did it anyway. \"I completely agree!\" says Mr Raskin. \"There is so much culpability, do not get me wrong.\" But the industry contains many kinds of people, and what really matters is the incentives they work under. \"Even if you had a different Facebook and a different YouTube, they'd still be focused on the same kinds of forces.\" The human cultures that were willing to farm and slaughter animals outcompeted those that were more squeamish; so too the companies willing to \"treat human beings as resources to exploit\" will outcompete those that refuse.</p><p>How, then, can all of this actually be stopped? Mr Harris's jazz club speech was mocked by some viewers for being vague on this point. He asked his audience to meditate, to be aware of their breathing, and mentioned that he would be launching a podcast. Attendees received bookmarks with confusing commandments such as \"embrace our cognitive and social ergonomics\". Tom Coates, a veteran tech blogger and friend of Mr Raskin, tweeted: \"I thank you for your lovely dream. But that's all it is.\"</p><p>Speaking to The Telegraph, though, Mr Raskin is more specific. He welcomes US regulators' expected $3bn to $5bn (\u00a32.3bn to \u00a33.8bn) fine against Facebook for the Cambridge Analytica scandal, but says it is treating the symptom, not the cause. Instead, systemic problems require a systemic approach. One way would be to modify safe harbour rules, which protect social networks for liability for the content their users post. Instead of making them fully liable like a newspaper is, Mr Raskin suggests they should be liable for any content that they algorithmically \"promote\". \"That really starts to change the landscape.\"</p><p>Another proposal is to give tech firms a fiduciary duty towards their users, similar to the duty of care for which The Telegraph has been campaigning. The power of AI systems, he argues, has created an inescapable asymmetry between companies and users. So, just as doctors and stockbrokers are bound to act in the best interests of their clients, on pain of being sued, so tech firms should be held to a higher standard of trust and good faith.</p><p>Most of all, Mr Raskin believes there must be cultural, even spiritual change in Silicon Valley. He has mixed feelings about the success of \"time well spent\", seeing time management tools as an outsourcing of responsibility. \"We've made this thing hyper-addictive and it's your fault if you use it,\" he jokes; it's like cigarette companies putting a calendar on each packet that lets you check off all the days you didn't smoke. Nevertheless, he believes it showed that tech firms can be pressured into changing their behaviour. He quotes Margaret Read's aphorism: \"Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world.\" In his view, tech workers are that small group, and by changing their minds he can \"ship a product to a billion phones without writing a single line of code\".</p><p>This focus on Valley elites has attracted strident criticism. Mr Raskin is a technologist through and through; he speaks their language and shares their world-view. Mr Harris, too, often uses engineering jargon to describe the path forward. To industry critics who have warned about these dangers for years, that is a red flag: the last thing we need, the say, is a plan to dismantle Big Tech using the tools of Big Tech.

Roosevelt said of the Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza, \"but he's our son of a bitch.\" Just as Big Tech was beginning to reconcile itself to a swingeing regulatory crackdown, or even break-up, an even bigger supposed bogey has arrived on the scene to deflect attention from its alleged sins - China.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In answering their critics, the tech giants have long characterised themselves as an outstanding American success story. The growing stand-off between the incumbent global hegemon of the US and the aspiring one of China has allowed a new way of playing the patriotic card.</p><p>Eight of the world's top 20 tech companies are now Chinese, suggesting a contest for global dominance in which the US ought to be protecting, or even subsidising, its own, rather than breaking them up. This line of argument has been widely deployed by Big Tech in recent months, but as it happens, it was not much in evidence during a marathon session of Congressional testimony this week by the bosses of four of the US's biggest tech companies - Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook. And with good reason. Like most multinationals, the tech giants are as happy doing business with China as the US, prompting allegations of \"hypocrisy\" and \"treachery\" by one Congressman. But it is also because the argument is a red herring.</p><p>This is not to suggest that these companies should be ritually dismembered in the American antitrust tradition, as some US lawmakers demand. There are many good arguments for leaving the tech giants be - not least, the years of debilitating litigation that enforced break-up invariably involves - but China is the least compelling of them.</p><p>These are intensely competitive and innovative markets: Amazon, Apple and the rest would not be as successful as they are if they didn't serve consumers well.</p><p>Despite the way they are demonised in the press, all of them have customer-satisfaction levels that leave most older companies, never mind government-provided public services, in the shade. They have been the big winners of the government-imposed lockdowns of the past six months. Like it or not, the economy would have struggled to cope without them. But it is not just that we need them - more so now than ever - it's also that the antitrust case against them is, in truth, pretty flimsy, based as it is as much on what they could potentially do as what they actually do. For all those start-ups that claim to have been taken down by an abusive Big Tech, there are hundreds of others for which these platforms have been a godsend.</p><p>Big Tech neutralises the competition by buying it up, grandstanding Congressmen protested, citing Instagram, WhatsApp and YouTube as examples. Give us a break. These companies were in their infancy when bought. Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg was ridiculed for the apparently extravagant price he paid for Instagram. Regulators waved the deal through without a care. Is Mr Zuckerberg to be penalised for recognising the potential, and making such a success out of it? Much business would cease if we were to apply that logic widely.</p><p>It is an unfortunate characteristic of new industries that they tend quickly to become dominated by a small number of big players. This is particularly the case with tech, where powerful network effects are at work; the more people that use them, the more they attract others in search of compatibility. Monopoly is naturally occurring.</p><p>Yet to make the case for break-up, you have to demonstrate a positive benefit to consumers, competition, and innovation. This can only ever be supposition. It is not obvious, for instance, why separating Amazon's servers business from its retail operation, or Facebook from Instagram, would help these objectives.</p><p>But please, no more pleading the \"national champions\" cause. An idea I naively imagined had been put to bed by the debilitating experience of state-directed industrial strategy in the immediate post-war period is regrettably making something of a comeback - not just as a defence of Big Tech in an age of superpower conflict, but as a desirable economic goal in itself.</p><p>Even in Britain, we see such thinking in trade talks with the European Union. That the UK should jeopardise a decent trade deal with the EU for the sake of remaining free to dole out state aid to favoured \"champions\" is beyond ridiculous. Governments do not have a good record in backing winners.</p><p>Sometimes regulators need to step in to ensure markets remain open and honest. To maintain the public's trust, the tech giants must learn to selfregulate and pay their taxes, or they will indeed end up going the same way as the railroad barons, AT&amp;T, IBM and other targets of America's penchant for taking down the economically overmighty. With great power comes responsibility; most of the evidence is that Mr Bezos, Mr Zuckerberg et al have taken these lessons on board.</p><p>FOLLOW Jeremy Warner on Twitter @JeremyWarneruk; READ MORE at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion\">www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TELEGR-161990591</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TELEGR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GF-PRP1-JCBW-N46P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8109</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"828\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Telegraph (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30219\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 31, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

He was durable enough to manoeuvre his way into the firm's New York media practice, where his job was to manage the Reader's Digest account, the publishing empire whose business model revolved round providing a wholesome grab-bag of articles, anecdotes and compressed works of literature for time-poor readers. A ???best on the web' before there was a web.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Thornley arrived in New York with a simple idea: in a world that had moved from information scarcity to information abundance, the ability to order that information was the most powerful tool you could offer anyone.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He was playing with these concepts the night he discovered Netscape, one of the first browsers that allowed users to navigate the web without needing to enter computer code.</p><p>\"I had been doing online stuff working on systems like Unix and Delphi and it was hard as buggery,\" he remembers, \"then a workmate at McKinsey fires up the browser and five seconds later he's looking for apartments to rent in London. And I thought to myself, 'Oh my God - this going to change the world!'\"</p><p>Over the following decade, Thornley went on to change the world by pioneering search-engine technology through the company he <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/politics/how-two-australians-played-the-internet-game-and-won-19990220-k8ki0\">co-founded with his wife Tracy Ellery</url> in 1995, LookSmart.</p><p>But ever since he cashed in his shares and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/politics/the-left-wing-plutocrat-20041223-j71yr\">returned home</url> from the US to Australia, Thornley has spent his days pondering how the world can get itself out of the digitalised knot it has spun itself into - a knot that Thornley inadvertently helped to create.</p><p>Thornley's villain is not network technology: it is the individualism that has both shaped and been shaped by it, and led more and more people to feel alone and unhappy in a consumer-oriented world where every impulse is calculated to make us less connected to those closest to us, rather than more so.</p><p>Back in the early '90s, the gap that Thornley identified was in sifting and categorising all the pages that were flooding the web. There were already a few fledging search engines on the market like Yahoo! but they were basic sorters of files.</p><p>His idea was more ambitious, to create what he called a ???hierarchical ontology' of categories, a bit like the way libraries used to sort books. There would be a broad category like music, then a more specific category like country music, then something even more specific like Mary Chapin Carpenter. The trick was to get to that point fast.</p><p>Thornley's plan was to hire a team of human editors whose job each day would be to seek out, rate and categorise websites into curated lists. As more and more sites were built every day, a service to sort out the quality from the rest was timely. But it was just the tip of the business model.</p><p>While other search engines like AltaVista, Infoseek and Excite were setting themselves up as entry points to assist a user to navigate the web, Thornley recognised there could be something different. If someone was searching for something, then it was obvious they were more likely to be a buyer than someone who wasn't searching for anything. Search to him was more than a navigation system; it was the ???big front door' to deliver really high-quality leads for anyone wanting to do business on the fledgling web.</p><p>He took his idea to Reader's Digest. While the magazine still defined the brand, it had become a very different business. The real money now was in direct sales to subscribers. The magazine was the big front door into direct sales of books, CDs and videos. The company was so good at direct mail that it could send out a test offer to see if someone would buy a book, record or video before they produced it. It could estimate to within 500 copies what they were going to sell. Reader's Digest didn't make a product unless they knew they were going to sell a million copies.</p><p>Thornley's message to Reader's Digest in 1995 was simple: the company had a great business model and was getting better and better at identifying and directly targeting its core customers, but there was a problem: the readership was ageing and not being replaced by younger readers. Worse, he argued, the more they created products that appealed to that core customer base, the more they excluded anyone else.</p><p>Readers Digest said, \"Yeah, but every year we make more money so we don't care.\" And so Thornley produced a single graph based on US mortality rates. It was headed \"10 years from now, customers representing 41 per cent of your profit will be dead\".</p><p>That's when Thornley made his pitch: there's this new thing called the internet and your big front door is going to be search engines. While people think you are helping them find the site they want, what they are actually doing is telling you what they want. So if you capture this information you will be able to bring people to a place where you can offer them something you already know they want. Then he offered the kicker: \"I'm going to do it anyway but if you want to do it with me, I will help you save your business.\"</p><p>Forty-five minutes later he walked out with a cheque for $US10 million.</p><p>While cobbling together the deal that would <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/companies/looksmart-gets-a-powerful-boost-19990215-kb51x\">create LookSmart,</url> Thornley was at the centre of the online universe. He moved to Silicon Valley on the outskirts of San Francisco, the geographical centre of the commercialisation of the web where start-ups tapped into the groundbreaking work of computer scientists at nearby Stanford University.</p><p>Like every new medium and every new technological advance - automobiles, aeroplanes, telephones - it prompted a mad rush of companies trying to find a way to harness digital advances and make a windfall. Like those earlier rushes to exploit technology, this one was driven by a libertarian mindset that government should just get out of the way and let the free market rip. This was totally consistent with the reward-driven speculation that is at the heart of capitalist enterprise; most go broke, but a few end up huge.</p><p>Thornley's LookSmart embraced the Silicon Valley ethos, but also differentiated itself from an industry where 40 per cent of the revenue was coming from the distribution of online pornography. LookSmart simply didn't categorise so-called ???adult' content. It was a simple moral decision for Thornley, but it also became part of the LookSmart brand.</p><p>That principled stand led to the biggest deal of his life. The moment that made LookSmart was the moment Microsoft decided to take the best search engine it could find for its home computers. After trying to take the model and copy it themselves, Microsoft licensed LookSmart to power its PC searches, complete with their Hotmail accounts, helping millions of families navigate their first-ever web experience. By providing a clean search engine, LookSmart was the family-friendly default.</p><p>Reader's Digest walked away from its investment in 1997 after new management decided the internet was just a passing fad. At the time LookSmart had been valued at just $US3 million. By August 1999, when the company floated on the NASDAQ, its valuation was $US1.2 billion. In March 2000 its value was $US7.2 billion, which at that time was the equivalent of $14 billion.</p><p>Owning 15 per cent of the company made Thornley, on paper at least, a billionaire. \"It was surreal,\" he remembers, \"like living in the wealthiest insane asylum on earth.\" There was money sloshing around in the streets and every kid thought they should be a senior vice president with three per cent stock in whatever company they were working for. But Thornley was also aware that these crazy times were never going to last.</p><p>In the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/companies/getting-on-with-business-20010518-ka3t3\">dotcom crash</url> of March 2000 nearly every internet company lost 99 per cent of its value. Fortunes disappeared overnight, even if they had never been real fortunes anyway. Because of the earn-out provisions of most floated companies, no-one got the chance to cash in other than the lawyers and business consultants who had orchestrated the bubble - they still made their own fortunes in fees. When the market hit its nadir, LookSmart bottomed out at $US30 million.</p><p>\"The truth is the great companies - and we weren't a great company but we weren't crap - were not overvalued,\" Thornley says. \"It turns out if you bought the great companies like Amazon and eBay at the top of the market before the crash, five years later you still would have made a good investment. But when the tide goes out, all the crap got washed out, including the other search engines like Excite, AltaVista, who all vanished.\"</p><p>In contrast, LookSmart managed to survive and got back to being a more modest and appropriately scaled business, worth hundreds of millions which, for a six-year-old business run by a guy in his early 30s, was still pretty good work.</p><p>Even without the tech crash, LookSmart's days were numbered. Thornley's ???capture, qualify and stream' was the right long-term model to make the web pay but the entry point was the quality of the search. When Google came along with a way of searching the internet that was so much better than anyone had ever imagined, search became a whole new ball game.</p><p>All previous keyword search engines, including LookSmart, had used what are called matching algorithms. The more frequent and close together in the document a set of keywords, the closer to the top of the list of results the site would sit. While the result would give you something relevant, it would not necessarily give you something useful.</p><p>Larry Page and Sergey Brin, a couple of PhDs from Stanford, came up with a new approach. They knew that in academia the currency of a paper was the number of scholars who had cited it. If you write an important research paper that gets cited by 1000 other scholars then you have written the definitive paper. They figured that if citations determined the quality of everything from a PhD to a Nobel Prize, then it was also likely to be the best way to judge a page on the web as well.</p><p>On the web, hyperlink shortcuts took the place of an academic citation. Page and Brin concluded that the more people link to a document, the more useful that document would be, particularly if those other documents that were linking to it were also deemed to be important. With this insight they created an equation that that could tell what the online community deter- mined were the most important documents on any given topic and they named it after an extremely large number (one with 100 zeroes after it): a googol.</p><p>Despite being five years late to the web, the Google ranking algorithm just blew every other search engine away. All of a sudden the web seemed a whole lot more relevant. Thornley saw Google coming in the rearview mirror and tried to buy it out, but Page and Brin rejected his offer, a shrewd decision on their part. Backed by not one but two of the world's top venture capital firms who had never done a joint deal before, they went it alone and emerged from the ashes of the dotcom crash to win the internet search wars.</p><p>Two decades on, Google has flattened the information hierarchy so that anyone, anywhere can get anything they want, and that's a good thing. But it's also allowed bad people who want to do horrible things to get the information they need and to find others like them - child porn networks, terrorists, drug dealers, the whole dark web. With no ground rules, the web is libertine in the purest sense of the word. It's a tool for good or evil depending on whether you are good or evil.</p><p>More profoundly, Google has realised that every search is a minuscule piece of evidence of human behaviour. Every connection is a living snapshot of human logic, each landing point a manifestation of human desire. Over time Google has learned to track the journeys of its users to create a larger truth, that what we seek defines who we are. It has learned to track our failings too, from simple things like predicting a misspelt word and correcting it for us to understanding the triggers for our grander follies.</p><p>As that body of evidence has grown, so has Google's capacity to understand our behaviour and purport to pre-empt our preferences. Google's ambitions transcended search long ago; its enterprises now range from creating <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/technology/waymo-and-other-selfdriving-car-makers-powering-a-37-trillion-shift-20190131-h1apqt\">self-driving cars</url> to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/technology/the-battle-to-control-artificial-intelligence-20190320-p515xt\">prototyping the human brain</url>. All this is still anchored in its elegant search algorithm.</p><p>In this environment the dominant platforms like Google and Facebook operate as extreme examples of companies that have accumulated market dominance. They use their scale to entrench their power, managing competition to their advantage.</p><p>Smaller players creating new things will never get to compete because they will be bought up and absorbed before they become a risk. Natural network effects always have a tendency towards monopoly, but the information networks have perfected it and amplified it more than most.</p><p>The companies that thrive master the network effect by creating a model that builds a self-perpetuating supply of users. Every user on Facebook makes the social network more attractive, every search on Google makes its base stronger, every supplier on Amazon makes its marketplace more compelling.</p><p>Nobel Prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz argues that Big Tech has crushed the theory of ???beneficial competition', the idea that the marketplace will work to distribute goods and services in a way that maximises wellbeing across society.</p><p>This article of faith, that consumers are sovereign and prices are set by their rational decisions, drove economic policy for more than a century. But Stiglitz warns that the power has shifted with monopoly technology companies being able to shape consumer desire to extract the maximum price. \"The law of the single price, which is a basic law of efficient markets, is no longer true,\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/joseph-stiglitz-warns-us-will-lose-from-trade-war-fears-domination-of-tech-giants-20181107-h17n0z\">he told The Australian Financial Review</url> in November 2018. \"That destroys the efficiency of the market economy. It is very serious.\"</p><p>Compounding this fracture is the ability of Big Tech to oppose measures that might change its behaviour and mediate its natural inclinations. Like every other ???Big' industry - Big Pharma, Big Tobacco, Big Coal - it has teams of lobbyists and lawyers to push back at any notion of regulation, wowing decision-makers not just with political donations and cultural cool, but the potential to dish the dirt on critics as well.</p><p>Censorship is a cause c??l??bre of Big Tech, with CEOs like Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/technology/why-no-one-s-buying-zuckerberg-s-nonsense-20191028-p534ud\">pushing back</url> against any move to regulate online content by invoking the rights of the individual user even as personal privacy becomes a tradable commodity. In this way Big Tech has the resources not just to define the problems but to dictate their solutions to policymakers.</p><p>And here's the rub. While the information hierarchies may have flattened, the economic hierarchy is stronger than it ever was. The institutional edifices that dominated industrial society may have come crashing to the ground, but Big Tech has reconfigured into horizontal structures that are metastasising across the network and exercising the same, if not greater, levels of control. Whether it's the media, real estate, motor sales, employment services - industries that used to use the media have been absorbed and then usurped by the Big Tech companies.</p><p>Could there have been a different way? What if smart people like Thornley, driven by the public good, had set about creating the public infrastructure of the future, rather than what have become private networks on which we all pay to play. Would we have a different network today if the internet had remained a government enterprise? What if the roll-out had been driven by the public interest rather than driven by commercial outcomes?</p><p>\"What makes you think the government wouldn't have stuffed it right up?\" says Thornley. \"It would have been slower, costlier, it would have created a drab and dull set of share files. It would have simply replaced the tendency for private control with state control. And history shows us how that can end.\"</p><p>Thornley's alternate reality does not see the state in the driver's seat but rather people tapping into the spirit of mutualism, the mass movement of cooperatives that were one of the biggest social forces of the early 20th century. Then more than half the households in the English-speaking world were members of mutual organisations of some description. Manchester Unity was a global empire, so too Alcoholics Anonymous, the motoring associations, mutual insurance companies like AMP (before they were privatised and became the worst of the for-profit financial services industry).</p><p>If you want a vision of a more genuinely connected net, conjure up the idea of cooperative platforms that genuinely share. Ask yourself why Airbnb isn't owned by its members. Why don't the drivers and passengers own Uber? Surely in the sharing economy we should share the ownership among all the producers and consumers on the network and not just defer to the landlords who have laid down the pipes?</p><p>For Thornley, Face-to-face human relations are the glue, he believes, not these virtual networks that Big Tech has built. It's not just that these new networks are failing to build real connections, they are actually destroying them.</p><p>\"The Enlightenment gave us the gift of scientific method and the fraud of individualism - not individuality, which is fine, but individualism, which is a fraud.\"</p><p>Thornley lines up scientific method, which has largely done humanity good, against this \"fraud of individualism\" that he believes is leading us further and further from the basic truth that \"our lives are going to be better or worse on the basis of how well we relate with those closest to us\".</p><p>He says, \"We were not born as sovereign selves who grew up in splendid isolation any more than we are pieces of data on a spreadsheet. We are formed by those closest to us and we exist socially for the remainder of our days.</p><p>\"The empirical evidence illustrates if those close and intimate relationships are good then life expectancy is longer, health is better, we are economically better off. But if those relationships are threadbare or non-existent then life is precarious and with little margin for error. And if those relationships are toxic then life is pretty awful.\"</p><p>That is something not even on the radar of the people who are inventing the future with their compelling start-ups and sense of technical and economic inevitability. Instead they have bought the dream that you can create any reality if only enough people are prepared to click. That's the web dream, but to Thornley it's nothing more than a virtual reality.</p><p>\"Reality is real people in real relationships with each other with real mutual care,\" he insists, \"and the more we separate ourselves from that central truth the further we are from reality.\"</p><p>Edited extract from <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.newsouthpublishing.com/articles/chasing-webtopia/\">Webtopia: The World Wide Wreck of Tech and How to Make the Net Work </url>by Peter Lewis (NewSouth Publishing).</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-1520217211</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XWN-RP91-DY19-C1V8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3150\"/><timeReceived>03:01 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

I\u2019ve now tweaked the headline since the answer is clear. I know I\u2019m not the only one who was utterly nauseated by Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s insipid speech at Georgetown University in Washington last week (pictured below), in which the Facebook founder and chief executive posited himself as a protector of free speech, rather than a surveillance capitalist.</p><p>It\u2019s hard to know who is more narcissistic and oblivious to reality \u2014 Zuck, or our president. And there, let me stop and ask Swampians to take note that I\u2019m bashing both a liberal and a conservative here, so no need for any angry political notes (and thanks to those who\u2019ve sent kind ones in the last couple of weeks after I complained about a deluge of hateful comments).</p><p>But back to Big Tech. The idea that a man who has become a billionaire by the industrial-scale monetisation of personal data is invoking Frederick Douglass, Martin Luther King, the Vietnam war and the first amendment of the US constitution in his continuing efforts to avoid appropriate regulation is just beyond. If anyone wonders about the cognitive dangers of being in the Silicon Valley money and power bubble, this is a case in point of how it can truly addle your brain.</p><p>The looming question is what the future of surveillance capitalism \u2014 as practised not only by Facebook, but an increasing number of corporations in and out of Silicon Valley \u2014 is going to be. Are we going to continue to allow people such as Mark and his deputy Sheryl Sandberg to tell us that either: a) they have no responsibility for any ramifications of their technologies; or b) they\u2019ve added another 25,000 human content regulators and don\u2019t worry, everything\u2019s fine now (they seem to do both in turns)? Or are we going to say \u201cenough is enough, this is our data that you are turning into a corporate input, and we are taking control of it now, and we will tell YOU what you can and can\u2019t do with it \u2014 and how\u201d?</p><p>I\u2019ve just written a new book (you can see the first excerpt here, on the cover of FT Weekend\u2019s Life &amp; Arts section) that argues for the latter. And as part of my book tour, I\u2019ll be moderating a conversation tomorrow at the Vanity Fair New Establishment Summit with venture capitalist Alan Patricof and technologist Tristan Harris, one of the most important critical voices in the fight against our algorithmic overlords.</p><p>Harris, who alerted me to the dangers of 24-7 monitoring, is now running the Center for Humane Technology. He believes that the targeted advertising business model (which by definition requires surveillance) and liberal democracy could be incompatible because companies such as Facebook have facilitated so much disinformation and have so much control of our consumption habits and choices that truly free will on the part of the mass voting public is no longer possible.</p><p>If that\u2019s true, then the only question is how to rein in the platforms, which now have more users than the world\u2019s largest companies have people, a point drawn home by Zuck\u2019s choice of Georgetown University\u2019s Gaston Hall to make his speech. This is usually where heads of state hold forth. I find the symbolism there quite frightening, because I know that Zuck and many of his tech titan compatriots view themselves and their corporate creations as supranational, and truly above political control.</p><p>Then again, there may be interesting comparisons to be made between Zuck\u2019s dangerous megalomania and that of the president. </p><p>Ed, you recently crafted a wonderful FT leader on the clear and present danger that Donald Trump poses to the republic. How do you think Zuck as an individual, and Facebook as a company, stacks up on that score?</p><p>Recommended reading</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Since we are talking surveillance, I must give a shout out to my colleague Gideon Rachman\u2019s terrific piece on why the west needs to stand up to China on human rights. </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>I was intrigued by Bob Hockett\u2019s piece on how digital currency could <url normalizedValue=\"https://prospect.org/economy/dynamic-inclusive-money-economy/\"> support poor neighbourhoods</url>.

We desperately need a new Louis Brandeis.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>Edward Luce responds</p><p>That\u2019s a good question Rana. I recently heard someone make the case that Trump and Zuckerberg have something in common that helps explain their respective megalomanias. Each has spent their whole life within a command and control structure of their own making \u2014 Trump in his property empire and Zuckerberg at Facebook. Indeed both were deep into their self-created worlds before they left college at varying stages of completion (Trump, of course, inherited most of his money but then built it entirely around his personal brand). At one level their achievements are spectacularly impressive. It landed one in the White House. The other was arguably the most powerful non-politician in the world before he turned thirty. </p><p>At another level it explains their inability to manage forces beyond their self-created bubbles. Trump is probably the most chaotic president in history. Zuckerberg is tone deaf to the fears that Facebook are legitimately generating. Every time he tries to assuage them he makes them worse, as he did last week. At any rate, now is not the time to offer my larger philosophy about surveillance capitalism \u2014 to the extent that I have a coherent one. I simply want to acknowledge your bipartisan invitation, Rana, and agree that they both pose big threats to liberal democracy as we know it. Trump is a clear and present danger \u2014 but a temporary one. Zuckerberg seems more like a clear and perpetual danger. His power grows every day. </p><p>Your feedback</p><p>We\u2019d love to hear from you.

I would argue that implanting things in your brain is beyond the creepy line \u2026 at least for the moment.\u201d (Video: <url normalizedValue=\"https://bit.ly/2Gz02M9\">https://bit.ly/2Gz02M9</url>)</p><p> That was in 2010.</p><p> A recent eye-opening documentary aptly titled \u201cThe Creepy Line\u201d uncovers how Google and Facebook are using data about each of us to encourage us to buy certain products. The documentary was produced by investigative journalist and New York Times best-selling author Peter Schweizer.</p><p> That Google and Facebook use data to sell to us shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise. They are by far the two largest advertising platforms in the world.</p><p> What is concerning is their ability to affect the outcomes of elections here and around the world. Our attitudes, opinions and even our voting preferences are being pushed one way or another by forces we don\u2019t even see.</p><p> That is creepy.</p><p>Google built the best algorithm for indexing the web so that we can find whatever we\u2019re searching for instantly. Google mastered search. It beat the competition \u2014 and fairly. It now has more than 90 percent market share in search.</p><p> About 40,000 Google searches are conducted every second. Just in the time it takes to read this column, Google will have processed more than 20 million searches.</p><p> How are Google and Facebook able afford the billions and billions of dollars it takes to run their companies and provide expansive services? The answer is we are their product. They sell us to advertisers.</p><p> So there really is a cost: our privacy.</p><p> The founder and CEO of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, testified before Congress responding to Sen. Orrin Hatch as to how Facebook is able to provide their social media platform free. \u201c Senator, we run ads,\u201d he said with a smirk on his face. (Video: <url normalizedValue=\"https://bit.ly/2N1MfgQ\">https://bit.ly/2N1MfgQ</url>)</p><p>Google and Facebook might know more know about us than we know about ourselves. This enables them to serve the right ad at the right time. It works very well. That\u2019s why advertisers spent more than $65 billion last year with Google and Facebook.</p><p>Google also owns the Android operating system that runs 82 percent of smartphones. Many say Google knows where you have been physically in the offline world. Google might be recording your voice and everything else going on in your environment.</p><p>Google owns the web browser Chrome. If you use Chrome, Google knows every website and webpage you have visited. Even if you don\u2019t use Chrome, 76 percent of websites contain hidden Google trackers, and 24 percent contain hidden Facebook trackers.</p><p>Google owns Gmail and keeps a record of every email you have sent and received.</p><p>Google knows everything you have searched. Since Google owns YouTube, it knows everything you have searched and watched on YouTube.</p><p> We have Google Voice, Google Home, Amazon Alexa, Apple HomePod, Apple Siri, Google Docs, Google Earth, Google Hangouts, Google Maps, Google Analytics and more are coming. Are they always listening and recording everything they hear in our homes?</p><p> Vast record-keeping</p><p> Schweizer\u2019s documentary claims Facebook keeps a record of all of our comments, likes, pictures, friends and private messages, even if we delete our accounts.</p><p> To understand the impact beyond our personal privacy, consider the possibility Hillary Clinton would be president if Facebook would have kept better tabs on who it was buying its advertising space and what they were doing with it.</p><p> Amazon, Apple and Microsoft aren\u2019t beyond question either.</p><p> Based on all the information Google and Facebook have on each of us, it\u2019s easy to understand why they are so good at sending the right ads at the right time.</p><p> \u201cGoogle crosses the creepy line every day,\u201d said former editor of Psychology Today Dr. Robert Epstein in the Schweitzer documentary.</p><p> He and University of Toronto professor Jordan Peterson have done research that showed each of us is served up different results when we search, and the results are delivered in a different order.</p><p> That applies not only in our searching for products. It also is about manipulating our thinking. If two people search a topic in the news using the same search term, the results will be different and in a different order. Facebook works similarly.</p><p> That crosses the creepy line.</p><p> Selling us products is one thing. Giving each of us different versions of the news and commentary is quite another.</p><p> The first major legislation by government in this arena is the General Data Protection Regulation. It was passed by the European Union to protect people\u2019s privacy. The regulation aims to give individuals control of their personal data.</p><p> GDPR is forcing big tech companies to behave more responsibly with regard to individual privacy.</p><p> When companies grow so big and we become so dependent on them, their responsibility must grow commensurately. Should they be regulated as publishers? Does our government need to take steps?</p><p> We love new technologies, but we must have a serious conversation about the concerns raised in \u201cThe Creepy Line\u201d documentary. We must look through a nonpartisan lens. We must guard against the potential threat to our democracy and individual liberty.</p><p> Dick Maggiore is president and CEO of Innis Maggiore, founded in Canton in 1974, and today recognized as America\u2019s leading positioning ad agency helping brands compete and win in the marketplace here and across the country.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">REPTRY-3825766</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">REPTRY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VGB-1B31-DXVP-V3WG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">387651</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"919\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 GateHouse Media, Inc.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Something I am acutely aware of and actively addressing in the context my responsibility to advance the Government's International Financial Services' Strategy, IFS2020.</p><p>Together they represent a valuable niche in the international marketplace Ireland can really put its stamp on. Taking on the mantle of a premier global Fintech hub is an opportunity that requires an alignment and leveraging of the many advantages Ireland has worked long and hard to achieve.</p><p>Our proximity and strong links to the City of London, our place at the heart of the Eurozone, our recognition as a leading European Financial Services Centre, and our deep cultural and commercial ties with the US situate Ireland as a nexus and hub for transatlantic financial services' activity.</p><p>Our big tech and big data advantages are many. The company listings, spanning Apple to Zynga, reads like a who's who in the ICT hall of fame. While Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Apple setting up data centres across the country prove that Irish clouds really do have a silver lining.</p><p>These human and capital votes of confidence in Ireland lend both the critical mass and fertile hinterland around which indigenous companies can cluster, thrive and expand as either direct service providers or emerging out from a vibrant ICT community and start-up cultural.</p><p>A third element, and indeed the catalyst behind the inexorable rise of Fintech on the global stage, is that financial services and ICT are increasingly two sides of the same coin. A look around Citi's Dublin Innovation Lab bears scant resemblance to traditional conceptions of what one would term a bank, while Apple Pay and Google Wallet assert these tech companies' advance as dominant players in the areas of mobile banking and merchant services.</p><p>To borrow the words of O'Casey's Captain Boyle, the financial services' world is truly in a 'terrible state o' chassis'. In business and tech circles this 'disruption' is challenging every aspect of financial services. In many cases previous providers of ICT services to established banks, insurance companies, and investment houses have decided to cut out the middleman and go straight to the consumer and business customer.</p><p>Likewise, established financial service providers, conscious of the changing landscape, are working hard to catch up. Some by way of acquisition of or partnering with tech companies, others by way of stimulating an entrepreneurial spirit and start-up culture amongst their workforce and organisational structures.</p><p>All in all, challenging and interesting times.</p><p>Since taking up my role as Minister of State for International Financial Services, my first challenge has been to better coordinate our Public Sector to be more responsive and alive to current and future trends.</p><p>In the course of my consultations with industry my Damascus moment was a visit to the Enterprise Ireland stand at Paddy Cosgrave's Web Summit last November. The energy and ambition radiated by these Fintech entrepreneurs was contagious, and confirmed for me that this was an area to be overlooked at one's peril.</p><p>Since that day I have made it my priority to work to foster and develop Ireland's Fintech and innovation ecosystems.</p><p>This includes, in the near term, implementing several cross-cutting measures to foster a pipeline of talent, to open up access to funding and expertise for Irish startups, and to work with other stakeholders to address the pressing need for enterprise space - both for startups looking for a first foot on the ladder and established SMEs eager to expand.</p><p>In the two months since launching the IFS2020 Strategy I have been impressed by the responsiveness of the public sector to come together to propose options and avenues to advance these measures, and by industry's openness to find a common ground so as to better communicate with Government and ensure that Ireland can compete in an increasingly competitive market place for ideas, drive and talent.</p><p>I am firmly of the view that getting to grips with the basics of communication and collaboration will unleash our potential to allow us outshine competitor locations as a destination of choice.</p><p>Recently the Taoiseach pointed out that bringing our unemployment down from 15pc to under 10pc was a massive undertaking to undo the failures of past administrations, and that moving from below 10pc to full employment is an equally difficult and important task of responsible Government.</p><p>I am convinced that Fintech is such a route beyond recovery to a sustainable and prosperous future. The task of Government is now one of continuing to deliver surefooted policy in tandem with a robust and responsive regulatory regime to ensure that an innovative, expanding and highlyprized sector can thrive in line with our innate and cultivated advantages.</p><p>Positioning and promoting Ireland as a preeminent Fintech hub is a step in that direction.</p><p>Simon Harris is Minister of State at the Departments of Finance, Public Expenditure and the Department of the Taoiseach, with special responsibility for International Financial Services.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Events such as Paddy Cosgrave's Web Summit showcase the skills and strengths of our country</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRIIND-100207327</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRIIND2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5G4P-VPW1-DY9P-N09T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304313</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-06-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"954\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Independent Newspapers Ireland Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Irish Independent</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"40446\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"06\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>June 4, 2015 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002275</classCode><className>CITIGROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS523120 SECURITIES BROKERAGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS522210 CREDIT CARD ISSUING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Shortly after they had swept from night to day, a bright, colorful complexity came past the limb of the Moon and into view.</p><p><br/>\u00a0<br/>-Oh my God! Look at that picture over there! Here's the Earth coming up.Wow, that is pretty.<br/>and life returned to the world . . .It has been called<br/>-Oh that's a beautiful shot.<br/>the most important picture of the 20th century.<br/>from: The Moon: A History for the Future by Oliver Morton<br/>\u00a0<br/>\"Earthrise, that iconic photograph snapped from the Apollo 8 space capsule 50 years ago on a Christmas-eve orbit around the Moon, forced a self-absorbed species to reflect on its fragility.<br/>\"Prior to that image, people had a perception of the planet being essentially infinite in its capacity to take all the damage we dish out,\" recalls John Amos. A geoscientist who worked for years helping oil companies scout prospects from space, Amos was among a generation inspired by the \"overview effect\" to shift into activism. He left industry to launch an environmental-surveillance nonprofit called SkyTruth.<br/>\"Seeing that vanishingly small green-and-blue dot surrounded by the absolute, almost horrifying blackness of open space-that made a lot of people think we need to be wielding our awesome power more wisely,\" he says. Along<br/>with aerial views of an enormous oil spill off the coast of Santa Barbara the following month, \u201fEarthrise\" helped spur the creation of Earth Day and the major environmental-protection laws of the 1970s. Such is the power of a transformative shift in perspective enabled by a major leap in engineering.<br/>Half a century later, the arcs of fast-rising technologies-commercial rockets, cubesats, and drones, plus cloud computing, machine learning, and the Internet of Things-are now intersecting in ways that will again indelibly alter how we see the world and our place in it.<br/>It is no longer just advanced militaries and rich corporations who can keep tabs on what people are up to half a world away. Watchdogs such as Global Forest Watch, Global Fishing Watch, and SkyTruth are combing through satellite photos and radar scans to alert authorities to illegal clear-cutting, rogue fishing, mountaintop removals, and other environmental misbehavior.<br/>Researchers at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology have exploited Amazon cloud servers to assemble millions of amateur birdwatcher reports into exquisite animated maps that plot the changing abundance of 122 bird species throughout North America. Ranchers are stapling health-monitoring microchips to their livestock. Beekeepers are sticking wireless sensors into their hives.<br/>Farmers are planting high-tech electronics into the soil along with their crops. Autonomous sailboats now ply the Southern Ocean to look for krill swarms, and AI-enhanced drones patrol elephant habitats in southern Africa to spot poachers on the prowl.<br/>\"We are on the curling edge of the wave,\" Amos says. The power of the \u201fEarthrise\" image came, in part, from the humbling invisibility of human existence in it. \"This new instrumentation is more about seeing what people are up to in the environment,\" he says. \"The promise of this convergence in technology lies in imposing radical transparency on corporate activity and supply chains everywhere.\" As SkyTruth's motto goes, \"If you can see it, you can change it.\"<br/>Or so one would hope. One lesson from past revolutions in social media and other technologies is that \"Power always learns, and powerful tools always fall into its hands,\" Zeynep Tufekci of the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society wrote recently in MIT Technology Review. In less than a decade, starry-eyed promises inspired by Internet-organized protests in Tahrir Square gave way to the grim realities of data trafficking, cyberbullying, election meddling, and surveillance states.<br/>Radical transparency in our online lives has frayed, not tightened, the fabric of societies. And now, in the unrelenting march of technological monitoring, things are getting real.<br/>As sprawling webs of sensors, cameras, and satellites give some (but not others) a near-real-time view from everywhere, certain parallels to recent history are unmistakable-and unnerving. Data-gathering startups are popping up all over, but they are locked in cutthroat races to monetize what they tout as \"intelligence.\" Tech giants are \"indexing the Earth\" by hoovering up satellite images the moment they are released to public access and then pouring the data into vast archives.<br/>Though today these companies often beneficently grant free access to selected researchers and nonprofits, their long-term business strategies hinge on converting data into dollars. And those who are being observed and recorded are not the customers-they are the products. Does any of this sound familiar?<br/>Yet history is not destiny. If we anticipate many of the ways that these new windows on the world might be misused, it should be possible to set up rules and agencies that will encourage the best uses while thwarting bad actors. Surprisingly, experts say that might not be as hard as it sounds.<br/>The unblinking eyeOnline instrumentation of the built and natural environment is extending our view of the real world in three dimensions at once: in extent, in detail, and in time. We are fast approaching a moment when, for a price, you can put eyes on any given spot on the planet on any given day, then scroll back through time to see how that place has changed.<br/>Advances in machine-learning algorithms have made it possible to train an unblinking AI gaze on a location of interest and get automated alerts when the software spots something amiss. One can now tag, say, a whaling ship and follow it from port to port. With each passing year, this tech makes it easier to conduct oversight-in the most literal sense-of those who exploit the land and sea.<br/>What's more, the number of eyes in orbit is skyrocketing, driven by launch costs that have plummeted 90 percent since the Space Shuttle era. Europe's Copernicus program has fielded six Earth-observing satellites, called Sentinels, since 2014. It plans to expand the fleet to 30 within the next decade. Last year, China added six high-resolution optical and infrared imaging satellites to its fast-growing constellation.<br/>\u00a0<br/>\u00a9European Space Agency<br/>The instrumented EarthA thickening flock of Earth-observing satellites blankets the planet. Over 700 were launched during the past 10 years, and more than 2,200 additional ones are scheduled to go up within the next 10 years. These scanners orbit among an increasingly crowded field of thousands of communications, navigation, and astronomical satellites as well as almost a million pieces of space debris bigger than one centimeter.<br/>The spacecraft and debris shown in this artist's impression reflect the actual density of orbiting objects but are exaggerated in size to make them visible at this scale.<br/>In the US, the most dramatic growth in environmental surveillance is happening in the private sector. San Francisco-based Planet Labs has launched 331 Earth-observing satellites since it spun up in 2013. Nearly 150 of Planet's cubesats, each roughly the size of a loaf of bread, took to space in 2018 alone. (For comparison, 173 satellites owned by governments were operating at the start of 2016.)<br/>The company now collects 300 million square kilometers of imagery every day. That's nearly three-fifths the surface area of the Earth.<br/>And at the same time as the number of images is exploding, so is the number of pixels in each square kilometer photographed. The smallest detail visible from Landsat 8, NASA's flagship Earth-imaging spacecraft, is 15 meters-the size of a city bus.<br/>Today Planet's largest orbiting cameras can pick out a person sunbathing in their backyard, though not the interesting bits. Its competitor, Maxar, snaps photos from orbit at 30-centimeter resolution, sharp enough to see people and large animals on the hoof. Views from the newest Chinese satellites are thought to be sharper still.<br/>Such surveillance works only when skies are sunny. But soon, constellations of very high-resolution satellites will use radar to peer through clouds and the dark of night as well. \"That kicks open some doors,\" Amos says. In particular, high-def radar can light up the vast \"dark fleet\" of fishing vessels that refuse to broadcast their positions via radio transponders.<br/>Armed with new ways of seeing and with software that can merge surveillance quickly from multiple sources, watchdogs now have more opportunities to illuminate shady behavior while there is still time to do something about it. \"We're just now seeing the beginning of what is going to become possible,\" he says.<br/>In January, the Center for Strategic and International Studies reported that it had used returns from a space-based radar-along with tracking data from radio, visible, and infrared satellites-to monitor fishing activity among the disputed Spratly Islands in the South China Sea.<br/>The study revealed that the number of boats operating surreptitiously in the area is \"exponentially higher\" than those broadcasting as they should. A large fraction of the vessels that look like fishing boats, the investigators concluded, are actually militia patrolling the waters on behalf of China.<br/>A different group of researchers working with Global Fishing Watch recently combined observations from multiple satellites to uncover illicit Chinese behavior of a different kind. In a study soon to be published, \"[W]e show that Chinese ships are fishing for squid in North Korean waters, almost certainly in violation of UN sanctions, while the North Koreans are fishing for squid in Russian waters,\" says Paul Woods, the team's chief technology officer.<br/>\"There's no way at this scale that there isn't a financial transaction between the North Koreans and businesses in China,\" he suspects, despite international accords prohibiting such trade.<br/>In addition to getting clearer views of the present, activists are now able to exploit cloud computing to replay the past from extensive image archives maintained by Google, Amazon, and various government agencies. Amazon makes all data from Landsat 8 freely available on its cloud storage service.<br/>Websites such as EO Browser have taken advantage of the open-use policy to create services that let you zoom in to any location, enter a time range, pick the satellite sources you like, and then produce a time-lapse video of how the scene has evolved.<br/>Though the search engine and imagery are currently free, thanks to financial backing by the European Union, they do not include the more detailed views offered by companies such as Planet and Maxar.<br/>But commercial firms have been working with watchdogs and government agencies on projects that demonstrate the potential of this technology, which can help attract paying customers. At the Rights Lab at the University of Nottingham, for example, researchers have been scouring image series supplied by Planet and Maxar for environmental evidence of slave labor at brick kilns in India, in cotton fields in Turkmenistan, and in mangrove-displacing shrimp farms in Bangladesh.<br/>Google has lent its Earth Engine system to Global Forest Watch, Global Fishing Watch, and a new surface-water viewer developed by the European Commission and the UN Environment Program.<br/>The viewer, developed over three years and 10 million hours of computing time, maps disappearing streams and dwindling lakes worldwide over the past 35 years. Scroll over northern California in the viewer, and the demise of Goose Lake is unmistakable. Click on the lake, and year-by-year measurements reveal that the 2008 drought sounded its death knell.<br/>Access to space has become cheap enough that better-funded nonprofits can now put their own birds into the sky. The Environmental Defense Fund plans to launch by 2021 a satellite it is building to measure methane leaking from oil and gas production sites worldwide, revisiting each site at least once a week.<br/>\u00a0<br/>250 petabytes, the expected size of the NASA environmental data archive in 2020s.<br/>To keep tabs on things that can't yet be seen from space-or to follow up on interesting sightings-some activist groups are deploying drones into the skies and oceans. Last winter, autonomous sailing robots built by Saildrone set off from South America to circumnavigate Antarctica.<br/>The months-long mission gathers data for scientists at NOAA and CSIRO on how fast the Southern Ocean is absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere, a crucial variable in global climate models. The floating drones are also mapping the abundance of phytoplankton and krill, which form the base of the marine food web.<br/>Also in 2018, biologists reviewing satellite images of the Danger Islands off the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula spotted what looked like a previously unknown megacolony of Ad\u00e9lie penguins. Researchers sailed to the islands and flew drones over the colony, confirming the discovery of 750,000-plus breeding pairs.<br/>One of the biggest challenges in environmental surveillance has been digging through haystacks for elusive needles. \"Society already struggles with too much data, not enough information, Amos says. \"And this is certainly happening in remote sensing as well.\"<br/>After many years of false starts, artificial intelligence finally seems ready to help solve this problem. In southern Africa, for example, the Lindbergh Foundation's Air Shepherd program had high hopes that, by flying surveillance drones equipped with infrared scanners over elephant and rhino habitats, its teams could catch poachers before the poachers caught their prey.<br/>But the monitoring teams found it hard to stare for hours on end at shaky, grainy, night-vision video. Hunters often slipped past them.<br/>So the group linked up with engineers at Microsoft, Carnegie Mellon, and UCLA to train an AI neural network to detect both poachers and wild animals in their recorded videos. Once they got the system working well in the lab, they tested it in the field in South Africa. It worked so well that they are now using it in national parks in Botswana and other African countries.<br/>Global Fishing Watch has used AI to distinguish fishing vessels from cargo and naval ships. A research team at Stanford reported in April that it had fed aerial photos of North Carolina farmland into a deep-learning system to find almost 600 industrial livestock farms that manual mapping had missed.<br/>Such concentrated feeding operations are a major source of freshwater pollution, in part because 60 percent of them operate without discharge permits, according to the EPA. In principle, regulators could use the AI to survey other states as well and to identify new operations as they pop up.<br/>All of these examples, and many others like them, are tremendously encouraging. They tempt us to envision a happier future in which the instrumentation of nature draws humans into a more synoptic, and yet more intimate, connection to our home planet-one where Gaia itself gains a voice and a Facebook account. These systems could help people routinely band together to watch over ecosystems and organisms they care about deeply, despite never having experienced them directly.<br/>Yet Mariel Borowitz, a space-policy researcher at Georgia Tech and author of the book Open Space, sounds a note of caution. The corporations building these technologies \"are creating new kinds of data, new use cases, new users. But they are companies, so they are selling that data to make a profit.\" And the revenue generated by environmental protection projects shows up on their books as little more than rounding error.<br/>We should take care not to overestimate the protective power of public awareness nor underestimate how the technology will amplify the power of big industry and bad actors. That is essentially the mistake we made with social media.<br/>Beneath the silver lining, a dark cloudIn the 20 years since Amos founded SkyTruth, his team has exposed rampant fracking activity, illegal gas-flaring, a decades-long oil spill, illegal fishing around Easter Island, and numerous other kinds of violations. Some of those expos\u00e9s have triggered official responses. Yet the latter half of SkyTruth's \"If you can see it, you can change it\" motto remains mostly aspirational.<br/>\"Although we've been effective at raising public awareness about certain issues,\" Amos says, \"we haven't had a big impact in altering corporate behavior.\" Environmental exploitation remains highly profitable, and profitable businesses find ways to protect themselves.<br/>The same can be said of the technology industry. Among the tech giants, \"everyone wants to be central, essential, and in control of your world,\" security expert Bruce Schneier writes in his recent book Click Here to Kill Everyone, because \"control equals profits.\"<br/>Google and Baidu became behemoths by erecting themselves as the gateways to the Web; Amazon and Alibaba as the gateways to commerce; Facebook as the gateway to friends and family. How much more valuable would it be to occupy the position of gateway to the planet?<br/>That idea seems not to have escaped Amazon and Google-which, according to Borowitz and Woods, have been downloading essentially all the Earth observations that NASA, NOAA, the European Space Agency, and other agencies make available to the public. Amazon is even building a global network of 24 large antennas to download data directly from some of the satellites that gather it.<br/>Planet Labs has been open about its long-term commercial strategy. CEO Will Marshall said last year that \"Planet will index physical change on Earth the same way Google indexed the Internet.\"<br/>Not to be left out, Facebook's AI team has been combining space imagery with public records to map the population of every community on Earth. That effort would seem to serve the company's long-held goal to get the billions of people who currently lack Internet access online-and on Facebook.<br/>None of this is necessarily a bad thing. Who could resist the convenience of Amazon's Alexa observing from orbit that your roof needs replacing or your windows could use washing, and offering to schedule the work? If Google noticed you heading out on a backcountry hike and offered to automatically summon help if you appear to get lost or injured, would you refuse?<br/>There will be countless ways that the tech giants can use the view from everywhere to make our lives slightly safer, cheaper, or more convenient. Most have not yet been conceived.<br/>But let us pause to remember that Amazon, Google, and Facebook grew to become the third-, fourth-, and fifth-most valuable companies in the world by pitching ads directly at the people most likely to act on them. Inference equals influence: the product that the tech companies sell to their customers is their ability to infer how we live, where we go, what we do.\u00a0 Imagine the value added to that product when it also captures our interactions with the physical world.<br/>\u00a0<br/>In 2017, wildfires in Chile burned almost 600,000 hectares, including 15,000 hectares of protected old-growth forest.\u00a0\u00a9Sentinel Hub<br/>\u00a0<br/>Researchers used an aerial quadcopter to help count a supercolony of 1.5 million penguins.

Witness Facebook's Cambridge Analytica fiasco and data breaches in September 2018, and again in April 2019, that exposed records-including location data-on hundreds of millions of its users. And recall how in 2017 Google tracked Android users, even when they had disabled location sharing. The day may arrive when \"going off the grid\" is no longer possible.<br/>The biggest customers for sensing data are governments and resource-extraction industries, and that is unlikely to change, Borowitz says.<br/>Sixty percent of Maxar's business comes from the US military, she notes. Planet Labs has earned tens of millions of dollars selling imagery to the US National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. Governments have often demanded exclusive access to the imagery they purchase. It stands to reason that as environmental sensing becomes commercially more valuable or politically more embarrassing, those who pay will want to keep it to themselves.<br/>It doesn't take much imagination to envision ways in which this technology could work against conservation efforts even more effectively than it aids the watchdogs. As the costs of drones and satellite images fall and the performance of AI-driven identification rises, whalers, fishers, and poachers may find them to be powerful tools for guiding their hunts. \"That's definitely a concern,\" Woods says, \"particularly for elephants, rare whales, or rhinos.\"<br/>Commodities traders and financial analysts already hone their forecasts by analyzing Planet and Maxar data to quantify the levels of fuel-storage tanks at refineries, the movement of shipping containers at ports, and the heat emitted by factories. Might land speculators use similar techniques to drive up the prices of wind and solar farms by scooping up the best sites and transmission rights-of-way?<br/>If past is prologue, regulators will lag far behind the tech giants and the resource extractors in constraining any destructive practices. \"The big tech companies are spending record amounts of money lobbying in Washington,\" Schneier writes-\"many times more than oil companies, defense contractors, and everyone else.\" One result, he observes, is that \"regulations are consistently co-opted. Instead of promoting the common good, they're aimed at promoting some private agenda.\"<br/>Watching the watchersThe good news is that none of these bad things has happened yet. Nor are they inevitable. Several models suggest how to prevent environmental surveillance from going sideways. Space exploration and scientific research offer two useful examples. And the wireless-communications and financial industries provide complementary ideas worth considering.<br/>The earliest satellites, from Sputnik on, were launched in a race to space, and a spirit of free competition has kept space open ever since. So far, 35 countries have lofted Earth-facing satellites. \"Everyone with a reasonably legitimate need gets to access low-Earth orbit and put hardware in space,\" Amos notes. \"It's just as important that there won't be shutter control imposed on [those] remote-sensing systems.\"<br/>The open-skies policy of space exploration could be extended to guarantee that no big player can exclude its competitors or critics from access to unfiltered observations-or to the computer storage and processing capacity needed to analyze them. There's no avoiding the fact that we look at the world through a prism. But we should be free to switch prisms and compare different perspectives.<br/>Scientific research has long embraced a similar principle-and it has been one of the greatest strengths of that enterprise. And financial regulators require public companies to be transparent about their performance so that the playing field is level for all investors. Similar rules could protect sensor data against undisclosed conflicts of interest and outright fraud.<br/>Today, however, open access to both raw data and open-source software to manipulate it is not the norm. Borowitz surveyed the data policies on the use of unclassified imagery from government satellites and found that data was freely available for fewer than half of them. Governments even hold back data crucial to updating climate models because they want to sell it for commercial use, she reports.<br/>Whereas Europe puts all of its Sentinel imagery in the public domain, only 10 percent of NOAA data was available online as of 2016. Since then, NOAA has implemented the Big Data Project, through which cloud providers host NOAA data and make it available to the public. They cannot charge for the actual data, but they can charge end users for distribution of the data and for processing and applications.<br/>The volume of data presents one hurdle to meaningful open access. NOAA satellites alone generate 20 terabytes of data daily. \"The amount of Earth-sensing data released by NASA is going from 20 petabytes today to 250 PB by 2020,\" she says.<br/>One petabyte-a billion megabytes-would take several years to download over a fast fiber-optic broadband connection. Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and others already offer competing cloud-computing platforms that can do the job.<br/>But this raises a second, thornier issue. When data that is too massive for nonprofits and individuals to download is generated by government, stored on private servers, and digested by profit-making companies, who controls it? And who pays?<br/>\"Space is a global public commons,\" Amos points out. He suggests that governments could demand license fees for the right to collect data from space or other public areas, much as broadcasters and wireless communications companies pay to use the electromagnetic spectrum. The fees could then help cover the costs of hosting the data for all to use.<br/>Though Amos, Woods, and Borowitz all recognize the potential unintended downsides of the emerging view from everywhere, they remain optimistic about what it means for conservation. \"The environmental bad guys already have ways to do what they want,\" Woods says. \"As long as the information stays open, I believe these tools will benefit the small players more.\"<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITNEXT-M-18765</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITNEXT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WMJ-4J31-JBYT-H4KK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">410719</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4336\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>IT Next</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 22, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Admiralty &amp;

The hunt is being led by YC's new president, Geoff Ralston, who took over from Sam Altman in May. Before assuming the role, Ralston was a partner with the organisation for eight years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">YC has a portfolio of 2,000 firms with a combined valuation of over $150 billion. These include 20 unicorns such as Airbnb, Stripe, Dropbox, and DoorDash. Speaking to STOI at his Mountain View office in California, Ralston said India was firmly in YC's crosshairs and the accelerator was looking to fund a greater share of Indian unicorns. He touched upon traits of founders who can build billion-dollar companies, government regulation, founder-investor control, and why Indian startups offer a great opportunity.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">You returned from India after conducting onsite interviews. How did it go?</p><p>It was a bit of an experiment. We started to experiment with a few ways as we try to evolve and improve a model. So, we did something like onsite interviews, and the first place we did that is India. It went really well. We got more applications than we did before and we funded more companies than we ever have. We are going to continue doing that; it will happen this fall. It's also planned for two other locations, Tel Aviv and Paris.</p><p>We think the opportunity represented by Indian startups and founders is enormous. It's because of multiple reasons \u2014 one being that there are really smart people, the founders.</p><p>YC picked a record number of startups in summer batch in India. What's the outlook going forward?</p><p>We received a record number of applicants, around 150. Earlier, it used to be around 100. I think what happens in markets like India is there's going to be an S-curve in the development of the market and a lot of the models. The interesting thing is that because every culture is different, there will be brand new opportunities here which we didn't think of before. This is perfect for startups.</p><p>You mentioned financial services was an interesting area. Which other sectors are you interested in?</p><p>We don't look at the world that way. The winds of opportunity cause founders to open themselves and that pulls them towards us. We help them be successful. I don't want to be prescriptive. We sometimes talk about areas which we think are interesting because we want to spur ideas. But we don't want to ever be prescriptive.</p><p>You are going to conduct interviews in India again this year. Will you consider opening an office here?</p><p>No, I don't think it helps. I think you should consider us to be like Stanford. You come here for three months and you learn what we know about how to prove your probability of success. We don't have an office in India, but that has not slowed down guys at Razorpay or ClearTax [YC portfolio companies].</p><p>Which among these Indian companies could become the next unicorn?</p><p>They are all making great progress towards it. They [growth-stage companies] are all significant percentages of unicorn (laughs). My interest is that we fund as larger percentage of future Indian unicorns as we can. And that's not just self-interest. It's because we really think we help founders with ethos to build a better world. A core message to founders is that they should build something people want. But there's a deeper thing we talk about, which is trying to make a world which people want. I don't think everyone has that perspective. We think YC founders generally do.</p><p>What are the core traits you look at while selecting startups?</p><p>It's important for us to believe that the founders can build billion-dollar companies. More than having traction, having product-market fit or any other thing.</p><p>How do you spot them?</p><p>It's hard. What we do particularly well is pattern match. We've seen thousands of companies; we've funded thousands of companies. So, you get a sense, sometimes we are wrong, often more wrong. Often, we are right, but it doesn't matter. It's so hard, even if you have the right person, there's a million reasons why a startup will fail or will do okay, or it will become a billion-dollar company. We kind of get the set of traits which founders of billion-dollar companies tend to have \u2014 resourcefulness and intelligence, ability to be absolutely, 100%, committed and passionate, and self-belief. You should also be able to listen to advice. This weird, almost contradictory, sense of being sure of yourself to the point of arrogance, but not so sure that you won't listen to good advice.</p><p>SoftBank has announced its second Vision Fund. How does it impact the ecosystem in Silicon Valley or India?</p><p>I think there's a lot of money in the system now. You have to understand that vision funds are so big that the minimum cheque that they can write is $100 million. That's not having a lot of effect on seed. Our first cheque is $150,000. So, the impact of that [big funds] on us is small. If they invest the money in YC companies later, it's probably a good thing.</p><p>What effect it might have is that it will push some money early on... If there's more money in Series A and Series B, it might pump up valuations, and we are seeing some indication that valuations have moved up there.</p><p>Silicon Valley investors, like Vinod Khosla, say the quality of startups has improved in India. Do you agree?</p><p>100%. It just takes a while sometimes for the culture and the ecosystem around entrepreneurship to grow. And I think that's happening in India. I think there's more opportunity in the Indian market itself.</p><p>Indian government and regulators are bringing policy changes [cryptocurrency ban, demand of data localisation] that have impacted startups.</p><p>Generally, governments tend to get in the way of startups instead of helping them. It's happened everywhere. Sometimes government officials ask us, what can we do? And our general answer is: 'Please stay out of the way. Please don't do anything'. It doesn't mean we don't believe that some regulation is smart. Regulating how people deal with data and how they think about security of people and children, those are all good things.</p><p>Many times, we have firms from countries where it's difficult for entrepreneurs to get going. It's because the legal regime is not in place.</p><p>In the US, it's super easy to incorporate, to get funding, to do all those things. There's not a lot of regulation around them. You don't have to have a lawyer on staff to figure it out. When you do, it's just harder, it slows you down. It makes success less likely. So, whether the Indian government can be smart enough to stay out of the way. I don't know. Let's hope so.</p><p>In the US, the government is talking of breaking up Big Tech. The issues of tax and wages are being constantly debated in Washington...</p><p>Let me give you YC perspective: we should have such problems that our firms grow so big that the government would want to break them up. Companies you're talking about have multi-hundred-billiondollar valuations. So, again, from YC perspective, that's like it doesn't weigh on us.</p><p>Companies are not getting broken up, by the way, for anticompetitive reasons. They're not letting any startups be successful. They're being broken up because people are worried about the power they have, vis-\u00e0-vis governments, on everyday lives. I think governments are going to have difficulties. I don't know if there's a simple solution.</p><p>India has introduced differential voting rights.</p><p>What's your view on founderinvestor control?</p><p>Historically, founders who maintained control have had the best interests of their companies in mind and that's been a good thing. I think in general, it's okay. I think there's potential for differential voting rights to be abused. It's incumbent on investors to pay attention to that. Investors are looking for great returns, and if they believe returns are going to be great, they will invest regardless of DVR. Differential board control didn't stop people from investing in Facebook. Probably, part of the reason Facebook is a strong company today is that Mark Zuckerberg was able to make the decisions he wanted.</p><p>Do you think India will have highest number of portfolio firms for YC, outside US?</p><p>It's a little hard to predict the game, but it looks like for the short term, India is likely to dominate. Next few batches for sure. We are going to start conducting interviews elsewhere, like Brazil, another big country but not as big as India population wise. India has the weight of a billion people behind it, so I think India could dominate for some time.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TOIEP-0_92_01092019014002</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TOIEP2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WY7-CKN1-DXJR-H209-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382891</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1431\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.

The hunt is being led by YC's new president, Geoff Ralston, who took over from Sam Altman in May. Before assuming the role, Ralston was a partner with the organisation for eight years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">YC has a portfolio of 2,000 firms with a combined valuation of over $150 billion. These include 20 unicorns such as Airbnb, Stripe, Dropbox, and DoorDash. Speaking to STOI at his Mountain View office in California, Ralston said India was firmly in YC's crosshairs and the accelerator was looking to fund a greater share of Indian unicorns. He touched upon traits of founders who can build billion-dollar companies, government regulation, founder-investor control, and why Indian startups offer a great opportunity.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">You returned from India after conducting onsite interviews. How did it go?</p><p>It was a bit of an experiment. We started to experiment with a few ways as we try to evolve and improve a model. So, we did something like onsite interviews, and the first place we did that is India. It went really well. We got more applications than we did before and we funded more companies than we ever have. We are going to continue doing that; it will happen this fall. It's also planned for two other locations, Tel Aviv and Paris.</p><p>We think the opportunity represented by Indian startups and founders is enormous. It's because of multiple reasons \u2014 one being that there are really smart people, the founders.</p><p>YC picked a record number of startups in summer batch in India. What's the outlook going forward?</p><p>We received a record number of applicants, around 150. Earlier, it used to be around 100. I think what happens in markets like India is there's going to be an S-curve in the development of the market and a lot of the models. The interesting thing is that because every culture is different, there will be brand new opportunities here which we didn't think of before. This is perfect for startups.</p><p>You mentioned financial services was an interesting area. Which other sectors are you interested in?</p><p>We don't look at the world that way. The winds of opportunity cause founders to open themselves and that pulls them towards us. We help them be successful. I don't want to be prescriptive. We sometimes talk about areas which we think are interesting because we want to spur ideas. But we don't want to ever be prescriptive.</p><p>You are going to conduct interviews in India again this year. Will you consider opening an office here?</p><p>No, I don't think it helps. I think you should consider us to be like Stanford. You come here for three months and you learn what we know about how to prove your probability of success. We don't have an office in India, but that has not slowed down guys at Razorpay or ClearTax [YC portfolio companies].</p><p>Which among these Indian companies could become the next unicorn?</p><p>They are all making great progress towards it. They [growth-stage companies] are all significant percentages of unicorn (laughs). My interest is that we fund as larger percentage of future Indian unicorns as we can. And that's not just self-interest. It's because we really think we help founders with ethos to build a better world. A core message to founders is that they should build something people want. But there's a deeper thing we talk about, which is trying to make a world which people want. I don't think everyone has that perspective. We think YC founders generally do.</p><p>What are the core traits you look at while selecting startups?</p><p>It's important for us to believe that the founders can build billion-dollar companies. More than having traction, having product-market fit or any other thing.</p><p>How do you spot them?</p><p>It's hard. What we do particularly well is pattern match. We've seen thousands of companies; we've funded thousands of companies. So, you get a sense, sometimes we are wrong, often more wrong. Often, we are right, but it doesn't matter. It's so hard, even if you have the right person, there's a million reasons why a startup will fail or will do okay, or it will become a billion-dollar company. We kind of get the set of traits which founders of billion-dollar companies tend to have \u2014 resourcefulness and intelligence, ability to be absolutely, 100%, committed and passionate, and self-belief. You should also be able to listen to advice. This weird, almost contradictory, sense of being sure of yourself to the point of arrogance, but not so sure that you won't listen to good advice.</p><p>SoftBank has announced its second Vision Fund. How does it impact the ecosystem in Silicon Valley or India?</p><p>I think there's a lot of money in the system now. You have to understand that vision funds are so big that the minimum cheque that they can write is $100 million. That's not having a lot of effect on seed. Our first cheque is $150,000. So, the impact of that [big funds] on us is small. If they invest the money in YC companies later, it's probably a good thing.</p><p>What effect it might have is that it will push some money early on... If there's more money in Series A and Series B, it might pump up valuations, and we are seeing some indication that valuations have moved up there.</p><p>Silicon Valley investors, like Vinod Khosla, say the quality of startups has improved in India. Do you agree?</p><p>100%. It just takes a while sometimes for the culture and the ecosystem around entrepreneurship to grow. And I think that's happening in India. I think there's more opportunity in the Indian market itself.</p><p>Indian government and regulators are bringing policy changes [cryptocurrency ban, demand of data localisation] that have impacted startups.</p><p>Generally, governments tend to get in the way of startups instead of helping them. It's happened everywhere. Sometimes government officials ask us, what can we do? And our general answer is: 'Please stay out of the way. Please don't do anything'. It doesn't mean we don't believe that some regulation is smart. Regulating how people deal with data and how they think about security of people and children, those are all good things.</p><p>Many times, we have firms from countries where it's difficult for entrepreneurs to get going. It's because the legal regime is not in place.</p><p>In the US, it's super easy to incorporate, to get funding, to do all those things. There's not a lot of regulation around them. You don't have to have a lawyer on staff to figure it out. When you do, it's just harder, it slows you down. It makes success less likely. So, whether the Indian government can be smart enough to stay out of the way. I don't know. Let's hope so.</p><p>In the US, the government is talking of breaking up Big Tech. The issues of tax and wages are being constantly debated in Washington...</p><p>Let me give you YC perspective: we should have such problems that our firms grow so big that the government would want to break them up. Companies you're talking about have multi-hundred-billiondollar valuations. So, again, from YC perspective, that's like it doesn't weigh on us.</p><p>Companies are not getting broken up, by the way, for anticompetitive reasons. They're not letting any startups be successful. They're being broken up because people are worried about the power they have, vis-\u00e0-vis governments, on everyday lives. I think governments are going to have difficulties. I don't know if there's a simple solution.</p><p>India has introduced differential voting rights.</p><p>What's your view on founderinvestor control?</p><p>Historically, founders who maintained control have had the best interests of their companies in mind and that's been a good thing. I think in general, it's okay. I think there's potential for differential voting rights to be abused. It's incumbent on investors to pay attention to that.

Differential board control didn't stop people from investing in Facebook. Probably, part of the reason Facebook is a strong company today is that Mark Zuckerberg was able to make the decisions he wanted.</p><p>Do you think India will have highest number of portfolio firms for YC, outside US?</p><p>It's a little hard to predict the game, but it looks like for the short term, India is likely to dominate. Next few batches for sure. We are going to start conducting interviews elsewhere, like Brazil, another big country but not as big as India population wise. India has the weight of a billion people behind it, so I think India could dominate for some time.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TOIEP-0_77_01092019011001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TOIEP2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WY7-CKN1-DXJR-H1F6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382891</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1431\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.

The hunt is being led by YC's new president, Geoff Ralston, who took over from Sam Altman in May. Before assuming the role, Ralston was a partner with the organisation for eight years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">YC has a portfolio of 2,000 firms with a combined valuation of over $150 billion. These include 20 unicorns such as Airbnb, Stripe, Dropbox, and DoorDash. Speaking to STOI at his Mountain View office in California, Ralston said India was firmly in YC's crosshairs and the accelerator was looking to fund a greater share of Indian unicorns. He touched upon traits of founders who can build billion-dollar companies, government regulation, founder-investor control, and why Indian startups offer a great opportunity.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">You returned from India after conducting onsite interviews. How did it go?</p><p>It was a bit of an experiment. We started to experiment with a few ways as we try to evolve and improve a model. So, we did something like onsite interviews, and the first place we did that is India. It went really well. We got more applications than we did before and we funded more companies than we ever have. We are going to continue doing that; it will happen this fall. It's also planned for two other locations, Tel Aviv and Paris.</p><p>We think the opportunity represented by Indian startups and founders is enormous. It's because of multiple reasons \u2014 one being that there are really smart people, the founders.</p><p>YC picked a record number of startups in summer batch in India. What's the outlook going forward?</p><p>We received a record number of applicants, around 150. Earlier, it used to be around 100. I think what happens in markets like India is there's going to be an S-curve in the development of the market and a lot of the models. The interesting thing is that because every culture is different, there will be brand new opportunities here which we didn't think of before. This is perfect for startups.</p><p>You mentioned financial services was an interesting area. Which other sectors are you interested in?</p><p>We don't look at the world that way. The winds of opportunity cause founders to open themselves and that pulls them towards us. We help them be successful. I don't want to be prescriptive. We sometimes talk about areas which we think are interesting because we want to spur ideas. But we don't want to ever be prescriptive.</p><p>You are going to conduct interviews in India again this year. Will you consider opening an office here?</p><p>No, I don't think it helps. I think you should consider us to be like Stanford. You come here for three months and you learn what we know about how to prove your probability of success. We don't have an office in India, but that has not slowed down guys at Razorpay or ClearTax [YC portfolio companies].</p><p>Which among these Indian companies could become the next unicorn?</p><p>They are all making great progress towards it. They [growth-stage companies] are all significant percentages of unicorn (laughs). My interest is that we fund as larger percentage of future Indian unicorns as we can. And that's not just self-interest. It's because we really think we help founders with ethos to build a better world. A core message to founders is that they should build something people want. But there's a deeper thing we talk about, which is trying to make a world which people want. I don't think everyone has that perspective. We think YC founders generally do.</p><p>What are the core traits you look at while selecting startups?</p><p>It's important for us to believe that the founders can build billion-dollar companies. More than having traction, having product-market fit or any other thing.</p><p>How do you spot them?</p><p>It's hard. What we do particularly well is pattern match. We've seen thousands of companies; we've funded thousands of companies. So, you get a sense, sometimes we are wrong, often more wrong. Often, we are right, but it doesn't matter. It's so hard, even if you have the right person, there's a million reasons why a startup will fail or will do okay, or it will become a billion-dollar company. We kind of get the set of traits which founders of billion-dollar companies tend to have \u2014 resourcefulness and intelligence, ability to be absolutely, 100%, committed and passionate, and self-belief. You should also be able to listen to advice. This weird, almost contradictory, sense of being sure of yourself to the point of arrogance, but not so sure that you won't listen to good advice.</p><p>SoftBank has announced its second Vision Fund. How does it impact the ecosystem in Silicon Valley or India?</p><p>I think there's a lot of money in the system now. You have to understand that vision funds are so big that the minimum cheque that they can write is $100 million. That's not having a lot of effect on seed. Our first cheque is $150,000. So, the impact of that [big funds] on us is small. If they invest the money in YC companies later, it's probably a good thing.</p><p>What effect it might have is that it will push some money early on... If there's more money in Series A and Series B, it might pump up valuations, and we are seeing some indication that valuations have moved up there.</p><p>Silicon Valley investors, like Vinod Khosla, say the quality of startups has improved in India. Do you agree?</p><p>100%. It just takes a while sometimes for the culture and the ecosystem around entrepreneurship to grow. And I think that's happening in India. I think there's more opportunity in the Indian market itself.</p><p>Indian government and regulators are bringing policy changes [cryptocurrency ban, demand of data localisation] that have impacted startups.</p><p>Generally, governments tend to get in the way of startups instead of helping them. It's happened everywhere. Sometimes government officials ask us, what can we do? And our general answer is: 'Please stay out of the way. Please don't do anything'. It doesn't mean we don't believe that some regulation is smart. Regulating how people deal with data and how they think about security of people and children, those are all good things.</p><p>Many times, we have firms from countries where it's difficult for entrepreneurs to get going. It's because the legal regime is not in place.</p><p>In the US, it's super easy to incorporate, to get funding, to do all those things. There's not a lot of regulation around them. You don't have to have a lawyer on staff to figure it out. When you do, it's just harder, it slows you down. It makes success less likely. So, whether the Indian government can be smart enough to stay out of the way. I don't know. Let's hope so.</p><p>In the US, the government is talking of breaking up Big Tech. The issues of tax and wages are being constantly debated in Washington...</p><p>Let me give you YC perspective: we should have such problems that our firms grow so big that the government would want to break them up. Companies you're talking about have multi-hundred-billiondollar valuations. So, again, from YC perspective, that's like it doesn't weigh on us.</p><p>Companies are not getting broken up, by the way, for anticompetitive reasons. They're not letting any startups be successful. They're being broken up because people are worried about the power they have, vis-\u00e0-vis governments, on everyday lives. I think governments are going to have difficulties. I don't know if there's a simple solution.</p><p>India has introduced differential voting rights.</p><p>What's your view on founderinvestor control?</p><p>Historically, founders who maintained control have had the best interests of their companies in mind and that's been a good thing. I think in general, it's okay. I think there's potential for differential voting rights to be abused. It's incumbent on investors to pay attention to that. Investors are looking for great returns, and if they believe returns are going to be great, they will invest regardless of DVR. Differential board control didn't stop people from investing in Facebook. Probably, part of the reason Facebook is a strong company today is that Mark Zuckerberg was able to make the decisions he wanted.</p><p>Do you think India will have highest number of portfolio firms for YC, outside US?</p><p>It's a little hard to predict the game, but it looks like for the short term, India is likely to dominate. Next few batches for sure. We are going to start conducting interviews elsewhere, like Brazil, another big country but not as big as India population wise. India has the weight of a billion people behind it, so I think India could dominate for some time.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TOIEP-0_103_04092019015001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TOIEP2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WYW-97F1-JB3N-T2J2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382891</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1431\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.

So, again, from YC perspective, that's like it doesn't weigh on us.</p><p>Companies are not getting broken up, by the way, for anticompetitive reasons. They're not letting any startups be successful. They're being broken up because people are worried about the power they have, vis-\u00e0-vis governments, on everyday lives. I think governments are going to have difficulties. I don't know if there's a simple solution.</p><p>India has introduced differential voting rights.</p><p>What's your view on founderinvestor control?</p><p>Historically, founders who maintained control have had the best interests of their companies in mind and that's been a good thing. I think in general, it's okay. I think there's potential for differential voting rights to be abused. It's incumbent on investors to pay attention to that. Investors are looking for great returns, and if they believe returns are going to be great, they will invest regardless of DVR. Differential board control didn't stop people from investing in Facebook. Probably, part of the reason Facebook is a strong company today is that Mark Zuckerberg was able to make the decisions he wanted.</p><p>Do you think India will have highest number of portfolio firms for YC, outside US?</p><p>It's a little hard to predict the game, but it looks like for the short term, India is likely to dominate. Next few batches for sure. We are going to start conducting interviews elsewhere, like Brazil, another big country but not as big as India population wise. India has the weight of a billion people behind it, so I think India could dominate for some time.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TOIEP-0_97_01092019019001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TOIEP2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WY7-CKN1-DXJR-H165-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382891</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1431\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.

With digitisation, the online payment system boom has catapulted into the global movement. In fact, Unified Payment Interface (UPI) transactions in the country touched a new high earlier in November 2019 - UPI clocked 1.22 billion transactions worth Rs 1.89 lakh crore for the month of November.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">IndiaStack, a set of APIs, allow governments, businesses, startups and developers to utilise a unique digital infrastructure to solve India's challenges towards cashless service delivery.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Vivek Raghavan, Chief Product Manager and biometric architect at Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), explained how IndiaStack is of paramount importance at the ThoughtWorks' annual event - ThoughtWorks Live India 2019. He spoke about how it is more than just financial inclusion, and how it can actually drive financial inclusion in the country.</p><p>Driving financial inclusion </p><p>To bring the population under a financial system, the fundamental step is that the government has to provide them the access. \"Once the population is in the system, we have to give them some useful value, to further retain them in the system,\" Vivek said, adding that this should be followed through with the introduction of the concept of data empowerment, where data enables individuals with methods that gives them access to credit.</p><p>In 2017, only 17 percent of Indians had access to some kind of bank account. By 2018, over 80 percent of Indian had access to a bank account.</p><p>If a graph is to be followed, for a country to go to 80 percent from 17 would take at least 46 years. However, India did this in seven years. And mostly, three things were responsible for this - Political Bill, a proactive central bank, and IndiaStack.</p><p>\"IndiaStack is a set of technologies that can divided into identity layers, giving every resident a unique ID, and enabling them to prove that they are actually who they claim to be,\" Vivek explained.</p><p>Solving the layers</p><p>Enabling this is India's APIs - Aadhaar, eKYC and e-sign.</p><p>In order to drive financial inclusion, IndiaStack facilitates the payment's layer - allowing anybody to pay anybody else, and not just smartphone owners. And all in an inter-operable, fast and cheap manner.</p><p>\"The UPI layer and the Aadhaar payment bridge enables these kinds of payments,\" Vivek added.</p><p>The third and new layer is the data empowerment layer, which allows people to use their data to secure access to credit.</p><p>The Aadhaar resolution</p><p>Addressing identities began in 2008. Prior to that, the number of people who had a unique identity that was acceptable throughout the country was one in 25, and it was the passport.</p><p>Aadhaar reached a billion people in just five-and-a-half years,and that too three years before the government's prediction on how soon it would happen. Ninety-five percent of all Indians, and 98 percent of Indians above the age of 18 have an Aadhaar today; that is, 1.25 billion people are enrolled in the digital identity system, with 33 billion authentications having been done.</p><p>\"More than 7.5 billion KYC transactions have been done so far, and $32.4 billion has actually been transferred directly to beneficiaries using the system. Now that people are in the financial system, you have to give them something to make them stay. The answer to that is UPI,\" Vivek said.</p><p>UPI is a way in which India actually leapfrogged most other countries to allow inter-operable payments between all banks, using a unified payment trade (for both B2B and B2C). Thus, customers have instant payments available all the time that its low-cost and inter-operable - all banks work on UPI and it's fintech friendly with a whole bunch of companies based on UPI.</p><p>Today, UPI transactions are way ahead of credit and debit card transactions. And according to Vivek, trends show that UPI is going to be the dominant way in which people transact money. </p><p>Account and data aggregation</p><p>Once the population has an identity and a payment system, how do we put it together to allow people to use this data to get access to credit and actually change what happens with the economy?</p><p>Today, big tech companies gather and retain data about their users in proprietary silos. But the issue here is that it is the companies alone that are benefiting from all this data as people are not able to benefit from their own data. </p><p>To address this, the government is introducing an account aggregator as a system to bridge this gap. An account aggregator is actually a concept that goes beyond the financial domain to facilitate the sharing of financial information in real time.</p><p>So how does it work?</p><p>There are four players - one is the resident (owner of the data), who gives consent to access the data. And then there are two sets of financial information providers - who could be a bank or mutual fund provider, somebody who has the financial information. Once the consent is given, the provider would provide information in an end-to-end encrypted fashion to the user of the financial information. This thus allows access to data APIs, which in turn, allows interoperability between all producers of financial information.</p><p>Thus, if a small business entrepreneur is a part of the digital system and has a digital footprint, it allows the business to get a micro-credit, thus inducing growth for the business.</p><p>\"With the account advocator framework, people can view their data directly from the source. It is guaranteed to be tamper-proof, low-cost, and in real time. Using this will allow lenders to build more effective models and understand the risk of lending to any individual and also create a warning system,\" Vivek said.</p><p>Accountability renders consumer financial information safe, and it makes its every usage open to audits. But, more importantly, it makes it usable for the consumers.</p><p>\"We want to move from data being used to sell things to the consumers, to data being used to empower the consumer,\" he added.</p><p>Way ahead</p><p>Now that there is access and retention through payments, the digital exhaust of these payments will need a virtuous cycle of credit to the system. Once these payments can be used to share data security, trust can be built and more users can be encouraged to come on board.</p><p>\"We have built a layered system. In the bottom, we have a bunch of government, digital, and public goods. Those are being accessed by regulated players such as banks, mutual funds, and other regulated players. Over that layer, we have the unregulated players. So now we have created an ecosystem that has a culture of innovation, through a combination of regulated and unregulated players. It's something unique that we have done in India,\" Vivek says.</p><p>Before, in the pre-digital era, there were the central banks but going ahead, big tech companies will say that they want to use a combination of blockchain and crypto wallets.</p><p>\"The approach that India has taken is both unique and is something that we can export to the world and use ourselves to digitally transform ourselves. It's also an example to the world,\" Vivek added.</p><p>(Edited by Suruchi Kapur-Gomes and Evelyn Ratnakumar)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">YRSTRY-0050679385</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">YRSTRY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XN9-VVH1-DXMP-K1JS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389309</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1185\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Yourstory.in, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Yourstory.in</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 4, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DJQC</classCode><className>CONSUMERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000569</classCode><className>ELECTRONIC BANKING</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTk5RDIyOTlFMEQzNEIxMjlBQkIyQTA4RDY2Q0QzM0U7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDJDQjg1RTk0N0RFNEQ3MkJGRTk2OUZDMEZBN0QzOTA</classCode><className>External Audits</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000570</classCode><className>ELECTRONIC BILLING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009SP3</classCode><className>ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTIyNTc4QzVERTgwNDg1MkFERTdDREZFRDQ2QjkzNDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzBDNzQyN0JENDRFNDYwMkEyNjVFRTgxNjNFRDExNUI</classCode><className>Funds Transfers</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001541</classCode><className>SECURE ONLINE TRANSACTIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp;

The laughter of kids running from dodgems to candy stalls has been replaced by the stylish steps of advertising execs sauntering from event to event.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A PR minder walks me past the deserted rides to the far side of the venue, where we enter a vast room filled with pinball machines and assorted carny games. We?(EURO)(TM)re joined by Facebook?(EURO)(TM)s global chief marketing officer Antonio Lucio, who has a youthfully enthusiastic reaction, marvelling at the weirdness of what must be one of the more unconventional interview settings in his varied career.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The fun fair is the venue for Australia?(EURO)(TM)s annual Advertising Week conference, and before we sit down, Lucio stands in front of a funny mirror that offers a stretched-out, grotesque version of the well-groomed man he actually is. It seems an apt metaphor for the challenge facing Lucio, who has been picked to bend Facebook?(EURO)(TM)s image back into a shape that doesn?(EURO)(TM)t terrify people quite as much.  </p><p>Facebook chief operations officer Sheryl Sandberg hand-picked Lucio for the business about 11 months ago following the Cambridge Analytica scandal. During a career spanning roles at Hewlett-Packard, Visa, Pepsico, Kraft Foods and Procter &amp; Gamble, Lucio has garnered a reputation as a fixer ?(EURO)\" a steady hand you can rely on when things go sour.  </p><p>One story he tells is of joining Pepsico in Latin America and almost immediately having to fire 54 per cent of the workforce because of a series of business investments that had gone south. The company was in disarray, receiving hate not only from workers, but from the broader community over the impact of the job losses.  </p><p>?(EURO)oeThat was probably one of my darkest days,?(EURO) he says.  </p><p>There?(EURO)(TM)s no pithy press statement that will change minds after a situation like that, and Lucio says it took a full two-and-a-half years of concerted work to bring shareholders, investors, workers and consumers back on side.  </p><p>?(EURO)oeChange takes time,?(EURO) he says, offering the best estimate of what lies ahead for him.  </p><p>End of apologiesTime has also been kind to Facebook since the Cambridge Analytica scandal erupted and gave the world its first social data villain.  </p><p>?(EURO)oeAlthough the scores on trust had declined post-Cambridge Analytica, we are already halfway better than what we were at the time,?(EURO) Lucio says.  </p><p>That might be true on a global, statistical level, but Facebook?(EURO)(TM)s role in the Christchurch massacre still feels too raw for many of the 2.6 million New Zealanders who use the platform daily. The anger remains, as does the fear that something similar could happen again.  </p><p>Asked why Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook didn?(EURO)(TM)t apologise after the Christchurch shooting as they did after Cambridge Analytica, the fast-talking Lucio pauses for a moment before offering a measured response.  </p><p>?(EURO)oeI believe that you only regain trust through actions and not through words,?(EURO) he says.  </p><p>?(EURO)oeTo this day, I still feel awful about what happened. I was in Palo Alto in the office late that night, talking to our teams about all the things we have to do much better to make sure this thing doesn?(EURO)(TM)t happen again. And out of that, we?(EURO)(TM)ve had some tangible actions.?(EURO)  </p><p>To many New Zealanders, those actions seemed to come too slowly from a company that built its reputation on innovating faster than anyone else. One of the most oft-cited examples of inaction was the company?(EURO)(TM)s decision not to suspend live streaming in the aftermath of the shooting. So why did Facebook decide to leave the live streams running despite the calls for action?  </p><p>?(EURO)oeMark and the company is about creating solutions that will stick as opposed to a band-aid that might or might not work,?(EURO) is Lucio?(EURO)(TM)s response.  </p><p>Facebook?(EURO)(TM)s eventual solution was to institute a one-strike policy for Facebook Watch, which will now result in users being banned from using the interface if they?(EURO)(TM)re caught doing anything that contravenes Facebook?(EURO)(TM)s rules.  </p><p>The removal of white nationalists, separatists and supremacists, and the banning of other inflammatory figures notorious for stoking racial division, are among measures Facebook took as a result of the attack.  </p><p>Former UK Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, now vice-president of global affairs for Facebook, stood with Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and French President Emmanuel Macron in signing the nine-point Christchurch Call to tackle violent content on social media.  </p><p>The signatories?(EURO)(TM) intentions were clearly in the right place, but it has now been more than two months since the document was signed and the Herald still receives tip-offs that versions of the Christchurch attack video are circulating on Facebook. And this is only one isolated example that gets attention because of its high profile. It?(EURO)(TM)s anyone?(EURO)(TM)s guess how many other deplorable films and ideas are bouncing around among the 2.7 billion users on Facebook?(EURO)(TM)s services.  </p><p>Asked whether he thinks Kiwis will ever learn to love Facebook as much as they did a few years back, Lucio says he isn?(EURO)(TM)t even thinking about that at this stage.  </p><p>?(EURO)oeWe won?(EURO)(TM)t go from mistrust to love. We want to move from mistrust to understanding. It?(EURO)(TM)s a case of getting people to say ?(EURO)~I may agree or disagree with Facebook, but I understand why they?(EURO)(TM)re making the call they?(EURO)(TM)re making?(EURO)(TM).?(EURO)  </p><p>How to fix Facebook?Admittedly, those terrible examples are the minority among the mass of content published on Facebook every day, but they?(EURO)(TM)re increasingly being used to define what the platform represents.  </p><p>Lucio doesn?(EURO)(TM)t shy away from this, conceding that Facebook needs to fix its issues with hateful content, interference in elections, fake news and data management if it has any hope of changing the views of users around the world.  </p><p>Facebook says it is getting better at removing the worst terrorist content, with its algorithms and moderators effectively wiping out 99 per cent of the propaganda coming from the likes of Isis and al-Qaeda. But this is only one puzzle ?(EURO)\" and perhaps the easiest of them all ?(EURO)\" in the elaborate digital quest Facebook is in. As it moves on to other challenges, the degree of difficulty quickly ramps up.  </p><p>Take, for example, the fact that Facebook currently puts its success rate in removing hate speech at about 65 per cent. Lucio admits that isn?(EURO)(TM)t good enough, but explains that identifying hate speech or fake news isn?(EURO)(TM)t as simple as programming an algorithm to delete anything that meets a set of requirements.  </p><p>?(EURO)oeI?(EURO)(TM)ve been with the people who are making the nuanced decisions about what is news and what is not news,?(EURO) he says.  </p><p>?(EURO)oeWhen it comes to opinion, I can guarantee that four of us may know the platform, we may know about the standards, but once we get a post, we?(EURO)(TM)ll all disagree. It?(EURO)(TM)s not black and white.?(EURO)  </p><p>Facebook has already faced a backlash over decisions to ban certain accounts, or posts from US President Donald Trump, so imagine the complexity of trying to develop a uniform set of rules that apply across the world, while remaining sensitive to the nuances in governance across borders.  </p><p>?(EURO)oeWe?(EURO)(TM)re not going to be able to do this on our own,?(EURO) Lucio says.  </p><p>?(EURO)oeNo company should be defining election interference and all these kinds of things. We need to bring in governments, academics and opinion leaders to help us sort these things out. We will take our responsibility in that, but it?(EURO)(TM)s the future of democracy that?(EURO)(TM)s at stake here.?(EURO)  </p><p>No breaking thingsSometimes, Lucio sounds like a fastidious archivist, scouring through reams of statements Zuckerberg made earlier in his career and filing them away. After all, the Facebook boss has long had his earlier statements used as evidence against him, in scathing editorials questioning whether he even cares about the impact of what he unleashed on the world. And Lucio admits that many of those comments have not aged well, even pointing the Weekend Herald to a particularly awkward example.  </p><p>?(EURO)oeMark had said at some point in his 20s that the younger generation does not believe in privacy, but now he?(EURO)(TM)s 35 and we?(EURO)(TM)re privacy first. He?(EURO)(TM)s coming of age,?(EURO) says the marketing boss.  </p><p>No quote has been a source of more consternation and criticism for Zuckerberg than Facebook?(EURO)(TM)s old motto: ?(EURO)oeMove fast and break things?(EURO). Even though the company changed that half a decade ago to the more palatable ?(EURO)oeMove fast?(EURO), Facebook?(EURO)(TM)s recent stumbles from calamity to calamity seemed to be a direct result of a culture that chased innovation regardless of cost.  </p><p>Lucio says those days at the company are over, somewhat surprisingly pointing to Facebook?(EURO)(TM)s plans to launch a cryptocurrency called Libra. He sees my scepticism, quickly adding that I wouldn?(EURO)(TM)t be the first journalist to question why the hell Facebook is making such a bold move at what is arguably the toughest crossroads in its history. But there?(EURO)(TM)s apparently logic to this madness.  </p><p>?(EURO)oeThree years ago, we would have launched it,?(EURO) he says. ?(EURO)oeIt would be out there, people would be complaining, we would have broken a couple of things here and there.  </p><p>?(EURO)oeBut this is Mark saying: ?(EURO)~No, we?(EURO)(TM)re going to write a white paper, we?(EURO)(TM)re going to publish that white paper, we?(EURO)(TM)re going to create this association and then we?(EURO)(TM)re going to face the legislators in Europe and in Washington and we?(EURO)(TM)re going to allow them to tell us everything that could [be] wrong with this?(EURO)(TM).  </p><p>?(EURO)oeAnd by the way, if there?(EURO)(TM)s no agreement that we should do this, Facebook will not go in. I don?(EURO)(TM)t know how to tell you how much of a fundamental shift that is for the company.?(EURO)  </p><p>Regulators welcomeFacebook?(EURO)(TM)s awkward embrace of regulation isn?(EURO)(TM)t restricted to its cryptocurrency ambitions. As the chorus of countries calling for regulation of other parts of its business grows, Facebook has expressed a willingness to work with governments to develop suitable frameworks. Whether this move is sincere will probably only become clearer as the rules start taking shape.  </p><p>Lucio says Facebook wants clear rules, so it knows the boundaries within which it can operate.  </p><p>?(EURO)oeWe?(EURO)(TM)re going to work closer with governments, so when something happens, we?(EURO)(TM)re going to know specifically what to do and we?(EURO)(TM)re going to be in agreement that that?(EURO)(TM)s the right thing to do,?(EURO) he says.  </p><p>Leaning on his experience at Visa, he uses the analogy of the credit card industry, which today has the reputation of being secure and safe, despite being subject to fraud.  </p><p>?(EURO)oeCredit cards are still hacked all the time, but the infrastructure has been put in place, so that people understand now that when they get hacked, they won?(EURO)(TM)t have liability and they?(EURO)(TM)ll be sent a new card.?(EURO)  </p><p>In a particularly impressive PR sidestep, Lucio even manages to see a positive in the US$5 billion ($7b) settlement Facebook recently made with the Federal Trade Commission over its use of data.  </p><p>?(EURO)oeIf we had gone the legal route, we would have paid a fraction just because of precedent,?(EURO) he says.  </p><p>?(EURO)oeBut Mark and the company decided it was an inflection and we?(EURO)(TM)re going to take advantage of this. The Government is going to tell us how we should do this, so that we have the roadmap and the plan to make the fundamental changes.?(EURO)  </p><p>A more cynical view is that this allows companies like Facebook to share the blame when things don?(EURO)(TM)t go according to plan. As long as the company operates within the confines of clearly defined rules written by the governments of the countries in which it operates, it has a defence.  </p><p>It?(EURO)(TM)s the same defence we see when any of the big tech companies are challenged for not paying enough tax: they?(EURO)(TM)re just abiding by the laws of the country involved. Which may be fair enough ?(EURO)\" ensuring that citizens are safe is partly the job of legislators, and they have dropped the ball when it comes to the sheer pace of digital advancement. In much the same way that Facebook is looking to slow down and rethink the way it operates, perhaps lawmakers need to move a bit faster, to keep laws relevant in a changing online world.  </p><p>Christchurch again?A question many have asked since Christchurch is whether we can avoid this ever happening again, on a platform as big and unwieldy as Facebook.  </p><p>?(EURO)oeThat?(EURO)(TM)s a very challenging question,?(EURO) admits Lucio, framing it in even bigger terms by asking whether we can eradicate crime. ?(EURO)oeNo, you are not going to be able to eradicate it, because there will always be creative minds who will try to figure things out. This is going to be a forever battle.?(EURO)  </p><p>He says that it?(EURO)(TM)s not Facebook?(EURO)(TM)s size that is the problem, but rather the motivations of the people using it.  </p><p>?(EURO)oeThere are significant incentives for people to use the platform for good and there are significant incentives to use it for bad. There?(EURO)(TM)s a lot of impact and a lot of money that can be made on it.?(EURO)  </p><p>Facebook is really just a mirror of who we are, and that plays out every day. While environmentalists encourage people to remove three pieces of plastic every time they visit the beach, Donald Trump?(EURO)(TM)s campaign is selling hundreds of thousands of plastic straws on the premise that ?(EURO)oeliberal paper straws don?(EURO)(TM)t work?(EURO). And while charitable organisations fight bullying, an Ipsos report late last year found New Zealand has the third highest rate of cyber bullying in the world.  </p><p>This duality of Facebook is what makes it such an uncomfortable presence in our daily lives. For all the good it may do, the bad moments really stand out because of how effectively they?(EURO)(TM)re amplified across the world.  </p><p>It?(EURO)(TM)s reminiscent of Jordan Peele?(EURO)(TM)s 2019 psychological movie thriller Us, which also played out in a carnival setting and told the story of humanity?(EURO)(TM)s darker side lurking under the surface. That?(EURO)(TM)s not going to change. The only thing that can change is how we react when that darker side steps out of the carnival into our otherwise peaceful digital world.  </p><p>?-Damien Venuto travelled to Sydney courtesy of Facebook</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NZHRLD-NZHBdvface</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NZHRLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WPX-67X1-JDK8-V2R3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">257912</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2477\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The New Zealand Herald All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New Zealand Herald</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 3, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002IE1</classCode><className>MONDELEZ INTERNATIONAL INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002DBA</classCode><className>PEPSICO INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002KLJ</classCode><className>HP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0001RPG</classCode><className>PROCTER &amp;

But last week's resignations from CEOs who run two of the most valuable start-ups share common roots: a Silicon Valley spirit bent on disrupting existing industries and seeking torrid growth.</p><p><br/>Juul's chief executive, Kevin Burns, was replaced on Wednesday as regulators plan to remove most vaping products from the market, citing concerns about the growing use of teenagers. A day earlier, WeWork co-founder Adam Neumann resigned under pressure as CEO of the office leasing company that started nearly a decade ago, after investor concerns about its management and growing losses disrupted a planned initial public offering.<br/>These new companies, along with Uber Technologies Inc. and others, were able to raise billions of dollars from products and services that changed the habits of the world: how we work, smoke and move. Facing well-funded rivals with similar ideas, they pushed to gain market share quickly and show investors that they could master their newly created niches. But along the way they ended up clashing with regulators, surprising investors with questionable corporate governance or entangled in crisis.<br/>This week's events, two years after Travis Kalanick was kicked out of Uber after a series of scandals, suggest that Facebook Inc.'s old mantra of \"moving fast and breaking things\" is not as reliable a formula for long-term success as some at once it seemed. That philosophy has been partly enabled by capital.<br/>As big tech companies have reached stratospheric valuations, investors have flooded Silicon Valley with money, chasing the next big thing. The tide of capital, heightened by low interest rates, and the success of founder-led companies such as Facebook and Amazon.com Inc. have given start-ups unprecedented influence over their investors.<br/>U.S. companies backed by private companies grossed a record $137 billion last year and are on track to match that year, according to data firm PitchBook. In an environment where there is so much money, the founders take the lead. \"Corporate governance has deteriorated at the pace of the increase in available capital from people who have traditionally not been sources of capital from private companies,\" says Adam J. Epstein, CEO corporate governance advisor and their boards of directors. Investors \"have to play well to be allowed to participate in these agreements.\"<br/>Extreme behaviors<br/>The visions of WeWork, Juul and Uber were all different. Neumann of WeWork stated that his company would fundamentally change the way people work and interact. Kalanick of Uber promised to end the car ownership and change the way people move. But there is an inherent danger that part of the sale is \"history,\" says Aswath Damodaran, a professor of finance at New York University's Stern School of Business.<br/>\"It stems from the fact that value is based on a personality, rather than a business, and when personality stumbles or acts in a way that is unreliable, the unbridled story can quickly turn into a story of collapse, where the ingredients are mix,\" he wrote either month on his blog.<br/>Juul and We are the most visible examples of extreme behavior \"because there are most of the zeros involved,\" Steve Blank said,adjunct professor at Stanford University and mentor of startups and venture capitalists. \"When capital is flush, people who get the capital can make the rules.\" \"This is the result of unrestricted capitalism,\" he said.<br/>Blank added that the decline in IPOs and the reduced focus on management credentials have undermined the need for some kind of adult supervision. \"Instead, this growth capital is a substitute for public markets, without any discipline,\" he said.<br/>The entry WeWork and Juul show the disadvantages of The Silicon Valley success formula was first published in The Third.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-8780197</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X5N-73B1-JBJN-M0N1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"646\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 30, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

WeWork is losing $219,000 hourly. In 2018, the company's losses and revenues both doubled, to $1.9 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. As WeWork moves toward an initial public offering, it will need to convince investors that it's a worthwhile long-term investment and could survive an economic downturn despite its losses. </p><p>Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[2]. WeWork[3], the 9-year-old coworking startup now operating under the We Company[4] umbrella of companies, may have a whopping $47 billion valuation, but it's hemorrhaging money: $219,000 every hour of every day during the 12 months leading up to March, according to the Financial Times[5]. In 2018, WeWork's losses and revenue both doubled[6], to $1.9 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, according to FT. Though the company in March projected $3 billion in revenue in the next year, it lost $700 million in the first quarter of 2019. In April, CEO Adam Neumann announced WeWork confidentially filed initial-public-offering paperwork in December as the We Company[7], which also includes Neumann's coliving venture, WeLive, and the \"conscious entrepreneurial school\" WeGrow[8]. As the company moves toward an IPO, it will need to convince investors that its significant growth makes it a worthwhile long-term investment despite equally large losses. SoftBank[9] CEO Masayoshi Son is the major investor in WeWork and a mentor to Neumann (his wife, Rebekah, refers to Son as \"Yoda\"[10]). Son has invested more than $10 billion in WeWork. In December, Softbank was expected to invest $16 billion in WeWork but ended up investing only $6 billion, with $1 billion of that going toward existing shares, prompting renewed scrutiny of its business model. Uncertainty about WeWork can be boiled down to three concerns: the stability of its model (pairing long-term office leases with short-term occupants and what that might look like during a recession), its categorization (should WeWork be compared against tech companies or real-estate companies), and the wild card that is Neumann.  New York magazine's Intelligencer published a profile[11] of Neumann in June, depicting the CEO as zany and idealistic. Neumann forbid employees from expensing meals containing meat last summer. His commencement speech at Baruch College in 2017 recounted his early years in New York City, which he spent clubbing and \"hitting on every girl in the city.\"  When asked about his personal superpower, Neumann brought up a character from the TV show Heroes (\"Neumann neglected to mention that this was the show's villain: a serial killer who murdered people to get their powers,\"Reeves Wiedeman wrote for New York magazine.)  A surfing fan, he has seemingly blurred the lines between his personal interests and WeWork's, investing on behalf of the company in a wave-pool startup called WaveGarden and the big-wave surfer Laird Hamilton's so-called superfood startup, which sells things like \"performance mushrooms,\" powdered coconut water infused with beets and turmeric, and highly caffeinated coffee[12]. And yet, Neumann's ambition and salesmanship are the force that has skyrocketed his company to a nearly $50 billion valuation in under a decade. \"There are hundreds of co-working companies around the world, but what has long distinguished WeWork is Neumann's insistence that his is something bigger,\" Wiedeman wrote. According to WeWork's website, the company has 743 coworking sites open and coming soon in 124 cities in more than 36 countries. FT reported that WeWork has 485 offices and was in 105 cities as of the first quater of 2019; New York magazine reported that the company has 12,000 employees. WeWork is the largest[13] private office tenant in Manhattan.NOW WATCH: 23 useful iPhone tricks and hidden features to make your life easier[14]See Also: eBay is trolling Amazon over last year's Prime

The SEC is reportedly \"reviewing\" WeWork[3]'s business and its disclosures to stakeholders in the weeks leading up to its failed attempt to go public. Bloomberg reported that the SEC inquiry is preliminary, and that it may not lead to any allegations of wrongdoing. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[4] WeWork has drawn the attention of the US Securities and Exchange Commission after its failed attempt to go public, Bloomberg's Matt Robinson, Robert Schmidt, and Ellen Huet first reported Friday.[5] The office-sharing startup is facing federal scrutiny of its business and its disclosures to investors in the weeks leading up to its attempted IPO, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. </p><p>Bloomberg reports that the SEC inquiry is preliminary, and that it may not lead to any allegations of wrongdoing. It also notes the SEC has been known to \"kick the tires\" of embattled companies in the public eye. WeWork cancelled its planned IPO in late September shortly after ousting its chief executive, Adam Neumann, amid concerns from investors that the business wasn't as profitable as it initially claimed and that Neumann's controversial leadership style was putting the company's future in peril. WeWork was once privately valued at $47 billion, but that number has since fallen to a fraction of that, leading the company to negotiate a rescue deal with SoftBank that gave the investor control of the startup. According to Bloomberg[6], WeWork has retained Wall Street lawyer and former SEC enforcer Andrew Ceresney as it faces scrutiny from the SEC. Spokespeople for WeWork and the SEC both declined to comment. A spokesperson for Ceresney's law firm, Debevoise ...impton, was not immediately available to comment. SoftBank has installed Marcelo Claure[7] as WeWork's new chairman, who will oversee the company along with its two co-CEOs, Sebastian Gunningham and Artie Minson[8], who replaced Neumann. The company is reportedly seeking a high-profile permanent CEO. Among the candidates being considered is T-Mobile CEO John Legere, according to The Wall Street Journal[9]. CNBC[10] has since reported that Legere is not the leading candidate, citing a source familiar with the matter. WeWork lost $1.3 billion in the third quarter as it was trying to go public, according to an earning presentation viewed by Business Insider[11]. The losses are reflective of Neumann's growth-heavy strategy. WeWork would reportedly have run out of money by mid-November if not for a $9.5 billion bailout from Softbank[12].Read the full report over at Bloomberg.[13] NOW WATCH: Watch Google reveal the new

Read the full story here.</emphasis></p><p>This was meant to be the moment that <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SoftBank</emphasis>\u2019s <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Masayoshi Son</emphasis> would confirm his investment genius to the world.</p><p>Critics of his $97bn <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Vision Fund</emphasis> and its subsequent technology spending spree were supposed to be silenced by the conviction of public markets. A handful of the fund\u2019s biggest bets were set to list, allowing SoftBank to finalise plans to raise an even larger second Vision Fund.</p><p>But markets have not proven kind to several of Son\u2019s investments this year. Even with the troubled stock market debuts of some of SoftBank\u2019s bets \u2014 think ride-hailing app <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Uber</emphasis> \u2014 investors have zeroed in on one company that has drawn billions of dollars in seed money from the Japanese telecoms-to-technology group: <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WeWork</emphasis>.</p><p>On Monday the market scepticism over WeWork reached unseen heights, prompting the company\u2019s executives and board to meet to shelve its hotly anticipated initial public offering. Advisers at <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JPMorgan Chase</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Goldman Sachs</emphasis> were not-so quietly warning the company that it was in for a particularly painful listing process, DD has learnt.</p><p>Now, we\u2019ve focused quite a bit on the travails at WeWork in recent days. But the company is invariably linked to SoftBank and the Vision Fund, and several of the investments that the two have backed have struggled this year. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Slack</emphasis> shares, which surged as high as $42 a share after its IPO, are now back down at $26. Uber remains below its IPO price and WeWork, as you already know, was targeting a cut-price valuation of between $15bn and $18bn in its IPO, a far cry from the $47bn it earned earlier this year.</p><p>You wouldn\u2019t know by looking at SoftBank\u2019s public statements, which show the Vision Fund investments performing strongly, that the company could be forced to swallow huge writedowns:</p><p>Looking deeper into the SoftBank Vision Fund portfolio, there are more questions to be asked. Critics say it\u2019s impossible to verify how SoftBank attributes valuations to companies it invests in.</p><p>Consider<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Oyo</emphasis>, the fast-growing Indian hotel chain founded by <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ritesh Agarwal</emphasis>. In the first quarter, SoftBank attributed part of its near-$4bn valuation gain in the Vision Fund to its investment in Oyo, which doubled in value from $5bn to $10bn.</p><p>The biggest investor at the higher valuation was none other than Agarwal, whose share purchase had been funded by a consortium of Japanese financial groups that count SoftBank among their biggest clients.</p><p>All of this puts serious doubts on <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Vision Fund II</emphasis>. Bloomberg News reports that Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, which put up $45bn for the first fund, is only planning to reinvest profits into the new fund.</p><p>However, DD understands that is premature and no decision has yet been taken by Riyadh.</p><p>The derailment of WeWork\u2019s IPO has only compounded issues for Son and his plans for Vision Fund II. After all, many of the initial backers of the new technology fund made non-binding commitments to invest. The question on everyone\u2019s mind: are those investors still standing by Son\u2019s side? Stay tuned.</p><p>Want more on SoftBank and WeWork? Listen to our latest Behind the Money podcast with DD\u2019s Arash Massoudi and Eric Platt.\u00a0</p><p>Chinese dealmaking comes full circle</p><p>What happened to the European software developer hoovered up by the Chinese wire maker? Or the gaming group bought by the Chinese iron miner?</p><p>Many of the international assets caught up in China\u2019s unyielding global dealmaking binge in 2016 have returned to the market this year.</p><p>At the peak in 2016, Chinese groups struck more than $200bn in overseas deals, according to Dealogic data. So far this year, China Inc has agreed to buy a paltry $35bn in international assets, yet it has disposed of about $40bn, becoming a net seller of overseas assets for the first time since it began buying in a big way. Check out the FT story here.</p><p>Is anyone surprised? The investment bankers and lawyers that designed many of the original deals certainly aren\u2019t.</p><p>Back in 2016, it appeared that Chinese companies were scooping up companies for the sake of buying rather than anything else. Mining groups were snapping up foreign gaming companies; chemical producers were looking at film studios in Los Angeles; one provincial airline, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HNA Group</emphasis>, was purchasing tens of billions of dollars in hotel and banking assets; a handful of tycoons were buying European football teams \u2014 and the binge was fuelled by unsustainable debt.</p><p>There are some familiar brands landing on the market as part of the $40bn worth of asset sales this year. The ocean theme park <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Seaworld </emphasis>and the UK travel company <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Abercrombie &amp; Kent</emphasis> were both exited by property developer <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Zhonghong</emphasis>, which has defaulted in China. Famously, Zhonghong also looked at <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DreamWorks Animation </emphasis>and elderly care group <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brookdale</emphasis>.</p><p>Many lawyers argue today that Chinese companies and the government have learnt some important lessons over the past half decade, and that Chinese global dealmaking, although at a low not seen in a decade, is returning to a sustainable pace.</p><p>Court crowns Saudi prince winner of Sheffield United</p><p/><p>It was a match that had to be settled off the pitch.</p><p>A Saudi prince has secured full ownership of <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Premier League</emphasis> club <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sheffield United</emphasis> after a two-year legal battle that was put to an end by a ruling from the UK High Court on Monday.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Prince Abdullah Bin Mosaad Bin Abdulaziz al-Saud</emphasis>, a grandson of the late <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">King Abdulaziz</emphasis>, and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Kevin McCabe</emphasis>, an English property developer and boyhood fan \u2014 each with a 50 per cent stake \u2014 have been locked in a dispute over the Yorkshire club\u2019s ownership.</p><p>Back in 2013, McCabe sold a 50 per cent stake in the club for \u00a31 to<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> UTB LLC</emphasis> \u2014 a company controlled by Prince Abdullah, a member of the Saudi royal family.</p><p>Prince Abdullah agreed to inject \u00a310m into the football team over two years as part of an investment strategy designed to turn the lossmaking club round and reach the Premier League. The original contract also stipulated that he could acquire the rest of the shares owned by McCabe\u2019s family for \u00a35m.</p><p>Sheffield returned to the Premier League this season, but the two co-owners had fallen out over a \u201cdisagreement about funding\u201d, which led to further disputes. McCabe wanted the deal struck in 2013 to be voided and for the Saudi prince to sell his shares back to the English businessman.</p><p>The High Court decided that the contract should be enforced. McCabe, who said he was \u201cbitterly disappointed\u201d, hasn\u2019t ruled out an appeal.</p><p>Full story here from the FT\u2019s Murad Ahmed.</p><p>Job moves</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Cryan</emphasis>, former chief executive of <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Deutsche Bank</emphasis>,is to take over as chairman of <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Man Group</emphasis> after<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Ian Livingston</emphasis> announced his intention to quit the world\u2019s largest listed hedge fund group after less than four years in the role.

Now his former chief of staff, Medina Bardhi, has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytdealbookconference.com/\">accused him of discrimination</url>, writes David Yaffe-Bellany of the NYT.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> When Ms. Bardhi became pregnant, she was replaced by a man who was paid more than twice as much as her, she says in a complaint filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in New York.</p><p> When she returned, she was given a role with no clear responsibility.</p><p> Eventually, Ms. Bardhi got her job back. But when she became pregnant a second time, the cycle repeated, she said, with a male employee again hired to replace her, and she found herself sidelined when she returned to work.</p><p> \u201cAs Mr. Neumann and Ms. Bardhi drove back from the offices of JPMorgan Chase on Sept. 16, the complaint said, Mr. Neumann said to her, \u2018I hope you enjoyed your vacation,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Yaffe-Bellany writes.</p><p>The actions she described run counter to Mr. Neumann\u2019s pledges to elevate women in the workplace. \u201cWe like to say that right now we\u2019re bringing in the most talented women in the world at an early stage,\u201d he said in a 2017 interview. \u201cWe\u2019re going to grow them all as leaders.\u201d</p><p>Ms. Bardhi asked the E.E.O.C. to file a class-action suit against WeWork on behalf of herself and \u201csimilarly situated female employees,\u201d <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytdealbookconference.com/\">Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson of the FT reports</url>.</p><p>A WeWork spokeswoman denied the charges, saying that the company would \u201cvigorously defend itself.\u201d</p><p>Juul\u2019s meltdown will cost Altria $4.5 billion</p><p>The tobacco giant Altria Group announced yesterday that it would <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytdealbookconference.com/\">write down its 35 percent stake</url> in the vaping company Juul by $4.5 billion, Katie Robertson of the NYT reports.</p><p>Altria invested $12.8 billion in Juul last year, at a $38 billion valuation. It now values the e-cigarette maker at about $24 billion. The tobacco company blamed recent bans on vaping across the U.S. and the \u201cincreased likelihood\u201d that the F.D.A. would \u201cremove flavored e-vapor products from the market.\u201d</p><p>Juul has come under intense scrutiny amid growing outrage over vaping among teens and a spate of mysterious lung illnesses that have been linked to e-cigarettes. (The C.D.C. said yesterday that there have <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytdealbookconference.com/\">now been 1,888 illnesses and 37 deaths</url> tied to vaping in the U.S.) The U.S. attorney\u2019s office in San Francisco, the F.D.A. and the F.T.C. are all investigating Juul\u2019s marketing.</p><p>Juul replaced its C.E.O., Kevin Burns, last month, with an Altria executive, K.C. Crosthwaite, to contain the damage. But even that move has come under scrutiny: The F.T.C. is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytdealbookconference.com/\">investigating if Altria played a role in that decision</url>.</p><p> Altria is \u201ccommitted to Juul\u2019s success,\u201d its chairman and C.E.O., Howard Willard, said yesterday.</p><p>Leon Cooperman takes on Elizabeth Warren</p><p>Escalating tensions between the billionaire money manager Leon Cooperman and Senator Elizabeth Warren about her pledge to overhaul Wall Street <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytdealbookconference.com/\">have burst out in a letter</url> that he wrote to her, according to Kate Kelly and Shane Goldmacher of the NYT.</p><p>This all started when Mr. Cooperman predicted that stocks would fall 25 percent if Ms. Warren were elected president. (The senator wants to crack down on private equity, break up big banks and tax the wealthy.) Ms. Warren hit back, saying that Mr. Leon should \u201cpitch in a bit more so everyone else has a chance at the American dream, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour vilification of the rich is misguided,\u201d Mr. Cooperman wrote in a letter made public yesterday. \u201cFor you to suggest that capitalism is a dirty word and that these people, as a group, are ingrates who didn\u2019t earn their riches \u2026 and now don\u2019t pull their weight societally indicates that you either are grossly uninformed or are knowingly warping the facts.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Cooperman argued that many entrepreneurs, including himself, started off with little and often shared their wealth with needier people. He also questioned the assumptions on which Ms. Warren\u2019s tax policies are based, and suggested she focus on income opportunity, rather than income inequality.</p><p>But Ms. Warren has welcomed attacks from Wall Street \u201cas a signal of her populist credibility and as a rallying cry for small donors,\u201d Ms. Kelly and Mr. Goldmacher write.</p><p>Big problems at SoftBank\u2019s Vision Fund</p><p>As SoftBank confronts a tough challenge in fixing one of its biggest investments, WeWork \u2014 see above \u2014 it also faces renewed scrutiny of its $100 billion Vision Fund. And that is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytdealbookconference.com/\">uncovering a lot of problems</url>, Liz Hoffman and Bradley Hope of the WSJ find.</p><p>Much of the responsibility falls on Rajeev Misra, the former Deutsche Bank executive who leads the Vision Fund. A taster of his personality from the WSJ article: \u201cHe pads around the Vision Fund\u2019s London headquarters barefoot, often chewing on betel nuts, a mild stimulant. He recently changed the layout of his office after consulting his astrologer.\u201d</p><p>The Vision Fund has developed a host of problems under his watch:</p><p> \u201cInvestment decisions often are made in minutes, said people familiar with its operations.\u201d</p><p> \u201cA consultant\u2019s report last year quoted employees describing a \u2018chaotic\u2019 and \u2018personality driven\u2019 firm with few controls, where people are \u2018incentivized to gamble to look good\u2019 and build their own personal brands.\u201d</p><p> \u201cOn several occasions, separate investment teams discussed investing in the same company on different terms.\u201d</p><p> \u201cAll in, the Vision Fund invested $4.4 billion in WeWork \u2014 a stake it now expects to write down by $3 billion, according to a person familiar with the plan.\u201d</p><p> Several other investments are underwater, including those in Uber; Wag, an on-demand dog-walking service; and Plenty, an indoor vertical-farming start-up. And Katerra, a home builder that the Vision Fund has backed, has reportedly had to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytdealbookconference.com/\">pull out of projects</url> and lay off employees.</p><p>Several investors have walked away from SoftBank\u2019s second Vision Fund, the WSJ adds, including funds associated with Singapore, Taiwan and Koch Industries.</p><p>Mr. Misra is now being more cautious, the WSJ adds. The Vision Fund won\u2019t make outsized bets on individual companies anymore, and it will slow down its pace of investments.</p><p>More: Masa Son, SoftBank\u2019s chief, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytdealbookconference.com/\">appeared to briefly fall asleep</url> onstage at Saudi Arabia\u2019s recent investment conference.</p><p>Fiat and Peugeot have their work cut out</p><p>The two automakers succeeded in announcing a plan to combine yesterday, which analysts welcomed. But there are <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytdealbookconference.com/\">plenty of hurdles to overcome</url> if the combination is to succeed.</p><p>Fiat and Peugeot need to increase sales across the world, especially in China. Fiat is heavily reliant on North America, as its quarterly financial results yesterday showed. And both companies count too much on sales in Europe, whose car market is stagnant.</p><p>They must cut manufacturing capacity in Europe. Fiat\u2019s factories in Italy<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytdealbookconference.com/\">ran at 57 percent capacity</url> last year, according to an analysis cited by the WSJ, while its plants in the U.S. ran at 88 percent. But       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytdealbookconference.com/\">powerful labor unions</url> in Italy and France may prevent the companies from cutting too many jobs.</p><p>And they need to create new best-sellers, particularly on the Fiat side. Fiat\u2019s luxury brands, Alfa Romeo and Maserati, have struggled in recent years, forcing that company to consider dropping slow-selling models and even withdrawing the Alfa brand from some markets.</p><p>But analysts think the merger still makes sense. The deal is \u201cgreat on a spreadsheet, but tricky to execute,\u201d Philippe Houchois, an analyst at Jefferies, wrote in a recent research note. But he still said the logic supporting the transaction was \u201coverwhelming.\u201d</p><p>Deutsche Bank flagged its own Russian deal as suspicious</p><p>After German officials at the bank decided last year to move ahead with the $72 million sale of a California office complex to the son of a former top Kremlin official, employees in the U.S. took a rare step: They <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytdealbookconference.com/\">reported the transaction to the U.S. authorities</url>, Charlie Savage and David Enrich of the NYT write.</p><p>U.S. bank executives raised objections to the proposed transaction. They warned that, while not illegal, it could further damage Deutsche Bank\u2019s reputation, which had already taken a beating from a federal investigation into the bank\u2019s role in Russian money laundering.</p><p>Frankfurt executives went ahead. But shortly after, the U.S executives filed a suspicious activity report about the deal with the Treasury Department\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.</p><p>Deutsche Bank said it conducted due diligence on the sale and didn\u2019t find any evidence that it would violate laws against money laundering or sanctions. The only issue was one of reputational risk, which a spokesman told the NYT the bank would have faced whether it halted the sale or moved forward with it.</p><p>Revolving door</p><p>Apple<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytdealbookconference.com/\">promoted several executives</url> to vice president, including Paul Meade, Jon Andrews, Gary Geaves and Kaiann Drance.

The banking space would also include both traditional players with strong customer base and new technology led players.''India is increasingly populated by Fintech firms which are contributing to ease of doing transactions and improve credit assessments. </p><p>But the regulator continues to prefer banks over the innovators because of the wider financial stability issues and their capital positions.The governor also issued a word of warning for the traditional banks. The emergence of big tech companies into the financial services landscape of the country, he warned, will pose a challenge for these traditional lenders if they don't modify business models in line with the changing technology realities of the time.\"Banks are not only facing competition from Fintech companies but also from large technology companies (BigTechs) which are entering into financial services industry in a big way, said Das addressing an industry gathering at Mint's Annual banking conclave here on Monday.The low-cost nature of their businesses and the use of big data to assess the riskiness of borrowers and thereby reducing the need for collateral these big Tech businesses can easily be scaled up to provide basic financial services to the unbanked population, he said.\"These developments pose a challenge to banks as well as banking regulators,\" Das said. \"All these mean that the future of banking will not be a continuation of the past. We would see a very different banking sector, in terms of structure and business model, in the coming years.\"Typically, big tech companies include US based Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple. The financial services arms of these companies are already making significant headway into the business subsets of India's banking industry such as payments and money management.The answer, governor Das said, for state run banks would be to increase synergies in workforces, branches and operations to \"meet the future challenges.\" \"The focus has to be on ushering in significant improvements in efficiency and rationalisation of scarce capital to meet the capital adequacy requirements,\" said Das. \"Investments in technology and skill building has to be stepped up. Bigger and agile banks may be able to reposition themselves with better branding exercises, backed by improved technology, skills and business models.\" For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECOTMS-74287936</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECOTMS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y8W-18J1-DXJR-H43S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">362627</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"566\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.

Scott Galloway, the best-selling author,[3] well-known tech-industry pundit, and professor of marketing atNew York University's Stern School of Business, unleashed his special kind of wit and financial weaponry on WeWork's recent S-1 filing.  Writing on his \"No Mercy / No Malice\" blog[4], Galloway says any Wall Street analyst who believes WeWork's worth over $10 billion is \"lying, stupid, or both.\" WeWTF Really? Really?</p><p> I've started nine firms and I'm, generously, 3-4-2 (win-lose-tie). In retrospect, and I think about this a lot, the only reliable forward-looking indicator of our firm's success or failure was timing. Specifically, the part of the economic cycle at founding. The firms we started in recessions had an easier time finding talent, controlling costs, and getting immediate feedback about if this thing worked as clients/consumers held their purse strings closed. Then, armed with a battle-tested value proposition, as the recession ended, we enjoyed the afterburner of confidence to spend more and try new things. #disco. In frothy markets, it's easy to enter into a consensual hallucination, with investors and markets, that you're creating value. And it's easy to wallpaper over the shortcomings of the business with a bull market's halcyon: cheap capital. WeWork has brought new meaning to the wordwallpaper. This is more reminiscent of the cheap marbled panelling you'd find inMike Brady's[5]home office \u2014 panelling whose mucilaginous coating will dissipate at the first whiff of a recession, revealing a family of raccoons or the mummified corpses of drug mules. The features of seventies sitcom panelling: Cult WeWork's prospectus has a dedication (no joke): \"We dedicate this to the power of We \u2014 greater than any one of us, but inside each of us.\" Pretty sureJim Jones[6]had t-shirts printed up with this inspiring missive. Speaking of idolatry, \"Adam\" (as in Neumann) is mentioned 169 times, vs. an average of 25 mentions for founder/CEOs in other unicorn prospectuses. Uber's CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, is mentioned 29 times in their prospectus. Granted, \"Adam\" is super dreamy, in sort of an Argentinian polo player way (he's Israeli). But he's not 6x dreamier than Dara, who has a whole 'Omar Sharif[7], if he went to Brown' thing going on. But I digress. We's mission is \"to elevate the world's consciousness.\" Maybe, but it's clear the mission of the prospectus is to dampen our consciousness ahead of the sh*tshow that is \"The Story of Us: We.\"  Nomenclature Find the hottest sector, and if you don't have the insight, IP, genius, capital, code, skills, human capital, or a clue, then just borrow the words. SAAS firms trade at a multiple of revenues (yay), vs. real estate firms, which trade at a multiple of EBITDA (boo). So, We isn't a real estate firm renting desks, it's a Space as a Service (SAAS) firm. I know, use the word \"technology\" over and over, despite having little R...nd computers and stuff, and voil we're Salesforce. Today I froze water and used this technology to reconfigure the environment encapsulating my Zacapa and Coke. So, I'm Bill Gates. Better yet, today I began calling my wife Gisele, which I'm pretty sure means I'm the starting QB for the Pats. At WeWTF, you're not a guest, but a member.Memberhas a more 'recurring revenue' sound to it. So, I plan to be a member tomorrow night at the Marriott in Boston, where I will then get membership to the TD Center so I can watch a 21-year-old Canadian (Shawn Mendes) with my 8-year-old son \u2014 also a member of the Marriott and TD Center, for tomorrow at least. Invented Metrics GAAP accounting standards got you down? No problema at WeWTF. We has begun reporting \"Community-based EBITDA[8],\" profitability before the BITDA, but is also taking out expenses, including real-estate, that comprise the bulk of cost required to deliver the service. A more honest description of the metric would be \"EBEE, Earnings Before Everything Else.\" As someone who follows stocks and goes on TV to pretend I have any idea which direction a given stock is going, I'd like to suggest a few metrics to provide insight into We: EBG[9], Earnings Before Gluten  EBBG, Earnings Before the Big Dawg (tennis balls, pig's ears, etc.)  EBEPW, Earnings Before Equal Pay for Women  Red Flags My goddaughter informed me she's dating a club promoter, a red flag. Occasionally, red flags marry each other, the Biebs and Hailey Baldwin \u2014 what could go wrong? So now, imagine red flags the dimensions of Kansas. Buckle up: \u2014 Adam Neumann hassold $700 million in stock[10]. As a founder, I've sold shares into a secondary offering to get some liquidity and diversify holdings. Ok, I get it. But 3/4 of a billion dollars? This is 700 million red flags that spell words on the field of a football field at halftime: \"Get me the hell out of this stock, but YOU should buy some.\"  \u2014 Gross margins are a pretty decent proxy for how good or bad a business is. And this is a sh**ty business:    \u2014 Adam has several family members working in the business who make 'less than $200,000.\"  \u2014 The ownership structure chart is similar to a hieroglyphic on a cave wall about the survival of the species: Harvest the crops when the sun is high in the horizon, do not venture over the hills, hostile tribes live there, and don't buy this stock. The corporate governance structure of WeWTF makes Chinese firms look American, pre-big tech.    \u2014 The related party section of this prospectus reads like the Trump administration. Adamowns 10 buildings[11], several that he leased to WeWTF at a handsome profit. Adam also owned the rights to the \"We\" trademark, which the firm decided they must own andpaid the founder/CEO[12]$5.9 million for the rights. The rights to a name nearly identical to the name of the firm where he's the founder/CEO and largest shareholder.  YOU. CAN'T. MAKE. THIS. SH*T. UP.  \u2014 Mismatched durations. The founder of Kohlberg Capital, Jim Kohlberg (total gangster), taught me investment firms go out of business because of \"mismatched durations.\" It's about raising money short (customers who can stop buying your product service soon/tomorrow) and investing money long (10-year leases). WeWTF is an especially risky business going into a recession, when the ability to variabilize costs is limited, but revenue decline is unlimited. WeWTF has $47 billion in long-term obligations (leases) and will do $3 billion in revenue this year. What could go wrong?  There are other businesses like this (real estate, Hertz), and they are good businesses. Businesses that trade at, I don't know, 0.5 to 2x revenues. However, WeWTF is claiming it's not in this neighborhood, or even the same planet. So, let's talk valuation. Insane. Seriously loco. Ok, let's assume WeWTF is onto something, better than peer IWG or Hertz. But is this firm, trading at 26x revenues, superior to Amazon, which trades at 4x revenues? There appears to be no scale effects, as losses have kept pace with revenue growth. There is little pricing power, as they are still a mole on the elephant of commercial real estate. There is no defensible IP, no technology, no regulatory moats, no network effects, and noflywheel effect[13](the ancillary businesses are stupid, just stupid). The last round$47 billion[14]\"valuation\" is an illusion. SoftBank invested at this valuation with a \"pref,\" meaning their money is the first money out, limiting the downside. The suckers, idiots, CNBC viewers, great Americans, and people trying to feel young again who buy on the first trade \u2014 or after \u2014 don't have this downside protection. Similar to the DJIA, last-round private valuations are harmful metrics that create the illusion of prosperity. The bankers (JPM and Goldman) stand to register$122 million in fees[15]flinging feces at retail investors visiting the unicorn zoo. Any equity analyst who endorses this stock above a $10 billion valuation is lying, stupid, or both. Adam's wife is Gwyneth Paltrow's cousin, meaning Adam is two degrees removed from Goop, an assault on humanity. Ms. Neumann created controversy when she went onCNBC[16]and said: 'A big part of being a woman is to help men [like Adam] manifest their calling in life.' Ok, fine whatever works for you and Adam. But it's not retail investors' role to help Adam realize his calling \u2014 he should feel pretty manifested with $700 million. The panelling is compelling and cool, but it's beginning to curl and the substance behind the wood veneer stinks. I mean, stinks. * * * Follow Galloway on Twitter at@profgalloway[17].

But this is not a typical election year. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With COVID-19 wreaking havoc on the economy, the election appears secondary to other macroeconomic forces at stake. At least for right now. </p><p>\"Markets have registered a 'could care less'\" about the election so far, said Scott Colyer, CEO at Advisors Asset Management. \"Over 45% of GDP is now government spending. That bridge is going to extend for a long time...I think we're going to live with this for awhile. I'm not sure the election really matters that much.\"<br/><br/></p><p>Big Tech specifically -- which makes up an outsized chunk of the market -- could find a somewhat different environment if  . Regulation of the sector could materialize. But that's not necessarily a bad thing, added John Freeman, vice president of equity research at CFRA. </p><p>\"We do see legislation in a Biden-Harris administration,\" Freeman said. \"That brings clarity to a lot of the issues that, honestly, a lot of the big tech guys also wouldn't mind being clarified.\"</p><p>If Democrats  , data privacy regulation could advance more quickly through Congress. Biden has also proposed an increase in corporate taxes, aiming to raise the corporate tax rate from 21 to 28 percent and to establish minimum corporate taxes for domestic and foreign income.</p><p>But between Biden and Harris, a California senator with friendly ties to Silicon Valley, investors don't expect a particularly hostile posture towards tech. A breakup of the biggest tech firms -- Apple , Amazon , Alphabet , Microsoft  and Facebook , which make up about 20% of the stock market's total value -- is considered unlikely no matter who wins in November.</p><p>\"I'm not sure if you can really separate these entities,\" added Cornelio Ash, analyst at William O'Neil. </p><p>Generally, investors see Democrats as more likely to scrutinize big business, impose higher corporate taxes, or look more carefully at major mergers and acquisitions. But President Trump's record of meddling with private industry, most recently threatening to ban TikTok unless a U.S. company buys it, muddies that narrative. </p><p>\"The White House wants to lean towards Microsoft taking over TikTok,\" Ash added. \"Pulling investor sentiment out of it...we're setting precedent and the ramifications would be lasting.\" </p><p>Right now Biden is slightly favored to win the presidency, with most trackers placing the betting odds of a Biden-Harris victory at  . But with several weeks to go until November 3, anything could happen. And the market hasn't yet absorbed what another four years of Trump could mean, Freeman added. </p><p>Regardless of the election, Big Tech likely still has much more room to run: Historically, the sector has shown \"acceleration\" on the whole whole during difficult tough economic times, he said, bolstered by big secular trends like cloud computing and digital advertising. Those trends aren't going away. </p><p>What could change for the worse, if Trump wins, is the environment that has made the United States the world leader in innovation over decades. Among other actions of the current administration, the Trump White House has shown an impulse to punish private companies for political reasons, recently calling for a boycott of Goodyear  and signing two executive orders this summer targeting Twitter  and Facebook. </p><p>The market has not fully appreciated the possibility of a gradual erosion of U.S. innovation -- the \"move fast and break things\" credo that made tech so successful -- that could arise in a second Trump term, said Freeman. </p><p>\"Trump does kind of follow, if you believe what he says, less rule of law and more rule by fiat,\" he said. \"The magnitude of the downside if Trump wins, I think will shake the foundation of contract laws, rule of law.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSC-15405293</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSC2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60N6-DD81-JCHV-V0FC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">220623</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"670\"/><timeReceived>9:00 AM EDT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TheStreet.com, Inc.

Bernie Sanders from his frontrunner status in the Democratic primary race. Biden now leads the race with 433 delegates to Sanders' 388 as of late Wednesday. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Biden capturing the Democratic nomination would be an immensely more palatable result for investors compared to a Sanders victory, and markets reacted accordingly on Wednesday, according to Patrick Healey, founder of Caliber Financial Partners. </p><p>\"Biden had an incredible outcome yesterday, and I think the stock market [on Wednesday] is reflecting the favorability of that,\" Healey said. </p><p>The S&amp;P 500 surged 4.2% on Wednesday, which market watchers pinned on the Super Tuesday result, as well as waning coronavirus fears. The markets rise was led by health insurers, who would likely be threatened by Sanders' Medicare for All plan. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500's information technology sector rose 4.3% on Wednesday. </p><p>Sanders' opinions on corporate influence, and in particular Big Tech, are well known. The Vermont Senator has said that he would \"absolutely\" look to  Facebook , Alphabet , Apple  and Amazon , and similarly consider splintering cable broadband firms and other sectors he has likened to monopolies. </p><p>How a President Biden would approach the tech industry is less well known. </p><p>Biden has spoken critically of Facebook, telling a NYTimes interviewer last year that he views CEO and chairman Mark Zuckerberg as \"a real problem.\" He said in the same interview that breaking up tech firms should be under consideration, but that it was \"premature\" to make a judgment call on antitrust matters. But he also called for the revocation of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, the clause that protects internet companies from liability for content that appears on their platforms, saying that companies such as Facebook should be held responsible for spreading falsehoods. </p><p>Biden also said that the U.S. \"should be setting standards not unlike the Europeans are doing relative to privacy.\" And privacy is one area of tech policy that has drawn  . </p><p>\"The power of persuasion is a president's main power -- and certainly, if the Democrats are successful in holding the House and in winning the Senate, you could see a massive legislative push forward,\" said Dr. Dora Kingsley Vertenten, a professor at the Price School of Public Policy at USC. </p><p>Data privacy has seen a recent legislative push by states, creating a patchwork of laws that tech founders like Zuckerberg have decried. If a President Biden were paired with a supportive legislative branch, those laws could be reconciled at the federal level. And presidents can also drive tech policy through appointments to influential oversight commissions, such as the FCC, and to the federal judiciary: \"Much of the decision making is done through the federal court system,\" said Kingsley Vertenten.</p><p>In contrast to Sanders, Biden -- who served for decades in the Senate, and was a longtime member of the judiciary and foreign relations committees -- would be much more likely to approach tech policy from a security perspective, rather than from an economic perspective. That means Big Tech could find a more collaborative environment for moving policies forward in a Biden administration. </p><p>\"I think there's still an opportunity to shape policy with Biden because he comes from a framework that's steeped in cybersecurity concerns,\" Kingsley Vertenten added. \"Tech would have a much easier time working with him in a positive sense.\"</p><p>For investors, the prospect of a Biden presidency raises little cause for alarm -- even when considering a range of unknowns, namely what the makeup of the House and Senate will be come next year. Healey noted that a \"divisive\" nominee, such as Sanders, could have the effect of sinking investor confidence, even if some of his tough rhetoric on Big Tech has little chance of materializing in concrete policy changes. </p><p>The evidence is in Wednesday's market performance, he said. </p><p>\"I don't think Biden would be looking to impose punishing regulation on tech,\" Healey said. \"It's fairly evident in the trading activity that's taking place now.\"</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Facebook, </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Alphabet, </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Amazon and Apple are holdings in Jim Cramer's</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"/></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">.

The British firm's ploy to obtain Facebook information is the smallest figurine.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's important for the 21st century citizen to understand the other layers too.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The CA figurine is enclosed in a bigger one: the data collected about us by Facebook. The next layer is all the data Big Tech has about people. Whether or not we're paranoid enough to worry about the existence of another layer \u2014 the surveillance machine that's being built by the corporate world, politicians and governments using these data along with those contained in government databases \u2014 we have the right to know what's being collected, how and why.</p><p>Superficially, big tech companies appear to be open about their data collection practices. One can easily download an archive from Facebook, Google and Twitter. Amazon doesn't offer such an opportunity, but, if you're patient enough, it'll send you the data, and it tells you in general what types of information it collects and shares. There are settings to turn off various data-harvesting services and ways to wipe some of the data. But if you get the archives, as I have, you may be surprised to meet the person who's supposed to be your digital doppelganger and intrigued by what the tech companies might be doing with him or her.</p><p>Meeting the doppelganger will take some perseverance. Among the more than 3 gigabytes of data Google sent me (yes, that little: I kept Gmail and Google Photos out of my request and I'd recently wiped the search and browsing histories from my Google account), there was a record of my movements \u2014 a location history.</p><p>The timestamp is in UNIX time, and it can easily be converted into a normal date. Google knows where I've been since Sunday, February 24, 2013. One needs to divide the coordinates by 10 million to get to the accepted format, which can be entered onto a map.</p><p>The ones in my Google file point to the village of Malaya Vishera in Russia's Novgorod region. I have never been there.</p><p>Ad topics</p><p>Unlike Google, Facebook provides a convenient interface to view the data files. With enough patience, one can discover all the Messenger conversation histories that you haven't specifically erased \u2014 some with people you have blocked or forgotten; there'll also be every ad you've recently clicked on and all the likes and comments you're ashamed of.</p><p>But, perhaps most intriguingly \u2014 because it's the data closest to the heart of Facebook's business model, based on micro-targeting commercial messages to you \u2014 you'll see ad topics with which the system identifies you.</p><p>Mine are as follows:</p><p>\u2014 Books</p><p>\u2014 Nana (manga)</p><p>\u2014 Forbes</p><p>\u2014 The New York Times</p><p>\u2014 Republic</p><p>\u2014 Zen</p><p>\u2014 Nassim Nicholas Taleb</p><p>\u2014 Amnesty International</p><p>\u2014 Angela Merkel</p><p>\u2014 Vedomosti</p><p>\u2014 Buddhism</p><p>\u2014 Funny Images</p><p>I'm bothered by the idea that Big Tech thinks of me as a Buddhist who sits in Malaya Vishera and looks at mangas (who on earth is Nana, anyway? I fear that googling her may reinforce Big Tech's impression that I'm a fan).</p><p>Then again, it may go with my psychological profile as compiled by the likes of Cambridge Analytica. The profile I get from the University of Cambridge Psychometrics Center, the origin of the research that informed CA's methods, says, based on my Facebook and Twitter feeds, that I'm 27 years old.</p><p>A lot of data</p><p>I'm actually 46, so I won't argue childishly with the psychological traits ascribed to me by the profile. Perhaps some of them fit, and perhaps they fit the manga-loving Taleb fan from the Novgorod region \u2014 surely they fit someone.</p><p>I do give up a lot of data to the digital giants. Some of it is fake, some real, some is distorted by the devices used to harvest the data (I suspect the Malaya Vishera bit falls into the latter category) and some are ruined by joint use. My younger daughter, for example, buys e-books on Amazon more frequently than I do, because her books are shorter, and that skews the ad targeting considerably: Amazon seems to think I'm eight.</p><p>What I really want to know, however, is how exactly the tech firms use what I give them. Google says it uses the location data, among other things, to give me traffic information about my regular commute \u2014 and it does so faithfully every day as if I drove to work and back.</p><p>I don't, I use public transportation. But I also know that if my wife were the jealous kind, she might someday demand to see specific Google location data for a certain day \u2014 and I'd struggle to explain what she'd find.</p><p>It's not enough for the tech firms to give users access to the collected raw data, which most users will struggle to interpret, anyway. (These data dumps are so inconveniently structured that one gets the feeling they are designed to obfuscate). What I'd like is, for every type of data, a full disclosure of the purposes for which it is processed and the conclusions drawn from it by algorithms.</p><p>Essentially, I'd like to be able to push a button next to a \"targeted\" ad \u2014 or to any algorithmic suggestion of an interaction \u2014 that would immediately reveal exactly what information I provided to make the algorithm decide I must see it. Then, I'd like to be able to erase that information immediately.</p><p>Better tools</p><p>I'd also like, with my data dump, a detailed explanation of what the company does with each data type that it harvests and stores. I just can't think of a reason why Google would need five years of my location data, for example.</p><p>Controlling my information ultimately means just that: I want to be the editor of my data as provided to business entities, and I want much better tools for that job than the ones provided today. Google, Amazon, Facebook and Twitter know how to design a friendly user interface; they just haven't done it here.</p><p>This may have been wishful thinking a year ago. But thanks to the CA scandal, the tide is turning and regulators are getting fidgety.</p><p>Facebook announced that they are giving users more control over their privacy through more accessible settings, which will no longer be scattered through 20 or so different pages.</p><p>That's a baby step. If Facebook and other data harvesters don't go much further, there's now a real chance they will be forced to.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GULNWS-113342258</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GULNWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S0K-WXG1-F11P-X1DV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">338760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1062\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Gulf News - Al Nisr Publishing LLC.

Even though each company is under antitrust scrutiny for different reasons, the committee used this week's hearing to point out similarities between all four, making the case for future regulatory reform.</p><p><br/>Since last June, lawmakers have been engaged in a sweeping antitrust investigation into the tech sector, honing in on how some of the most notable names in the industry have grown too big by allegedly stifling competition. Lawmakers have heard hundreds of hours of testimony and obtained over one million documents throughout their investigation, a process that made it difficult for CEOs like Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon's Jeff Bezos to evade uncomfortable lines of questioning.<br/>Throughout this process and under Cicilline's leadership, the committee found troublesome patterns of behavior that all four firms exhibit. This includes how each company controls distribution, surveils competitors, and abuses their control over tech to strengthen their power.<br/>In his opening remarks, Rep. David Cicilline (D-RI), the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on antitrust, said \"Although these four corporations differ in important and meaningful ways, we have observed common patterns and competition problems over the course of our investigation.\"<br/>The power tech giants wield over distribution of information and products was key to the committee's investigation. Apple and Amazon both hold tremendous power over who gets to put up apps and sell products. Rep. Val Butler Demings (D-FL) asked Apple's CEO Tim Cook about its app store rules, focusing in on Apple's decision to remove third-party parental control apps that used mobile device management (MDM) tech. Apple has parental control software of its own.<br/>Google caught fire from Cicilline for keeping a watchful eye on competitors in search. Cicilline cited emails obtained through the investigation between Google employees concerned with how competing companies were growing more dominant. For Yelp specifically, Google allegedly threatened to delist its reviews if the giant couldn't feed them into its own products. This surveillance technique extends into the other three companies as well. For example, Facebook has allegedly kept tabs on other rising tech companies, making efforts to copy them or eventually purchasing them, like in the case of Instagram.<br/>By gaining dominance in their respective markets, companies could make it more difficult for competing companies and products to gain traction. Amazon was the committee's primary example of this behavior. Rep. Lucy McBath (D-GA) pointed out Amazon's ability to \"systematically block\" sellers from selling products in specific categories, citing interviews with a seller who believed she had been blocked from selling specific genres of books.<br/>\"I do not think that's systematically what's going on,\" Bezos responded. \"Third-party sellers in aggregate are doing extremely well on Amazon.\"<br/>The committee plans to issue a report at the end of the summer laying out its findings. Congress can't do much to break up Big Tech, but they can craft legislation aimed at regulating it. Facebook and Google are already under antitrust scrutiny by law enforcement. Agencies like the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department are the only bodies with the authority to penalize tech over anti-competitive behavior.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-M1278004</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G9-7NB1-DYDW-70WC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"585\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 30, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

With effect from 7 November 2019, goods and services supplied in the digital marketplace will now be subject to income and VAT tax...</p><p><br/>-<br/>The taxes hardly come as a surprise to Kenyans as the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) made a clear declaration in the 2018 KRA Annual Summit of its intention to broaden its tax base by introducing taxes on the emerging digital economy. Even before then, there were signals of future tax changes, with the VAT Act, 2013 envisaging VAT on downloaded electronic services. <br/><br/>All this comes after the large-scale technological and digital developments Kenya has experienced in the past two decades, ranking third among African countries with the highest Bitcoin usage in 2019 and with a population that has a remarkably high appetite for online betting, borrowing and purchases.<br/><br/>The ins and outs of the new taxes<br/><br/>Section 4 of the Finance Act amends the Income Tax Act to include  income accruing through a digital marketplace  as taxable income. Likewise, section 18 of the Act expands the VAT Act to be  applicable to supplies made through a digital marketplace . <br/><br/>The Act broadly defines a digital marketplace as 'a platform that enables the direct interaction between buyers and sellers of goods and services through electronic means.' This broad catch-all provision seeks to ensure that entities generating income through a digital platform are captured. The most obvious targets of the provision are expected to be e-hailing platforms and online selling marketplaces such as Uber and Jumia.<br/><br/>How the new provisions will be implemented?<br/><br/>While the Act indicates that the measure to tax income from digital transactions entered into force on 7 November 2019, it also states that the Cabinet Secretary of National Treasury and Planning shall make regulations to provide for the mechanisms of implementation. There is no clear timeline as to when these regulations shall be published, posing a practical challenge to implementation of the provisions. This means that enforcement of this tax will be delayed.<br/><br/>It would be beneficial to stakeholders in the digital and technological sector if the regulations were to clearly set out: <br/><br/><br/>-  the specific income that is subject to the tax provisions;<br/><br/>-  the applicable rates of tax to be applied (particularly in the case of non-resident persons without a permanent establishment in Kenya); and <br/><br/>-  the party responsible for accounting for the taxes.<br/><br/>As of February 2020, it remains unclear whether these taxes are operational, given the absence of clear guidelines on how these would operate.<br/><br/>Across the border<br/><br/>Taxation of the digital economy is not a novel concept in the world, with countries such as India and France jumping on the bandwagon in recent times. Globally, the introduction of digital taxes is fast becoming infamous for setting off retaliatory trade wars between countries.<br/><br/>In 2016, India imposed digital taxes (commonly dubbed the  Google Tax ) on tech companies involved in digital advertising. The tax seemed to target Over-the-Top (OTT) service providers such as Google, Twitter and Facebook. In 2018, the country went further, introducing a provision requiring companies to pay tax on domestic income accrued from a digital platform. The implication of this provision is that non-resident big tech companies would now be required to pay direct taxes on income generated in India. In retaliation, the USA introduced immigration restrictions that adversely affect Indians resident in the USA. <br/><br/>Similarly, the French government last year proposed a digital tax where tech companies would be mandated to pay a 3% tax 'on the gross revenues derived from digital activities of which French  users  are deemed to play a major role in value creation'. The laws also introduced a threshold for annual revenue generated (EUR750-million for taxable digital services supplied worldwide and EUR25-million for taxable digital services supplied in France). These thresholds were seen as a move to capture big tech companies such as Amazon, Google and Facebook. <br/><br/>As expected, the proposed tax sparked threats of retaliatory tariffs on imported wines and cheeses from France in the USA. At the moment, the rivalry between France and the USA has seemingly been quelled through a quasi ceasefire agreement to suspend the digital tax in exchange for a postponement of the threatened retaliatory tariffs until the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) provides a harmonised position on digital taxes. The OECD is best placed to ensure that there is uniformity of digital taxes around the world, as it has done for other taxes in the past   VAT being one such example.<br/><br/>These trade wars have in the past caused global stock markets to stumble. A similar crippling effect to the digital economy is imminent if the two superpowers cannot find common ground on the subject of digital tax.<br/><br/>What is the OECD s take on digital taxes?<br/><br/>The OECD is an intergovernmental economic organisation mandated to foster world trade and economic progress. In the past few years, the OECD has been working on a model for taxation of the digital economy, set to be part of the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS). Primarily, the model proposes to allocate the primary right to tax to the country from which the digital revenue generates (where the transaction takes place) rather than the country in which the investment is made (where the platform is hosted).<br/><br/>Under BEPS, the first pillar is intended to focus on profit allocation rules among states, including necessary modifications to traditional transfer-pricing rules, nexus rules and the arm s length principle, to take into account the changes that digitisation has introduced to the world economy. <br/><br/>BEPS is also set to examine concepts of marketing intangibles, user contribution and significant economic presence, and how they can be used to address the resultant tax challenges of the digital economy.<br/><br/>Anticipated effects of the tax in Kenya<br/><br/>The new amendments introduced by the Act have been negatively received by digital platform operators and consumers in Kenya. The move has been viewed as tantamount to double taxation for digital platform operators and burdensome to consumers, particularly where VAT on supplies is concerned.  <br/><br/>This is because without clear guidelines on how this tax will be applied, ascertaining who bears the cost of this new tax is largely speculative.  In the event that the VAT provision intends to place incidence on the consumer, the new tax may inevitably end up stifling innovation by taking away the very incentive for digital marketplaces - which have for a long time, been regarded as a more cost-efficient means of conducting business compared with traditional brick and mortar businesses.<br/><br/>This particular point was raised during the public participation in the Finance Bill, where it was pointed out that a huge portion of the Kenyan youth population, because of lack of jobs and capital, have turned to innovation in the digital space to reduce operational costs of doing business. Members of the public were therefore concerned that this move would encourage flight from the sector and hamper growth of start-ups and small and mid-size enterprises (SMEs).<br/><br/>What is more worrying is that national digital taxes (without a corresponding international tax regime) could endanger cross-border trade and investment. This is because any investor attempting to do business across borders would face the risk of being taxed repeatedly on the same portion of income. <br/><br/>Carefully thought-out international tax agreements may be the key to minimising the risk of endangering cross-border trade. A huge challenge for the drafters of such agreements, however, is that digital creatures lack defined territorial boundaries and are always evolving faster than the law. This is the challenge that plagues any attempt to regulate cyberspace.<br/><br/>What next for Kenya?<br/><br/>The regulations for the new tax provisions will be key in understanding how the tax will be imposed on digital marketplaces in Kenya, its operational workings and its effect. Our view is that these regulations should align with the broader government policy on the digital economy, international best practice and data protection laws to ensure a smooth implementation.  <br/><br/>Perhaps it would be prudent for industry players to lobby to ensure that a favourable environment for innovation is central to the efforts of the National Treasury in formulating these regulations, so that Kenya does not lose its position as an innovation and tech hub in Africa.</p><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BIZAMM-1201043</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BIZAMM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y99-6741-DY06-84BF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">376639</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1452\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Bizcommunity Publishing SA (Pty) Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Bizcommunity.com (Africa: Marketing and Media)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"13296\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 26, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>tax law</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>tax laws</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>digital tax</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>John Syekei</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Denis Magonga and Angela Mukora</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Nikhil Hira</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><classCode>STX001688</classCode><className>TAXES &amp;

Many of those suffer chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath and fatigue. But for others, AFib is symptomless, a potentially silent killer. </p><p>Enter the collaboration between Apple Watch and Stanford Medical Center. First announced in November, 2017. Initial results were presented at the American College of Cardiology Scientific Session in New Orleans in March.</p><p>\"This is one of the first large-scale studies to use wearables to screen patients for a serious medical condition,\" said Dr. Mitesh Patel, who directs the Penn Medicine Nudge Unit, the world's first behavioral design team embedded within a health system.</p><p>\"Future studies should test ways to combine these technologies with effective engagement strategies to change patient behavior to treat or reduce their risk from these conditions,\" said Patel, who was not involved in the study. </p><p>\"As more sensors of higher accuracy get integrated into smartwatches and smartphones ... the prediction accuracy for various health conditions using machine learning techniques will continue to improve,\" said Princeton electrical engineer Niraj Jha, who was also not involved in the study and who is researching the use of smartwatch-smartphone combinations to detect Type I and Type 2 diabetes. </p><p>Study concerns</p><p>A key success of the study: The ability to enroll more than 419,000 people into a clinical study within a mere eight months.</p><p>\"It's unprecedented to enroll 419,000 patients in that short amount of time,\" Rumsfeld said. \"We talk about not being able to get people into research studies. Well here I think we're showing that if you meet them in the real world as part of daily life, people are interested in adding to scientific knowledge.\" </p><p>Not surprisingly, the majority of the Apple Watch users who opted in were on the younger side, in fact, almost half were between the ages of 22 and 39. Also not surprising: The majority of the AFib alerts occurred in people over the age of 65.</p><p>\"As you get older, your heart stretches,\" Perez explained. \"It starts to scar. Or you become sensitive to the irregular electrical activities at the top of the heart. And that leads to atrial fibrillation.\"</p><p>Alerts sent to people under age of 40, however, were more likely to be picking up a genetic defect they were born with.</p><p>A major concern of the study was that the watch would deliver \"false positives\" by sending rapid pulse alerts when they were not significant. </p><p>\"Are you going to have huge numbers of them getting these alerts and being scared and wondering if they have heart disease?\" Rumsfeld said. \"So when it was deployed in the real world ... it was a great relief to many to see how few people had notifications.\" </p><p>In fact, of the more than 419,000 users, only 2,161 received an alert from the watch during the study period.</p><p>\"The study detected a low rate of atrial fibrillation in the overall population (.052%) but the rates were higher in older patients with 1.3% in ages 55 to 64 and 3.14% in age 65 or older,\" said Patel, who is an assistant professor of medicine and health care management at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.</p><p>\"So future work should consider which populations of patients are most appropriate for this method of screening,\" Patel said.</p><p>Another unknown of the study was how much people would participate once they got a notification of a possible atrial fibrillation event.</p><p>\"And we found that 76% of people either called the study doctor or went to their own doctor,\" Perez said. \"They were actively reacting and responding to these notifications.\" </p><p>Yet another unknown as the study started: Were those alerts actually a signal of atrial fibrillation? </p><p>The study was able to test that because many of the people who reached out to the study's healthcare provider for screening were sent an ECG patch monitor to wear in conjunction with the watch. </p><p>\"And we found that 84% of the time, the patch monitor and the watch showed the user was having atrial fibrillation at the exact same time,\" Perez said, adding that the results showed the watch's algorithm had a relatively high \"positive predictive value.\" </p><p>Big tech and privacy</p><p>Privacy concerns are a huge issue facing the successful use of digital health monitors in the future, experts say. </p><p>Recent news reports have criticized Google's collaboration with St. Louis-based Ascension, one of the largest nonprofit and Catholic health systems in the United States. The two companies confirmed they were working together to analyze patient data to streamline communication and develop new approaches to patient care.</p><p>After accusations the effort was clouded in secrecy and patients were not notified in advance or given permission to accept or deny the use of their medical records, \"Project Nightingale,\" named after the trailblazing nursing advocate Florence Nightingale, is now being investigated by the Department of Health and Human Services' Office for Civil Rights.</p><p>Ascension has pushed back on the accusations, saying that all operations were done in the open with full knowledge of clinicians and staff, and that stored patient data is under their control and in compliance with HIPPA laws and regulations. </p><p>\"Our data will always be separate from Google's consumer data, and it will never be used by Google for purposes such as targeting consumers for advertising,\" wrote Eduardo Conrado, Ascension's Executive Vice President of Strategy and Innovations.</p><p>Google said in a blog post that they have a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) with Ascension, \"which governs access to Protected Health Information (PHI) for the purpose of helping providers support patient care.\"</p><p>This isn't the first time Google has faced scrutiny for its handling of user data.</p><p>Google paid a record $170 million penalty to the Federal Trade Commission to settle accusations that YouTube broke the law when it knowingly tracked and sold ads targeted to children.</p><p>'We took user privacy very, very seriously'</p><p>Privacy issues were paramount on the minds of the development committee as the Apple Watch study was being planned, Perez said.</p><p>\"We took user privacy very, very seriously,\" he said. \"We were held up to the highest of standards, in terms of privacy and encryption and data safety. And I believe we met all of those standards.\"</p><p>Stanford recruited Apple Watch users via an app which they could download, Perez said. Users opted in and sent their application, medical information and survey answers via the app through Apple and directly to a server bank at Stanford. </p><p>\"We designed it so Apple would not be able to trace information back to the owners of the watch,\" Perez said. \"All of that data was funneled to us and any identifying data was given to us but did not stay at Apple. </p><p>\"Now Apple has some information about the heart rates and things like that, but they do not have it in an identified manner, so they're not able to link that data back to the participants.\"</p><p>In fact, Perez said, he believes that the methods used by Stanford can be a model for future studies.</p><p>\"I think this is sort of an exciting new way of doing clinical trials and I think many will be able to see our experience, see what we did and how we did it, not only in study design, but also in terms of data safety and encryption,\" he said.</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.
