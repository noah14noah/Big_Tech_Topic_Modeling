That just happened to Waze, an app famous for user-generated and edited maps that featured real-time traffic and routing information from its broad community. That community now belongs to Google, after a modest $1.03 billion buyout a couple of weeks ago. Googlenow gets to benefit from the community and offer slight improvements to their already great maps by adding the Waze development team. More importantly, they made sure Facebook didn't do those things by negotiating a successful buyout of their own.</p><p><br/> But, back to Waze, which is now $1.03 billion richer. The Israel-based startup team will remain in its native land and continue working independently (Google says 'for now' on its blog). It's a win for Waze, because, like so many other companies that get bought out, they don't have to figure out a way to make money off their service (and, you know, the part about getting $1.03 billion). That raises the question - who's next? Israel has proven to be fertile ground for tech startups lately, including many that have that problem of not being able to make a buck (or enough bucks). Here are a few that might just decide the time is right to accept a nice, large chunk of cash in the near future.<br/>Viber<br/> Viber[1] has made its name and grown its user base by taking something people have to pay for, and making it free. Text, image, and picture messaging are all free while using the app, along with free HD VoIP calling. If you live in Wi-Fi, Viber takes away that many reasons to give money to your telecom. Using your actual phone number as your user name means contact book integration. Combine that with cross-platform functionality (and that Viber is available in some form for just about every OS under the sun) and you have a winner.<br/> Thing is, Viber doesn't actually make money. That's not saying they don't make a profit - Viber actually does not generate revenue, at all. That makes the company, which was started by an American-Israeli entrepreneur, an intriguing buyout prospect - mostly, because they have a significant user base, a well-loved service, and the lack of money coming in means that they might just listen to the right offer. $20 million in investor capital is keeping it afloat for now - we'll have to see if anyone in big tech is willing to throw a little more in their direction.<br/>Pixtr <url normalizedValue=\"http://kec8irlufurlhy5n.zippykid.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/screenshot_1299.jpg\">http://kec8irlufurlhy5n.zippykid.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/screenshot_1299.jpg</url><br/>Pixtr<br/><br/>People like pictures of other people. They like pictures of famous places, or pretty landscapes. They are, on average, less enthusiastic about pictures of themselves, even when taking selfies into account. After all, how many takes go into a selfie? Not one. That's because flattery is not the camera's strong suit. It is, however, the strong suit of Pixtr[2].<br/> Pixtr is an app with a simplified, narrow take on photo editing. You upload pictures of faces, the app does in just a few seconds what a professional makeup crew or photoshop would normally do. The app does away with facial blemishes, improves skin tone, and adjusts the lighting in the picture to make sure that your best face gets put forward (that's their tagline, actually) in all your photos. The app is free for iOS, coming soon for Android, and looks ripe for someone else's picking.<br/>Bizzabo<br/>LinkedIn already did the professional social network thing, helping people to create and maintain career contacts. But, the people behind Bizzabo[3] realized that contacts you make online don't often mean that much. The best kind of networking is still done in person, so they made an app that helps you do just that.<br/> Bizzabo can be used by event organizers and attendees. Those attending professional meetups and events can see guest lists and receive suggestions on who to seek out and meet while they're at the event. Fellow Bizzabo users can send messages to each other within the app while attending the event, and arrange to make face-to-face meetings. The general idea is to cut away the awkwardness involved in approaching new people, and the time wasted in talking to people that might not be the most helpful to your goals.<br/> Event organizers, on the other hand, can use the app to set up and promote events, communicating directly with attendees through the app. A recent update has made it easier for potential attendees to browse for events using the app, as well.<br/> Like any good startup, Bizzabo has done a great job of finding a niche problem and approaching it in a modern, networked way, making it an interesting prospect. It's a free app, and you can find it for iOS or Android.<br/>GetTaxi<br/> You might have heard of the e-hail taxi app Uber, which recently managed to get around the regulations in NYC and get started serving the city. Thing is, they aren't the only app being invited to try out e-hailing during a one-year trial program. There's another Israel-based app called GetTaxi[4] in the mix, headed in the United States by Jing Wang Herman - a licensed cab driver herself.<br/> The app allows you to order a taxi online to your location, and pay after the ride. Cabbies using the app will see a map with all the requests open to them, and can select which fare they want to pick up. The app goes one step further, though - you can check to see if others around you are going to the same place. If there are, you have the option to merge your orders and split the cab fare.<br/> It's a promising idea, and now GetTaxi has one year to make it big in the Big Apple. If they can make it there, odds are they can make it anywhere.<br/>Mobli <url normalizedValue=\"http://kec8irlufurlhy5n.zippykid.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/screenshot_1300.jpg\">http://kec8irlufurlhy5n.zippykid.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/screenshot_1300.jpg</url><br/>Mobli<br/><br/>Mobli[5] is arguably most famous for being one of the primary benefactors of the Instagram buyout, as thousands of users that wanted no part of Facebook's takeover migrated over to the still-independent startup. In fact, Mobli even started a contest called MyLastInstagram in order to attract new users - I think the title of the contest is pretty self-explanatory.<br/> Mobli is not that much different from Instagram - a social network for sharing photos and videos, with real-time uploading from events like concerts encouraged. Those browsing for content can do so by uploader, location, or subject, and can check out real-time feeds from multiple accounts at the same event or place.<br/> Mobli does bring in cash through advertising on their site, helping keep the core service free. It's been enough to get CEO and founder Moshiko Hogeg to turn down buyout offers thus far. But, who knows if that will last considering the amounts of money being thrown around lately. As Mobli's user base continues to grow, it's going to get more and more attention, which will translate into more and more dollar signs.<br/>5 Israeli Startups With Amazing Apps, Just Like Waze[6] was first posted on June 23, 2013 at 12:16 am. \u00a9 2012 Chip Chick[7] This feed is for personal, non-commercial use only.

Democrats largely grilled Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos, Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, Alphabet\u2019s Sundar Pichai and Apple\u2019s Tim Cook on antitrust matters, while Republicans focused largely on allegations of political bias against conservatives.\u00a0</p><p>When on topic, legislators relished a rare opportunity to discuss major corporate acquisitions and press the CEOs on allegations of anticompetitive behavior in their respective product spaces. While the other tech execs had appeared before Congress, it was the first time for Bezos.</p><p>House Judiciary Chairman Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., interrogated Zuckerberg about Facebook\u2019s $1 billion acquisition of Instagram in 2012\u2014specifically his rhetoric in internal emails at the time, which cited the photo-sharing app as a threat. He and other committee members alleged a pattern of anticompetitive behavior whereby Facebook identified companies that could pose a threat to their business and acquired them. New documents released by Congress today show internal emails to Zuckerberg in which its former CFO talks about acquiring companies to \u201cneutralize a competitive threat.\u201d Lawmakers also raised Facebook\u2019s 2014 acquisition of WhatsApp for $19 billion and its attempted purchase of Snapchat in 2013.</p><p>\u201cIt is a violation of the Sherman Act to buy out a direct competitor to eliminate them as a danger and protect a monopoly; that idea doesn\u2019t seem to be well understood,\u201d tweeted the Columbia Law School professor and internet expert Tim Wu during the hearing.</p><p>Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., also asked Zuckerberg about copying competitors\u2019 features, which Facebook arguably did with Snapchat\u2019s Stories and will do with TikTok\u2019s infinite scroll and video editing features when Instagram Reels comes out this month.</p><p>\u201cPeople want to be able to communicate privately and with all their friends at once,\u201d Zuckerberg said in response. \u201cWe\u2019re going to build the best products in all the spaces people want to stay connected with the people they care about.\u201d</p><p>Nadler put the pressure on Zuckerberg to acknowledge the influence Facebook\u2019s algorithms have played on news companies\u2019 business models\u2014specifically, that Facebook knowingly inflated video metrics in a bid to win over ad dollars. Zuckerberg denied knowing about the scandal prior to admitting it to advertisers, something initially reported by The Wall Street Journal four years ago. Facebook\u2019s emphasis on video led to a much-discussed \u201cpivot to video\u201d in the news industry and, after Facebook revealed its missteps and deemphasized video in its algorithms, Nadler said, media companies laid off hundreds of journalists.</p><p>\u201cDo you realize the harm that caused journalists across the country?\u201d Nadler asked. Zuckerberg disagreed with the characterization, but said he knows \u201chow important it is that the metrics we report are accurate.\u201d</p><p>Nadler pressed Pichai to detail Google\u2019s exact reach by aggregating data across its services. \u201cUse of this data from all these companies gives you a tremendous advantage over them and over any competitor. Does the ability to make money in any way affect Google\u2019s algorithm in terms of what news appears in a typical user\u2019s search result?\u201d Nadler asked. Pichai said Google\u2019s algorithm doesn\u2019t \u201ctake into account a commercial relationship.\u201d</p><p>Antitrust Subcommittee Chairman Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., and Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., also brought up Facebook\u2019s struggles to root out hate speech and misinformation on the platform. Raskin mentioned the Stop Hate for Profit advertiser boycott that has targeted Facebook this month.</p><p>It took 96 minutes for legislators to ask a question of Amazon\u2019s Bezos, but when they did, he was grilled on allegations that the company used third-party seller data to quash competitors. \u201cI can\u2019t guarantee you that policy has never been violated,\u201d Bezos said in a stunning admission. \u201cI\u2019m not yet satisfied we\u2019ve gotten to the bottom of that.\u201d</p><p>The committee also asked Apple\u2019s Cook about whether the App Store had a chokehold on the mobile app marketplace. Pichai faced tough questions about Google\u2019s 2006 acquisition of YouTube as well as more recent children\u2019s privacy violations by the online video giant.</p><p>With Facebook in the room, you may be surprised that that reply didn\u2019t come from the social media giant. Instead, Google\u2019s Pichai gave that response to Rep. Greg Steube, R-Fla., a legislator critical of how the company\u2019s email service, Gmail, handled his campaign emails. How did reelection campaign emails they gave as examples end up in the junk folder? \u201cWe approach our work in a nonpartisan way,\u201d Pichai said.</p><p>Having a political bent, Pichai later said, goes against the company\u2019s \u201ccore values.\u201d The exchanges spoke to how legislators took the opportunity to wade into politics and get very specific answers on how their families\u2019 junk folders were being populated.</p><p>Other Republican committee members including Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, and Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., focused on allegations of political bias.</p><p>Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., asked Zuckerberg why he temporarily suspended Donald Trump, Jr., the president\u2019s son, from the platform for sharing a video with Covid-19 misinformation.

Disruptive investigations, federal lawsuits and new rules could loom for Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The companies and their executives don\u2019t need to look far for guidance about how this could all play out. One of their top competitors, Microsoft, faced the government\u2019s ire in the 1990s, leading to a bruising battle in federal court. The company was found to have repeatedly violated the nation\u2019s antitrust laws, and it agreed to change its corporate behavior as part of an eventual settlement.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cThe Microsoft case is incredibly front and center, the road map, in all these discussions about big tech and antitrust,\u201d said Andrew I. Gavil, a law professor at Howard University and co-author of \u201cThe Microsoft Antitrust Cases: Competition Policy for the Twenty-First Century.\u201d</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Interviews with several of the people at the center of the government\u2019s case against the company, as well as antitrust experts, suggest that tech executives will need to be careful and flexible in navigating their turn in the cross hairs.</p><p>Here are five lessons that today\u2019s executives might want to take away from the Microsoft experience, according to the people who lived through it.</p><p>1. Antitrust law may be old, but it can apply to the modern tech industry. </p><p>There was a great deal of skepticism about that when the Justice Department and 20 states sued Microsoft in 1998. The tech world was young, fast and freewheeling. Old antitrust laws from the 19th century, created in an industrial era of corporate trusts, when deals were done in smoke-filled railroad cars, could never keep pace, the thinking went. Determining winners and losers was best left to the marketplace.</p><p>That view was supported by the previous big antitrust case in tech, against IBM. Filed in 1969, the suit was simply dropped in 1982. It was regarded as a 13-year misadventure. Robert H. Bork, a leading antitrust expert at the time, termed it the Justice Department antitrust division\u2019s \u201cVietnam.\u201d A few years before it was finally abandoned, even one of IBM\u2019s competitors called the case \u201ca historical curiosity.\u201d</p><p>In the Microsoft case, the government was able to fashion traditional antitrust law to the digital age, by obtaining enough evidence and casting the company as a bullying monopolist.</p><p>The federal government and states demonstrated that \u201cantitrust law works,\u201d said Senator Richard Blumenthal, who was the attorney general of Connecticut during the Microsoft investigation and trial.</p><p>2. Consumer harm extends well beyond the price of products.</p><p>For decades, the litmus test of consumer harm in antitrust had been high prices charged by a dominant company. But the Microsoft case departed from that convention, defining harm broadly as stifling competition by upstart rivals and thus impeding the arrival of innovative new products and services.</p><p>The main focus of the case was Netscape, the commercial pioneer in browsing software. Microsoft regarded the newcomer as a threat to its grip on the market for desktop personal computer software and its operating system, Windows. One tactic Microsoft employed was to bundle its browser, Internet Explorer, to Windows, which held more than 90 percent of the personal computer operating system market. The additional charge for Internet Explorer? Zero.</p><p>\u201cThe case didn\u2019t hang on pricing, and it couldn\u2019t,\u201d said Rebecca Henderson, an economist at the Harvard Business School, who submitted expert testimony on behalf of the government. \u201cIt was the threat to competition and future innovation.\u201d Microsoft declined to comment for this article.</p><p>That point resonates today. Google and Facebook offer their services to consumers free. But as the Microsoft case shows, free is not a free pass from antitrust.</p><p>3. Fight, but be flexible.</p><p>\u201cIt always seemed to me that Microsoft waged a kind of holy war,\u201d said A. Douglas Melamed, who was the second-in-command at the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division during the investigation and trial. \u201cTheir attitude was: We\u2019re tech. We\u2019re innovators. We understand this industry. There\u2019s plenty of competition.\u201d</p><p>Microsoft could have settled, but resisted. David Boies, who was recruited as the Justice Department\u2019s chief litigator, initially thought that the case should be settled. Get Microsoft to agree to refrain from some anti-competitive behavior, he figured, and do not risk losing in court in a detail-filled technology case against a company with an all but unlimited budget for legal talent.</p><p>But Mr. Boies said his view changed as more evidence surfaced. For example, a senior Microsoft executive, in a private meeting, described the software giant\u2019s strategy against Netscape as a campaign to \u201ccut off their air supply,\u201d according to witness testimony.</p><p>Mr. Boies said that in an antitrust case, the corporate target begins with a \u201chuge knowledge advantage, but that will erode\u201d as the inquiry proceeds. If the facts look incriminating, he said, the best course for a defendant is to \u201csettle early before the other side knows what you do.\u201d</p><p>4. Politics and public opinion matter a lot.</p><p>Antitrust cases are built on facts and evidence, but also legal theory and the climate of the times.</p><p>Early in the pursuit of Microsoft, Netscape and its allies faced an uphill struggle trying to enlist public support for its cause. Microsoft was a tech superstar, Bill Gates was a business hero, and its products were used by hundreds of millions of people every day. Why punish success?</p><p>But gradually, government officials, politicians and other companies became convinced that Microsoft\u2019s power should be curbed to keep the door open for innovators.</p><p>The idea was to rally support broadly and create \u201csafety in numbers\u201d for potential industry witnesses, recalled Christine Varney, an antitrust expert and a former F.T.C. commissioner who served as an outside counsel to Netscape.</p><p>Today, the big tech companies face more antagonism than Microsoft did at the outset. They are under fire for their role in undermining privacy, distributing disinformation and thwarting competition.</p><p>So far, American antitrust authorities have been far less aggressive than their European counterparts in challenging the tech giants. But that could change if public concerns intensify, more complaints surface and evidence accumulates.</p><p>\u201cAnd if they do take bold action, the political system will not trash them,\u201d said William Kovacic, a law professor at George Washington University and former chairman of the F.T.C. \u201cNo one will be accusing them of trying to destroy a national treasure.\u201d</p><p>5. The Microsoft case changed the industry \u2026 or so it seems.</p><p>There is no way to know what would have happened without the Microsoft case. Some believe that it mattered little. Technology surged on. Search, smartphones and social networks became the new platforms.</p><p>David B. Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School and a former Intel board member, used to be in that camp.</p><p>But his thinking has changed, Mr. Yoffie said, as he has studied the early years of Google\u2019s rise. Without the restrictions on its behavior that were in the settlement in 2001, Microsoft could have unleashed the tactics it used against Netscape, like pressuring personal computer makers to agree to exclusive deals that would feature Microsoft\u2019s Bing search service and exclude Google search.</p><p>\u201cGoogle may have never emerged in its current form if Microsoft had not been restrained,\u201d Mr. Yoffie said.</p><p>Of course, Microsoft eventually found a new path. It missed the shift to smartphones and its Bing search service trails well behind Google. But under Satya Nadella, who became chief executive in 2014, Microsoft has made the transition to catch the next big wave in tech platforms \u2014 cloud computing.</p><p>In the cloud market, Microsoft is a strong and fast-growing No. 2, behind Amazon, safely outside the gaze of antitrust watchdogs. Last week, with its shares up a bit, the market value of Microsoft\u2019s shares topped $1 trillion, ahead of the other tech giants.</p><p>Pointing to that performance, Mr. Yoffie added another lesson from the Microsoft case.</p><p>\u201cAn antitrust battle,\u201d he said, \u201cdoesn\u2019t necessarily spell doom for any of these big tech companies.\u201d</p><p>Steve Lohr covers technology and economics.

For many content-based companies, the focus was on distribution \u2014 particularly streaming via an ever-growing number of services that each threaten to encroach on the dominant company in the space, Netflix. And for tech companies, the threat of regulatory intervention seems to have taken a backseat to the challenges of bottom-line issues like revenue and growth. Here are 5 takeaways from Q3 that stood out: 1. Wall Street Isn't Sweating Looming Threats to Big Tech When it comes to big tech, Wall Street only cares about two things: money and growth. </p><p>Regulatory concerns, it seems, are ancillary. That was reinforced this earnings season, with Facebook being the most obvious example. Mark Zuckerberg's social network has been skewered on multiple fronts in the last few months \u2014 including a slew of antitrust probes, a $5 billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission to cover data security breaches and a widely criticized public decision to not fact check political ads. Still, Facebook has remained largely impervious to the noise, with the company's stock price enjoying a small bump after posting strong Q3 user growth and topping analyst estimates with $17.7 billion in revenue. On the year, Facebook's stock price has increased 40%, to about $192 per share. Amazon, like Facebook, has also been the subject of antitrust complaints from 2020 presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren. But those threats have done little to scare away investors, with the e-commerce giant's stock price holding steady, thanks to its $70 billion in quarterly revenue easily topping projections. Meanwhile, Twitter \u2014 which has received a fraction of the heat Facebook and Amazon have from Washington, D.C. \u2014 was shelled by investors[1] for its underwhelming Q3 sales, sending its stock price shooting down 20% in the aftermath. The aggregate paints a clear picture: Investors care much more about how these tech companies are performing \u2014 and expect to perform the following quarter \u2014 than any looming legal or political threat that may hit a year from now. As long as revenue is growing and more users are still coming aboard, Wall Street will worry about any antitrust concerns when the time actually comes.

Disney Talks About Its Other Streaming Service All the ink has rightly gone to Disney+, the long-awaited streaming service that finally debuted this week with 10 million initial signups. But Disney shared more about its plans for Hulu, the streamer in which it now has full control after its acquisition of Fox and buyout of other minority stakeholders. And FX, one of the Fox assets Disney acquired in its $71.3 billion deal, is going to be a big part of that. Hulu is now the official steaming home for FX, whose more adult-oriented fare wouldn't play well next to The Avengers and Mickey Mouse on the family-oriented Disney+ service. Not only does that include all current and past seasons of FX series, under the brand 'FX on Hulu,' but also will see FX develop content for Hulu. Four series that were previously in development at FX \u2014 'Devs,' 'Mrs. America,' 'The Old Man' and 'A Teacher' \u2014 will now be Hulu originals. It's something FX chief John Landgraf had told us would happen[3]. 3. Streaming Continues to Eat Traditional TV's Lunch This trend isn't exactly new, but it has started to accelerate. Traditional TV, a.k.a. cable and satellite providers, were hit with a record number[4] of net customer losses during the third quarter, with more than 1.7 million people ditching their service. At the same time, Netflix bounced back from an unprecedented second quarter blip \u2014 losing U.S. subscribers for the first time ever, thanks in part to its price hikes \u2014 by adding another 500,000 subscribers in the U.S. Overall, Netflix added nearly 7 million customers during Q3. Still, a nugget in Roku's Q3 performance made it clear the wind is not blowing in favor of cable and satellite providers: Roku viewers streamed 10.3 billion hours of content[5] during the quarter, coming out to about 3.5 hours per day of streaming on average for its 32.3 million accounts. That's a lot of streaming time. And it's continuing to grow, with Roku's streaming hours increasing about 3% quarter-over-quarter. So not only are more viewers cutting the cord and picking up streaming devices, they're also spending more time watching their favorite streaming services. There's only so many hours in a day \u2014 and less and less of the them are being spent on old-school television. How can these traditional providers fight back? An increased focus on their cheaper, live -TV streaming services would be a place to start. Dish, for instance, offset its quarterly satellite losses by adding more than 200,000 Sling TV customers. This might mean less revenue per customer, but at least it's retaining some consumers. This already looks like a difficult reality for AT...o accept, though, with the telecom raising its AT...ow monthly fee[6]s in October for the second time this year. That move likely won't help stem its DirecTV losses. Also Read: Why Apple TV+ Can't Compete Against Netflix and Disney Without a 'Friends' or 'Seinfeld'[7] 4. Viacom and CBS, Together Again (Almost) Viacom and CBS are about to become ViacomCBS in a few weeks, when the two mega-media companies re-merge ahead of 2020. Top executives, the ones who remain at least[8]after the latest major shakeup, say they're ready for the synergies. (They've sure said so enough.) Both CBS and Viacom bested Wall Street's earnings expectations when they reported numbers this week. Viacom topped[9]on revenue forecasts for its fiscal fourth quarter of 2019. In its Q3, the actual third quarter of calendar 2019,CBS missed[10]on revenue. Though 'Viacom' will come before 'CBS' in the new company's title and Viacom chief Bob Bakish will run the whole thing, CBS is still the bigger piece of the combined pie, which is maybe more the size of a sheet cake. CBS' current market cap is $14.26 billion, Viacom's is exactly $5 billion less than that. We'll let you do the math on what that means when they're under one umbrella next time earnings roll around. 5. The Movie Theater Isn't Dead, Yet Yes, streaming services are popping up left and right, making it tougher for viewers to get up off the couch. But people still loving going to the movies, it turns out. Cinemark's third quarter attendance 5% increased year-over-year, setting a record quarterly revenue with $73.4 million in sales in the process. AMC set its own Q3 record with 87.1 million tickets sold, helping increase revenue 8% year-over-year to $1.32 billion. Imax's sales increased 5% year-over-year as well, with CEO Richard Gelfond saying[11] the premium theater chain was 'on track for our best year ever at the global box office.' Obviously, the box office rebound was spurred on by blockbuster releases that moviegoers wanted to see. Cinemark, in its letter to shareholders, pointed to Disney's 'The Lion King' reboot and Sony's 'Spider-Man: Far From Home' as two major releases that helped drive ticket sales. The fear people won't leave their homes for shows has intensified in recent years, hitting not just the movies but live entertainment and sports as well. The best way to combat that trend is to offer viewers \u2014 who are growing more accustomed to simply ordering movies on Apple TV each day \u2014 a compelling reason to actually go out. At least during the third quarter, the studios were able to do that \u2014 and the theaters thanked them for it.Related stories from TheWrap: Viacom Q4 Earnings Beat Expectations, Paramount Posts

Here are another five.<br/> 1. Three charts explain where hospitals and systems are today, security-wise. HIMSS Media research found that privacy is the top concern, nailed down more than a dozen ways healthcare organizations are addressing security issues and pinpoints specific job roles involved in establishing strategy and internal policies. Read the full article here.<br/> 2. Several infosec leaders rated the industry's security posture as just about 'average.' As in, somewhere between a four and six with 10 being the highest. One speaker at the HIMSS Healthcare Security Forum even gave a three rating. Why so low? Call it a \"false sense of cloud\" that big tech guns will make the security problem go away. Read the full article here.<br/> 3. Security teams will never have upper management's attention quite like they do in the immediate wake of a breach. It might not be a silver lining, exactly, but it is an opportunity to talk with the board of directors to advance your long-term strategic plan by talking about operation resiliency, which is bound to keep their attention. Read the full article here.<br/> 4. Evidence-based security is not just a fancy buzzword. Hope is emerging that applying analytical rigor to security in a fashion akin to evidence-based medicine will transform today's practices. To that tend, Penn Medicine CISO Dan Costantino explains how to use data and analytics to better understand threat intelligence and heighten your security posture while remaining compliant with necessary rules and regulations. The foundation is gathering two key data types so you can put the intelligence to work. Read the full article here.<br/> 5. Smart CISOs master patch management without disrupting the clinical workflow. It sounds easy enough, sure, but it's not because of the legacy software and hardware still running in hospitals. Hint: Smart planning starts with assessing vulnerabilities, setting response processes and allowing for anomalies such as zero-day events.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INHNEW-n10719871</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INHNEW2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TMF-0FF1-DYDW-738N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428668</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"413\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Health care news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 1, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000832</classCode><className>HEALTH CARE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008ZGX</classCode><className>CYBERCRIME</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000882</classCode><className>IDENTITY THEFT</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Q0QzNDc4RTM3RjNENDA3RUJFMjFEODQ5OTUzODI4Q0Y7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTdGN0NBMjhBN0VBNDYzOEFCRkQyNDc2RDJDMzc3Mjg</classCode><className>Identity Theft</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX001638</classCode><className>STRATEGIC PLANNING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp; ORGANIZATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX000194</classCode><className>BOARDS OF DIRECTORS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000D7DY</classCode><className>INFORMATION SECURITY &amp; PRIVACY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000832</classCode><className>HEALTH CARE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009T96</classCode><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008ZGX</classCode><className>CYBERCRIME</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX002149</classCode><className>HEALTH CARE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N622000CC</classCode><className>HOSPITALS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001269</classCode><className>EVIDENCE BASED MEDICINE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DN7Y</classCode><className>DATA ANALYTICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST000A39R</classCode><className>COMPUTER SOFTWARE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>GX142</classCode><className>NEW DELHI, INDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

This year, 25 tracks will help attendees navigate discussions on the future of everything from artificial intelligence and virtual reality to more traditional topics like advertising and music.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SXSW 2019 also has some newcomers, namely two new tracks to come later next week: one for blockchain technology and another about the business of cannabis. Other focuses this year are more sobering, such as list of Democratic presidential candidates and plenty of talks about the dangers of social media and data privacy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cThe best-case scenario is that the sessions don\u2019t just reflect [the current state of tech], but also offer some solutions going forward with systems that more people trust,\u201d said SXSW chief programming officer Hugh Forrest.</p><p>While past SXSW speakers have included big-name political leaders like then-President Barack Obama, this year\u2019s field of Democratic speakers offers a lens into next year\u2019s presidential race. However, it might also be a preview of how some politicians are planning to regulate big tech.</p><p>\u201cI think it reflects where we are in 2019 that politics are much more front and center in people\u2019s minds,\u201d Forrest said. \u201cWe\u2019re always trying to focus two or three years ahead and 2020 falls squarely into that bucket.\u201d</p><p>The focus is largely on Democrats this year, but it\u2019s not because SXSW doesn\u2019t want Republicans to join in the conversation about the future of tech or the future of the nation. A few GOP leaders will be in town this week, including former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and former Ohio Gov. John Kasich, but it\u2019s been historically hard to get Republicans to the conference. Forrest said he would like to see more bipartisan and nonpartisan participation next year.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re having conversions about future issues and future policies, they\u2019re not as complete as they should be if it\u2019s just one side of the table having these conversations,\u201d he said.</p><p>Leigh Christie, director of Isobar\u2019s NowLab, said the Democratic primaries will sway conversations about the future of innovation. Candidates are talking increasingly about data regulation, AI and other topics and how they affect every American. It also helps tech companies understand how the narratives are shifting.</p><p>\u201cThe radicalization of politics has led many many tech entrepreneurs start to think more about the relationships between tech and politics, or technopolitics,\u201d he said.</p><p>Spring is just around the corner, and some say it\u2019s possible the blockchain industry might be soon seeing the end of the \u201ccrypto winter\u201d\u2014a season of cryptocurrency value declines and overall period of pessimism about decentralization.</p><p>This year, SXSW is hosting a three-day blockchain track from March 14-16 that will including discussions ranging from the regulation of cryptocurrencies to how it can improve everything from voting to food supplies.</p><p>\u201cBlockchain is becoming more and more of a backbone of our connected society so it makes sense to have that at SXSW,\u201d Forrest said.</p><p>Tonight, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, known for their early involvement with Facebooks, will deliver a keynote on behalf of their company Gemini on why cryptocurrencies should be regulated.</p><p>Another evolving nationwide trend is the business of cannabis, which is getting its own three-day track about how brands can think about the emerging industry, what it means for criminal justice reform and how it affects users\u2019 health.</p><p>According to Forrest, there were only six sessions about cannabis a year ago, but this year, there will be about 60. He said the goal is to include more communities and microcommunities that might be interested in the industry to help diversity and enhance discussions.</p><p>\u201cThe industry is changing so quickly and so rapidly in so many ways,\u201d Forrest said, \u201cand these are the kind of changes that entrepreneurs love or dream about or want to be in front of.\u201d</p><p>While some agencies say their clients aren\u2019t ready to think about cannabis, others say the heightened profile of the industry helps \u201ccredentialize\u201d it.</p><p>\u201cI remember a few years ago that the couple of panels about cannabis \u2026 it was the tiniest room,\u201d said Phillip Lee, digital strategy director at the Dallas-based agency The Richards Group. \u201cAnd now, we\u2019re seeing that business in particular is the representation of a lot of cultural, technical and financial trends that support it to be a viable business.\u201d</p><p>With dozens of bands and solo artists playing showcases and secret shows around Austin, there will no doubt be plenty of music at SXSW, as there always is. However, the biggest music-streaming services are scaling back. Spotify and Pandora have both opted out of hosting events or stages this year. However, Visible, the cheaper, online-only wireless provider owned by Verizon, will be sponsoring the main stage during SXSW Music next weekend.</p><p>Lee said it might be a sign of the times.</p><p>\u201cBy some estimations, it\u2019s a little based on the wisdom of the crowd,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it\u2019s often a reflection of what\u2019s exciting in business and tech and culture and also a reflection of the anxieties of what\u2019s happening in business and tech and culture.\u201d</p><p>However, music brands will still have activations of their own. Next week, Shure, the audio equipment company, will host a two-day event it\u2019s calling \u201cShure Bedroom Sessions\u201d as a tribute to all the musicians who started off recording songs in their bedrooms. The event on March 15 and 16 will showcase more than a dozen artists playing live shows at Antone\u2019s Nightclub as well as a place for musicians to relax in between festival gigs.</p><p>Of course, there will be plenty of brands, media companies and tech companies across downtown Austin hosting immersive experiences or simply providing phone charging or free beer.</p><p>Dani Calogera, group account director at 360i, said it seems brands are thinking less about being splashy and more about how they can provide consumers with something useful. For example, she mentioned the dating app Bumble is giving dating tips and taking photos of them for their profiles.</p><p>\u201cWhen I look at what\u2019s on the docket this year, you see a lot of brands are focusing on their core value proposition,\u201d she said.</p><p>Mike Dossett, director of digital strategy at RPA, said he\u2019s been going to SXSW for the past six or seven years and that the past few have seemed to like \u201ca renaissance.\u201d However, he said, it would be nice to see more of SXSW focused on what\u2019s still working when it comes to traditional agency roles.</p><p>\u201cIt would be valuable to say many of the folks who are espousing some of this common sense aren\u2019t putting their heads in the sand,\u201d he said. \u201cBut don\u2019t forget about how the world looks today.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ADWEEK-1029133</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ADWEEK2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VKP-0CN1-JC8H-T1KF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7907</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1151\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Mediabistro Holdings, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>adweek.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 8, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

THE MODERN PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The problem? Picking up the pace </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">If startups are speedboats, big businesses are cruise ships. This is how Kent Bradley, founder of BTN Advisors, describes the players in healthcare innovation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The speedboat is agile and entrepreneurial, but can only fit so many people and has only so much gas. On the other hand, the cruise ship boasts deep resources and competencies, yet often requires extensive compliance and oversight. They both can get to the destination, but at different speeds.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But don't confuse slow with risk averse, notes Judy Sewards, VP, head of digital strategy and data innovation at <person><nameText>Pfizer. </nameText></person>\"Skeptics like to say that pharma is not innovative, that it is an old and clunky industry. However, I would say we are one of the most innovative industries, and one that has driven continuous breakthroughs in health,\" she explains.</p><p>See also: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.mmm-online.com/what-10-innovation-teams-look-like/article/488505/\">What 10 innovation teams look like</url></p><p>When the estimated cost of getting a new drug approved is pegged at $2.6 billion, it is hard to argue that pharma does not take risk. However, the high stakes tend to happen on the R&amp;D side of the operation where, Sewards says, \"We know how to explore ambitious possibilities when looking at a disease, design studies to learn how a potential medicine might best meet unmet patient needs, and have a systematic framework to bring that medicine to the patients who need them.\"</p><p>So what happens when the risk is not in a molecule, but in a device, an app, or machine learning as part of digital transformation? Typically these activities happen within an innovation team on the commercial operations side of the organization, which is notorious for reducing risk, and rightly so. Once a drug has crossed the approval chasm, a lot more is on the line.</p><p>This is precisely where things slow down for the modern pharmaceutical. But Sewards sees a path forward.</p><p>\"By borrowing the principles from our scientific model of focus, iterative experimentation, which requires curiosity and patience, and planning for success and applying it to digital innovation, pharma has the opportunity to be a leader in shaping healthcare transformation,\" she explains.</p><p>See also: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.mmm-online.com/the-fda-astellas-and-accenture-use-innovation-competitions-to-help-address-business-challenges/article/524804/\">The FDA, Astellas, and Accenture use innovation competitions to help address business challenges</url></p><p>However, Sewards cautions, don't feel like you have to go it alone. \"Today, we are not a technology company, we are a medicines company,\" she notes.</p><p>\"Therefore, part of our success depends on our ability to partner effectively with those companies and institutions that are pioneering new digital and data solutions and exploring together what these solutions might enable in the future,\" she continues.</p><p>In this situation, the cruise ship opts to engage with a few speedboats. \"By working together on behalf of patients, we can marry domain and functional expertise to more rapidly find meaningful solutions and also pull it through into action,\" Sewards adds.</p><p> 2. ANY LARGE HEALTHCARE ORGANIZATION </p><p> The problem? Developing a data-driven culture </p><p>Data is, and always has been, the lifeblood of business. What we know, when we know it, and what we can do with it has the potential to create a significant competitive advantage for the data-driven life-sciences organization.</p><p>But who owns data in the 21st century organization? Where does it live? And how is it shared?</p><p>These are the organizational and behavioral questions facing many pharmaceutical executives tasked with building next-generation data and machine learning teams that just might hold the next medical breakthrough.</p><p>See also: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.mmm-online.com/challenges-exist-even-as-excitement-grows-for-big-data-market/article/490340/\">Challenges exist, even as excitement grows for big data market</url></p><p>\"Given that technology is now generating more data than we have ever had - from the dramatic increase in the use of EMRs to the use of mobile devices - we have more data from more sources,\" explains Aman Bhandari, executive director, center for observational and real-world evidence (CORE), Merck.</p><p>\"This data will create more opportunity for a more holistic point of view of disease and public health, but it will also bring tremendous methodological challenges,\" he continues.</p><p>And all too often, the data and technology live in completely different parts of the same organization.</p><p>\"If we want to drive novel science, it is critical to have a thesis for how you will use all of your data along with a tech stack that will enable your goals. Data and technology are so interwoven today, to think of them separately is a mistake,\" notes Bhandari.</p><p>To create a truly data-driven culture, executives such as Bhandari look to models outside of their industry - albeit cautiously. While numerous big tech companies are eager to play in healthcare, the rules are different.</p><p>Bhandari says it is one thing for a tech company in Silicon Valley to look at sales data and be off by 1%, and another thing for a healthcare company to be off 1% in a key metric.</p><p>\"In healthcare data, you have to be incredibly precise and have the highest standards,\" he explains.</p><p>See also: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.mmm-online.com/panel-why-data-is-the-first-step-in-telling-a-human-story/article/502467/\">Panel: Why data is the first step in telling a human story</url></p><p>Fortunately, Carl Anderson, VP, head of data and analytics at the hospitality company WeWork, created a playbook that is adaptable to any industry, including highly regulated pharma.

THE CLINIC </p><p> The problem? Integrating patient data into the workflow </p><p>For Dr. Daniel Kraft, chair of medicine for Singularity University and founder and executive director of the Exponential Medicine conference, data is nothing if not integrated into the healthcare professional's workflow. It is this last mile of the delivery of care where many data-driven innovations fall flat.</p><p>The quintessential early adopter, Kraft says the challenge is not the technology. Roughly one year ago, some forms of Epic's electronic medical record gained the capability to intake Apple HealthKit data from a patient.</p><p>See also: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.mmm-online.com/wbmd-webmd-patients-doctors-fitbit-apple-watch/article/647966/\">Infographic: The physician view on patient data</url></p><p>For example, Kraft can log into his Stanford Health Care app and allow it to connect to his iPhone. On the clinician side, his doctor is able to see his steps, sleep, and glucometer data. \"This is a frame shift,\" explains Kraft. \"He can now see my outside life.\"</p><p>The real challenge, argues Kraft, is moving from a reactive model with intermittent data to a proactive model with free flowing data.</p><p>\"The nut to crack is how to make data useful through machine learning so the three high-risk patients are identifiable,\" he continues. \"We need to figure out how to take all of this new data - sometimes coming from the consumer and sometimes from the clinician - and make it part of clinical care.\"</p><p>Designing for workflow requires an appreciation of the human factors at play. If a physician needs to open a new app, the likelihood of it happening is very low. \"No one wants to log into your Fitbit app,\" Kraft says. Rather, he recommends that innovators storyboard how their solution is seamlessly incorporated in the healthcare professional's day.</p><p>See also: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.mmm-online.com/drugmakers-formalize-patient-roles-as-they-work-to-define-patient-centricity/article/580175/\">Drugmakers formalize patient roles as they work to define patient centricity</url></p><p>Incentives can help. \"If the data flows to the EMR, is it going to be covered? Can he bill for a virtual checkup?\" asks Kraft.</p><p>So while organizations such as Kaiser Permanente and Geisinger Health System are moving toward this model, Kraft would like to see Medicaid and Medicare as having great potential to move the market. While this may seem far off, he points out the NHS now prescribes apps and devices to manage chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease in England.</p><p>Astellas is one example of a drugmaker that has used an innovation challenge to come up with new ideas.</p><p> 4. STARTUPS </p><p> The problem? Insiders know too much </p><p>Healthcare is increasingly recognizing the value of bringing outside thinking in by investing in opportunities to reach the edges of the innovation ecosystem, where the most unique perspectives and freshest ideas often reside. From hackathons to accelerators to corporate investment funds, the hunt is on for the next big idea and the team likely to make it a reality.</p><p>But what if transformational solutions don't just come from outside healthcare, but from people who never thought about health at all?</p><p>See also: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.mmm-online.com/startup-unveils-tools-to-improve-trial-reproducibility/article/471977/\">Startup unveils tools to improve trial reproducibility</url></p><p>\"My biggest skill was that I knew nothing about healthcare,\" explains Naveen Jain, founder and CEO of Viome, a wellness company that aims to give people the clearest picture of their wellness through an artificial intelligence engine that makes personalized diet recommendations based on an assessment of health at the molecular level.</p><p>\"If you take someone who knows healthcare, they can improve it 10% to 15%. But if you want to improve it 100%, you need to know nothing,\" he states.</p><p>It would be easy to dismiss entrepreneurs such as Jain. Except this is the same entrepreneur who founded companies such as Infospace and Intelius, and he most recently cofounded Moon Express, the only privately funded company approved by the U.S. government to travel beyond Earth's orbit and land on the moon, slated to happen in 2017.</p><p>While searching for the next disruptive thing, Jain observed the tools of modern medicine were designed to address 20th century health problems, which were primarily infectious disease and acute care. Now in the 21st century, these tools don't successfully address chronic disease. In fact, they may even be causing it, posits Jain.</p><p>See also: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.mmm-online.com/uber-partners-with-startup-to-take-patients-to-the-doctor/article/525013/\">Uber partners with startup to take patients to the doctor</url></p><p>It was around this time he stumbled upon federally developed technology deployed to understand exactly what happens inside the body when exposed to biological warfare. It occurred to Jain this same technology could be utilized to provide an analysis of one's personal metabolome and microbiome.</p><p>He is not alone. Prior to founding Flatiron Health, Nat Turner and Zach Weinberg were better known for selling their internet startup, Invite Media, to Google. Today, Flatiron has raised more than $300 million to improve cancer care, and it was recently named a Tech Pioneer by the World Economic Forum.</p><p>Photo credit: Gilles Frydman</p><p> 5. MUCH OF THE DRUG INDUSTRY </p><p> The problem? R&amp;D has become dehumanized </p><p>No matter how many patient journeys are commissioned each year, how many innovation shops are retained for human-centered design research, or how many chief patient officers are hired, healthcare is still at a loss to truly know the patient.</p><p>And it's not just patients. \"The whole system has dehumanized all aspects of medicine,\" explains Gilles Frydman, founder of the Association of Cancer Online Resources (ACOR) and cofounder of Smart Patients. \"When is the last time you saw a picture of the person who discovered the molecule?\"</p><p>See also: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.mmm-online.com/drugmakers-facing-pricing-criticism-sell-cures-in-new-ads/article/567499/\">Drugmakers, facing pricing criticism, sell cures in new ads</url></p><p>Frydman is on a quest to change this. When tackling a complicated problem, he utilizes a simple process. And the simplest way to better understand real people is to see them. \"Medicine is about real people,\" he says. \"And a picture is worth a thousand words.\"</p><p>Following 20 years of work in cancer advocacy, Frydman notes the images - literal and figurative - that executives have of stage 4 cancer patients are not accurate. And so he embarked on a mission to set the record straight by producing portraits of real people with cancer, some of which appear on pharmaceutical company websites.</p><p>While this sounds simple enough, real pictures of real people are often a no-no for big pharma.</p><p>\"They are afraid of the lack of control. What are these people going to do or say? Or how will they look?\" Frydman explains. Of course, much of this comes from the fear of legal or regulatory action. \"The FDA has forced everyone involved with treatments to be super careful,\" he continues, adding they \"try to protect patients without asking them how or if they want to be protected.\"</p><p>See also: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.mmm-online.com/4-trends-with-the-potential-to-change-behavior-in-the-patient-journey/article/497978/\">4 trends with the potential to change behavior in the patient journey</url></p><p>And so everything becomes standardized. Stock images of actors replace real people in marketing. Or even better, stick figure illustrations assume the role of everyday people.</p><p>However, his clients are special, Frydman says. They are a new breed of healthcare executive that is doubling down on re-humanizing medicine by valuing all of the people involved in producing the drug, and not just the drug. True to his French roots, Frydman says, \"As long as medicine is run exclusively as a business,\" we will never truly understand the patient.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Sara Holoubek is CEO of Luminary Labs.

Major bourses tumbled into correction for the second time this year and closed below key technical levels. Elevated trade tensions between the United States and China along with weakness in large-cap tech stocks are cited to be the reasons for the free fall. The prospect of rising interest rates and lofty valuations are expected to trigger another stock market correction in the near term.Given the turmoil, investing in defensive companies seems prudent. </p><p>Such stocks provide risk-adjusted returns, consistent dividend and steady earnings growth regardless of the state of the equity market.How Did the Benchmarks Perform?The S...00 finished 2.2% lower at 2,581.88 on Apr 2, down 10.1% from its record high in Jan 26. The broader index closed below its 200-day moving average for the first time since the U.K.'s vote for Brexit in June 2016. The Dow Jones also closed below the aforesaid technical level, indicating further downtrend in the near future.Unlike the S...00 and the Dow Jones, the Nasdaq somehow managed to avoid a correction but it did lose more than 10% from its record high attained in March. This leaves all the three major indices in negative territory for the year, while the CNNMoney's Fear ...eed Index slipped further into 'extreme fear' territory.Global Trade WarSelling in stocks intensified after China decided to impose tariffs on about 130 U.S. goods, including a 25% charge on U.S. pork and 15% on fruits. The world's second largest economy retaliated against Trump's plan to slap tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum shipments.All these have not only weighed on U.S. meat producers as well as industrial stocks, investors panicked as a full-fledged trade war might deal a heavy blow to economies, resulting in widespread unemployment. It may also dent first-quarter corporate earnings results slated to release this month.Big Tech SelloffAdding to the downbeat tone is a sharp selloff in the technology sector. Investors remained concerned about tighter regulations for large tech companies. The sector took a beating following the backlash over Facebook, Inc's FB[1] handling of user data. Everyone raised questions as to how Cambridge Analytica, which worked on Trump's election campaign, had gained access to personal data on roughly 50 million Facebook users without their knowledge.Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN[2], in the meantime, slipped after Trump lashed out at the e-commerce company on its tax policy and subsequent effect on bricks-and-mortar retailers. Another tech major Intel CorporationINTC[3] took a beating after Apple Inc. decided to break away from the chip maker and make its own chips in its Mac computers as early as 2020.Electric car maker Tesla, Inc.TSLA[4] is also sinking after one of its driverless technology vehicles was involved in a fatal crash, while it recalled 123,000 Model S vehicles because of an issue related to a power steering component.Rate Hike FearsAmid all these, Jerome Powell-led Federal Reserve has hiked rates by a quarter-percentage point and projected a steeper path of rate hikes in 2019 and 2020.This hasn't gone down well with investors as we all know that they had piled up on U.S. stocks with the notion that quantitative easing will help the domestic economy grow at a better rate than emerging economies like China. After all, rate hikes will raise borrowing costs, eventually denting corporate profits and affecting the U.S. economy.How to Prepare for the SetbackAs the markets seem to be plagued with widespread uncertainty, defensive stocks seem to be the safest investment option. Such stocks are generally non-cyclical, or companies whose business performance and sales are not highly correlated with the activities in the larger market. Their products are in constant demand irrespective of market volatility and such names include companies from the utilities and consumer staples sectors.Utilities are deemed defensive stocks as electricity, gas and water are essentials. Food, beverage and tobacco companies are true defensive plays as demand for such staple stocks remains unaltered during market gyrations.5 Solid ChoicesWe have, thus, selected five solid stocks from the aforementioned defensive sectors that boast a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).UtilitiesCenterPoint Energy, Inc. CNP[5] operates as a public utility holding company in the United States. The stock has a Zacks Rank #1 and a dividend yield of 4.2%.

The company is expected to return 13.1% this year, better than the industry[6]'s estimated return of 6.7%.CMS Energy CorporationCMS[7] operates as an energy company primarily in Michigan. It operates through three segments: Electric Utility, Gas Utility, and Enterprises. The stock has a Zacks Rank #2 and a dividend yield of 3.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings rose 0.4% in the last 60 days. The company is expected to return 7.4% this year, better than the industry[8]'s estimated return of 6.7%.The AES CorporationAES[9] operates as a diversified power generation and utility company. The stock has a Zacks Rank #2 and a dividend yield of 3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings rose 2.6% in the last 60 days. The company is expected to return 10.6% this year, better than the industry[10]'s estimated return of 6.7%.

The company is expected to return 17.7% this year, better than the industry[15]'s estimated return of 16.4%.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

Let's look at five of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/best-stocks-to-buy-this-year\">best stocks to buy</url> for December as 2019 comes to a close: </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">-- Microsoft Corp.

(MSFT)</emphasis></p><p>The only major \" <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/best-tech-stocks-to-buy-this-year\">Big Tech</url>\" name not under antitrust scrutiny by U.S. regulators, Microsoft shareholders have been amply rewarded in 2019. MSFT put up the kind of year you might have expected in the 1990s, with shares up 47% in the first 11 months. </p><p>One reason MSFT is one of the best stocks to buy for December and beyond is this remarkable ability to post above-market growth despite its enormous size. Now worth more than $1 trillion, Microsoft has grown revenue at a compound rate of 11% and earnings by a compound rate of 34% over the last three years. </p><p>CEO Satya Nadella is largely responsible for impressive execution in recent years, pivoting the company to a software-as-a-service model and doubling down on the high-margin cloud. The 2016 acquisition of LinkedIn also continues paying dividends, with those revenues up 25% last quarter. </p><p>Microsoft's cloud division, Azure, grew by 59% last quarter, and Azure landed the coveted $10 billion JEDI contract with the Pentagon this year as well. Nadella was recently named Fortune's Businessperson of the Year. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ulta Beauty (ULTA)</emphasis></p><p>The largest beauty retailer in the U.S., Ulta has been growing at a healthy clip for years, focusing on expanding its store base and building customer loyalty. Differentiating itself by combining its retail presence with in-store salons, it stocks both great brand names and private label products, and offers a loyalty program that's proven successful. </p><p>The company continues growing, increasing its total square footage by 8% year-over-year in the last quarter. It now has over 1,200 locations. Same-store sales grew by 6.2% last quarter, a very healthy pace for retail. </p><p>Shares took a major dive after Ulta's last earnings announcement, with shares losing over 20% in a single day; the company missed top- and bottom-line estimates, and revised full-year guidance downward as it lamented soft consumer trends in the beauty space. </p><p>But this sell-off is precisely what makes ULTA one of the best stocks to buy for December. Analysts still expect roughly 10% growth in sales and earnings going forward, yet shares trade for a below-market 19 times earnings. </p><p>In late September there was a spate of insider buying, a bullish indicator. Ulta is scheduled to report quarterly earnings after market close on Dec. 5, so we will likely see big moves in ULTA stock -- for better or worse. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">United Rentals (URI)</emphasis></p><p>Equipment rental giant United Rentals also makes the cut as one of the best stocks to buy for December, showing that attractive stocks can come in all shapes and sizes. </p><p>Unlike Ulta, which has no long-term debt, URI loaded its balance sheet up with leverage in recent years as it aggressively pursued <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/stocks-to-watch-potential-m-a-targets\">acquisitions</url>. Purchases of fluid solutions specialist BakerCorp and construction rental business BlueLine began paying off this year, as free cash flow grew 101% in the first nine months of 2019. </p><p>[<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">READ</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/best-stocks-to-buy-for-the-5g-revolution\">7 of the Best Stocks to Buy for the 5G Revolution</url>]</p><p>As a result, URI shares are up about 50% year-to-date. And while the explosive growth in free cash flow isn't sustainable, shares still trade at extremely conservative multiples: 10.6 times trailing earnings and 7.7 times forward earnings. </p><p>That compares favorably to competitors Deere &amp; Company ( <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/de-deere-co\">DE</url>), which has a trailing P/E of 17.4 and a forward P/E of 15.9; Stanley Black &amp; Decker (       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/swk-stanley-black-decker-inc\">SWK</url>), which as a trailing P/E of 28.6 and a forward P/E of 17.5; and U-Haul parent Amerco (       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/uhal-amerco\">UHAL</url>), which boasts a trailing P/E of 19.2 and a forward P/E of 16.6. </p><p>URI chose the right time to lever up, adding debt in an era of unusually low interest rates. That said, it plans on reducing its net leverage ratio by year-end to 2.6 compared to 3.1 as of year-end 2018. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Universal Insurance Holdings (UVE)</emphasis></p><p>Property insurer Universal Insurance Holdings is arguably the least well-known company on this list, which, as longtime investors can attest, often means some of the most compelling risk-reward opportunities. </p><p>UVE stock, similar to Ulta, is a compelling buy largely because of a sell-off earlier this year that shares have yet to recover from. </p><p>While no obvious catalyst lies ahead in December, there has been a spate of recent insider buying, which again, has been shown to be a generally bullish indicator, all things considered. The $980 million company, which primarily sells homeowners insurance in Florida, recently authorized a $40 million <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/articles/2019-08-15/theres-a-worrisome-trend-in-share-buybacks\">stock buyback</url> through the end of 2021, amounting to over 4% of the company's overall value. </p><p>If, hypothetically, UVE earns the $3.30 per share analysts expect it to next year, and the 11.1 P/E ratio remains constant, shares should be worth $36.63 by early 2021. That indicates roughly 25% upside in just over a year. </p><p>Small-cap stocks like UVE also sometimes enjoy benefits in December from investors front-running the \"January effect,\" the tendency of small caps to outperform at the start of the New Year. </p><p>[<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">READ</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/dividends/slideshows/high-yield-stocks-with-growing-dividends\">8 High-Yield Stocks With Growing Dividends</url>]</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Medifast (MED)</emphasis></p><p>Last but not least is Medifast, a Baltimore, Maryland-based health and wellness company that's trading for multiples far lower than a company with its <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/best-growth-stocks-to-buy\">growth rate</url> should be subjected to. This is emblematic of a stock that's oversold due to market fears; despite sales growth of 37% last quarter, MED trades for 14 times earnings. </p><p>MED shares have sold off in 2019 after a security breach on its website compromised some customer information. That issue has since been remedied, and while a growth deceleration is expected, if analyst expectations for earnings going forward are even in the neighborhood, then MED stock is a steal. </p><p>The company, which sells weight loss products and nutrition-rich bars, shakes, puddings and other products, is trading for a price-earnings growth ratio of just 0.7. Legendary fund manager Bill Miller recently bought into the stock, as well as activist investor Glen Welling, who now own 15% of the company through his fund, Engaged Capital. </p><p>Shares boast a 3.5% <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/dividends/slideshows/best-dividend-stocks-to-buy-this-year\">dividend yield</url>.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, Ulta Beauty increased its total square footage by 8% year-over-year in the last quarter and now has over 1,200 locations., (John Greim/LightRocket via Getty Images)</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USNCOM-191202investing.beststocksdecember</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USNCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XN4-S811-JCKG-J537-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">297647</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1089\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 U.S. News &amp;

While investors are always hoping for earnings and revenue beats, they will also have their ears open for any updates from management on Intel's 10 nanometer (nm) processors. </p><p>Intel finally began shipping 10 nanometer processors in bulk in the third quarter and the company said the first 10 nm desktop processors will be shipping in early 2020. A positive 10 nm update on the earnings call could ease fears about market share losses to Advanced Micro Devices ( <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/amd-advanced-micro-devices-inc\">AMD</url>) that have weighed on the stock in recent years. </p><p>Intel shares are up 59% in the past five years, but they have significantly lagged competitors AMD and Nvidia Corp. ( <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/nvda-nvidia-corp\">NVDA</url>), which are both up more than 1,000% in that time. If it puts its production problems in the past, INTC stock is a compelling value at just 12.7 times forward earnings. It also pays a 2.1% dividend, a rarity in the tech sector. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Citigroup (C)</emphasis></p><p>Some analysts believe a late-2019 market rotation from growth stocks to <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/best-value-stocks-to-buy-now\">value stocks</url> will continue in 2020, and Citigroup shares are currently trading below their book value. </p><p>The latest commentary from the Federal Reserve suggests interest rates have finally stabilized, and falling rates should no longer create net interest margin pressures for big banks in 2020. </p><p>While global banks with high exposure to Europe are pressured by lackluster loan growth in the region, Citi has much higher exposure to high-growth regions such as Latin America and Asia. After years of selling assets to shore up its business following the 2008 financial crisis, Citigroup is now streamlined, well-capitalized and back on offense. </p><p>Citigroup trades at an earnings multiple of under 10 and pays a 2.6% <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/investing-101/articles/what-are-dividends-and-how-do-they-work\">dividend</url>. In addition, its aggressive share buyback program should continue to reduce share count and boost earnings per share. </p><p>Citigroup will report earnings on Jan. 14. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JD.com (JD)</emphasis></p><p>Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com managed to gain more than 73% in 2019 despite constant headlines about trade war tariffs and slowing economic growth in China. </p><p>Not only has the trade relationship between the U.S. and China seemingly improved since a preliminary phase one trade deal was announced in December, JD also proved to investors it can still outgrow U.S. e-commerce leader <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/articles/pros-cons-to-buying-amazon-amzn-stock\">Amazon</url> even as China's economy slows. </p><p>[<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">See:</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/best-restaurant-stocks-to-buy\">9 of the Best Restaurant Stocks to Buy in 2020.</url>]</p><p>China's massive population gives JD tremendous long-term growth potential. The latest economic projections suggest China's GDP will grow at 5.8% in 2020 compared to about 1.8% projected U.S. growth. In addition, China has an emerging middle class of younger consumers and JD is targeting less developed regions of the country in an attempt to gain market share. </p><p>JD shares surged more than 11% in December as investors piled back into China stocks following the <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/articles/2019-09-17/how-investors-can-win-in-the-china-trade-war\">trade war</url> progress. Investors can expect U.S. President Donald Trump to attempt to continue that momentum in 2020 rather than risk voters penalizing him for the trade war at the voting booth in November. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Canopy Growth Corp. (CGC)</emphasis></p><p>Most investors had a great year in 2019, but not cannabis investors. Vaping health concerns, disappointing revenue growth in the Canadian market and persistent heavy losses let the air out of cannabis stocks that had been big winners in 2018. </p><p>Canopy Growth was no exception, finishing 2019 down more than 28%. However, Canopy remains one of the best-positioned cannabis stocks heading into what could be a big rebound year for marijuana. </p><p>While competitors like Aurora Cannabis ( <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/acb-aurora-cannabis-inc\">ACB</url>) are struggling to raise capital, Canopy has the financial backing of global alcohol giant Constellation Brands (       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/stz-constellation-brands-inc\">STZ</url>), which holds roughly a 37% stake in Canopy. </p><p>In July, Canopy founder and CEO Bruce Linton left the company and former Canopy chief financial officer David Klein was named Linton's replacement. In the near-term, Canopy could be a potential buyout candidate for Constellation, according to Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Pablo Zuanic. </p><p>Not only is Canopy a Canadian cannabis market share leader, it recently announced a conditional buyout of U.S. Acreage Holdings (ACRGF) back in April. If the U.S. ultimately lifts the federal ban on marijuana, Acreage will give Canopy a significant first-mover advantage in the American market. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Walt Disney Co. (DIS)</emphasis></p><p>Walt Disney launched its highly anticipated Disney Plus streaming service in early November. By nearly any measure, Disney Plus has exceeded expectations in the early stages. </p><p>Disney reported more than 10 million Disney Plus subscribers within 48 hours of its launch. Cowen &amp; Company analysts estimate Disney Plus added 24 million total subscribers in the month of November. </p><p>Based on its own guidance, Disney hadn't even expected to hit the 20 million subscriber mark by the end of 2020. </p><p>At the same time, Disney clearly seems to be gaining share from market leader Netflix ( <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/nflx-netflix-inc\">NFLX</url>). Cowen analysts estimate       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/articles/pros-and-cons-of-buying-netflix-inc-nflx-stock\">Netflix</url> will lose about 1 million additional subscribers to Disney Plus in the fourth quarter. A recent Bank of America survey of 1,000 Americans who subscribe to both streaming services say they plan to eventually cancel Netflix in favor of Disney Plus. </p><p>Disney Plus has given Disney a much-needed potential long-term revenue growth source, a rarity for investors in the traditional media space. Investors will get their next major update on Disney Plus in early February when the company reports fourth-quarter numbers. </p><p>[<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">See:</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/top-investing-themes-for-the-next-decade\">10 Top Investing Themes for the Next Decade.</url>]</p><p>In addition to Disney Plus, \"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker\" generated $374 million in global ticket sales in its opening weekend in December. </p><p>Disney reported its studios have generated more than $10 billion in global box office sales in 2019, demolishing its previous record of $7.6 billion in 2016. </p><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, Citigroup has fully rebounded from the the 2008 financial crisis and is now streamlined, well-capitalized and back on offense., (Alex Tai/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USNCOM-191231investing.fivestocksjanuary</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USNCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XWR-MF31-JCKG-J17W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">297647</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1135\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 U.S. News &amp;

Whatever the reason, Apple logged $3.05 billion in short selling in July, more than any other U.S.-listed stock, Dusaniwsky says. </p><p/><p/><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alibaba (BABA)</emphasis></p><p> Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba has been perfectly positioned to benefit from the 2020 economic shutdown. Last quarter, Alibaba's online retail and cloud services businesses helped drive 51.9% adjusted net income growth and 37.7% revenue growth. </p><p>Alibaba accounts for about 56% of China's <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/retail-stocks-with-booming-online-businesses\">e-commerce</url> market, according to Statista. China's overall retail spending is on track to shrink by 4% this year, but eMarketer projects the nation's e-commerce spending will continue to grow by 16%. </p><p>In July, Alibaba announced a potential $200 billion <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/why-you-shouldnt-buy-an-ipo\">initial public offering</url> of affiliate Ant Group, in which Alibaba holds a 33% stake. </p><p>Short sellers may be betting political tensions between the U.S. and China will continue to rise heading into the November presidential election. Alibaba short sellers added $2.78 billion to their positions in July. </p><p/><p/><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Microsoft (MSFT)</emphasis></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/articles/pros-and-cons-to-buying-microsoft-msft-stock\">Microsoft</url> is another company with a business model that is immune from <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/stay-at-home-stocks-beating-the-coronavirus-blues\">work-from-home</url> disruption, and its share price performance in 2020 has reflected that advantage. Microsoft shares are up about 35% year to date, thanks to booming demand for cloud services and videoconferencing software. </p><p>The technology company reported 13% revenue growth last quarter, including 47% growth in Azure cloud revenue. Microsoft's gaming business is also booming, thanks to the current climate. Xbox content and services revenue was up 65% in the second quarter ahead of the Xbox Series X gaming console's launch later this year. </p><p>Microsoft short sellers may be anticipating a pullback with the company's market cap now at $1.6 trillion, or they may simply be using the stock as a tech hedge. Microsoft's short interest increased by $2.29 billion in the past month. </p><p/><p/><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tesla (TSLA)</emphasis></p><p> Electric vehicle maker <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/articles/tesla-inc-tsla-stock\">Tesla</url> has the most short interest of any stock in the world at $16.5 billion. Short sellers and value investors are baffled by the stock's valuation and performance. </p><p>Tesla shares are up almost 550% in the last year, yet the company recently reported a 4.9% drop in revenue in the second quarter. Second-quarter vehicle deliveries were also down 4.7% from a year ago, despite opening a factory in China and rolling out Model Y. </p><p>However, Tesla reported its fourth consecutive quarter of profits, making its stock eligible for inclusion in the <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/best-dividend-stocks-in-the-first-half-of-2020\">S&amp;P 500</url>. Tesla bears were quick to point out that electric vehicle regulatory credits sales, not auto sales, accounted for all of Tesla's net income in the second quarter. </p><p>Tesla shares now trade at 100 times forward earnings and 11.5 times sales, a valuation far beyond any <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/top-auto-related-stocks-to-buy\">auto peers</url> and even a sizable valuation premium relative to many high-growth tech stocks. </p><p>Tesla short sellers added $1.8 billion to their positions in the last month, bringing Tesla's short percent of float up to 7.3%, the highest among all five stocks. </p><p/><p/><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)</emphasis></p><p>Google parent company <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/articles/alphabet-inc-googl-goog-stock\">Alphabet</url>, including its YouTube video platform and its online advertising business, has been relatively resilient during the 2020 downturn. Its Waymo subsidiary is also among the global leaders in autonomous vehicle technology, potentially creating a significant long-term growth opportunity. </p><p>However, short sellers are likely concerned with the many risks facing big <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/best-tech-stocks-to-buy-this-year\">tech companies</url> these days, including the potential for higher taxes and increased regulation. CEO Sundar Pichai defended the company in July against antitrust charges before Congress. Alphabet also reported its first revenue decline in the second quarter. </p><p>Alphabet has the smallest short position of all five stocks mentioned at $4.88 billion. But Alphabet's short interest increased in July by $1.21 billion. </p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, Electric vehicle maker Tesla has the most short interest of any stock in the world at $16.5 billion, (Getty Images)</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USNCOM-200805investing.mostshorted</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USNCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60HT-M6W1-F02J-80NB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">297647</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"946\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 U.S. News &amp;

In fact, nothing about this deal makes sense given you have a tech giant that is known for the enterprise, President Trump tweeting about Tik Tok, legislators chiming in and a 45-day deal deadline.</p><p><br/>Sure, I've read a few Wall Street analysts do some mental gymnastics to argue for the Microsoft purchase of Tik Tok. Depending on price ($10 billion too good to pass up and $50 billion crazy), Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is going to have some explaining to do.<br/>With all that said, here is a bit of informed speculation about why this Microsoft-Tik Tok lunacy is happening.<br/>1. The Department of Defense's JEDI cloud contract is to be announced soon. Microsoft won the $10 billion cloud contract over Amazon Web Services for the military's cloud transformation contract. Trump isn't exactly a fan of Amazon or CEO Jeff Bezos, who owns the Washington Post. Microsoft and AWS have been duking it out in court throughout 2019 and 2020 and now the JEDI contract will be reannounced potentially this month after an Inspector General report.\u00a0<br/>See the calendar overlap here? If you do then you're a cynical person like me. Perhaps there is no connection, but it's not a reach to envision a JEDI contract being mentioned in the same breath as a buyout of Tik Tok. Disclosure: This is my cynical opinion, but the timing makes me go hmm.<br/>2. Microsoft is grabbing headlines about Tik Tok to avoid questions about why the software and cloud giant isn't buying Arm from Softbank. Clearly, Microsoft has $40 billion or so burning a hole in its pocket. Softbank is looking to sell Arm and Nvidia is reportedly interested. Surely, other companies (Apple, Qualcomm and perhaps AMD and Intel) would be interested in Arm too, but the purchase of that chip intellectual property would face regulatory hurdles. Generally speaking, Arm is best held with a company not in the mobile game and Microsoft could be a good fit. Microsoft, which knows a bit about licensing, would probably do well with Arm. Why not bid for Arm over Tik Tok?<br/>3. Microsoft just can't quit you consumers. Microsoft just scrapped Mixer, started Band and then killed it and had the Windows Phone debacle. And remember when Cortana was going to thump Alexa, Google Assistant and Siri? Oh yeah, Cortana didn't exactly thrive (still could beat Siri though but whatever) and has gone corporate. Now Microsoft has a consumer success with Xbox and hasn't screwed up Minecraft, but the Tik Tok hurdles are much larger. Microsoft can't just buy Tik Tok and leave it alone. The company will have all sorts of data, privacy and integration issues.<br/>4. Microsoft may be able to get Tik Tok at a fire sale price. We don't know what Tik Tok would really fetch given that it's on the US government's hit list. Maybe Microsoft can get Tik Tok for really cheap. The problem here is that Microsoft can't exactly flip Tik Tok to Facebook after those big tech House hearings. Tik Tok may be one complicated reference customer for Microsoft Azure.<br/>5. Nadella has done too well as CEO of Microsoft. It's hard to find any Nadella flops with Microsoft. Perhaps Nadella is miffed that he wasn't viewed as big tech monopolist to Washington DC pols and wants a Steve Ballmer type moment to get attention. If Microsoft buys Tik Tok rest assured Nadella will get attention.\u00a0<br/>In the end, I'd argue that Microsoft should walk (actually run) from this Tik Tok talk. There are simply too many headaches and let the Feds figure out how to shut down Tik Tok and annoy users that may just have turned 18 and can vote. \u00a0<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-M1291588</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60HC-3F71-DYDW-726K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"603\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 4, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><classCode>CC0001X0M</classCode><className>INTEL CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0001YLV</classCode><className>NVIDIA CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0001QUW</classCode><className>QUALCOMM INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>NAICS334413 SEMICONDUCTOR &amp;

In fact, nothing about...</p><p>It's hard to know what to make of this Microsoft acquiring Tik Tok talk, but here are some theories on why this wacky merger dance is happening now.    Microsoft's talks to acquire Tik Tok don't make a whole lot of sense on the surface. In fact, nothing about this deal makes sense given you have a tech giant that is known for the enterprise, President Trump tweeting about Tik Tok , legislators chiming in and a 45-day deal deadline.   Sure, I've read a few Wall Street analysts do some mental gymnastics to argue for the Microsoft purchase of Tik Tok . Depending on price ($10 billion too good to pass up and $50 billion crazy), Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is going to have some explaining to do.   With all that said, here is a bit of informed speculation about why this Microsoft-Tik Tok lunacy is happening.   1.  The Department of Defense's JEDI cloud contract is to be announced soon. Microsoft won the $10 billion cloud contract over Amazon Web Services for the military's cloud transformation contract. Trump isn't exactly a fan of Amazon or CEO Jeff Bezos, who owns the Washington Post. Microsoft and AWS have been duking it out in court throughout 2019 and 2020 and now the JEDI contract will be reannounced potentially this month after an Inspector General report .    See the calendar overlap here? If you do then you're a cynical person like me. Perhaps there is no connection, but it's not a reach to envision a JEDI contract being mentioned in the same breath as a buyout of Tik Tok. Disclosure: This is my cynical opinion, but the timing makes me go hmm.    2.  Microsoft is grabbing headlines about Tik Tok to avoid questions about why the software and cloud giant isn't buying Arm from Softbank. Clearly, Microsoft has $40 billion or so burning a hole in its pocket. Softbank is looking to sell Arm and Nvidia is reportedly interested . Surely, other companies (Apple, Qualcomm and perhaps AMD and Intel) would be interested in Arm too, but the purchase of that chip intellectual property would face regulatory hurdles. Generally speaking, Arm is best held with a company not in the mobile game and Microsoft could be a good fit. Microsoft, which knows a bit about licensing, would probably do well with Arm. Why not bid for Arm over Tik Tok?   3. Microsoft just can't quit you consumers. Microsoft just scrapped Mixer , started Band and then killed it and had the Windows Phone debacle. And remember when Cortana was going to thump Alexa, Google Assistant and Siri? Oh yeah, Cortana didn't exactly thrive (still could beat Siri though but whatever) and has gone corporate . Now Microsoft has a consumer success with Xbox and hasn't screwed up Minecraft, but the Tik Tok hurdles are much larger. Microsoft can't just buy Tik Tok and leave it alone. The company will have all sorts of data, privacy and integration issues.      4. Microsoft may be able to get Tik Tok at a fire sale price. We don't know what Tik Tok would really fetch given that it's on the US government's hit list. Maybe Microsoft can get Tik Tok for really cheap. The problem here is that Microsoft can't exactly flip Tik Tok to Facebook after those big tech House hearings. Tik Tok may be one complicated reference customer for Microsoft Azure.   5. Nadella has done too well as CEO of Microsoft. It's hard to find any Nadella flops with Microsoft. Perhaps Nadella is miffed that he wasn't viewed as big tech monopolist to Washington DC pols and wants a Steve Ballmer type moment to get attention. If Microsoft buys Tik Tok rest assured Nadella will get attention.    In the end, I'd argue that Microsoft should walk (actually run) from this Tik Tok talk. There are simply too many headaches and let the Feds figure out how to shut down Tik Tok and annoy users that may just have turned 18 and can vote.  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42754291422</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60H8-VSD1-F07F-8472-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"675\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>ZDNet</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 3, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"80\"><classCode>CC0001X0M</classCode><className>INTEL CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0001YLV</classCode><className>NVIDIA CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0001QUW</classCode><className>QUALCOMM INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"80\"><className>NAICS334413 SEMICONDUCTOR &amp;

So, when investors are willing to buy stocks en masse above a level like S&amp;P 1,600, it bodes well for the strength of the market. It means that buying is still convicted as the market makes much more conspicuous higher highs.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/5-stocks-under-10-set-surge.html\">&gt;&gt;5 Stocks Under $10 Set to Surge</url>That bodes well for Mr. Market's upside potential as we round the corner to summer. To take full advantage, we're turning to a new set of      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/rhinostocks/portfolio/rocket-stocks-for-the-week-ending-may-10/\">Rocket Stock names</url>.For the uninitiated, \"Rocket Stocks\" are our list of companies with short-term gain catalysts and longer-term growth potential. To find them, I run a weekly quantitative screen that seeks out stocks with a combination of analyst upgrades and positive earnings surprises to identify rising analyst expectations, a bullish signal for stocks in any market. After all, where analysts' expectations are increasing, institutional cash often follows. In the last 198 weeks, our weekly list of five plays has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 75.4%.Without further ado, here's a look at      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/rhinostocks/portfolio/rocket-stocks-for-the-week-ending-may-10/\">this week's Rocket Stocks</url>.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/5-hated-stocks-could-pop-may.html\">&gt;&gt;5 Hated Stocks That Could Pop in May</url><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Coca-Cola</emphasis>=\"Scripts/swfobject_modified.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;</p><h>Content on this page requires a newer version of Adobe Flash Player.</h><p>First up is<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Coca-Cola</emphasis>(<url normalizedValue=\"http://stockpickr.com/symbol/KO/\">KO</url>). Coke is the biggest non-alcoholic beverage company in the world, selling around 3% of all of the beverages served globally every single day. That's enormous scale any way you slice it. As things start heating up this summer, so too should Coke's sales numbers. The firms brands include the obvious marques -- such as Coke and Diet Coke -- as well as less obvious names such as Sprite, Dasani and Poweraid.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/5-dividend-stocks-ready-give-you-raise.html-1\">&gt;&gt;5 Dividend Stocsk Ready to Give You a Raise</url>Coke's network is one of its biggest assets. The firm has distribution in more than 200 countries, giving the firm efficient reach that's nearly impossible to replicate. And it shows: Coke earns 70% of its sales outside of the U.S., diversification that few blue-chips can even boast. As the firm continues courting consumers in emerging markets, it should be able to materially grow its sales over the next several years -- no small feat for a firm that moved $48 billion worth of drinks in 2012.There's no question that Coke is a defensive name; the firm's product is recession-resistant, it pays a 2.65% dividend yield, and it sports a solid balance sheet. But with quality leading in performance in 2013, that's panned out to stellar 16.5% performance year-to-date. Investors can expect that performance to keep rolling.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Altria</emphasis>=\"Scripts/swfobject_modified.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;</p><h>Content on this page requires a newer version of Adobe Flash Player.</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Altria</emphasis>(<url normalizedValue=\"http://stockpickr.com/symbol/MO/\">MO</url>) is dying, but that shouldn't stop you from buying it. The $73 billion company is one of the biggest tobacco names in the world, with brands such as Marlboro under its belt. The problem is that Altria only represents the U.S. business of legacy tobacco giant Philip Morris (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Philip Morris International</emphasis>(      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://stockpickr.com/symbol/PMI/\">PMI</url>) is the non-U.S. side of the business). With tobacco sales slowly declining here at home, selling cigarettes isn't exactly a growth opportunity.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/4-big-stocks-traders-radars.html-0\">&gt;&gt;4 Big Stocsk on Traders' Radars</url>But the key word there is that the declines are slow, and as long as that remains the case, Altria will remain a cash cow that throws off a huge dividend payout -- a 4.82% yield right now. In the meantime, Altria has been expanding its portfolio in the \"sin stock\" world, expanding its exposure to alcohol with a 27% stake in<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SABMiller</emphasis>(      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://stockpickr.com/symbol/SBMRY/\">SBMRY</url>) and a wholly owned winemaker in Ste. Michelle Wine Estates. That's a big departure from the firm's former ownership of<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kraft Foods</emphasis>(      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://stockpickr.com/symbol/KRFT/\">KRFT</url>), but it's one that makes a whole lot more sense in my view.Regulations continue to put a very tight leash on cigarette makers' marketing efforts, and on new product offerings. But all of those challenges are already priced into shares. Customer stickiness is extremely high in the tobacco business, and that helps offset some of the marketing hurdles that Altria's faced with. As the firm continues to diversify outside of tobacco, it should stay relevant to investors. Until then, its dividend makes it worth buying for income.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Union Pacific</emphasis>=\"Scripts/swfobject_modified.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;</p><h>Content on this page requires a newer version of Adobe Flash Player.</h><p>2013 has been a strong year for shares of<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Union Pacific</emphasis>(<url normalizedValue=\"http://stockpickr.com/symbol/UNP/\">UNP</url>). Shares of the $70 billion railroad stock have rallied almost 19% this year, buoyed by overall strength in the transports sector. UNP is the largest railroad on the continent, with more than 32,000 miles of track that links 23 states, Canada and Mexico. That scale puts the firm in a strong position to grab more freight volume as the economy warms up.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/5-stocks-poised-breakouts.html-31\">&gt;&gt;5 Stocks Poised for Breakouts</url>While oil prices have dipped recently, they're still on the high end of their historic range, and that actually bodes well for railroads. In general, rail shipping costs around one-fourth as much as trucking does per ton shipped, a cost advantage that typically sends customers setting aside the convenience factor of truck freight once fuel prices get past a certain point. The firm's hefty commodity exposure is a little less attractive right now, but that hasn't stopped Union Pacific from posting impressive revenue numbers lately. UNP has a deep economic moat. Railroad assets aren't easily copied by rivals - and they're extremely costly to maintain. While that does mean that UNP has some hefty fixed costs to overcome, its scale easily makes up for that drawback. With much better efficiency than the firm had just a couple of years ago, Union Pacific looks well positioned for 2013. We're betting on shares of this Rocket Stock this week.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Costco Wholesale</emphasis>=\"Scripts/swfobject_modified.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;</p><h>Content on this page requires a newer version of Adobe Flash Player.</h><p>Investors should love<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Costco Wholesale</emphasis>(<url normalizedValue=\"http://stockpickr.com/symbol/COST/\">COST</url>) in 2013 -- and not just when they're trying to buy ketchup by the gallon. Costco isn't the biggest club warehouse in terms of locations, but it is the best. Costco's 430 locations boast much higher revenues per square foot than competitors like BJ's or Sam's Club (around twice as much, in fact) thanks to a niche of selling bargain-priced big-ticket items. That niche also keeps Costco's customer mix skewed towards \"mass affluent\" consumers.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/5-stocks-insiders-love-right-now.html-25\">&gt;&gt;5 Stocks Insiders Love Right Now</url>Costco operates a membership model, which means that only the firm's 64 million members can shop in its stores. That membership restriction provides Costco with a recurring revenue stream, and (more significantly), a very loyal and sticky customer base. Because consumers are less likely to carry memberships from competing wholesale clubs, Costco's existing base of higher-spending customers gives the firm a shallow economic moat vs. its peers.Because COST earns the majority of its profits from those membership fees, it's able to charge very low prices for its merchandise. Financially, Costco is in stellar shape. The firm carries close to a billion dollars in net cash, a hefty amount of dry powder for a retailer. As consumers keep spending in 2013, Costco should keep rallying.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TJX</emphasis>=\"Scripts/swfobject_modified.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;</p><h>Content on this page requires a newer version of Adobe Flash Player.</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TJX</emphasis>(<url normalizedValue=\"http://stockpickr.com/symbol/TJX/\">TJX</url>) is another name that's had a strong retail rally in 2013. Shares of the $35 billion off-price retailer have climbed close to 17% so far in 2013. TJX owns an attractive collection of discount retail names that includes T.J. Maxx, Marshall's and HomeGoods - three store chains that benefit when consumers want to seek out a bargain.TJX is the standard bearer in the off-price retail segment, the firm's stores stock major brand name clothing, accessories and housewares at prices that are fairly dramatic discounts to their retail costs. Better, full-price retailers and manufacturers need TJX because the firm is willing to buy massive swaths of excess inventory.The firm's suppliers can hypothetically bypass the middle-man by opting to sell last season's fashions at their own outlet stores, for most it's not a feasible model. Retail is extremely capital intense, and TJX provides a top-line boost to its suppliers with zero risk. Those factors should keep quality inventory flowing to TJX's stores for the foreseeable future.

And Apple still looks like it has higher prices in store as 2014 comes to a close. <br/>Apple continues to hit new-sales high notes. Last quarter, the firm sold a record breaking 39.3 million iPhones, thanks to better-than-forecast sales of the larger iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus handsets. And next year, Apple makes the transition into wearables with the Apple Watch. Apple's strategy is built around offering innovative software features that drive demand for higher-cost (and higher-margin) hardware. And once customers are in, they're likely to keep spending money within the Apple ecosystem, fueling sales at the firm's iTunes and App Stores. <br/>The introduction of Apple Pay this month is another potential coup for the Cupertino, Calif.-based company.

In short, its business is built around helping oil and gas producers pull commodities out of the ground as efficiently as possible. The firm's menu of services ranges from seismic surveys to well drilling and positioning and everything in between; as a result, SLB is omnipresent on oilfields around the world. It makes sense, then, that the firm's been getting squeezed as dropping oil prices ratchet down oil producers' incentives to keep costlier well sites online. <br/>But the cost pressures in the oil business are also making Schlumberger's value proposition more impactful. For instance, because SLB helps reduce the costs of pulling oil out of the ground, E&amp;Ps need it when prices drop. Schlumberger's ideal middle ground comes when producers are squeezed enough to want to cut costs, but not enough to close well sites. After selling off hard, SLB looks ready to rebound in the final week of October. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Must Read:</emphasis>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/5-stocks-poised-breakouts.html-58\">5 Stocks Poised for Breakouts</url><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">UnitedHealth Group</emphasis><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">UnitedHealth Group</emphasis> (       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://stockpickr.com/symbol/UNH/\">UNH</url> ) is the largest managed care organization in the country. The firm provides coverage to more than 40 million members, and its network extends worldwide to more than 85 million individuals who use UNH in some capacity. Size comes with serious advantages in the healthcare world: UNH's unparalleled scale means that the firm has leverage over medical providers, which in turn drives cost-conscious patients to turn to UNH's services. <br/>Unlike most of its domestic peers, UnitedHealth is one of the few U.S. health insurance providers that has exposure overseas. The firm acquired Brazilian health insurer Amil in 2012, gaining exposure to a fast-growing market with starkly different dynamics than we face here at home. In all, it has some business in 125 different countries. Meanwhile, domestically, an aging U.S. population is providing a tailwind for UNH as patients seek higher coverage levels and network providers with the lowest out of pocket costs. <br/>With major health care regulation changes, UNH has been moving more of its efforts from health insurance to healthcare administration, a more lucrative and less regulated business that benefits from the aging U.S. demographics. Likewise, exposure to Medicare and Medicaid provide an important low-risk source of revenues at UnitedHealth. With rising analyst sentiment in this name this week, we're betting on shares. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Must Read:</emphasis>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/5-stocks-under-10-set-soar.html-83\">5 Stocks Under $10 Set to Soar</url><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Delta Air Lines</emphasis><br/><br/>2014 has been a blockbuster year for $33 billion airline company <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Delta Air Lines</emphasis> (       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://stockpickr.com/symbol/DAL/\">DAL</url> ). Shares are up more than 43% since the start of the year. Delta and its peers are enjoying a cyclical upswing in the airline business right now, as profitability and passenger volumes ratchet higher. The dropping cost of oil is a major plus for Delta in the fourth quarter. Fuel is the single largest expense for an airline, so even moderate crude oil price decreases can have major positive effects on Delta's bottom line. <br/>That's particularly true for Delta, which went a nontraditional route with its fuel hedging by going out and buying an oil refinery. Delta's Monroe Energy's subsidiary refines approximately 200,000 barrels of crude per day at its Trainer refinery in Delaware. <br/>Delta is one of the country's legacy air carriers and one of the largest airlines in the world. The firm's fleet includes more than 720 aircraft serving approximately 250 mainline locations around the globe. Delta also owns a large stake in UK carrier Virgin Atlantic, a deal that gives the firm access to more lucrative trans-Atlantic routes through codeshare agreements. Recent changes to Delta's frequent flyer program will put the onus on travelers' dollars spent at the airline, rather than just miles flown, putting the incentives for Delta's most lucrative customers in line with the firm's bottom line. <br/>Delta is consistently a first-mover in the airline business. Look for the firm to continue to enjoy best-in-breed profitability and traffic volumes. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Must Read:</emphasis>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thestreet.com/story/12867153/1/10-stocks-billionaire-john-paulson-loves-in-2014.html\">10 Stocks Billionaire John Paulson Loves in 2014</url><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Illinois Tool Works</emphasis><br/><br/>Last up on our Rocket Stocks list this week is <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Illinois Tool Works</emphasis> (       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://stockpickr.com/symbol/ITW/\">ITW</url> ), an industrial manufacturing company that makes everything from car seat heaters to commercial ovens. All told, the firm has more than 100 individual business units in 58 countries. As it happens, that number is actually <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">low</emphasis> compared with ITW's historic diversification -- the firm has trimmed its division count from 800 over the past several years. Focusing on the most lucrative corners of its empire has had a palpable effect on overall profitability at ITW. <br/>Previously, one of the most notable aspect's of ITW's structure was the fact that it operated on a decentralized model. In other words, it gave managers enough rope to hang themselves. That operational freedom helped grow the firm at a breakneck pace, but the tradeoff was that ITW couldn't leverage its scale for bigger returns. With the firm's re-focus on its most profitable segments, ITW is changing that. While management will still have autonomy over their individual units, they'll centralize some back office and buying functions to increase efficiency. <br/>From a financial standpoint, ITW is in good shape. The firm has a $4.8 billion cash position that helps to offset its reasonable $7.5 billion debt load -- and it consistently earns net profit margins that come in above 10%.

After selling off hard, SLB looks ready to rebound in the final week of October.</p><p>Must Read:<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/5-stocks-poised-breakouts.html-58\">5 Stocks Poised for Breakouts</url></p><p>UnitedHealth Group</p><p>UnitedHealth Group is the largest managed care organization in the country. The firm provides coverage to more than 40 million members, and its network extends worldwide to more than 85 million individuals who use UNH in some capacity. Size comes with serious advantages in the healthcare world: UNH's unparalleled scale means that the firm has leverage over medical providers, which in turn drives cost-conscious patients to turn to UNH's services.</p><p>Unlike most of its domestic peers, UnitedHealth is one of the few U.S. health insurance providers that has exposure overseas. The firm acquired Brazilian health insurer Amil in 2012, gaining exposure to a fast-growing market with starkly different dynamics than we face here at home. In all, it has some business in 125 different countries. Meanwhile, domestically, an aging U.S. population is providing a tailwind for UNH as patients seek higher coverage levels and network providers with the lowest out of pocket costs.</p><p>With major health care regulation changes, UNH has been moving more of its efforts from health insurance to healthcare administration, a more lucrative and less regulated business that benefits from the aging U.S. demographics. Likewise, exposure to Medicare and Medicaid provide an important low-risk source of revenues at UnitedHealth. With rising analyst sentiment in this name this week, we're betting on shares.</p><p>Must Read:<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/5-stocks-under-10-set-soar.html-83\">5 Stocks Under $10 Set to Soar</url></p><p>Delta Air Lines</p><p>2014 has been a blockbuster year for $33 billion airline company Delta Air Lines . Shares are up more than 43% since the start of the year. Delta and its peers are enjoying a cyclical upswing in the airline business right now, as profitability and passenger volumes ratchet higher. The dropping cost of oil is a major plus for Delta in the fourth quarter. Fuel is the single largest expense for an airline, so even moderate crude oil price decreases can have major positive effects on Delta's bottom line.</p><p>That's particularly true for Delta, which went a nontraditional route with its fuel hedging by going out and buying an oil refinery. Delta's Monroe Energy's subsidiary refines approximately 200,000 barrels of crude per day at its Trainer refinery in Delaware.</p><p>Delta is one of the country's legacy air carriers and one of the largest airlines in the world. The firm's fleet includes more than 720 aircraft serving approximately 250 mainline locations around the globe. Delta also owns a large stake in UK carrier Virgin Atlantic, a deal that gives the firm access to more lucrative trans-Atlantic routes through codeshare agreements. Recent changes to Delta's frequent flyer program will put the onus on travelers' dollars spent at the airline, rather than just miles flown, putting the incentives for Delta's most lucrative customers in line with the firm's bottom line.</p><p>Delta is consistently a first-mover in the airline business.

All told, the firm has more than 100 individual business units in 58 countries. As it happens, that number is actually low compared with ITW's historic diversification -- the firm has trimmed its division count from 800 over the past several years. Focusing on the most lucrative corners of its empire has had a palpable effect on overall profitability at ITW.</p><p>Previously, one of the most notable aspect's of ITW's structure was the fact that it operated on a decentralized model. In other words, it gave managers enough rope to hang themselves. That operational freedom helped grow the firm at a breakneck pace, but the tradeoff was that ITW couldn't leverage its scale for bigger returns. With the firm's re-focus on its most profitable segments, ITW is changing that. While management will still have autonomy over their individual units, they'll centralize some back office and buying functions to increase efficiency.</p><p>From a financial standpoint, ITW is in good shape. The firm has a $4.8 billion cash position that helps to offset its reasonable $7.5 billion debt load -- and it consistently earns net profit margins that come in above 10%.

The $617 billion tech giant is up more than 31% since the calendar flipped to January, hitting new split-adjusted all time highs thanks to a <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thestreet.com/story/12877576/1/its-not-too-late-to-buy-apple--but-hurry-up.html\">bargain bin valuation</url> and fast product growth. And Apple still looks like it has higher prices in store as 2014 comes to a close.</p><p>Apple continues to hit new-sales high notes. Last quarter, the firm sold a record breaking 39.3 million iPhones, thanks to better-than-forecast sales of the larger iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus handsets. And next year, Apple makes the transition into wearables with the Apple Watch. Apple's strategy is built around offering innovative software features that drive demand for higher-cost (and higher-margin) hardware. And once customers are in, they're likely to keep spending money within the Apple ecosystem, fueling sales at the firm's iTunes and App Stores.</p><p>The introduction of Apple Pay this month is another potential coup for the Cupertino, Calif.-based company.

Since the start of July, shares of SLB have fallen close to 20%, dragged down by pressure from falling oil prices. The drop in Schulberger has been <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thestreet.com/story/12876481/2/5-toxic-stocks-to-sell-now.html\">pretty predictable so far</url> , but SLB is starting to show some signs of strength this fall.</p><p>Schlumberger is the largest oil servicer in the world. In short, its business is built around helping oil and gas producers pull commodities out of the ground as efficiently as possible. The firm's menu of services ranges from seismic surveys to well drilling and positioning and everything in between; as a result, SLB is omnipresent on oilfields around the world. It makes sense, then, that the firm's been getting squeezed as dropping oil prices ratchet down oil producers' incentives to keep costlier well sites online.</p><p>But the cost pressures in the oil business are also making Schlumberger's value proposition more impactful. For instance, because SLB helps reduce the costs of pulling oil out of the ground, E&amp;Ps need it when prices drop. Schlumberger's ideal middle ground comes when producers are squeezed enough to want to cut costs, but not enough to close well sites. After selling off hard, SLB looks ready to rebound in the final week of October.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Must Read:</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/5-stocks-poised-breakouts.html-58\">5 Stocks Poised for Breakouts</url><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">UnitedHealth Group</emphasis><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">UnitedHealth Group</emphasis><br/> is the largest managed care organization in the country.

Recent changes to Delta's frequent flyer program will put the onus on travelers' dollars spent at the airline, rather than just miles flown, putting the incentives for Delta's most lucrative customers in line with the firm's bottom line.</p><p>Delta is consistently a first-mover in the airline business.

As it happens, that number is actually <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">low</emphasis> compared with ITW's historic diversification -- the firm has trimmed its division count from 800 over the past several years. Focusing on the most lucrative corners of its empire has had a palpable effect on overall profitability at ITW.</p><p>Previously, one of the most notable aspect's of ITW's structure was the fact that it operated on a decentralized model. In other words, it gave managers enough rope to hang themselves. That operational freedom helped grow the firm at a breakneck pace, but the tradeoff was that ITW couldn't leverage its scale for bigger returns. With the firm's re-focus on its most profitable segments, ITW is changing that. While management will still have autonomy over their individual units, they'll centralize some back office and buying functions to increase efficiency.</p><p>From a financial standpoint, ITW is in good shape.

Here's a look at five stocks that could still blast off in the final months of 2016...</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The correction continues--after giving back just under 1% of its returns last week, the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">S&amp;P 500</emphasis> is up only 3.37% since the calendar flipped to January. But that stat doesn't tell the whole story for stocks in 2016.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a lot of ways, we're getting a repeat of 2015. While the big averages put up uninspiring numbers this fall, the individual stocks that are working this year are <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">really</emphasis> working. Just about 60% of the S&amp;P is actually up year-to-date. Of those stocks, almost two-thirds are up 10% or more. Put simply, this is a market of stocks that are up a lot and down a lot, with few in between--and that means stock picking still matters a lot in this environment.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To get on the right side of the price action, we're turning to a new set of \"Rocket Stocks\" worth buying for gains this October.</p><p>For the uninitiated, Rocket Stocks is our list of companies with short-term gain catalysts and longer-term growth potential. To find them, I run a weekly quantitative screen that seeks out stocks with a combination of analyst upgrades and positive earnings surprises to identify rising analyst expectations, a bullish signal for stocks in any market. After all, where analysts' expectations are increasing, institutional cash often follows. In the past 370 weeks, our weekly list of five plays has outperformed the S&amp;P 500's record-breaking run by 79.73%.</p><p>Without further ado, here's a look at this week's Rocket Stocks.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Intel Corp.</emphasis><br/></p><p>Leading off our list of outperformers is semiconductor giant <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Intel Corp.  </emphasis>, a megacap stock that's been no stranger to our Rocket Stocks list in 2016, and for good reason. Year-to-date, Intelhas handed investors total returns of 11.5%--and this stock looks positioned to keep on outperforming in the final stretch of the year. That's doubly true now, following a surprise boost to guidance last month that could potentially point to an end to the biggest black cloud that's hovered over Intel's share price this year: pressured PC sales.</p><p>Inteldominates the processor business, with about 80% market share, making the firm the largest semiconductor company on the planet. That huge market share means that Intelhas more scale for R&amp;D and negotiating with PC makers. It also means that Intelbenefits disproportionately from improvements in the PC business. Expansion to mobile chips has been slow for Intel, particularly as major OEMs like <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Apple\u00a0  \u00a0</emphasis>and Samsung develop processors in-house for their flagship phones. Intel's market penetration in PCs and high-end servers should remain relatively more attractive (with fatter margins) than mobile components.</p><p>Financially, Intelis in strong shape. The firm boasts about $3 billion in net cash after all of its debt has been accounted for, leaving Intelplenty of room on its balance sheet to return value to investors or apply leverage for acquisitions. Buyers are clearly in control of the price action in Intelright now--and shares are hovering at 52-week highs this fall.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Adobe Systems</emphasis><br/></p><p>$53 billion software stock <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Adobe Systems\u00a0  </emphasis>\u00a0is another big tech stock that made our cut of Rocket Stocks this week. Like Intel, Adobe has been a notable leader in 2016, up almost 15% since the calendar flipped to January. And it's another stock that's hitting 52-week highs in October at the same time the rest of the broad market is retreating.</p><p>Adobe's software is used by creative and marketing professionals to make and promote digital content. The firm's best-known content creation applications include Photoshop, Acrobat, Dreamweaver and After Effects, which are used by creative professionals the world over to create images, videos, page layouts and Web sites. As the standard toolbox for creatives, Adobe has a built-in advantage versus rivals--after sinking the time to learn a complicated software package and build a collection of digital assets in a file format, users are less likely to abandon it.</p><p>Adobe has been a pioneer in the cloud software business, transitioning from selling one-time licenses for its software to selling users ongoing Creative Cloud subscriptions that keep the latest version of its applications on those users' machines. That move not only smooths out revenues, it also tamps down the sticker shock of getting access to Adobe's tools, which previously could cost thousands of dollars. That lower barrier to entry should be especially important in emerging markets, where piracy has been a persistent challenge for Adobe. Moving to the cloud changes that problem--and customer adoption has been ahead of schedule to-date. Look for this outperformer to keep beating the rest of the market.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Southern Co.</emphasis><br/></p><p>Utilities are in focus in 2016. As the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fed</emphasis> continues to tease investors over the prospect of an interest rate hike before year's end, the rate sensitivity of high-yield stocks like utilities has helped to propel this usually boring sector higher than most this year. And <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Southern Co.  \u00a0</emphasis>has been one of the best of the breed, up more than 8% in the past nine months.</p><p>Southern Co. is the local power company for more than 9 million customers in Alabama, Florida, Georgia and Mississippi. The firm also owns more than 44,000 megawatts of generating capacity, and more recently, seven gas distribution companies through its acquisition of AGL Resources, which closed at the start of July. Between an attractive regulatory environment and expansion into far more territory through the AGL acquisition at the same time natgas prices are hovering near lows, Southern looks attractive long-term.</p><p>The regulated utility business is attractive because there aren't many surprises. That's particularly important for high-yield dividend payers like Southern, which hands out a 4.4% annual payout to investors. In an environment where yield is hard to come by, Southern should continue to look particularly attractive to income investors, who are paying a premium for that recurring yield. After correcting at the end of September, Southern is taking off for higher ground again in October.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PayPal</emphasis><br/></p><p>The global push to cashless payments continues to be a major tailwind for <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PayPal  </emphasis>, which went public last summer in a long-awaited spinoff from online marketplace operator <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">eBay  </emphasis>. PayPal operates one of the largest independent closed-loop payment networks on the planet, with more than 188 million active users worldwide. And as the rising tide of electronic payments buoys the whole industry, PayPal has some of the biggest growth potential.</p><p>PayPal offers solutions for consumers as well as merchants, with more than $282 billion in total payment volume last year. The firm's independence is an important selling point--banks, merchants and credit card companies are more apt to work with PayPal than they are with a network that's owned by a company that competes with them. Smart acquisitions, like the purchase of payment processor Briantree (which included peer-to-peer payment service Venmo), have greatly increased PayPal's presence in the brick-and-mortar retail space, making it far more appealing for consumers in the process.</p><p>Financially, PayPal continues to look attractive, with no debt and just under $5 billion in cash. At current price levels, that means that PayPal's balance sheet pays for about 10% of its market capitalization, providing investors with some pretty meaningful risk reduction here. This stock's upside is likely to keep on climbing in 2016.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CSX Corp.</emphasis><br/></p><p>Rounding out our list of Rocket Stocks this week is $29 billion railroad stock <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CSX Corp.  </emphasis>. CSX corrected hard in 2015, and this stock has been playing catch-up this year, up nearly 20% since the calendar flipped to January. That rebound should continue to accelerate as commodity prices rally and the dollar softens this fall.</p><p>CSX is one of the biggest railroad operators in the U.S., with more than 20,000 miles of track focused on the eastern half of the country. The firm has huge commodity exposure, both in its operating costs and its shipment volume. It may seem unintuitive, but CSX is actually a net winner when commodity prices are high--that's because about 40% of the firm's shipment volume comes from coal and commodity chemical products, which drive more rail shipment demand when prices are high. At the same time, rail transport is typically a quarter the cost of truck shipping per ton, a differential that becomes particularly significant when oil prices are high.</p><p>Like other railroads, CSX has spent the past few years driving efficiency improvements.

Stocks are starting off this morning's trading session in correction mode, not an altogether bad thing given the 1% hurdle higher in all three of the big indices. All told, the<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">S&amp;P 500</emphasis>rallied 5% in January, giving equities an annualized gain of 60% if they kept that pace for the whole year.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/5-stocks-poised-breakouts.html-23\">&gt;&gt;5 Stocks Poised for Breakouts</url>No, a little correction isn't such a bad thing after all right now.But just how long it lasts is another question. With considerable data coming out this week, Mr. Market could get snapped out of his sideways pause sooner rather than later. With the S&amp;P 500 now just 3.3% of a new all-time high, the significance of another upward push is even bigger.That's why we're taking a look at five new Rocket Stock names this week.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/5-stocks-under-10-set-soar-higher.html-0\">&gt;&gt;5 Stocks Under $10 Set to Soar Higher</url>For the uninitiated, \"Rocket Stocks\" are our list of companies with short-term gain catalysts and longer-term growth potential. To find them, I run a weekly quantitative screen that seeks out stocks with a combination of analyst upgrades and positive earnings surprises to identify rising analyst expectations, a bullish signal for stocks in any market. After all, where analysts' expectations are increasing, institutional cash often follows. In the last 186 weeks, our weekly list of five plays has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 75.17%.Without further ado, here's a look at      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/rhinostocks/portfolio/rocket-stocks-for-the-week-ending-february-8/\">this week's Rocket Stocks</url>.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/4-big-stocks-buy-february-and-one-sell.html\">&gt;&gt;4 Big Stocks to Buy in February -- and One to Sell</url><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Walt Disney</emphasis>=\"Scripts/swfobject_modified.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;</p><h>Content on this page requires a newer version of Adobe Flash Player.</h><p>Shareholders in<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Walt Disney</emphasis>(DIS:NYSE) are enjoying a good year. The $100 billion company already hit all-time highs of its own back in the summer, and it's up almost 40% in the last 12 months. Everyone knows Disney's brand, but just a day after my Baltimore Ravens took the Super Bowl championship in New Orleans, many investors may not realize just how big football is to Disney's business.<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/4-hot-stocks-trade-or-not.html-1\">&gt;&gt;4 Hot Stocks to Trade (or Not)</url>Football matters to Disney because of ESPN, the crown jewel in the firm's TV network portfolio. ESPN pays the NFL approximately $1.8 billion each year for the rights to broadcast Monday Night Football games during the regular season; not surprisingly, that costs the network more than ad sales contribute during the games. But the real value in the deal is broadcast rights for other games, giving ESPN the ability to sell countless ads in today's inevitable Super Bowl post-game coverage. Disney's other networks include ABC, as well as stakes in the History Channel and Lifetime. The firm's portfolio of intellectual property is unmatched, with beloved characters such as Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and Winnie the Pooh generating considerable cash from film, TV, merchandise and theme parks. The purchase of Pixar should keep Disney's portfolio growing in value as new favorite films come out of the independently run animation studio. Disney has a solid balance sheet, it pays a modest dividend, and its technical trajectory is stellar. With rising analyst sentiment in this Rocket Stock, we're betting on shares.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Goldman Sachs</emphasis>=\"Scripts/swfobject_modified.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;</p><h>Content on this page requires a newer version of Adobe Flash Player.</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Goldman Sachs</emphasis>(GS:NYSE) is another name that's enjoying excellent relative strength of late. In 2013 alone, shares have rallied more than 17%, buoyed by breakneck performance in the rest of the financial sector. Goldman is one of the last remaining legacy investment banks, a status that gives it attractive positioning right now as an equity rally starts making deals look attractive to capital-hungry firms again.<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/port/5-Bank-Stocks-That-Can-t-Stop-Posting-Profits/\">&gt;&gt;5 Bank Stocks That Can't Stop Posting Profits</url>Goldman's legacy status counts for something in the financial sector. The firm has established a reputation as a well-connected firm that's staffed by smart professionals. Even if stories of GS employees mocking clients tarnished the firm's image somewhat, wealthy retail clients on the investment management side generally still feel that they'd rather be trading with Goldman than against it. Investment banking deal sizes generally move in kind with the equity markets. That's because, statistically, firms can capture bigger price premiums when stocks are moving higher. So equities being up more than 5% in 2013 stands to benefit Goldman Sachs more than most. The firm's decision to become a bank holding company was a matter of survival -- and it still is to some extent. Increased regulatory scrutiny helps to prevent Goldman from conspicuously over-leveraging itself in chase of returns. While that does mean that Goldman's profit potential is reduced, the bigger market share and more lucrative businesses that the firm has been enjoying post-recession should easily offset that.I also featured Goldman recently in \"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/5-stocks-want-pay-you-more-quarter.html\">5 Stocks That Want to Pay You More This Quarter</url>.\"<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Priceline.com</emphasis>=\"Scripts/swfobject_modified.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;</p><h>Content on this page requires a newer version of Adobe Flash Player.</h><p>The return of William Shatner as<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Priceline.com's</emphasis>(PCLN:NYSE) advertising front man may have fans of the ads happy, but he can't get all of the credit for the stellar price performance that this stock has seen for the past few years. Priceline has seen its share price increase by 535% in the last five years, and the trajectory is still pointed higher in 2013; shares are already up 10% year-to-date.<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/5-bargain-stocks-play-resurgent-us-consumer.html\">&gt;&gt;5 Bargain Stocks to Play the Resurgent U.S. Consumer</url>Priceline is one of the world's biggest online travel sites, offering bookings for hotels, airlines, rental cars, and vacation packages such as cruises. Here at home, there aren't many big advantages in travel anymore -- the U.S. travel market is largely commoditized at this point thanks to \"lowest price\" guarantees with hotels, a phenomenon that effectively means that it doesn't matter where you buy your next trip. But there is a lot more flexibility abroad, particularly in emerging markets in Asia and Latin America. And that's where Priceline has been focusing its attention. Financially, Priceline is in excellent shape, with $4.6 billion in cash and just $1.45 billion in total debt. The firm's business is light on capital requirements -- PCLN is able to earn huge net margins for its trouble -- so how management decides to part with that cash matters a lot. We'll either want to see acquisitions of mature, established travel outlets overseas or a big value return to shareholders in 2013.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MetLife</emphasis>=\"Scripts/swfobject_modified.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;</p><h>Content on this page requires a newer version of Adobe Flash Player.</h><p>As the largest life insurer in the U.S.,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MetLife</emphasis>(MET:NYSE) has a pretty stolid business. Insurance isn't that exciting, but sometimes, boring is better for your portfolio.MetLife may be the biggest insurer here at home, but the firm has growth at its fingertips in overseas markets. With operations in more than 50 countries, MetLife has exposure to currencies and economies that are much better positioned to swell in size -- particularly if the U.S. dollar starts to slump on an exodus from treasuries. Latin America is an especially attractive market for MetLife right now, and management knows it - the region makes up around half of the countries that MET operates in. Here at home, the commoditization of the insurance business has made profitability more challenging. That said, MET's size provides a big advantage. Because MetLife can underwrite business that smaller insurer's don't have the scale to dump on their balance sheets, the firm has an operational advantage in an industry where advantages are few and far between. MetLife is another financial firm that became a bank holding company in the height of the financial crisis, but the firm is trying to shed that status. Management has been selling off its banking assets for the past few years, decreasing its exposure to Europe, and working on gaining approval from regulators. Once that happens, MET will look more attractive to investors.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ralph Lauren</emphasis>=\"Scripts/swfobject_modified.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;</p><h>Content on this page requires a newer version of Adobe Flash Player.</h><p>Last up this week is<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ralph Lauren</emphasis>(RL:NYSE), the $15 billion apparel and accessory firm. RL owns a large number of sub-brands, most of which capitalize on the designer/CEO's name in them in some form or fashion. That ability to build out individual franchises from a single firm are beneficial because they enable RL to grab at a wider set of markets and across multiple price points. The firm doesn't have to risk devaluing its brand by selling lower-priced clothing -- it just sells them under a more value conscious brand.Typically, RL's core demographic has been older \"mass affluent\" consumers whose fashion tastes aren't especially volatile. That exposure is doubly attractive because it gives RL the ability to earn deeper profit margins on every polo shirt and pair of jeans without worrying about falling out of favor next season. 73-year-old Ralph Lauren still helms his namesake firm as CEO, bringing the question of succession when the founder ultimately steps down from his daily duties. That said, the brand should be able to maintain its strength even without Lauren himself involved in the day-to-day operation of the firm. With considerable room for international expansion in the firm's lucrative company-owned stores, this Rocket Stock stands to benefit more than most in a stock rally.To see all of this week's Rocket Stocks in action, check out<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/rhinostocks/portfolio/rocket-stocks-for-the-week-ending-february-8/\">the Rocket Stocks portfolio</url>at Stockpickr.-- Written by Jonas Elmerraji in Baltimore.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RELATED LINKS:</emphasis>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/beat-market-5-foreign-stocks-everyone-hates.html?cm_ven=splinks\">&gt;&gt;Beat the Market With 5 Foreign Stocks Everyone Hates</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/5-stocks-insiders-are-scooping.html-2?cm_ven=splinks\">&gt;&gt;5 Stocks Insiders Are Scooping Up</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/3-big-tech-stocks-trade-or-not.html?cm_ven=splinks\">&gt;&gt;3 Big Tech Stocks to Trade (or Not)</url>Follow Stockpickr on<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/>and become a fan on<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSC-11831178</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSC2013</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:57NN-C861-F03D-60PV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">220623</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1665\"/><timeReceived>10:38 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2013 TheStreet.com, Inc.

That adds up to a 54% decline on an annualized basis. At this pace, a few more trading holidays might be a good idea for February.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But while most stocks are in the red this year, some big names are fighting the backslide. As I write, 18% of S&amp;P components are actually up this year. To find the stocks that look primed to outperform for the short week ahead, we're turning to a fresh set of Rocket Stocks.</p><p>For the uninitiated, \"Rocket Stocks\" are our list of companies with short-term gain catalysts and longer-term growth potential. To find them, I run a weekly quantitative screen that seeks out stocks with a combination of analyst upgrades and positive earnings surprises to identify rising analyst expectations, a bullish signal for stocks in any market. After all, where analysts' expectations are increasing, institutional cash often follows. In the last 336 weeks, our weekly list of five plays has outperformed the S&amp;P 500's record run by 79.17%.</p><p>Without further ado, here's a look at this week's Rocket Stocks.<br/><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Johnson &amp; Johnson</emphasis><br/></p><p><br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://ycharts.com/companies/JNJ\">JNJ</url> data by       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://ycharts.com\">YCharts</url><br/></p><p>Up first is <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Johnson &amp; Johnson</emphasis><br/> , a stock that's best described as the prototypical blue-chip stock. It probably doesn't come as much of a surprise that a big, steady blue-chip like J&amp;J is a defensive play right now -- or that shares are holding within a percentage point of breakeven year-to-date, beating the S&amp;P by a big margin. But the fact remains that investors don't get any extra points for picking obscure names in turbulent markets -- and Johnson &amp; Johnsonlooks well-positioned to keep on outperforming the broad market right now.</p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnsonis the biggest health care company in the world. The firm owns major consumer health and personal care brands such as Band-Aid, Tylenol, Neutrogena and Acuvue -- but it earns most of its revenue outside of the consumer space. J&amp;J's pharmaceutical and medical device units are its cash cows. By spreading revenue across a wide spectrum of dissimilar businesses, Johnson &amp; Johnsonreduces risks for investors, particularly as regulatory changes threaten the health sector.</p><p>Another major reason for Johnson &amp; Johnson's defensive posture is its balance sheet. The firm currently has more than $17.5 billion in net cash and investments on its balance sheet, enough to pay for more than 6% of the firm's outstanding shares at current price levels. During rough market environments, cash gives a company options -- and Johnson &amp; Johnsonhas a lot of them right now.</p><p>Add on a 2.95% dividend yield at current prices, and this stock looks like a name worth having in your portfolio this winter.<br/><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cisco Systems</emphasis><br/></p><p><br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://ycharts.com/companies/CSCO\">CSCO</url> data by       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://ycharts.com\">YCharts</url><br/></p><p>$129 billion tech stock <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cisco Systems</emphasis><br/> was one of the biggest winners in the S&amp;P 500 last week, ending things 9.7% higher thanks to positive second quarter earnings announced Wednesday. Excluding one-time items, Cisco's profits came in at 57 cents per share, ahead of the 53.8-cent best guess from Wall Street. From here, Cisco looks ready to ride that bullish momentum into another week\u2026</p><p>Cisco is the 800-pound gorilla in the computer networking business. The firm makes the software and hardware that enterprises use to connect computer networks. Cisco's routers, switches, and applications can be found in just about every server room on the planet today, providing Cisco with scale that comes with some serious advantages. Because Cisco's gear is designed to plug-and-play with other Cisco components, IT departments that \"keep it in the family\" can often see much lower integration and ongoing technical support costs.</p><p>Financially, Cisco is in excellent shape. The firm currently carries $35.78 billion in net cash and investments on its balance sheet, enough to pay for almost 28% of its outstanding shares at today's prices. That's a huge risk reducer for investors right now, and it gives this big tech company a bargain-priced ex-cash P/E ratio of 8.95. With buyers coming back into this stock, now looks like a good place to build a position.</p><p>Cisco is a holding in Jim Cramer's <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thestreet.com/k/aap/_tscnav/index.html\">Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio</url> .</p><p>\"Cisco delivered a clean top- and bottom-line fiscal-second-quarter beat and issued strong third-quarter guidance,\" Cramer and co-portfolio-manager Jack Mohr <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thestreet.com/k/aap/13458330/weekly-roundup.html\">wrote recently</url> . \"More importantly, the company announced a series of aggressive capital return moves,\" including raising its dividend and increasing buyback authorization.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Exclusive Look Inside:</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">  You see Jim Cramer on TV.

Even though ACE was the one that bought Chubb, the combined business is going to continue operating under the Chubb name. And the deal comes with some big benefits for everyone involved.</p><p>The new Chubb is an insurance giant. The firm generates most of its business through property-casualty products. That may not sound particularly exciting, but Chubb's huge size actually gives it the ability to operate in a unique niche where competitors are few and underwriting margins are bigger. Bigger size means that Chubb can spread the risks of a gigantic commercial policy across a larger portfolio. And that means that it can pursue niche products that aren't as commoditized as conventional insurance products where price is the deciding factor.</p><p>Last month's merger completion means that the combined firm can spread risk across an even bigger portfolio now, and it can cut costs that are duplicated across both former companies. Because Chubb and ACE had different core customers in the commercial lines market, customer overlap is minimal.</p><p>With rising analyst sentiment in shares this week, we're betting on upside in Chubb.<br/><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Illinois Tools Works</emphasis><br/></p><p><br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://ycharts.com/companies/ITW\">ITW</url> data by       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://ycharts.com\">YCharts</url><br/></p><p>What's working this year? Capital-intense manufacturing businesses, it seems. That's part of the explanation of why diversified manufacturer <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Illinois Tool Works</emphasis><br/> , is down less than 1% since the calendar flipped to January. While the rest of the market has been in freefall, this $34 billion industrial stock has actually been heading higher since shares reported earnings at the end of January. And that momentum isn't showing any signs of slowing in February.</p><p>Illinois Tool Works is the parent company behind brands such as Sub-Zero and Wolf appliances, Rain-X and Zip-Pak. Just a few years ago, ITW had approximately 800 individual divisions; now it's down to 90. That massive culling of its most commoditized businesses has resulted in bigger margins and more consistent financial performance without sacrificing the majority of its revenues. The firm's remaining brands are its strongest, and they provide automatic revenue diversification because they operate in disparate corners of the marketplace.</p><p>At the same time ITW has been streamlining the businesses it owns, it's also been streamlining its SG&amp;A expenses. While the firm has historically run a decentralized business, it's started returning to sharing some back-office functions between units. The result is that individual managers will still have autonomy over their units, but investors won't bear the financial burden of duplicated HR and accounting roles. The strategy shift is working; ITW posted its 10th consecutive quarterly earnings beat on Jan. 27.<br/><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Deere </emphasis><br/></p><p><br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://ycharts.com/companies/DE\">DE</url> data by       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://ycharts.com\">YCharts</url><br/></p><p>Last up on our list of Rocket Stocks is $25 billion agricultural and construction equipment maker <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Deere</emphasis><br/> . Deere is another company that's proving big industrial manufacturing stocks are working in 2016. After a double-digit decline last year, Deere is actually one of the few S&amp;P components that's up year-to-date. And that outperformance is worth paying attention to in February.</p><p>Deere arguably owns the most valuable brand in the heavy equipment business. Even if you've never set foot on a farm, odds are you know the Deere name and its signature green and yellow color scheme. That brand awareness comes from the firm's dominance in the North American agriculture market, and it translates into the consumer and prosumer equipment segments that have become an increasingly valuable (if smaller) piece of Deere's business in recent years.</p><p>Deere owns its own captive finance unit, a critical tool that gives it the ability to subsidize finance costs in order to move machinery, much like an automaker. While tumbling soft commodity prices have put the squeeze on Deere's farm customers (and, by extension, Deere itself), ag prices appear to be stabilizing in 2016.</p><p>Keep an eye out for a potential catalyst in fourth-quarter earnings numbers, which hit Wall Street on Friday.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSC-13459389</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSC2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5J3R-3JT1-JCHV-V1SK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">220623</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1500\"/><timeReceived>8:48 AM EDT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 TheStreet.com, Inc.

This new version, supposedly aimed at safety and curbing \u201cmalicious coordinated actions\u201d by users of social networks and private messaging apps, will allow the government to identify and track countless innocent users who haven\u2019t committed any wrongdoing in order to catch a few malicious actors.    The bill creates a clumsy regulatory regime to intervene in the technology and policy decisions of both public and private messaging services in Brazil, requiring them to institute new takedown procedures, enforce various kinds of identification of all their users, and greatly increase the amount of information that they gather and store from and about their users. They also have to ensure that all of that information can be directly accessed by staff in Brazil, so it is directly and immediately available to their government\u2014bypassing the strong safeguards for users\u2019 rights of existing international mechanisms such as Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties.    This sprawling bill is moving quickly, and it comes at a very bad time. Right now, secure communication technologies are more important than ever to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic, to collaborate and work securely, and to protest or organize online. It\u2019s also really important for people to be able to have private conversations, including private political conversations. There are many things wrong with this bill, far more than we could fit into one article. For now, we\u2019ll do a deep dive into five serious flaws in the existing bill that would undermine privacy, expression and security.   Flaw 1: Forcing Social Media and Private Messaging Companies to Collect Legal Identification of All Users   The new draft of Article 7 is both clumsy and contradictory. First, the bill (Article 7, paragraph 3) requires \u201clarge\u201d social networks and private messaging apps (that offer service in Brazil to more than two million users) to identify every account\u2019s user by requesting their national identity cards. It\u2019s a retroactive and general requirement, meaning that identification must be requested for each and every existing user. Article 7 main provision is not limited to  the identification of a user by a court order, also including when there is a complaint about an account\u2019s activity, or when the company finds itself unsure of a user\u2019s identity. While users are explicitly permitted to use pseudonyms, they may not  keep their legal identities confidential from the service provider. Compelling companies to identify an online user should only be done in response to a request by a competent authority, not a priori . In India, a similar proposal is expected to be released by the country\u2019s IT Ministry, although reports indicate that ID verification would be optional.    In 2003, Brazil made SIM card registration mandatory for prepaid cell phones, requiring prepaid subscribers to present a proof of identity, such as their official national identity card, driver\u2019s license, or taxpayer number. Article 39 of the new draft expands that law by creating new mandatory identification requirements for obtaining telephone SIM cards, and Article 8 explicitly requires private message applications that identify their users via an associated telephone number to delete accounts whenever the underlying telephone number is deregistered. Telephone operators are required to help with this process by providing a list of numbers that are no longer used by the original subscriber. SIM card registration undermines peoples\u2019 ability to communicate, organize, and associate with others anonymously. David Kaye, United Nations\u2019 Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression and Opinion have asked states to refrain from making the identification of users a condition for access to digital communications and online services and requiring SIM card registration for mobile users.   Protect Your Privacy with a Phone Shield Faraday Bag   Even if the draft text eliminates Article 7, the draft remains dangerous to free expression because authorities will still be allowed to identify users of private messaging services by linking a cell phone number to an account. The Brazilian authorities will have to unmask the identity of the internet user by following domestic procedures for accessing such data from the telecom provider.    Internet users will be obliged to hand over identifying information to big tech companies if Article 7 is approved as currently written, with or without paragraph 3. The compulsory identification provision is a blatant infringement on the due process rights of individuals. Countries like China and South Korea have mandated that users register their real names and identification numbers with online service providers. South Korea used to require websites with more than 100,000 visitors per day to authenticate their identities by entering their resident ID numbers when they use portals or other sites. But South Korea\u2019s Supreme Court revoked the law as unconstitutional, stating that \u201cthe [mandatory identification] system does not seem to have been beneficial to the public. Despite the enforcement of the system, the number of illegal or malicious postings online has not decreased.\u201d   Flaw 2: Forcing Social Networking and Messaging Companies to Retain Immense Logs of User Communications      Man: What happened? Police officer: You shared that message that went viral accusing someone of a corruption scheme. They\u2019re saying that it\u2019s a lie and is cal\u00fania. Descriptive text: It\u2019s easy to imagine how the new traceability rule could be abused and make us all afraid to share content online. We can\u2019t let that happen.    Article 10 compels social networks and private messaging applications to retain the chain of all communications that have been \u201cmassively forwarded\u201d, for the purpose of potential criminal investigation or prosecution. The new draft requires three months of data storage of the complete chain of communication for such messages, including date and time of forwarding, and the total number of users who receive the message. These obligations are conditioned on virality thresholds and apply when an instance of a message has been forwarded to groups or lists by more than 5 users within 15 days, where a message\u2019s content has reached 1,000 or more users. The service provider is also apparently expected to temporarily retain this data for all forwarded messages during the 15-day period in order to determine whether or not the virality threshold for \u201cmassively forwarded\u201d will be met. This provision blatantly infringes on due process rights by compelling providers to retain everyone\u2019s communication before anyone has committed any legally defined offense.    There have also been significant changes to how this text interacts with encryption and with communications\u2019 providers efforts to know less about what their users are doing. These mandatory retention requirements may create an incentive to weaken end-to-end encryption, because end-to-end encrypted services may not be able to comply with provisions requiring them to recognize when a particular message has been independently forwarded a certain number of times without undermining the security of their encryption.    Although the current draft (unlike previous versions) does not create new crimes, it requires providers to trace messages before any crime has been committed so the information could be used in the future in the context of a criminal investigation or prosecution of crimes for specific crimes defined in articles 138 to 140, or article 147 of the Brazil\u2019s Penal Code , such as defamation, threats, and cal\u00fania . This means, for example, that if you share a message that denounces corruption of a local authority and it gets forwarded more than 1,000 times, authorities may criminally accuse you of cal\u00fania against your local authority.    Companies must limit the retention of personal data to what is reasonably necessary, proportionate to certain legitimate business purposes. This is \u201c data  minimization ,\u201d that is, the principle that any company should minimize its processing of consumer data. Minimization is an important tool in the data protection toolbox. This bill goes against that, favoring dangerous big data collection practices.   Flaw 3: Banning Messaging Companies from Allowing Broadcast Groups, Even if Users Sign Up   Articles 9 and 11 require broadcast and discussion group sizes in private messaging tools to have a maximum membership limit (something that WhatsApp does today, but that not every communications tool necessarily does or will do), and that the ability to reach mass audiences via private messaging platforms must be strictly limited and controlled, even when those audiences opt in. The vision of the bill seems to be that mass discussion and mass broadcast are inherently dangerous and must only happen in public, and that no one should create forums or media for these interactions to happen in a truly private way, even with clear and explicit consent by the participants or recipients.    Suppose an organization like an NGO, or a labor union, or a political party wanted to have a discussion forum among its whole membership or send its newsletter to all its members who\u2019ve chosen to receive it. It wouldn\u2019t be allowed to do this through a tool similar to WhatsApp \u2014 at least once some (unspecified) audience size limit was reached. Per articles 9 and 11, the organization would have to use another platform (not a private messaging tool), and so the content would be visible to and subject to the control of its operator.   Flaw 4: Forcing Social Media and Messaging Companies to Make Private User Logs Available Remotely   Article 37 compels large social networks and private messaging apps to appoint legal representatives in Brazil. It also forces those companies to provide remote access to their user databases and logs to their staff in Brazil so the local employees can be directly forced to turn them over.    This undermines user security and privacy. It increases the number of employees (and devices) that can access sensitive data and reduces the company\u2019s ability to control vulnerabilities and unauthorized access, not least because this is global in scale and, should it be adopted in Brazil, could be replicated by other countries. Each new person and each new device adds a new security risk.   Flaw 5: No Limitations on Applying this Law to Users Outside of Brazil   Paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 1 provide some jurisdictional exclusions, but all of these are applied at the company level\u2014that is, a foreign company could be exempt if it is small (less than 2,000,000 users) or does not offer services to Brazil. None of these limitations, however, relate to the users \u2019 nationality or location. Thus, the bill, by its terms, requires a company to create certain policies and procedures about content takedowns, mandatory identification of users, and other topics, which are not themselves in any way limited to people based in Brazil. Even if the intent is only to force the collection of ID documents from users who are based in Brazil, the bill neglects to say so.   Addressing \u201cFake News\u201d Without Undermining Human Rights     There are many innovative new responses being developed to help cut down on abuses of messaging and social media apps, both through policy responses and technical solutions. WhatsApp, for example, already limits the number of recipients of a single forwarded message at a time and shows users that messages were forwarded, viral messages are labeled with double arrows to indicate they did not originate from a close contact. However, shutting down bad actors cannot come at the expense of silencing millions of other users, invading their privacy, or undermining their security. To ensure that human rights are preserved, the Brazilian legislature must reject the current version of this bill. Moving forward, human rights such as privacy, expression, security must be baked into the law from the beginning.    Source: EFF.org    Katitza Rodriguez is EFF\u2019s international rights director.

Instead, they're companies that operate in industries like alcohol, tobacco, gambling, and defense. And as an income investor, sin stocks could be the most wholesome addition to your portfolio.In a lot of ways, sin stocks are purpose-built income machines in good times and bad. For starters, sin stocks tend to be businesses that provide a stress outlet for consumers. As a result, recession resistant revenues and sticky customer bases are the norm. The devil's in the details with sin stocks; because these firms generally sport wide economic moats and deeper margins than traditional consumer plays, sin stocks benefit from an extra qualitative boost that you can't find in any other group right now.When investor anxiety is ramped up, sin stocks really shine. Just take a look at what they've done in anxiety rally the past year: while the S&amp;P 500 has rallied an impressive 15.9%, the aptly named<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Vice Fund</emphasis>(VICEX) had climbed 22.2%.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/5-big-trades-market-top.html\">&gt;&gt;5 Big Trades for a Market Top</url>But our focus today is dividends, not just capital gains. And instead of chasing payouts, we'll try to step in front of the next round of sin stock payout hikes.Over the last three and a half decades, dividend stocks have outperformed the rest of the S&amp;P 500 by 2.5% annually, and they outperformed nonpayers by nearly 8% every year, all while paying out cash to their shareholders, based on data compiled by Ned Davis Research. The numbers are even more compelling when looking at companies that consistently increase their payouts.For our purposes, that \"crystal ball\" is composed of a few factors: namely a solid balance sheet, a low payout ratio, and a history of dividend hikes. While those items don't guarantee dividend announcements in the next month or three, they do dramatically increase the odds that management will hike their cash payouts.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/5-stocks-insiders-love-right-now.html-33\">&gt;&gt;5 Stocks Insiders Love Right Now</url>Without further ado, here's a look at      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/rhinostocks/portfolio/potential-dividend-hikes-for-the-week-ending-august-30/\">five sin stocks that could be about to increase their dividend payments</url>in the next quarter.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Philip Morris International</emphasis>=\"Scripts/swfobject_modified.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;</p><h>Content on this page requires a newer version of Adobe Flash Player.</h><p>As the world's second largest tobacco company,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Philip Morris International</emphasis>(<url normalizedValue=\"http://stockpickr.com/symbol/PM/\">PM</url>) is the prototypical sin stock. It boasts recognizable brands, a sticky customer base, and a hefty dividend payout -- and the payout looks due for a dividend hike. As I write, Philip Morris International currently pays out a 85 cents each quarter, adding up to a 4.05% yield.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/3-huge-stocks-trade-or-not.html-2\">&gt;&gt;3 Huge Stocks to Trade (or Not)</url>Philip Morris owns almost 30% of the world's tobacco market. And much of that success is thanks to a single iconic brand: Marlboro. The firm has owned Marlboro (as well as second-tier names such as L&amp;M and Parliament) internationally ever since<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Altria</emphasis>(      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://stockpickr.com/symbol/MO/\">MO</url>) split up its international and domestic operations. Between the two markets, PM owns the more attractive franchise by far. After all, the international market is the only one that's actually growing.While the U.S. market for tobacco products is rife with regulation and demographic shifts are turning away from smoking, international tobacco sales are up -- especially in emerging markets. Premium positioning in markets like India, China and Indonesia translates into substantial cash flows for PM investors. And while the strength of the dollar has been a challenge post-2008, the potential for a<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fed</emphasis>taper could strengthen this stock's payout in 2013.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wynn Resorts</emphasis>=\"Scripts/swfobject_modified.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;</p><h>Content on this page requires a newer version of Adobe Flash Player.</h><p>While gamblers in Las Vegas are focused on the payouts on the casino floor at<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wynn Resorts</emphasis>(<url normalizedValue=\"http://stockpickr.com/symbol/WYNN/\">WYNN</url>), I'm more interested in this stock's dividend payout -- there's no gamble there. The $14 billion casino resort operator currently pays out a $1 per share dividend each quarter, adding up to a 2.8% dividend yield at current price levels.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/triple-your-gains-these-5-cash-rich-stocks.html\">&gt;&gt;5 Cash-Rich Stocks to Triple Your Gains</url>Wynn has benefitted from a rebounding economy in Las Vegas. The firm's Wynn and Encore resorts are two of the newer properties on the strip, and their high-end positioning keeps VIP business coming into the door. Vegas, though, isn't Wynn's cash cow anymore. China is. Today, around 70% of revenues actually come from Macau, the high-end Chinese gambling district. Macau is Wynn's crown jewel in large part because the firm is one of the few that's been granted a gaming license from the government: Wynn has two properties in Macau, with a third on the way.Healthy levels of profitability have translated into a $2.2 billion cash position for WYNN -- enough to pay for around 15% of the firm's market capitalization. Concentrated ownership from founder Steve Wynn should align management's incentives with investors, and increase the likelihood of a dividend hike.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Beam</emphasis>=\"Scripts/swfobject_modified.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;</p><h>Content on this page requires a newer version of Adobe Flash Player.</h><p>Bourbon giant<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Beam</emphasis>(<url normalizedValue=\"http://stockpickr.com/symbol/BEAM/\">BEAM</url>) is enjoying strong tailwinds thanks to increased consumption of its namesake spirits. The firm is the name behind Jim Beam and Maker's Mark bourbon as well as Sauza tequila, Pinnacle vodka and Cruzan rum. Since spinning off from what was then Fortune Brands in 2011, this stock hasn't done much in the way of price, but it has made leaps and bounds fundamentally. That financial improvement paves the way for a dividend boost.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/5-stocks-under-10-set-soar.html-41\">&gt;&gt;5 Stocks Under $10 Set to Soar</url>Beam is well-positioned in the spirit business. Liquor consumers are sticky. Because BEAM owns some of the most attractive brands in the business, it's less likely to see brand attrition than others. And more recently, the embrace of drinkers' demand for \"craft\" alcoholic beverages has provided a fast-growing opportunity for the firm: a line of small-batch bourbons. That same small-batch approach could spill over to the firm's other liquor brands in a very positive way; Beam already has a winning model to copy, after all.In the last few years, Beam has essentially halved its debt, and it's kept balance sheet liquidity very healthy. As a result, income trends look very strong -- and more of that income is available for shareholder payouts rather than bank obligations. While the firm's 1.5% dividend payout it far from high-yield, investors should expect a raise in the coming quarters.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Molson Coors Brewing</emphasis>=\"Scripts/swfobject_modified.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;</p><h>Content on this page requires a newer version of Adobe Flash Player.</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Molson Coors Brewing</emphasis>(<url normalizedValue=\"http://stockpickr.com/symbol/TAP/\">TAP</url>) operates in a different corner of the alcoholic beverage business: beer. The $9 billion brewer is one of the biggest in the world, with brands like Molson and Coors as well as Blue Moon, Keystone and Miller Lite (the latter through a joint venture with<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SABMiller</emphasis>(SBMRY: Pink Sheets) here in the U.S.).      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/4-stocks-rising-unusual-volume.html-36\">&gt;&gt;4 Stocks Rising on Unusual Volume</url>Molson Coors is engaged in a battle of the big boys - as the second largest brewer in Canada and the U.S., the firm primarily competes against top-rival<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anheuser Busch Inbev</emphasis>(      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://stockpickr.com/symbol/BUD/\">BUD</url>) for market share. Like BEAM with its small barrel bourbon line, TAP has poured resources into the craft beer segment, the fastest-growing area in the alcoholic beverage space. While that's not likely to materially change its business, it should provide a welcome margin boost.Beer sales tend to ebb and flow with the broad economy. In 2013, with consumer discretionary spending on the upswing, beer spending should grow in kind. For TAP specifically, the possibility of a falling dollar bodes well for the firm's large international exposure -- and its ability to hike its payout. Right now, TAP pays a 32-cent dividend for a 2.6% yield.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">International Game Technology</emphasis>=\"Scripts/swfobject_modified.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;</p><h>Content on this page requires a newer version of Adobe Flash Player.</h><p>2013 is panning out to be a great year for investors in<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">International Game Technology</emphasis>(<url normalizedValue=\"http://stockpickr.com/symbol/IGT/\">IGT</url>). Shares of the mid-cap slot machine maker have climbed more than 34% since the calendar flipped over to January. Now a boost to IGT's 10-cent dividend payout spells even more upside for the second half of the year.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/4-big-tech-stock-traders-radars.html\">&gt;&gt;4 Big Tech Stocks on Traders' Radars</url>IGT is the biggest manufacturer of casino gaming equipment in the world. Calling them \"slot machines\" is a little bit of a sleight -- the firm's digitally-powered machines are designed to provide gamers with a much more immersive experience than the old mechanical spinning wheels ever could. And the technology and branding in IGT's games translates into an economic moat for investors. It's a deep moat too: IGT currently controls around 20% of the gaming equipment market.The debate over online gambling presents a big potential tailwind for IGT, as it opens a big market for the firm's social gaming business. Even as-is, though, IGT's numbers are attractive: this sin stock earns net margins deep in the double digits, it carries a manageable debt load, and it sports a perfunctory earnings multiple. With an impressive track record of boosting dividend payout each quarter, expect to see this stock's 2% yield get hiked sooner rather than later.To see all of this week's Rocket Stocks in action, check out      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/rhinostocks/portfolio/rocket-stocks-for-the-week-ending-august-30/\">the Rocket Stocks portfolio</url>at Stockpickr.-- Written by Jonas Elmerraji in Baltimore.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RELATED LINKS:</emphasis>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/5-stocks-under-10-triggering-breakouts.html-2?cm_ven=splinks\">&gt;&gt;5 Stocks Under $10 Triggering Breakouts</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/4-stocks-breakout-territory-big-volume.html?cm_ven=splinks\">&gt;&gt;4 Stocks in Breakout Territory on Big Volume</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/5-commodity-stocks-trade-gains.html?cm_ven=splinks\">&gt;&gt;5 Commodity Stocks to Trade for Gains</url>Follow Stockpickr on<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/>and become a fan on<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSC-12024311</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSC2013</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:598N-2DH1-JCMB-G198-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">220623</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1608\"/><timeReceived>09:10 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2013 TheStreet.com, Inc.

And one of the best ways to do that is by turning to a life of sin. Let me explain.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/4-big-stocks-trade-or-not.html-4\">&gt;&gt;4 Big Stocks to Trade (or Not)</url></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As an investor, the best defense is a good defense. And the best offense is a good defense too. That\u00bfs not just some investing platitude. It\u00bfs backed up by stock market research. According to data collected by Cambria Investment Management CIO Mebane Faber, missing both the best and worst days of the year with a defensive market posture actually outperforms a buy-and-hold approach.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That's a pretty ringing endorsement for putting defensive names in your portfolio. But contrary to popular belief, defensive stocks don't have to be boring. Sin stocks offer an interesting mix of downside protection, income generation and, well, fun</p><p>Don\u00bft let the name fool you; sin stock companies aren't in the business of burning down old folks' homes. Instead, alcohol, tobacco, gambling and weapons firms are all classical examples of sin stocks. So what makes sin stocks so attractive when anxiety ratchets higher?</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/must-see-charts-5-active-trades-quiet-month.html\">&gt;&gt;5 Active Trades for a Quiet Month</url></p><p>For starters, sin stocks tend to be businesses that provide a stress outlet for consumers. As a result, recession resistant revenues and sticky customer bases are the norm. The devil's in the details with sin stocks; because these firms generally sport wide economic moats and deeper margins than traditional consumer plays, sin stocks benefit from an extra qualitative boost that you can\u00bft find in any other group right now. That's not to say that sin stocks are recession-proof -- they're not. But they are certainly recession-resistant, which is more than an offense-centered investment strategy can offer.</p><p>Here's a look at<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/rhinostocks/portfolio/sin-stocks-january-2014/\">five sin stocks that could outperform in this market</url>.</p><p>Boston Beer</p><p>The last 12 months have been stellar for shares of Boston Beer -- the Samuel Adams brewer has rallied more than 59% since last January, gaining around double what the S&amp;P 500 was able to turn out. So while SAM isn't quite as defensive as some of the other names on this list, it's a pedigreed sin stock with a very interesting business in 2014.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/5-stocks-big-insider-buying.html-51\">&gt;&gt;5 Stocks With Insider Buying</url></p><p>Boston Beer owns just 1% of the U.S. beer market, but that share is enough to make SAM the fourth-largest brewer in the country. If there's ever a poster child for an oligopoly, the beer business is it. But Boston Beer has been doing an impressive job of changing that -- the firm's Samuel Adams brand has grown from regional favorite to a national staple in the last couple of decades, and it's got exciting growth prospects in new offerings such as its Angry Orchard cider brand.</p><p>Much of SAM's success comes from evolving consumer taste for beer that's made the craft beer segment the fastest-growing corner of the alcoholic beverage industry. If SAM can continue to ramp up its production abilities, it should continue to grab a more meaningful chunk of the market.</p><p>Financially, Boston Beer is in stellar shape. The firm carries more than $43 million in cash and effectively zero debt. It also earns attractive margins thanks to the premium pricing that buyers are willing to pay for its craft brews.</p><p>While shares are hardly cheap right now, the momentum continues to look impressive in shares of SAM. I'd expect a near-term correction in the next couple of weeks followed by a low-risk buying opportunity.</p><p>Altria</p><p>Altria has a business that's fraught with regulatory challenges -- and worse, it's dying a slow death. So why would you want to own shares of the tobacco giant?</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/should-you-invest-governments-5-favorite-stocks.html\">&gt;&gt;Should You Invest in the Government's 5 Favorite Stocks?</url></p><p>In short, it's because all of those black clouds are already priced into shares. That makes Altria a cheap, relatively low risk income play in 2014.</p><p>Altria is the biggest tobacco company in the U.S., led by its Marlboro brand. The firm also owns non-cigarette businesses that include cigars and smokeless tobacco, Ste. Michelle Wine Estates and a massive stake in SABMiller (SBMRY). So yes, those holdings make MO the quintessential sin stock. Altria long ago spun its growth prospects off into Phillip Morris International (PM), keeping the atrophying U.S. business. But the key is that U.S. tobacco sales are declining slowly, so cigarette volumes should see slips in the mid-single digits for the next few years. In the meantime, the firm generates massive cash flows, and it pays out a huge chunk of those cash flows in the form of dividends.</p><p>There is some growth on Altria's horizons, however. The firm's investments in e-cig products and a partnership with Phillip Morris International could spur some new sales in 2014. And the firm's huge alcoholic beverage holdings give it a deceptively low-risk balance sheet: the firm's 27% stake in SABMiller adds up to around $7 per share for MO shareholders, greatly reducing the risks in this name.</p><p>Perhaps most important, shares currently pay out a 5.15% dividend yield.</p><p>Wynn Resorts</p><p>Wynn Resorts is another name that's having an amazing year for shareholders. Since January 2013, shares of the $21 billion casino resort operator have rallied close to 71%. But that performance is more than just a roll of the dice; Wynn's deep economic moat makes it a best-in-breed gambling name right now.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/5-rocket-stocks-stomp-sp-2014.html\">&gt;&gt;5 Rocket Stocks to Stomp the S&amp;P in 2014</url></p><p>As a major casino operator in Las Vegas and China, the firm operates a concentrated portfolio of high-end properties in each location. Even though the Wynn name is synonymous with Las Vegas (and 82% of Wynn's hotel rooms are located in Vegas), it's profitability isn't. Instead, around 70% of revenues actually come from Macau, the high-end Chinese gambling district. Macau is Wynn's crown jewel in large part because the firm is one of the few that's been granted a gaming license from the government. Wynn has two properties in Macau, with a third on the way.</p><p>One of the secrets to Wynn's success is its high-end positioning. With some of the newer five-star properties on the Vegas strip (all of Macau's megaresorts are relatively new), and positioning that caters to high-rollers, Wynn has been able to attract the big money and, just as significantly, the aspirational small money.</p><p>As the gambling industry enjoys some tailwinds heading into 2014, Wynn's still a great way to get exposure.</p><p>Raytheon</p><p>Lots of people forget that defense stocks -- such as Raytheon -- fall into the \"sin stock\" category. Then again, too many investors forget about Raytheon too; the $28 billion defense contractor is dwarfed by its bigger rivals, but it's on our list today. At current prices, Raytheon pays out a 2.43% dividend yield.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/4-stocks-spiking-big-volume.html-27\">&gt;&gt;4 Stocks Spiking on Big Volume</url></p><p>Raytheon is a U.S. defense contractor with a hand in everything from aircraft and missiles to computer networks and technical services. It earns around 75% of its revenues from the U.S. government, with the balance coming from foreign allies. Contracts with those U.S. allies are helping to expand international sales growth at a double-digit annualized pace and should take away some of the downside risk that Wall Street has already priced in from budgetary concerns at DoD.</p><p>Financially, the company has done a good job of leveraging its balance sheet in a positive way for the last few years. And while debt has grown to $4.7 billion, the firm's cash position has grown in lock-step to $3.9 billion. That liquidity gives RTN lots of options right now, especially as it ramps up its IT services arms here in the U.S. With a history of returning value to shareholders, this underappreciated defense contractor is a solid way to get exposure to the sector.</p><p>Diageo</p><p>Last, but certainly not least, is Diageo , the $81 billion alcoholic beverage stock that wears the crown of being the largest spirits producer in the world. The London-based firm owns a collection of segment-leading brands that include Smirnoff, Johnnie Walker, Captain Morgan and Crown Royal. And while Diageo may be best known for its liquor labels, it also owns the hugely popular Guinness stout beer brand.</p><p>Diageo is a mature alcoholic beverage maker. The firm's 25 premium liquor brands are sold in more than 180 countries, and its distribution channel includes more than 2,500 sales representatives whose job is to get Diageo's brands stocks on store shelves and behind bars. While a mature business makes growth prospects more challenging, the firm's growth-by-acquisition strategy has added some key labels to DEO's portfolio in recent years, particularly in emerging markets like China, where the firm has a subsidiary.</p><p>Even though the firm's acquisition appetite has levered up its balance sheet, DEO still operates under a pretty reasonable debt load of around $6.5 billion net. That level of borrowings leaves enough cash generation for the firm to pay a 2.3% dividend yield. With spirits volume increasing at a swift organic pace, DEO offers a hard-to-find combination of scale and growth potential right now.</p><p>To see all of these sin stock trades in action, check out<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/rhinostocks/portfolio/sin-stocks-january-2014/\">The Sin Stocks 2014 Portfolio</url>on Stockpickr.</p><p>-- Written by Jonas Elmerraji in Baltimore.</p><p>RELATED LINKS:</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/3-retail-stocks-traders-radars.html?cm_ven=splinks\">&gt;&gt;3 Retail Stocks on Traders' Radars</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/5-stocks-under-10-set-soar.html-60?cm_ven=splinks\">&gt;&gt;5 Stocks Under $10 Set to Soar</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/5-big-tech-stocks-sell-right-now.html?cm_ven=splinks\">&gt;&gt;5 Big Tech Stocks to Sell Right Now</url></p><p>Follow Stockpickr on<url normalizedValue=\"http://twitter.com/stockpickr\">Twitter</url>and become a fan on      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Stockpickr/129281803913?ref=ts\">Facebook</url>.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSC-12244557</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSC2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5B9N-80Y1-F03D-642V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">220623</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1549\"/><timeReceived>12:10 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 TheStreet.com, Inc.

In 2017, many of the old challenges will persist as new ones emerge. Let's take a closer look at five things investors should do this year to stay ahead of the market.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Image source: Getty Images.</p><p>U.S. interest rates are widely expected to rise\u00a0next year, which could impact your portfolio in three big ways. First, dividend stocks could become less attractive than bonds as yields rise -- meaning that income stocks with historically high multiples could tumble. One vulnerable stock is tobacco giantAltria (NYSE: MO), which currently pays a forward yield of 3.6% but trades at 26 times trailing earnings -- which is much higher than its industry average of 21.</p><p>Second, higher interest rates make it harder for companies to boost their earnings with debt-fueled buybacks. Companies likeQualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) andApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) might suffer because they fund their buybacks with debt, but companies likeTexas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN) -- which fully funds its buybacks with its free cash flow -- won't be affected. Higher interest rates could also reduce M&amp;A activity due to higher borrowing costs. Lastly, higher interest rates will boost the profitability of banks, because they make savings accounts more attractive while boosting the interest collected on outstanding loans.</p><p>The strong U.S. dollar, which could rise further with higher interest rates, could hurt multinational companies that generate a large percentage of their revenue overseas. This means that many blue chip stocks, likeProcter &amp; Gamble,Coca-Cola, andIBM, could report widening disparities between their constant currency and \"as reported\" growth.</p><p>However, a strong U.S. dollar might make \"All American\" stocks which generate most of their revenue domestically more attractive than their multinational counterparts -- provided that their growth remains steady and valuations stay reasonable.</p><p>In addition to a strong dollar, regulatory pressures both at home and abroad could punish multinational companies. Back at home, President-elect Donald Trump has called out companies like Apple andGeneral Motors (NYSE: GM) for relying too heavily on overseas labor. If these companies are forced to relocate their manufacturing facilities back to the U.S., their operating expenses could surge and hurt their bottom line growth.</p><p>U.S. companies could also keep struggling in China, where protectionist regulators have slapped American companies like Qualcomm,Microsoft, and General Motors with probes and fines over allegedly anti-competitive practices. Investors should keep a close eye on these moves, but they shouldn't panic and dump these stocks on just a few negative headlines.</p><p>These issues and other factors are causing big investors to rotate out of certain sectors and into others. For example, many institutional investors are buying energy stocks due to higher oil prices, and financial stocks in expectation of rising interest rates.</p><p>They've also been selling some big tech stocks likeFacebook,Amazon,Netflix, andAlphabet.

(<url normalizedValue=\"http://stockpickr.com/\">Stockpickr</url>) -- It's that time of year again when Wall Street's biggest players report their holdings to the public through 13F filings. Hedge funds and other large asset managers have filed all of their 13F forms with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the second quarter. These filings show which positions some of the smartest money managers are adding to and which stocks they are taking new positions in.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/5-stocks-poised-breakouts.html-37\">&gt;&gt;5 Stocks Poised for Breakouts</url>For the purpose of this piece, I want to focus on some low-priced speculative stocks that trade below $10 a share that the biggest players are jumping into here. These low-priced companies could have tremendous upside since some of the smartest guys in the game have deiced to take significant stakes per the latest filings. These names could be attractive at current levels if these managers have found an undervalued situation and their timing is right. Of course, these low-priced stocks also hold a great deal of risk, so investors need to manage risk accordingly.Managing risk is important no matter what stock you're trading, but it's especially important in under-$10 names since they tend to be more volatile. When managing risk, it's important to use proper position sizing and to cut losses small if the trade goes against you. Remember, you can always get back into a stock at anytime if your first trade doesn't work out, so make sure to trade with the trend and manage that risk.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/5-toxic-stocks-you-should-sell.html\">&gt;&gt;5 Toxic Stocks You Should Sell</url>Stocks that trade below $10 a share are highly speculative in nature. Many mutual funds don't even allow their managers to own stocks that trade below $5 a share since the risk is considered too great. That said, hedge funds can own whatever they want, and if they see value in a low-priced stock they will jump in with zero fear. They might know something the average investor doesn't, or they might have done extensive research that lead them to take a position in an under-$10 name. Whatever the reason, it's never a bad idea to put the under-$10 names the whales are getting into on your watchlist. With that in mind, here's a look at      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/roberto-p/portfolio/under-10-13f-stock-buys-by-smart-money/\">a number of under-$10 stocks that are being bought by Wall Street's biggest players.</url>One smart hedge fund legend everyone has heard of is      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/pro/portfolio/john-paulson/\">John Paulson,</url>who is the founder and president of Paulson &amp; Co., a New York-based hedge fund. Paulson is famous for becoming a billionaire by short-selling subprime mortgages in 2007 right before the U.S. housing market collapsed. That trade netted him a cool $3.7 billion, and in 2010, he beat a hedge fund record by making almost $5 billion in profits.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/5-dividend-stocks-want-pay-you-more.html-2\">&gt;&gt;5 Dividend Stocks That Want to Pay You More</url>Unless you believe that Paulson just got lucky on his subprime bet, then he's probably someone you want to listen to when he makes moves into the housing sector. Back in July, at the Delivering Alpha conference, Paulson said the housing recovery is real, and where he was winning money betting on foreclosures and defaults, he is now making it on a steady run higher in housing prices and sales. Paulson said the housing sector has bottomed and it's not too late to get involved.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MGIC Investment</emphasis>Paulson is backing up his bullish housing thesis by loading up on shares of<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MGIC Investment</emphasis>(      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://stockpickr.com/symbol/MTG/\">MTG</url>), a provider of private mortgage insurance in the U.S. This stock has been on fire so far in 2013, with shares up sharply by 154%. MGIC Investment has a market cap of $2.29 billion and an enterprise value of 3.17 billion. This stock trades at a reasonable valuation, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 25.15. Its estimated growth rate for this year 88.9%, and for next year it's pegged at 157.4%.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/5-rocket-stocks-buy-now.html\">&gt;&gt;5 Rocket Stocks to Buy Now</url>MGIC Investment is one of the most levered plays to the housing sector that you can find. This company reimburses lenders when borrowers default and foreclosures fail to recoup costs. In a strong housing market, MGIC Investment will be writing polices left and right as new home owners come into the market. This company thrives on low down payment loans, so there should be plenty of business for them to win if the housing market returns to a more robust environment. In fact, this company just reported an operating profit of 4 cents per share, vs. Wall Street estimates of a loss of 16 cents per share. That marked the first profit for the company since the second quarter of 2010. Business looks to be turning up for MGIC Investment, which could be one of the reasons why Paulson has been loading up the boat. Paulson's hedge fund took a new position in MTG after buying 17 million shares worth $84.15 million at an average price of $3.46 a share. Paulson is already up big on this position, so there's no telling how long he plans to keep it. That said, shares of MTG are in a strong uptrend despite its short-term weakness, so it's worth putting on your radar. From a technical perspective, shares of MTG have recently pulled back from its recent 52-week high at $8.16 a share to right above its 50-day moving average of $6.71 a share. This stock could have more to go on the downside if the market doesn't bounce soon, so I would watch to see if it finds support either at its 50-day, or at $6 to $5.50 a share. Those second levels are the range lows from earlier this summer, so watch to see how it acts here at the 50-day, and then near those second levels if MTG continues lower.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kodiak Oil &amp; Gas</emphasis>Another under-$10 name that Paulson is jumping into here is<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kodiak Oil &amp; Gas</emphasis>(      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://stockpickr.com/symbol/KOG/\">KOG</url>), an independent energy player engaged in the exploration, exploitation, acquisition and production of crude oil and natural gas in the U.S. This stock hasn't done much so far in 2013, with shares up by just 7.6%. Kodiak Oil &amp; Gas has a market cap of $2.53 billion. This stock trades at a reasonable valuation, with a trailing price-to-earnings of 25.41 and a forward price-to-earnings of 9.53. Its estimated growth rate for this year 40.4%, and for next year it's pegged at 51.5%.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/5-stocks-rising-big-volume.html-1\">&gt;&gt;5 Stocks Rising on Big Volume</url>Paulson's hedge fund added a new position here with KOG after buying 14,958,400 shares between $7.47 a share to $9.07 a share, with an average price of $8.45 a share. This company has been rumored to be a takeover target, so Paulson could be speculating on just that. Another legendary hedge fund manager that's loading up on some under-$10 stocks here is      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/pro/portfolio/greenlight-capital-david-einhorn/\">David Einhorn.</url>Einhorn is the founder and president of Greenlight Capital, a long-short value-oriented hedge fund, which he started in 1996 with $900,000. Greenlight has reportedly produced about a 20% annualized return for investors, which has helped him achieve a net worth of $1.25 billion.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rite Aid</emphasis>One under-$10 name that Einhorn has initiated a massive new position in is<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rite Aid</emphasis>(      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://stockpickr.com/symbol/RAD/\">RAD</url>), which operates a retail drugstore chain in the U.S. This stock has been red hot so far in 2013, with shares up a whopping 150%.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/3-big-retail-stocks-trade-or-not.html\">&gt;&gt;3 Big Retail Stocks to Trade (or Not)</url>Rite Aid has a market cap of $3.09 billion and an enterprise value of $9.40 billion. This stock trades at a cheap valuation, with a trailing price-to-earnings of 13.99 and a forward price-to-earnings of 13.08. Its estimated growth rate for this year 33.3%, and for next year it's pegged at 62.5%. Einhorn's play here could be simply betting on Obamacare, since many analysts think the healthcare-retail sector will see a jump in sales once all the new consumers come online under the sweeping act. His position in RAD could also be a turnaround idea or even an acquisition target, since this company recently came out of tough cost cutting environment. Rite Aid is also turning itself wellness player, since its converting stores at a rapid pace into its next generation wellness store format. During the second quarter, Einhorn bought 20.2 million shares of Rite Aid between $1.71 and $3.15 a share, with an estimated average price of $2.61 a share. Einhorn's position in RAD is worth somewhere near $70 million. Einhorn is already up solidly on this bet, but I would think he's planning on holding it much longer since the stock is uptrending strong. From a technical perspective, RAD has been uptrending big for the last six months, with shares soaring higher from its low of $1.57 to its recent 52-week high at $3.62 a share. This stock has broken out multiple times during that uptrend and shares are currently not far from its 52-week high. That said, shares of RAD are bit overbought here and are due for a pullback. This one is probably worth a look near its 50-day moving average of $3.01 a share, or near $2.50 a share which its base low from this summer.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BioFuel Energy</emphasis>Another under-$10 name that Einhorn is getting long here is<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BioFuel Energy</emphasis>(      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://stockpickr.com/symbol/BIOF/\">BIOF</url>), which is engaged in the production and sale of ethanol and its co-products. This stock has been hit hard by the sellers during the last six months, with shares off by 38%. BioFuel Energy has a market cap of $19.34 million and an enterprise value of $13.37 million. This stock trades at a reasonable valuation, with a price-to-sales of 0.05 and a price-to-book of 0.37. This company has a bit more cash on its books then debt, since its total cash position is $11.23 million and its total debt is $6.7 million.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/5-stocks-poised-pop-bullish-earnings.html-15\">&gt;&gt;5 Stocks Poised to Pop on Bullish Earnings</url>This company recently reported a second-quarter net loss of $4.74 million vs. a $12.4 million net loss in the year-ago period and revenue of $91 million vs. $122.8 million, which dropped 30% year over year. Clearly not a great fundamental story here, but Einhorn could be playing BIOF as a potential beneficiary of the EPA's Renewable Fuels Standard II, or RFS2, program. Basically, large oil companies could hypothetically go out and buy ethanol plants likes BIOF runs as a way to avoid the RIN regulatory tax. Einhorn's hedge fund owns 1,427,825 shares of BIOF worth about $4.76 million. The fund increased its stake this quarter, but it's important to understand that this isn't a big position by any means, since it makes up less than 1% of his total stock portfolio. From a technical perspective, shares of BIOF have been downtrending badly for the last five months, with the stock dropping from over $6 a share to its recent low of $3.01 a share. During that downtrend, shares of BIOF have been consistently making lower highs and lower lows, which is bearish technical price action. That said, BIOF has formed a higher low and its latest pullback with the stock finding buying interest at $3.20 a share. Investors might want to look to get long BIOF if it can close back above its 50-day moving average of $3.64 with volume. I would like it even more with a close above its 200-day at $4.43 with volume. One final billionaire hedge fund manger that's making moves in low-priced stocks is      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/pro/portfolio/julian-robertson-tiger-management/\">Tiger Management's Julian Robertson</url>. Robertson is considered a pioneer in the hedge fund world since a number of money managers who have worked for him have gone on to create some of today's largest hedge funds. He's now retired but invests directly in other hedge funds, most run by former employees that still report 13Fs to the SEC.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sirius XM Radio</emphasis>One under-$10 name that Robertson's crew seems to love is<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sirius XM Radio</emphasis>(      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://stockpickr.com/symbol/SIRI/\">SIRI</url>), which broadcasts its music, sports, news, talk, entertainment, traffic and weather channels in the U.S. for a subscription fee through its proprietary satellite radio systems. This stock has been in play with the bulls so far in 2013, with shares up sharply 24%. Sirius XM Radio has a market cap of $22.42 billion and an enterprise value of $25.57 billion. This stock trades at a premium valuation, with a trailing price-to-earnings of 48.13 and a forward price-to-earnings of 30.08. Its estimated growth rate for this year -82.4%, and for next year it's pegged at 33.3%.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/4-big-tech-stocks-traders-radars.html-1\">&gt;&gt;4 Big Tech Stocks on Traders' Radars</url>On Monday, Lazard Capital Market's Barton Crockett said he thinks that SIRI could rise nearly 40% to $5 a share. In a note out to clients, the firm said the Street should have taken the announcement on Monday morning that Sirius and MLB renewed their agreement to extend live broadcasts through 20121 as a more bullish sign. The note also said the deal comes after SIRI said last week that it had signed away Piolin, a major Spanish-language radio personality, from Univision to an exclusive deal. Robertson added to his holdings in Sirius XM Radio by 76.91%, after he bought the stock between $2.99 and $3.59, with an estimated average price of $3.29. His total holdings of SIRI stock are now 7.3 million shares. From a technical perspective, shares of SIRI have been uptrending relatively strong for the last year, with shares moving higher from its low of $2.33 to its recent 52-week high of $3.85 a share. During that uptrend, shares of SIRI have been making mostly higher lows and higher highs, which is bullish technical price action. That said, shares of SIRI have started to come off its 52-week high with conviction and the stock looks ready to break below its 50-day moving average of $3.57 a share. If that level gets broken with volume, then SIRI could easily set up to re-test its 200-day at $3.21 a share, or trend much lower. If both its 50-day and 200-day moving averages are taken out on this pullback, then I would put SIRI on my watchlist for a potential buy once it trades below $3 or near its two-year base level at $2.50 a share.

In one, Democrats focused largely on the topic at hand. In the other, Republicans used the opportunity to level accusations of anti-conservative bias in Silicon Valley and censorship of conservative voices online.</p><p>The executives - Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Apple's Tim Cook, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Google's Sundar Pichai - managed to steer clear of most of those accusations, arguing that their platforms are politically neutral.</p><p>But under questioning related to their business practices, including their corporate acquisitions, the tycoons appeared more vulnerable.</p><p>Here are five key takeaways from the landmark proceedings.</p><p>1. Amazon questioned on use of sales data by private sellers</p><p>One of the most hotly anticipated lines of questioning at the hearing didn't come right away, possibly because of technical difficulties Bezos experienced during the hearing's early stages.</p><p>But when Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., asked the Amazon executive whether his company accesses and uses data on the third-party sellers who use its platform in its business decisions, the manner in which Bezos answered was notable.</p><p>\"I can't answer that question yes or no,\" Bezos told Jayapal.</p><p>During the course of its investigation, the subcommittee questioned an Amazon associate general counsel, Nate Sutton, who testified that the company does not \"use any seller data to compete\" with third-party sellers.</p><p>Amazon is conducting an internal investigation into the allegations. Bezos said he would share the results with the committee once it is complete.</p><p>2. Google accused of stealing content from Yelp</p><p>Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., said the committee's investigation showed Google had stolen the content of other websites, including Yelp, in order \"to bootstrap its own rival local search business.\"</p><p>When Yelp asked Google to stop doing that, the search engine giant responded by threatening to \"delist Yelp entirely,\" Cicilline said.</p><p>Pichai said Google was focused on giving users what they wanted and offered to provide more answers after understanding details of the case that Cicilline mentioned.</p><p>3. Facebook's acquisition of Instagram under scrutiny</p><p>In an early exchange, Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said documents unearthed by the investigation showed that Facebook saw Instagram, the popular photo-sharing app, as a \"powerful threat that could siphon business away from Facebook.\"</p><p>Rather than compete with Instagram, Facebook \"bought it,\" Nadler said of the 2012 acquisition.</p><p>Zuckerberg defended the acquisition, saying it was cleared by federal antitrust regulators when it was proposed and has proven to be \"wildly successful\" largely because of efforts by Facebook to grow Instagram.</p><p>4.

But the hearing seemed at times to take place in dual universes. In one, Democrats focused largely on the topic at hand. In the other, Republicans used the opportunity to level accusations of anti-conservative bias in Silicon Valley and censorship of conservative voices online.      The executives \u2013 Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Apple's Tim Cook, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Google's Sundar Pichai \u2013 managed to steer clear of most of those accusations, arguing that their platforms are politically neutral. But under questioning related to their business practices, including their corporate acquisitions, the tycoons appeared more vulnerable.      Here are five key takeaways from the landmark proceedings.      1. Amazon questioned on use of sales data by private sellers      One of the most hotly anticipated lines of questioning at the hearing didn't come right away, possibly because of technical difficulties Bezos experienced during the hearing's early stages.     But when Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., asked the Amazon executive whether his company accesses and uses data on the third-party sellers who use its platform in its business decisions, the manner in which Bezos answered was notable.      \"I can't answer that question yes or no,\" Bezos told Jayapal.      During the course of its investigation, the subcommittee questioned an Amazon associate general counsel, Nate Sutton, who testified that the company does not \"use any seller data to compete\" with third-party sellers. Sutton also said Amazon does not use those sellers' \"individual data when we're making decisions to launch private brands.\"      But on April 23, a Wall Street Journal report asserted that Amazon has done exactly that. Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., and Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., the subcommittee chairman, issued a statement that if the report is accurate, Sutton's testimony would \"appear to be misleading, and possibly criminally false or perjurious.\"      Under questioning by Jayapal, Bezos said Amazon has a policy against using third-party data but that he could not \"guarantee that policy has never been violated.\"     Amazon is conducting an internal investigation into the allegations. Bezos said he would share the results with the committee once it is complete.      2. Google accused of stealing content from Yelp      Cicilline said the committee's investigation showed Google had stolen the content of other websites, including Yelp, in order \"to bootstrap its own rival local search business.\"      When Yelp asked Google to stop doing that, the search engine giant responded by threatening to \"delist Yelp entirely,\" Cicilline said. \"In other words, the choice Google gave you was 'let us steal your content or effectively disappear from the web.' Isn't that anti-competitive?\"      Pichai said Google was focused on giving users what they wanted and offered to provide more answers after understanding details of the case that Cicilline mentioned.      In addition to stealing other websites' content, Google searches also \"privilege its own sites,\" Cicilline said, adding that most web searches that start on Google also \"end somewhere on Google's own websites.\"      Taken together, \"the evidence seems very clear to me as Google became the gateway to the internet it began to abuse its power and use its surveillance over web traffic to identify competitive threats and crushed them,\" Cicilline said.      3. Facebook's acquisition of Instagram under scrutiny      In an early exchange, Nadler said documents unearthed by the investigation showed that Facebook saw Instagram, the popular photo-sharing app, as a \"powerful threat that could siphon business away from Facebook.\"      Rather than compete with Instagram, Facebook \"bought it,\" Nadler said of the 2012 acquisition.      \"This is exactly the type of anti-competitive acquisition the antitrust laws were designed to prevent,\" Nadler said. \"This should never have been permitted to happen, and it cannot happen again.\"      Zuckerberg defended the acquisition, saying it was cleared by federal antitrust regulators when it was proposed and has proven to be \"wildly successful\" largely because of efforts by Facebook to grow Instagram.      \"I've been clear that Instagram was a competitor in the space of mobile photo sharing,\" Zuckerberg said. \"By having them join us, they certainly went from being a competitor ... to an app that we could help grow.\"      Jayapal questioned  Zuckerberg about internal emails from 2012 showing that the company sought to copy features and aspects of its competitors' products, especially Instagram.      Zuckerberg said the company had \"certainly adapted features that others led in,\" as have others.      Jayapal also said she had documents showing that Facebook had \"threatened to clone the products of another company while also attempting to acquire that company,\" referring to Facebook's attempts to develop a camera app to rival that of Instagram.      Instagram founder Kevin Systrom had said in emails to some investors that he felt threatened that if he didn't sell his company to Facebook, then Zuckerberg would copy or clone the photo feature to destroy Instagram.      Zuckerberg denied he had ever threatened Systrom.      4. App Store could spell trouble for Apple      Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Ga., said Apple wielded \"an enormous amount of power\" because of the coveted app marketplace and the rules \"get changed to benefit Apple at the expense of app developers in the App Store.\"      Apple's Cook said that the company evaluates every app before it is featured on the App Store and treats every developer equally and that the rules were \"open and transparent.\"      Johnson also said that Apple assigned some of its employees to help large app developers such as China's Baidu to navigate Apple's bureaucracy, compared with smaller developers who had to deal with the process on their own.      Cook said he was unaware of such practices, adding that Apple executives engage with app developers large and small.      Cook also denied allegations that the company threatened or retaliated against app developers who went public with their criticisms and also denied that Apple had increased commissions it charges app developers.      5. Republicans oppose new antitrust laws      From the hearing's outset, it was clear that the panel's Republicans would engage in lines of questioning that had little to do with antitrust. They asked about alleged anti-conservative bias, content moderation and each company's business activities in China.      And although observers could be forgiven for mistaking their interest in other issues as a lack of interest in antitrust, a key exchange between Bezos and the subcommittee's ranking member \u2013 Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wis. \u2013 revealed a more likely explanation: Republicans are against passing new antitrust laws.      The current debate in antitrust divides those who follow theories espoused by conservative legal icon Robert Bork, who believed that a company establishing market dominance by acquiring smaller companies was good for consumers as long as prices stayed low, and those who apply the beliefs of former Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, who opposed monopolies.      On Wednesday, Sensenbrenner revealed himself to be a Borkian.      \"History shows that Congress does a poor job of picking winners and losers,\" he said. \"I have reached the conclusion that we do not need to change our antitrust laws.\"      Sensenbrenner then asked Bezos how customers would benefit from the government breaking up Amazon.      \"They would not be,\" Bezos said.      \"Right,\" Sensenbrenner replied.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42722576059</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GD-YR61-F07F-811T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1379\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Miami Herald</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 30, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

In contrast, much like the previous years, there was no single standout digital platform that emerged. The last one to explode upon the scene was Meerkat, which, not unlike Foursquare before it, rapidly became commoditized or replicated by the larger platforms. In fact, the large platforms and tech companies themselves were one of the key themes of this year\u2019s SXSW, both from a regulatory standpoint as well how they impact society.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This year\u2019s SXSW could probably be summed up by five recurring themes that could be felt the panels, casual conversations, convention centers and even in an Uber, Lyft or on electric scooters.</p><p>I had the opportunity to shake the hand of Howard Schultz at the Four Seasons in Austin and introduce myself. He even made it a point to look me in the eye and come over and shake my hand once more before leaving. As he walked away, I knew in my gut that he was going to have his work cut out for him with this crowd, and it turns out that his talk ended up receiving mixed reviews.</p><p>Of the political players that attended SXSW this year (and there were many), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez had the most attended as well as the most talked about session. Days before her appearance, Senator Warren announced her position that big tech should be broken up. The upcoming 2020 election was definitely on the minds of attendees at SXSW, and for this crowd, the more progressive the policies, ideas and rhetoric, the better.</p><p>For the second year, SXSW included a \u201cWellness Expo\u201d in a 125-square-foot space, but the topics of wellness, mindfulness and all aspects of health ranging from nutrition to physical to emotional could be felt within and beyond the walls of the Palmer Events Center.</p><p>On the content side, Michael Acton Smith, CEO of mindfulness app Calm, could be found on an offsite panel with celebrity Matthew McConaughey, who narrates one of the app\u2019s sleep stories. On the streets, you could run into people like Jeff Dachis, founder of the One Drop diabetes management platform, which combines an Apple-like user experience in both its software and hardware design.</p><p>This intersection between technology and all aspects of health could be found pervasively at SXSW and is only likely to grow. The need for better solutions to proactively manage health and the desire for all players in this space to have access to the valuable data that comes with your health management will spark that growth.</p><p>At last year\u2019s SXSW, you could sense that something was on the horizon in terms of the industry\u2019s attitude toward itself in addition to its self-awareness. This year, the \u201ctechlash\u201d could be felt in every direction.</p><p>Author and digital veteran Brian Solis leveraged his platform as a featured session speaker to share his personal journey of coming to terms with the distractions and downsides of social media. A panel titled \u201cGeneration Lonely: 10,000 Followers and No Friends\u201d contemplated the epidemic of loneliness in society despite being more digitally connected than ever before. In addition to tech monopolies and the effect of technology on our emotional wellbeing, topics like AI, automation and algorithms were debated more vigorously compared to previous years.</p><p>Last year\u2019s SXSW had no shortage of panels discussing the role of women in tech or advancing women\u2019s work with STEM. A quick scan of the SXSW site using the word \u201cwomen\u201d returns at approximately official 50 sessions or events (there were more unofficial woman-centric sessions), and with the timing of International Women\u2019s Day at the kickoff of the event, the festival has become a perfect conduit for continuing the tradition of discussing all things women empowerment. Panels like \u201cHow Women Are Re-building the Man-Made Internet,\u201d featuring panelists such as Bumble\u2019s chief brand officer Alex Williamson, have fast become a staple at SXSW and are likely to continue as such.</p><p>For marketers exploring the brand track at SXSW, even if there weren\u2019t tracks dedicated to exploring the topic of a brand\u2019s higher purpose specifically, it could be felt in many conversations both onstage and off given both the political and cultural environment. Senior executives from brands who know a thing or two about brand purpose\u2014including Patagonia\u2019s Corley Kenna, Lyft\u2019s Joy Howard and Airbnb\u2019s Nancy King\u2014discussed the importance of a brand\u2019s values.</p><p>Some of the above recurring themes overlapped effortlessly, such as brand purpose and politics or politics with techlash or wellness meeting techlash, but each of these themes were big and pervasive enough to also stand on their own. SXSW was once a place where aspiring digital platforms made their debut, but it\u2019s quickly becoming a global festival where conversations around technology, society and culture collide by design and serendipity.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ADWEEK-1031796</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ADWEEK2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VP7-G1J1-JC8H-T0BM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7907</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"836\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Mediabistro Holdings, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>adweek.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 20, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp; Journals</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Online</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000707</classCode><className>FESTIVALS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>ST000DNCA</classCode><className>MINDFULNESS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N551112MM</classCode><className>HOLDING COMPANIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001970</classCode><className>TRENDS &amp; EVENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>ST000DMYZ</classCode><className>EMOTIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX000486</classCode><className>DIABETES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000707</classCode><className>FESTIVALS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DN5F</classCode><className>ON DEMAND SERVICES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>ST000DNCA</classCode><className>MINDFULNESS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX000583</classCode><className>ELECTRONICS DESIGN</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000DO43</classCode><className>MOTORIZED SCOOTERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST000DLCR</classCode><className>RIDE SHARING SERVICES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST000A39R</classCode><className>COMPUTER SOFTWARE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>PE000DN9S</classCode><className>ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

You can see this in the rise of ad blockers - now making up30% of all internet users globally and climbing[1]--and scary stats like the fact that84% of millennials don't like traditional marketing[2]. To combat these rising trends, marketers will need to be more creative, innovative, and transparent in how they engage their target audiences. To accomplish this in 2020, interactive marketing will be crucial.Consumers have had good reason to distrust companies with their data. The recentCambridge Analytica scandal[3]has made users everywhere think twice before sending their private information to third-party sources. </p><p>And anew Facebook data leak[4]shows that big tech still can't be trusted.This brings us to interactive marketing in 2020. Marketers have always loved the concept - easy-to-create quizzes, listicles, polls, and more can turn passive visitors into active participants. But interactive marketing campaigns will only work if they can get users to choose to participate in them. Transparency is crucial; companies will need to be upfront about how they will use any data collected.Here are a few things to expect in the world of online quizzes and interactive marketing in 2020. 1. More content flexibility Interactive marketing isn't new, but it's always evolving. In 2020, expect marketers to go beyond the standard one-off quiz or personality test and lead form combination. Instead, quiz makers will continue to deliver a greater range of formats and experiences for marketers to encourage repeat engagement and visits.New quiz types will automate interactive content creation. Rather than creating a \"one and done\" quiz, marketers can just upload questions by spreadsheet and pick the refresh time. Their quizzes work as evergreen content, refreshing to show visitors new questions every hour, day, or week. One simple quiz equals constant engagement.Retention mechanics will feature strongly in 2020 as well. Savvy marketers know that successful marketing is based on growing relationships - and this requires more than a single visit. Content teams will experiment combining auto-refreshing content with video game tools like leaderboards. The goal is to turn each experience into an interactive social competition keeping users coming back for more. 2. More customization Every campaign is unique, and marketers need to rapidly create bespoke content that will deliver the results they need. Quiz, poll, and other formats will move beyond the current one-size-fits-all approach and into new avenues that allow for more customization, allowing marketing teams to create a mix-and-match recipe to ensure that everything fits the needs of their customers.For example, imagine wanting to create a standard three minute, eight-question quiz to qualify leads. Beyond sticking to a strict quiz or poll, marketers will be to mix and match within the quiz itself. Questions one and two might be single or multiple-choice, three and four could be polls, and five to eight can be Tinder-style swipe questions. The result is that these more engaging experiences keep visitors happily tapping away until the end. 3. More power for product recommendations Online marketing quizzes have always been good at suggesting products based on each quiz taker's answers. The best quizzes feature six to ten questions, which give marketers that many data points to refine and suggest the perfect products. But there are many more useful and flexible ways to craft the quiz and post-quiz experience.After the quiz is completed, instead of just showing their results, you can send each user to their personalized shopping cart. For example, imagine a customer takes a quiz to help choose their ideal headphones. A quality post-quiz experience will take them directly to a shopping page for the noise-canceling headphones they need for their open-plan office. By seamlessly taking them to the checkout, they're far more likely to make a purchase.That's just one way that interactive marketing will win for marketers in 2020. Better yet, customized product recommendations matched with tighter integration into e-commerce systems will result in better conversions and deliver on the bottom line. 4. More efficient to create It's been breathtaking to see how fast online marketing tools have developed over the past ten years. Interactive marketing is no different: It has become exponentially easier to create and manage quizzes and other content - and this is only going to accelerate in 2020.Think back to YouTube: Before it arrived on the scene, video content was expensive to create, edit, and publish. Now, these tools have shifted down the skills pyramid from formerly requiring dedicated experts to now, where any online-savvy marketers can create their own quiz.Marketing teams will continue the trend of bringing interactive content in-house. In the past, it would have taken six to eight weeks for an agency to be hired, briefed, and then ready to deliver relatively straightforward custom content for a campaign.In 2020, this will change. Smart teams will increasingly create and roll out their own interactive content, from personality tests and quizzes to listicles or polls. They'll start because of the cost savings, paying a few modest monthly subscriptions for tools versus a stream of custom proposals. But they'll stay when they see the speed and scalability. Content will be faster, easier, and more effective. Even better, all these skills will stay in-house.Agencies will still have a role of course, but they'll be brought in only for high budget, high profile campaigns, not for this type of easily created content. 5. More data capture It's becoming ever-more difficult for marketers to collect data from potential customers. The EU kicked things off with its sweepingGeneral Data Protection Regulation[5](GDPR) in May, 2018, while California - the fifth largest economy in the world - launched itsCalifornia Consumer Protection Act[6](CCPA) on January 1, 2020.Big laws, big regulation, and big fines for non-compliance means that it will be increasingly difficult for marketing campaigns to have the same effect as in years past. Traditional online advertising like banner ads relies on using cookies and other tricks to covertly track behavior across the web. Sure, there's the \"manage privacy\" option displayed on the first visit to a site, but how many people really take the time to opt-in or out?Interactive content, on the other hand, will continue to thrive because it offers both a compelling and transparent way to convince customers to provide their data. Interactive content transparently integrates data collection - compare that with traditional advertising's behind the scenes approach. Most quality software providers include an explicit lead generation step before their results where a site visitor can explicitly choose to complete with their name, email, and other relevant information. It's up to the companies to provide a compelling reason to persuade each customer it's worth it.For example, if someone starts a quiz on a career consultant website, they might answer 10 to 15 questions about their ideal job. But before seeing their job recommendations, they can choose to give their name and email in return for a free 15-minute Skype session with an advisor, who can use craft a custom session around each person's needs. This sort of clear offer can pay off with up to 40% opt-in rates from interested leads. The big takeaways for interactive marketing in 2020 2020 kicks off a new decade full of new challenges and opportunities for marketers.

They will encourage their audience to voluntarily engage and opt-in with their data through the customization, lead generation, and production recommendation power of interactive content tools. Engagement and transparency through interactive content is the new marketing playbook for 2020.

Sign up here.)</p><p>1. DACA</p><p>The Supreme Court has blocked the Trump Administration's attempt to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA. It's the Court's second major blow to the President after the pro-LGBTQ rights ruling earlier this week. The 5-4 decision was written by Chief Justice John Roberts, who said the administration didn't provide an adequate reason for ending the program. Roberts, a conservative, is now facing scathing criticism from top GOP lawmakers. The Trump Administration has long wanted to phase out the Obama-era program, which protects from deportation nearly 700,000 young undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children. Lower courts have blocked it in the past, and now the Supreme Court has put a definitive end to current efforts -- for now. Keep in mind, the ruling took issue with how the administration was trying to phase out DACA -- it didn't weigh in on the legality of the program itself. So, there's no guarantee that future legal challenges would be met with the same result.</p><p>2. Coronavirus</p><p>Coronavirus cases are ticking up across the country, bringing some states back to the table on mandatory safety precautions. In California, people now will be required to wear face masks in indoor public areas. Oregon has adopted a similar mandate for seven counties. North Carolina and Arizona are considering face mask regulations, too. These four states, plus six others, are reporting their highest seven-day averages of daily new coronavirus cases since the crisis began. The governors of two of those states, Florida and Texas, are blaming the spikes on increased testing, even though local leaders are pleading for more action. Cases are also rising in Oklahoma, where President Trump is set to hold a massive rally Saturday, much to the concern of medical experts. The ominous numbers are another sign that the pandemic isn't going away anytime soon, something people half a world away in Beijing already know too well. The Chinese capital went 55 days without any new locally reported infections but is now battling a rapid resurgence.</p><p>3. Police reform</p><p>The New York City Council has passed a sweeping package of police reform bills, some of which have been in the works since the death of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man, in 2014. The package includes requirements for officer badge numbers to be visible, an official ban on choke holds or any other maneuver that restricts blood or air flow, and a bill requiring oversight of the New York City Police Department's surveillance technology. It also creates a penalty system for police officers with disciplinary issues, and sanctifies the right to record police interactions. In Washington, things aren't progressing so quickly. Senate Democrats are trying to decide whether to block a Republican police reform bill they believe is too weak. If they don't block it, they could miss an opportunity to change the bill to their liking. Meanwhile, Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron has promised a thorough investigation into the death of Breonna Taylor, a black EMT who was shot by police in her home in March. Some believe her case has gone under the radar in the rapidly evolving push for police accountability.</p><p>4. Facebook</p><p>Facebook has removed posts from President Trump's re-election campaign for breaching its policies on hate by using what the tech company claims is Nazi imagery. The ads attacked what the Trump campaign described as \"Dangerous MOBS of far-left groups,\" and featured an upside-down triangle. According to the Anti-Defamation League, the symbol is almost identical to one used by Nazis to classify prisoners in concentration camps. In response, the Trump campaign claimed the symbol was widely used by antifa, a loose group of liberal activists and a favorite political target of the President. Just last month, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was criticized for not taking action on some of President Trump's posts that had been flagged on Twitter as glorifying violence.</p><p>5. Economy</p><p>Europe is vowing to move ahead with levies that could hit big tech companies after the US slammed the brakes on diplomatic negotiations over global corporate tax rules. Since those talks shuttered, major European economies like France and the UK may move forward with their own levies to capture more taxes from companies like Apple, Google and Facebook. If that happens, the US has vowed to hit back with tariffs. This brewing conflict could heap even more pain on struggling economies. The UK is already facing its worst downturn in 300 years, and The Bank of England is adding even more money to the trillions in stimulus funds already propping up the economy.</p><p>BREAKFAST BROWSE</p><p>A woman fends off a bear attack -- with a laptop </p><p>Don't try this at home.</p><p>McDonald's is hiring 260,000 people in the US this summer</p><p>A golden opportunity for the golden arches.</p><p>Kristen Stewart is going to play Princess Diana in an upcoming movie </p><p>Yes, she's the one who got her start in \"Twilight.\"</p><p>Football may not even happen this year, according to Dr. Fauci </p><p>Now it will just be called Sunday Night SADNESS. </p><p>Americans are currently beset with record levels of unhappiness</p><p>You know what would fix this?

Sign up here.)</p><p>1. DACA</p><p>The Supreme Court has blocked the Trump Administration's attempt to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA. It's the Court's second major blow to the President after the pro-LGBTQ rights ruling earlier this week. The 5-4 decision was written by Chief Justice John Roberts, who said the administration didn't provide an adequate reason for ending the program. Roberts, a conservative, is now facing scathing criticism from top GOP lawmakers. The Trump Administration has long wanted to phase out the Obama-era program, which protects from deportation nearly 700,000 young undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children. Lower courts have blocked it in the past, and now the Supreme Court has put a definitive end to current efforts -- for now. Keep in mind, the ruling took issue with how the administration was trying to phase out DACA -- it didn't weigh in on the legality of the program itself. So, there's no guarantee that future legal challenges would be met with the same result.</p><p/><p>2. Coronavirus</p><p>Coronavirus cases are ticking up across the country, bringing some states back to the table on mandatory safety precautions. In California, people now will be required to wear face masks in indoor public areas. Oregon has adopted a similar mandate for seven counties. North Carolina and Arizona are considering face mask regulations, too. These four states, plus six others, are reporting their highest seven-day averages of daily new coronavirus cases since the crisis began. The governors of two of those states, Florida and Texas, are blaming the spikes on increased testing, even though local leaders are pleading for more action. Cases are also rising in Oklahoma, where President Trump is set to hold a massive rally Saturday, much to the concern of medical experts. The ominous numbers are another sign that the pandemic isn't going away anytime soon, something people half a world away in Beijing already know too well. The Chinese capital went 55 days without any new locally reported infections but is now battling a rapid resurgence.</p><p>3. Police reform</p><p>The New York City Council has passed a sweeping package of police reform bills, some of which have been in the works since the death of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man, in 2014. The package includes requirements for officer badge numbers to be visible, an official ban on choke holds or any other maneuver that restricts blood or air flow, and a bill requiring oversight of the New York City Police Department's surveillance technology. It also creates a penalty system for police officers with disciplinary issues, and sanctifies the right to record police interactions. In Washington, things aren't progressing so quickly. Senate Democrats are trying to decide whether to block a Republican police reform bill they believe is too weak. If they don't block it, they could miss an opportunity to change the bill to their liking. Meanwhile, Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron has promised a thorough investigation into the death of Breonna Taylor, a black EMT who was shot by police in her home in March. Some believe her case has gone under the radar in the rapidly evolving push for police accountability.</p><p>4. Facebook</p><p>Facebook has removed posts from President Trump's re-election campaign for breaching its policies on hate by using what the tech company claims is Nazi imagery. The ads attacked what the Trump campaign described as \"Dangerous MOBS of far-left groups,\" and featured an upside-down triangle. According to the Anti-Defamation League, the symbol is almost identical to one used by Nazis to classify prisoners in concentration camps. In response, the Trump campaign claimed the symbol was widely used by antifa, a loose group of liberal activists and a favorite political target of the President. Just last month, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was criticized for not taking action on some of President Trump's posts that had been flagged on Twitter as glorifying violence.</p><p>5. Economy</p><p>Europe is vowing to move ahead with levies that could hit big tech companies after the US slammed the brakes on diplomatic negotiations over global corporate tax rules. Since those talks shuttered, major European economies like France and the UK may move forward with their own levies to capture more taxes from companies like Apple, Google and Facebook. If that happens, the US has vowed to hit back with tariffs. This brewing conflict could heap even more pain on struggling economies. The UK is already facing its worst downturn in 300 years, and The Bank of England is adding even more money to the trillions in stimulus funds already propping up the economy.</p><p/><p>BREAKFAST BROWSE</p><p>A woman fends off a bear attack -- with a laptop</p><p>Don't try this at home.</p><p>McDonald's is hiring 260,000 people in the US this summer</p><p>A golden opportunity for the golden arches.</p><p/><p>Kristen Stewart is going to play Princess Diana in an upcoming movie</p><p>Yes, she's the one who got her start in \"Twilight.\"</p><p>Football may not even happen this year, according to Dr. Fauci</p><p>Now it will just be called Sunday Night SADNESS.</p><p>Americans are currently beset with record levels of unhappiness</p><p>You know what would fix this?

Immigration</p><p>Nearly 250 migrant children held in reportedly poor conditions at a Customs and Border Protection facility in Texas will be moved. The children should be in the Department of Health and Human Services' shelter system by today. The move comes after a team of lawyers, doctors and advocates warned of\u00c2\u00a0major health and hygiene problems -- including in some cases a lack of soap --\u00c2\u00a0after visiting\u00c2\u00a0multiple US Customs and Border Protection facilities in the state.\u00c2\u00a0The Trump administration argued in court last week that detained migrant children didn't need toothbrushes, medicine and blankets in order to be held in \"safe and sanitary conditions.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, Mexico has deployed about 15,000 troops to its US border (on top of\u00c2\u00a0the 2,000 service members it's sent to its southern border with Belize and Guatemala). Mexico is under renewed pressure from the Trump administration to help slow migration flows northward.</p><p>And the parents of Gurupreet Kaur, the 6-year-old girl from India who died near the US-Mexico border, have spoken out, explaining the predicament that ultimately ended in her death. \"We trust that every parent, regardless of origin, color or creed, will understand that no mother or father ever puts their child in harm's way unless they are desperate,\" they said.</p><p>2. US and Iran</p><p>President Trump signed an executive order yesterday imposing new sanctions on Iran\u00c2\u00a0as retaliation for Iran's downing last week of a US military drone. The President said the \"hard-hitting\" sanctions will financially punish Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The sanctions also target Iranian military officials and the country's top diplomat. Iran's state media denounced the move as a sign of \"America's desperation.\" CNN's Stephen Collinson says Trump's sanctions move still risks putting the two countries on a path to war. Still have questions about the US-Iran crisis? Here are some answers.</p><p/><p>3. Bill Gates</p><p>An unlikely voice is joining the chorus calling for government regulation of Big Tech companies:\u00c2\u00a0the founder of Microsoft. Bill Gates told the Economic Club of Washington\u00c2\u00a0DC that \"the government needs to get involved\" because technology has become so central to all areas of our lives. Microsoft's big tech rivals -- Apple, Google, Amazon and Facebook -- all face increased scrutiny from the\u00c2\u00a0Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice, which could lead to antitrust investigations. Microsoft had its own antitrust lawsuit to deal with two decades ago and ended up changing some of its business practices after a settlement with the Justice Department.</p><p/><p>4. Myanmar\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>We told you last week about the internet\u00c2\u00a0being switched off in parts of\u00c2\u00a0Ethiopia. Now, the government in Myanmar has shut down mobile data networks in parts of that\u00c2\u00a0country. It was done \"for the sake of security and the public interest,\" a\u00c2\u00a0Myanmar communications official said, and services will resume when \"stability is restored.\" A top UN official warned of \"serious implications for human rights\" in places where mobile internet services were cut.</p><p>The affected areas include Rakhine state, where violence had forced more than 720,000 Rohingya to flee into Bangladesh.

Two of the late CNN host's longtime friends, chefs\u00a0Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s and Eric Ripert, want fans to share memories of him with the hashtag #BourdainDay.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here's what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door. (You can also get \"5 Things You Need to Know Today\" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">1. Immigration</p><p>Nearly 250 migrant children held in reportedly poor conditions at a Customs and Border Protection facility in Texas will be moved. The children should be in the Department of Health and Human Services' shelter system by today. The move comes after a team of lawyers, doctors and advocates warned of\u00a0major health and hygiene problems -- including in some cases a lack of soap --\u00a0after visiting\u00a0multiple US Customs and Border Protection facilities in the state.\u00a0The Trump administration argued in court last week that detained migrant children didn't need toothbrushes, medicine and blankets in order to be held in \"safe and sanitary conditions.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, Mexico has deployed about 15,000 troops to its US border (on top of\u00a0the 2,000 service members it's sent to its southern border with Belize and Guatemala). Mexico is under renewed pressure from the Trump administration to help slow migration flows northward.</p><p>And the parents of Gurupreet Kaur, the 6-year-old girl from India who died near the US-Mexico border, have spoken out, explaining the predicament that ultimately ended in her death. \"We trust that every parent, regardless of origin, color or creed, will understand that no mother or father ever puts their child in harm's way unless they are desperate,\" they said. </p><p>2. US and Iran</p><p>President Trump signed an executive order yesterday imposing new sanctions on Iran\u00a0as retaliation for Iran's downing last week of a US military drone. The President said the \"hard-hitting\" sanctions will financially punish Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The sanctions also target Iranian military officials and the country's top diplomat. Iran's state media denounced the move as a sign of \"America's desperation.\" CNN's Stephen Collinson says Trump's sanctions move still risks putting the two countries on a path to war. Still have questions about the US-Iran crisis? Here are some answers.</p><p>3. Bill Gates</p><p>An unlikely voice is joining the chorus calling for government regulation of Big Tech companies:\u00a0the founder of Microsoft. Bill Gates told the Economic Club of Washington\u00a0DC that \"the government needs to get involved\" because technology has become so central to all areas of our lives. Microsoft's big tech rivals -- Apple, Google, Amazon and Facebook -- all face increased scrutiny from the\u00a0Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice, which could lead to antitrust investigations. Microsoft had its own antitrust lawsuit to deal with two decades ago and ended up changing some of its business practices after a settlement with the Justice Department.</p><p>4. Myanmar\u00a0</p><p>We told you last week about the internet\u00a0being switched off in parts of\u00a0Ethiopia. Now, the government in Myanmar has shut down mobile data networks in parts of that\u00a0country. It was done \"for the sake of security and the public interest,\" a\u00a0Myanmar communications official said, and services will resume when \"stability is restored.\" A top UN official warned of \"serious implications for human rights\" in places where mobile internet services were cut.</p><p>The affected areas include Rakhine state, where violence had forced more than 720,000 Rohingya to flee into Bangladesh. US lawmakers and human rights groups say the anti-Rohingya crackdown amounts\u00a0to ethnic cleansing and even genocide.\u00a0Internet shutdowns have become\u00a0increasingly common across the world in recent years, especially in Asia, often after protests or other anti-government activity. By the way, the internet is back on in Ethiopia.</p><p>5. Weather</p><p>Summer is only a few days old, but already Europe is facing down a big-time heat wave.\u00a0A \"potentially dangerous\" blast of hot\u00a0air is forecast to engulf the continent this week. Temperatures are expected to hit 100 degrees Fahrenheit in\u00a0France, Germany, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Switzerland and Italy. The uncommon heat could hang around until the start of July, one forecasting agency\u00a0predicts.

It used to be on everything, but now it's only found on two types of devices \u2014 iPhones[2] and some iPad[3] models. The lightning cable Apple[4] includes with the iPhone doesn't support fast charging and transfers data at USB 2.0 speeds. Switching the iPhone to USB-C[5] could unify Apple's products. </p><p>Following is a transcript of the video. Narrator: You probably recognize this. It's a Lightning cable. They're everywhere. In 2012, we said goodbye to 30-pin, and Lightning became Apple's main connector. But, seven years later, it's on only two types of devices: iPhones and lower-end iPads. When Apple introduced the Lightning connector, Phil Schiller said: Schiller: So much has changed since we first created that 30-pin connector. Narrator: Now, the same is true of Lightning.1. It's proprietary.Apple's connectors have become fragmented. In 2018, it unveiled the new iPad Pro with a USB-C port instead of Lightning. But when Apple updated its lower-end iPads in March, they kept the Lightning port. So now some iPads use Lightning, and some use USB-C. MacBooks also use USB-C. But still, the iPhone comes with a Lightning to USB-A cable. So you can't even plug your iPhone into your MacBook without buying a separate cable. Somehow, Apple's most important product is the odd one out. To be clear, Lightning was a good connector seven years ago. It transfers power and data, it was faster than 30-pin, of course, it's reversible, the connection is super secure, and replacement cables are really easy to find. The problem is that it's proprietary, so few devices actually use it.2. It's more expensive.This forces you to buy dongles and carry around extra cables. But it's not just a minor annoyance. Because it's a proprietary connector, official Lightning cables and accessories are often more expensive than the USB-C equivalent. These higher prices can lead consumers to buy non-certified cables, which might not function properly and could even damage your phone. And Lightning's starting to show its age.3. It's slower.The standard hasn't been significantly updated in the seven years it's been around. Most Lightning cables transfer data at USB 2.0 speeds, although there are some reports of USB 3.0 speeds with newer models. But we don't really know how fast Lighting is since it's proprietary, Apple, doesn't have to release all of the specifications. It just feels weird to buy a cable that can transfer data without actually knowing how fast or slow it will be. Regardless, Lightning is no longer a fast connector. If only Apple had a faster standard they could use. You're right, Thunderbolt 3 is frequently used by Apple, and at 40 gigabits per second, it's way faster than Lighting. It also supports things like external hard drives and displays. And of course, it uses the ubiquitous USB-C connector. But Apple has been reluctant to adopt USB-C on all of its devices.4. It doesn't support fast-charging.Now, you may be thinking, why do I need fast data-transfer speeds? It's just my iPhone-charging cable. Transferring large files to your iPhone isn't something every user needs. But the included Lightning cable doesn't even support fast charging, a feature found on almost every new Android phone. And it's notorious for breaking or fraying. It's almost inevitable that you'll need to buy another cable.5. On the other hand, ditching Lightning would complicate things.Even with all of its flaws, a world without Lightning might still seem strange to you. But Apple has a long history of ditching features before users are ready to say goodbye. And having different connectors throughout their products is very un-Apple-like. It goes against the it-just-works ecosystem they try to promote. Switching the iPhone to USB-C would unify their products. But that would also force Apple to say goodbye to the money it makes from licensing the Lightning standard to third parties, while also frustrating users who have purchased various Lightning dongles and accessories. We'll have to wait until September's iPhone event to find out if Apple will finally say goodbye to Lightning. Recent reports have predicted that the iPhone will have USB-C. But we've been hearing these types of rumors for a while. And, currently, it's still just speculation, based on an image in the iOS 13 beta. Between 30-pin and Lightning, Apple has had its own connector for over 15 years. Schiller: So a lot's changed, and it's time for the connector to evolve, and that's just what we've done.

At Google Cloud, we continually invest in protecting our customers' data across all our products, including Cloud Storage[1].&amp;#160;&amp;#160; For every Google Cloud product, security is always a top priority. As enterprise storage needs grow, our security and compliance protections grow too. Cloud Storage secures data by default with rich security controls and the ability to audit as needed. </p><p>Features like Bucket Lock, Cloud Key Management Service (KMS), and Access Transparency[2] already help keep your data safe in Cloud Storage. We're announcing further product updates, now generally available, to protect your data, even in complex, multi-cloud environments. Let's take a look at some of the new security features available in Cloud Storage. What's new with Cloud Storage security V4 signature support with Cloud Storage We are happy to announce the GA launch of V4 signature support with Cloud Storage[3]. This is a critical multi-cloud security capability for our customers and partners. V4 signature capability enables customers to generate signed URLs (also referred to as pre-signed URLs) with limited permissions and duration, which they can issue to their clients/users who don't need to have a Google identity. Signature-based authentications, especially through signed URLs, is a very common security posture used for content storage and delivery, SaaS platforms and applications, and analytics (enterprise data warehouses and analytics pipelines). You can take a look at a signature-based multimedia content storage and distribution setup example here[4].&amp;#160;Hash-based message authentication (HMAC) for Cloud Storage service accounts You can now manage and use hash-based message authentication (HMAC) credentials[5] associated with Cloud Storage service accounts, rather than user accounts. This feature strengthens your authentication and security by not having to rely on credentials tied to the user accounts. This feature also lets you interoperate seamlessly among multiple cloud vendors with regards to security and authentication setups and practices.Uniform bucket-level access for Cloud IAM Cloud Storage's support for Cloud Identity and Access Management (Cloud IAM) enables you to apply access policies by role to Cloud Storage users, along with other Google Cloud products. The new uniform bucket-level access feature lets you uniformly configure access through Cloud IAM Policies to your Cloud Storage resources[6], allowing for manageability at scale. When it's enabled on a bucket, only bucket-level Cloud IAM permissions grant access to that bucket and the objects it contains.Putting Cloud Storage security best practices into action Securing your enterprise storage data requires thinking ahead to protect your data against new threats and challenges. We often hear best practices and tips from Cloud Storage users on how they use Google Cloud products to enhance their company's security posture.&amp;#160; Here are five recommendations to use these new features and help prevent data leaks or hacks: 1. Turn on uniform bucket-level access[7] and its org policy Uniform bucket-level access for Cloud Storage buckets lets you configure and enforce uniform Cloud IAM policies for your buckets. Turning this feature also ensures that you are safeguarded against any object-level ACLs, which become a challenge to manage access, especially at scale. This feature also offers an organizational policy that lets you enforce the use of uniform IAM access policies on all new buckets, if desired. Enforcing IAM policies at the bucket level can help prevent inadvertent public exposures, which can happen in the absence of this feature if users make individual objects public.This feature has been very useful for our customers in particular from financial services and big tech industries. It lets you manage uniform permissions at scale in situations where there are lots of developers/employees who need to access the data, but it can't be exposed outside the company.2. Enable domain-restricted sharing Once you've turned on uniform bucket-level access, another useful tool in Cloud Storage is to enforce the domain-restricted sharing constraint[8] in an organization policy to prevent accidental public data sharing, or sharing beyond your organization. With this feature, organizations and development teams can move quickly, while security and governance teams can enforce security at scale and trust that resources have the right controls[9] in place. Domain-restricted sharing can be used in conjunction with uniform bucket-level access to configure rock-solid access control policies and safeguard against accidental public exposures.&amp;#160;3. Encrypt your Cloud Storage data with Cloud KMS Regulations for data access and control are increasingly becoming more strict. For example, GDPR made many companies change the way they collect, store and process personal information. An important piece of this puzzle is encryption key management. Cloud KMS[10] is a cloud-hosted key management service supported by Cloud Storage that lets you manage encryption keys for your cloud storage data. You can generate, use, rotate, and destroy AES256, RSA 2048, RSA 3072, RSA 4096, EC P256, and EC P384 cryptographic keys. This feature offers state-of-the-art encryption management and can help you with various regulations.4. Audit your Cloud Storage data with Cloud Audit Logging Cloud Audit Logs[11] bring visibility into user activity and data access across Google Cloud, including Cloud Storage. Cloud Audit Logs reside in highly protected Cloud Storage, resulting in a secure, immutable, and highly durable audit trail. You can also use Operations[12] (formerly Stackdriver) APIs for programmatic access and ingesting Cloud Storage audit logs into your threat detection analytics systems.5. Secure your data with VPC Service Controls With VPC Service Controls[13], you can configure security perimeters around the resources of your Cloud Storage service and control exfiltration of data across the perimeter boundary. For example, a VM within a VPC network that is part of the service perimeter can read from/write to a Cloud Storage bucket. Any attempt to access data from outside the perimeter will be denied. With your Cloud Storage buckets behind a VPC Service Control security perimeter, you have a private cloud-like security posture for your Cloud Storage data.To learn even more about Cloud Storage and ways to enhance data protection and security, check out the access control documentation[14] and our presentation at Cloud Next '19[15]. \" &gt; Cloud storage is a foundational technology for many modern businesses, helping to store vast amounts of data that users can easily access and use to power modern data projects.

As a therapist, Morin has counseled many couples through challenging experiences in their relationships. With the spread of the coronavirus[2], there's a growing chance that you and your partner may be required to work from home. </p><p>This increase of close quarters may be welcoming for some couples, and stressful for others \u2014 here's 5 ways to handle the situation. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[3]. Being confined to a small space together can be quite stressful for any couple. But add in the stress of the outbreak of a potentially life-threatening illness, and you might find even further trouble tolerating one another. Fortunately, there are some ways to help one another get through quarantine. Here's what you can do to ensure that your relationship survives being confined in a small room together: Help each other deal with the emotional rollercoaster imtmphoto/Getty ImagesFrom anger to fear, the quarantine will likely stir up a lot of emotion. And you might experience these emotions coming in waves. You may find yourselves laughing one minute and crying just a short time later. And of course, you're likely to be bored and frustrated in between. This is all normal when faced with such a highly stressful and unfamiliar situation as quarantine. There's little known about what to expect, what might happen, or when you will be able to leave. Help one another ride this emotional rollercoaster. Rather than minimize your partner's feelings by saying, \"Oh there's nothing to be scared about,\" say things like, \"I know this is a scary situation.\" Just knowing that you're listening can provide a big sense of relief for your partner.Focus on being kind and respectful Hinterhaus Productions/Getty ImagesAny stressful situation can cause you to grow a bit irritable and snarky with one another. But under normal circumstances, you can walk away and take a break. Obviously, you can't do that when you're quarantined in the same room. Make it a goal to treat your partner with kindness \u2014 even when you don't feel like it. Apologize when you are unkind, and forgive your partner for being rude at times as well. Keep in mind that even though there aren't a lot of things you can control when you're quarantined, one thing you can control is how you treat one another. So make it a goal to remain kind and respectful despite feeling stressed out.Practice healthy coping skills Fergus Coyle/ShutterstockWhen you're quarantined, you won't have access to many of the coping skills you've likely grown accustomed to in managing distress \u2014 like walking around the neighborhood or going for a drive to listen to music. Consequently, you might find yourself feeling a bit helpless when it comes to managing your mood. Fortunately, there are some simple coping strategies you can turn to even when you're quarantined. Meditation, yoga, breathing exercises, drawing, listening to music, reading a book, or just pacing around the room might decrease your stress and help you feel better. Work on managing your emotions so you can be the best partner you are able to under the circumstances. Talk about the skills that are working for you, and offer to assist your partner if he or she is looking for some quick ways to regulate their mood as well.See the rest of the story at Business

The region's growth is closely tied to buildup during World War II and federal investment. Recent events like Mark Zuckerberg's[2] congressional hearing and Elizabeth Warren's[3] plans for big tech may usher in a new era of Silicon Valley history. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[4] People often think of Silicon Valley technology firms as an industry that popped up independently and wants less regulation, but historian Jeannette Estruth, an assistant professor of history at Bard College wants to remind you that Silicon Valley is in many ways a federal and state project. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://jeannette-a-estruth.squarespace.com\">https://jeannette-a-estruth.squarespace.com</url>/ \"Its roots are totally enmeshed with the government,\" she said, in particular to war efforts of the 20th century. She pointed to federal investment in Bay Area universities during and after World War II, and how closely tied their growth was to war. Research and knowledge production from the war made the explosion of growth possible. \"People don't think about infrastructure,\" Estruth said, noting how important the housing boom following the war, and later the expansion of the San Jose airport, were to Silicon Valley's story. Now, with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's congressional hearing and democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren's plan to break up big tech[5], Estruth thinks that we might be entering a new era of increased accountability and oversight in Silicon Valley. Check out the six unexpected moments that Estruth says shaped today's Silicon Valley: 1. Modern Silicon Valley developed as a result of the infrastructure build-up of World War II. Photo by Alfred T. Palmer/Getty Images During World War II and the following years, the classic Cold War research university exploded, according to Estruth. Stanford University and UC Berkeley became part of knowledge creation in geography, chemical weapons, surveillance, and computation. Photo by Nat Farbman/The LIFE Picture Collection via Getty ImagesWith the US presence in the Pacific theater of the war, the West Coast became an important center of shipbuilding, transportation of troops and material, and food. People, money, and resources were moving through the area and in university spaces, setting the stage for a tech boom.Men from other parts of the country moved through the Bay Area for jobs or on their way to fight in Asia, and some of them saw a place they wanted to settle in the future. People stayed or moved after the war, and large quantities of housing were built.

This has led some strategists to recommend that investors shift away from big tech companies and, instead, buy up these young tech stocks.Companies that are leading the market and are positioned to keep outperforming include Cabot Microelectronics Corp.</p><p>(CCMP[1]), SolarEdge Technologies Inc. (SEDG[2]), Viavi Solutions (VIAV[3]), Brooks Automation Inc. (BRKS[4]), Power Integrations Inc. (POWI[5]), and Itron Inc. (ITRI[6]).\"Today, when it comes to technology stocks, while big may be beautiful, small may be smart,\" said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group,as outlined in a recent Business Insider[7] report.Paulson calls these small techs the 'Mini-FANGS,' which are displacing the traditional FANGs -- Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN[8]), Netflix Inc. (NFLX[9]), Facebook Inc. (FB[10]) and Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL[11]) -- as market leaders. Valuation, Volatility, Performance  SolarEdge stock has risen 153% this year, for example. Itron is higher by 57%, Brooks Automation and Cabot Microelectronics are both up 45%, while Viavi Solution's has jumped 43%. By comparison, the S...00 has returned about 18.4% in 2019.Paulsen likes these small cap names from a valuation, volatility and performance position, per BI. The money manager adds that smaller names are less vulnerable to regulation. What's Next  There's a compelling reason why these stocks will continue to do well. Small cap stocks in general, which include the mini-FANGs, are more compelling from a valuation perspective, according to the money manager. He indicates that based on forward price-to-earnings multiple, price-to-book ratio, and price-to-cash multiples, smaller stocks have become less expensive since the end of 2013.

The issue is the use of social networks by foreign actors to influence US elections. </p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> The audience will again raise questions about regulation, but investors do not expect any kind of shock. <br/><br/><br/><br/> \"Investors have become more immune to this news\" since, said GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives. \"I think that investors expect companies to continue to reiterate their messages and communications of the last few months, this is not a new problem.\" <br/><br/><br/><br/> Lawmakers will seek answers about what companies are doing to respond to false news criticism, state-sponsored misinformation, prejudice and harassment on their platforms. <br/><br/><br/><br/> The audience comes at a time when technological giants have been meticulously scrutinized for allowing Russian trolls to spread disinformation to influence US elections. Some Republicans, including the president, also accused social media platforms of harboring a liberal bias and trying to silence conservative voices. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Googlewas also asked to appear, but has not yet said publicly whether its CEO will attend. <br/><br/><br/><br/> Michael Pachter, general director of equity research at Wedbush, said he does not expect Google's shares to face any pressure if the company does not show up. But he added that he believes that \"investors expect their CEOs to have respect for their institutions.\" <br/><br/><br/><br/> Separately, on Wednesday, Dorsey will appear before the House Energy and Commerce Committee at 1:30 p.m., Eastern Time, to answer questions about the conservative claim that Twitter is silencing far-right voices in its platform. <br/><br/><br/><br/> Republican Rep. Greg Walden said he wants to \"better understand the decisions Twitter makes about the content and process of the company to prevent errors and undue biases.\" <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> 2. The next round of tariffs to China could be very large: President <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is reportedly ready to go ahead with a plan to impose strong tariffs on China worth $ 200 billion worth of products as soon as the period of public comments on Thursday. Trump has already imposed 25% tariffs on Chinese products worth 50,000 million dollars, and Beijing has retaliated equally. <br/><br/><br/><br/> China has vowed to put pressure on the United States if it moves forward with the new tariffs, although the country is running out of assets to tax. Even so, it is possible that China may choose to defend itself by devaluing its currency, which would make Chinese products more competitive throughout the world. <br/><br/><br/><br/> 3. Billions of dollars club: Amazon is about to reach a trillion dollars. On Friday, the stock closed in 2012.71 dollars per share. This trillion on August 2. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> 4. Employment Report: The US Department of Labor will publish your monthly employment data on Friday. Investors expect another set of solid earnings in employment and steady growth in wages. The unemployment rate fell to 3.9% in July. <br/><br/><br/><br/> 5. Kickoff: The NFL kicks off its 2018 season on Thursday with the Atlanta Falcons and the Philadelphia Eagles in a primetime show on NBC. Disney, Fox, CBS, Comcast and Amazon have made significant investments for transmission rights ofthe NFL, so investors will be tuned to the ratings this season. The NFL ratings have had problems. <br/><br/><br/><br/> 6. Back to work: the volume of operations has been low. But with the holidays coming to an end, the real test for the market could be when traders refocus completely on Wall Street. Markets could react more significantly to trade agreements, Federal Reserve interest rate decisions and corporate profits. <br/><br/><br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-4000814</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T61-W2M1-DY1K-8439-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"625\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 3, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Shares of companies such as Facebook Inc. (FB[1]), Netflix Inc. (NFLX[2]), Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.</p><p>(BABA[3]), Rakuten Inc. (RKUNY) and Naspers Limited (NPSNY), have posted returns over 25% year-to-date (YTD), compared to the broader S...00's 10.8% increase. Meanwhile, four tech stocks\u2014Microsoft Corp. (MSFT[4]), Facebook, Apple Inc. (AAPL[5]) and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN[6]) \u2014accounted for roughly 12% of the S...00's total advance in the first two months of the year, according to S...ow Jones Indices. These tech titans were four of the five biggest contributors to the index's gains during that period, per The Wall Street Journal[7].'Big tech is looking far more interesting now than it has any time over the past year,' said Jim Tierney, chief investment officer of U.S. concentrated growth at AllianceBernstein. Investors and analysts cite at least five key forces driving up techs, per the table below.Why Big Tech Stocks Are Back! Shares are cheaper, more attractive after Q4 plunge Fed has become more dovish Tech giants reporting strong, record profits while S...00 earnings decelerate Many big techs companies still trade below their 2018 highs Tech rally has more conviction now compared to momentum-driven rushes in the past Sector looks less 'crowded' than in 2018 Source: WSJAs global growth decelerates, a rally in tech has attracted the attention of many market watchers. Booming profits in tech have attracted investors back to the sector which saw trillions in market value lost during a selloff in the final quarter of 2018.The fourth quarter nosedive slashes valuations and overcrowding in many of the major names in tech, making them more attractive. As prospects for the larger market become increasingly lackluster, 'if you can find companies that can grow a heck of a lot faster, they're looking attractive,' said Mr. Tierney. Stocks Trading Below 2018 Records Despite the recent rebound, many big tech companies are still trading below their record 2018 highs. For example, Facebook trades around 22 times its trailing 12 month earnings, compared to 34 times at the start of 2018, per FactSet. Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. trades at 32 times trailing earnings, compared to 55 times earnings at the start of last year. More Cautious Fed Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve's flip to a dovish stance has attracted back risk-oriented investors. The central bank has signaled a halt in further rate increases as it waits out for easing U.S. trade tensions and weighs a slowdown in the global economy, driven by factors like Brexit uncertainty and decelerating corporate earnings. Tech Surprises with Stellar Profits Meanwhile, big tech companies have reported strong, sometimes record, profits as S...arnings overall have cooled. Facebook posted its best-ever quarterly report, while Alibaba grew its sales and profits by 41% and 37% respectively. Recent Rally Has More Conviction, Less Crowded Tech bulls also argue that the recent rally appears to have more conviction behind it compared to investors' past rush into the sector as a momentum play. Instead of being pulled into the sector due to 'fear of missing out,' investors are now more spired by fundamentals like earnings growth.'It feels more healthy than the go-go momentum we saw in 2017 and 2018,' said Dave Donabedian, chief investment officer at CIBC Private Wealth Management. 'We're in a global slow patch, so the earnings growth that growth stocks bring to the table looks more precious.'The tech space also looks less \"crowded\" than the fourth quarter when too may big investors owned the shares, per WSJ. As a result, the sector is not as vulnerable to sharp reversals. Looking Ahead Positive drivers aside, not all market watchers are sold on tech. Firms including RBC Markets and Morgan Stanley have advised clients against going overweight on tech in 2019, citing headwinds such as regulatory risk, particularly in China, and the potential for weaker-than-expected growth. Nonetheless, it may be safe to say that as long as the techs continue to crush it on earnings, they are slated to outperform a slowing market.

Of course, some of the products that make headlines at CES are sneak peeks at real products, while others are more like concept cars that may never come to market. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But CES also gives us a bigger picture of how the tectonic plates are moving in the tech industry, and the new ways technology is going to improve, encroach on and transform our lives. Here are six of the dominant trends:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Services: The tech industry doubled-down on services in 2019. There are now services that will deliver food from restaurants, send you meal kits you can cook yourself, ship you new clothes to try, help you meditate, find you a ride, protect your security and privacy online and a lot more. Because services and subscriptions are a much more sustainable business model than physical products, look for them to pop up in almost every category in tech and in new ones we never knew we needed - and probably don't. And yes, this will make subscription fatigue a bigger issue than ever for consumers.</p><p>Ambient computing:This is a very jargon-y name for the idea that technology is blending into our lives in more subtle ways. Think of it like this. Two decades ago, the way we dealt with technology and the online world was by sitting down at a mouse, keyboard and monitor. A decade ago, the smartphone put most of it in our pockets. Now, it's moving beyond our computers and phones.</p><p>This is where voice assistants like Alexa, Siri and Google Assistant come in. It's also where new air gestures like the ones with the new Google's Nest Hub Max show up. And it's also where technology like UltraSense could turn all kinds of traditional surfaces into touchscreens. Ultimately, our homes, cars and offices will become smart in new ways, so that we're not glued to our devices so much. And wearable technology such as smartwatches and connected clothing will certainly have their say in this trend.</p><p>Health and wellness: The fastest-expanding category at CES in recent years has been health, fitness and wellness.  It features technology to help you eat better, sleep better, exercise more efficiently, monitor your health better and a ton of other new takes on health and wellness. There are bands that claim to track how many calories you take in (rather than logging your meals) and mini bikes to help kids stay fit while playing video games.</p><p>The bottom line is that after years of arguably making us less healthy by getting us addicted to more and more screens in our lives, these health and wellness products are trying to reverse the course of the past decade by using tech to fight tech.</p><p>Privacy and security: Plenty of tech analysts and pundits have been raising red flags for years about the ways tech companies have been running wild with user data and not doing enough to keep us secure on their platforms. Consumers mostly ignored them. But we seemed to have reached a tipping point where enough people are paying attention to privacy and security that companies such as Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, Twitter and others are jockeying with each other to show you how they're protecting your data, keeping you secure from hackers and integrating digital wellness features to give you peace of mind.</p><p>Yes, much of it is marketing and spin. But, there's been an impact on the way all tech vendors now market their products - because it's not only consumers who are taking notice. More and more governments, including the U.S., are expected to come after big tech in 2020 and put it under greater regulatory scrutiny. Tech companies want to look like they're starting to clean up their own act.</p><p>Streaming and cord cutting: CES has transformed over the past decade to include a lot more stuff - from cars to exercise machines to home products. Still, the heart of the show remains TVs. But what we watch on those TVs and the way we watch it has been revolutionized by Netflix, YouTube, Hulu, Disney Plus, Apple TV Plus and other streaming services - along with streaming boxes such as Roku, Amazon Fire TV and Apple TV.</p><p>5G scenarios: Most of the 5G announcements and excitement are being targeted for Mobile World Congress in Barcelona at the end of February, but 5G has elbowed its way into CES. </p><p>5G is all about lightning-fast speed, for your phone and beyond. This next-generation wireless technology promises to make downloads and uploads ultrafast, but it's also poised to open up new or better ways of doing everything from growing food to saving lives.</p><p>For now, 5G's benefits start with the phone. When it eventually replaces 4G, 5G data transfer will be between 10 and 100 times faster than today's networks. </p><p>* One promise of 5G: Downloading large files in seconds, like the entire season of \"Stranger Things 3\" to watch offline, and streaming high-def movies without a hiccup.</p><p>* 5G networks combine those blistering data speeds with almost zero lag connecting to the network. That could lead to video calls with pin-sharp resolution and minimal image buffering or freezing. </p><p>* Augmented reality games like Pokemon Go and Harry Potter: Wizard's Unite rely on your phone's data connection to create virtual elements in the world around you. A faster connection could make objects richer and more immersive, and expand well beyond games.</p><p>* The Galaxy S10 5G phone lets you zoom in on a live-streamed baseball game to see players up-close. You can also twist your fingers to rotate the players and watch them from every angle while they throw, catch and run.</p><p>* Translations, like those through Google Translate, take a lot of AI work, and, if you're translating on the fly, a lot of data. 5G holds the power to translate large amounts of text or speech quickly and flawlessly, even more so than with 4G today.</p><p>* 5G's faster data speeds can potentially help first responders save more lives. By relying on the powerful new networks to control its dispatch system, responders can cut down their response time, and send help faster.</p><p>* Self-driving cars already sound futuristic, but as they develop alongside 5G, they'll be able to use sensors to tap into the network and instantly communicate with other vehicles on the road, avoiding collisions by knowing where every car is.</p><p>* Data is at the heart of smart cities, which use vast quantities of it to help manage the city better. 5G is pegged to power the network infrastructure of smart cities in the 2020s, everything from the electrical grid to water supply. </p><p>* 5G could support health care in numerous ways, but remote surgery is the most exciting. A form of robotic surgery, the surgeon controls surgical robots in a facility miles away to conduct a procedure. Advanced imaging guides the surgeon. Supported by a 5G network, this type of surgery could help specialists attend to more patients in critical conditions throughout the world.</p><p>* A combination of sensors and drones could help farmers maintain ideal conditions for growing and raising food. For example, connected collars can help monitor an animal's real-time health. Drones can transmit photos from the field. Sensors can tell automated systems to adjust the water temperature and salt content of fish farms.</p><p>* Sensors are also the key ingredient in 5G-connected factory equipment that can automatically upload information about productivity, and alert workers if machines malfunction, making the operation more efficient.</p><p>What's undeniable is that 5G holds a lot of potential to improve everything around you. As wonderful as it sounds, 5G isn't a slam dunk yet - and challenges may well lie ahead as these networks develop.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HTCOUN-HC0107160623</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HTCOUR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XYM-WWD1-JBM5-R108-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">306885</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1277\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Hartford Courant Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Hartford Courant</publicationName><edition>1 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 12, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;
