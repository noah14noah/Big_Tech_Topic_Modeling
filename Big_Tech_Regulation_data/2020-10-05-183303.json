Stocks ended up surging Tuesday, with the S&amp;P 500 climbing 1.6 percent. But the index is on pace to record its worst month since it was in the thick of the financial crisis in February 2009.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             Uncertainty surrounding the competitive midterm elections on Tuesday\u00a0appears to be among the least of investors' worries. Trump probably has been closer to the mark\u00a0when he's\u00a0blamed the falling market\u00a0on rising interest rates (a development he has used to savage his handpicked Federal Reserve chairman). But market watchers point to a confluence of other factors, including fiscal stimulus that is wearing off, fears that companies are overvalued and a sense the economic expansion is running out of steam. The rising threat of a disruptive trade war with China is only exacerbating investors' jitters.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             Would a new division of power in Washington that hands Democrats some control on Capitol Hill further weaken stocks, as Trump predicts? History suggests an answer: No.\u00a0          </p><p>             Since 1950, the S&amp;P 500 has averaged its best annual returns - of 18.3 percent - when a Democratic president shared power with an all-GOP Congress. That's obviously not a possibility next year.</p><p>             But the current makeup in Washington, with Republicans in\u00a0control of both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, has marked the second-worst performance by the S&amp;P 500 since the 1950's, with average annual gains of 11 percent. The stock market has only fared worse under a Republican president facing an all-Democratic Congress; and it has done nearly twice as well when a Republican president confronted split control on the Hill, as this chart from LPL Financial illustrates:</p><p>A longer lens gives all-Republican control a more pronounced advantage, per this chart from Strategas\u00a0that reaches back to 1933:</p><p>             Regardless of the balance of power in Washington, though, the market tends to register its strongest performance of any point during a four-year presidential term in the quarters immediately following the midterms. This chart from LPL Financial, pulling in data back to 1896, shows that pattern:</p><p>And going back to the Truman administration, the S&amp;P 500 has averaged a 14.5 percent gain in the years following midterms -\u00a0and finished in positive territory in each of those 18 years:\u00a0</p><p>             It's far from clear there's a causal relationship between the balance of power in Washington and the market's performance. Courtney Rosenberger, a director of policy research at Strategas, points to the fact that midterms usually benefit the party out of power, yielding more gridlock. And gridlock, she said, can be a bullish force for the market because it allows investors to focus on fundamentals.\u00a0</p><p>But Brian Belski, chief investment strategist for BMO Capital Markets, sounded a skeptical note about that thinking in a research note last week. \"When examining key macro indicators and market performance during the first and last two years of presidential terms, gridlock does not necessarily coincide with strong results. In fact, annual S&amp;P 500 price returns during political gridlock in the last two years of presidential terms were nearly 50% less than returns during full party control,\" he wrote. \"In addition, GDP growth, rate of inflation, personal income, and unemployment were all worse off under gridlock compared to full party control.\"</p><p>             Looking ahead, Goldman Sachs's economic team doesn't see the midterms playing a major role shaping economic growth one way or the other.\u00a0\"Continued Republican control of the House and Senate would b slightly more growth-friendly in the near-term than divided government or Democratic control, we believe, as somewhat greater tax-based stimulus under a Republican Congress would more than offset slightly greater spending growth under a divided or Democratic Congress,\" the team wrote in a research note earlier this month. \"However, under any of the scenarios, the boost to growth from recent tax cuts and spending increases should fade by 2020.\"</p><p>Goldman economists predict the makeup of Congress won't have much influence over the direction of the administration's trade policy or deregulatory efforts,\u00a0and an infrastructure package faces long odds no matter what. But they point to one potential wrinkle if Democrats reclaim some Hill control: The next deadlines for funding the government and lifting the debt ceiling, arriving sometime next fall, could become more contentious. That would rattle markets, at a minimum.\u00a0</p><p>             In the meantime, Trump's Monday tweet suggests he wouldn't hesitate to pin blame for future stock market sell-offs on empowered congressional Democrats. Here, via Bloomberg, is a look back at Trump's tweets about stock market milestones:\u00a0</p><p>             - Tech stocks still\u00a0struggle.\u00a0Bloomberg News's\u00a0Luke Kawa:\u00a0\"Tech wreckage keeps piling up. The once high-flying stocks that propelled the S&amp;P 500 Index to records have been leading the way down amid signs of hedge fund flight.\u00a0Equity market fear has become more focused in technology stocks, according to options markets. . . .\u00a0'Unlike industrials or materials stocks, there isn't any clear 'valuation floor' for tech,' said Pravit Chintawongvanich, equity derivatives strategist at Wells Fargo. 'It's a function of how much you're willing to pay up for growth.' . . .\u00a0'We saw for over two years how the market bowed at the altar of Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Facebook,' said Dave Roberts, a Washington-based independent trader of volatility options and products. 'Breadth was weak, signs of deterioration showed up almost everywhere, yet it was all covered up by five stocks. Now, they're broken.'\"</p><p>             Zooming in on Amazon's skid.\u00a0Bloomberg News's Spencer Soper:\u00a0\"Fears of a prolonged market downturn, slowing international sales, stepped-up competition in the U.S. and flat-out confusion about how Amazon.com Inc. makes money are all reasons behind the company's dizzying 25 percent drop in value from its September high. . . .\u00a0Amazon last week forecast revenue of as much as $72.5 billion in the current quarter, falling short of analysts' average estimate of $73.8 billion. The outlook and third-quarter results, which showed slowing sales growth in all major revenue categories including international and cloud computing, prompted investors to question whether the company is reaching a saturation point.\u00a0The reasons for worry continued this week. The U.K. proposed a first of its kind digital services tax, spreading fear that governments could increasingly turn to big tech platforms for revenue.\"\u00a0(Amazon.com founder and chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>             - Businesses hike\u00a0prices.The Wall Street Journal's\u00a0Austen Hufford and Annie Gasparro:\u00a0\"U.S. companies are raising prices on everything from plane tickets to paint, passing on higher costs for fuel, metal and food to their customers after years of low inflation. Coca-Cola Co. and Arconic Inc. on Tuesday said they raised prices in the third quarter. Top airlines, manufacturers and food makers have also announced price hikes over the past week.</p><p>\"The higher prices have effectively ended a long period of low inflation that led the Federal Reserve to keep short-term interest rates near zero for years. ...\u00a0Sensing that consumers are getting used to higher prices, some companies are also charging more to improve profits... At some point, higher prices could dampen the economy's recent strength. Investors are concerned that higher inflation could prompt the Fed to raise interest rates more quickly to prevent the economy from overheating.\"</p><p>             As consumer confidence rises.\u00a0Reuters's Lucia Mutikani:\u00a0\"U.S. consumer confidence rose to an 18-year high in October, driven largely by a robust labor market, bolstering expectations that strong economic growth would continue through early 2019.\u00a0But a weakening housing market and tightening financial market conditions are casting a shadow on the economic expansion that is in its ninth year, the second longest on record. Home price gains slowed further in August, other data showed, another sign that higher mortgage rates were weighing on housing demand.\"</p><p>             TRADE FLY-AROUND:          </p><p>             - China could weaponize its currency.\u00a0The New York Times's\u00a0Keith Bradsher:\u00a0\"As the United States and China swap threats and mete out increasingly punishing tariffs, the world is watching to see whether Beijing turns to one of its most potent economic weapons. It involves the number 7 . . .\u00a0There is nothing particularly threatening about the number 7 itself. The renminbi at 7.002 to the dollar is pretty similar to the currency at 6.998 to the dollar. But passing that number would be significant symbolically. It would suggest China is prepared to let its currency weaken further still. That would give China's factory owners an advantage when they sell their goods in the United States . . .\u00a0</p><p> \"A weaker currency can also help Chinese exporters beat [Trump's] tariffs. Right now, the United States imposes tariffs of about 10 percent on a wide variety of Chinese goods that arrive at an American port. If the renminbi has fallen 10 percent, the tariff is basically nullified.\"</p><p>             U.S. charges Chinese spies.The Post's Ellen Nakashima: \"The Justice Department on Tuesday\u00a0unsealed charges\u00a0against 10 Chinese spies, hackers and others accused of conspiring to steal sensitive commercial airline and other secrets from U.S. and European companies. The indictment marks the third time since September that the United States has brought charges against Chinese intelligence officers and their recruits for stealing American intellectual property...\u00a0The alleged conspiracy ran for at least five years beginning in 2010, and focused on the theft of technology underlying a turbofan engine used in U.S. and European commercial jets, officials said.\"</p><p>             Chinese factory growth slumps.Reuters: \"China's manufacturing sector in October expanded at its weakest pace in over two years, hurt by slowing domestic and external demand, in a sign of deepening cracks in the economy from an intensifying trade war with the United States...\u00a0The latest reading suggests a further loss of momentum in the world's second-biggest economy, and the deteriorating environment for businesses could prompt more policy support from Beijing on top of a raft of recent initiatives.\"</p><p>             MELTDOWN WATCH:          </p><p>- Dimon: Skipping Saudi conference achieved nothing. Bloomberg: \"Jamie Dimon was among the first banking executives to drop out of this month's investment conference in Saudi Arabia, but he doesn't think it made a difference. The moves from business leaders to shun the event accomplished 'nothing'\u00a0and were largely symbolic, Dimon, the chief executive officer of\u00a0JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., said Tuesday at an event hosted by Axios in Los Angeles.\u00a0 'We couldn't be seen to be in any way condoning that behavior,'\u00a0Dimon said. Still, business relationships with the nation will continue, he said. Dimon said his bank, which has been in the country for more than 70 years, will follow the lead of the U.S. government when making decisions about how to interact with Saudi Arabia after the alleged murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist and prominent government critic.\"</p><p>             - Hedge funds test clients.\u00a0WSJ's Juliet Chung:\u00a0\"Some of the rare hedge funds earning their keep are about to make it harder on investors. Israel Englander's $35.9 billion Millennium Management and Kenneth Griffin's $31 billion Citadel LLC are rolling out changes that could result in investors facing a longer path to get their money out of a fund or having to pay higher fees. Millennium has told investors that early next year they will get back their profits.</p><p> \"To reinvest that cash with Millennium, the clients will need to sign up for a new share class whose terms mean it would take five years to get all their money back - compared with a year now.\u00a0Citadel is tweaking how the firm charges investors in several of its hedge funds. The changes are nuanced, but can result in scenarios where investors pay more. These two firms are among the exclusive group of hedge funds that have posted a steady stream of profits even as the industry continues an extended drought.\"</p><p>             - Auto sales hit a skid.Bloomberg: \"U.S. auto sales may slip into negative territory for the year, as plunging demand for passenger cars and costlier loans wipe out a stronger-than-expected start to 2018...\u00a0A market that was cruising in the first half of the year on strong demand for sport utility vehicles including\u00a0FiatChrysler's Jeep Cherokee has succumbed to\u00a0interest-rate hikes, making it more expensive for consumers to finance new-car purchases.\"</p><p>             As used cars stage a comeback.\u00a0Bloomberg News's Craig Trudell:\u00a0\"AutoNation Inc. said Tuesday that it's investing $50 million in Vroom Inc., an online buyer and seller of used cars that offers no-haggle pricing and home delivery. AutoNation disclosed the deal along with the news of its steepest drop in quarterly new-vehicle sales in nine years, which sent shares sliding. 'You have a consumer that's basically had free money for eight years,' Mike Jackson, AutoNation's CEO, said in a phone interview. 'There's a cost related to financing that they have to adjust to.'\"</p><p>- Struggling areas won't figure in midterms. NYT's Jim Tankersley and Ben Casselman: \"The competitive districts that will decide control of the House are richer and more economically vibrant than the country as a whole. But there is little evidence that the thriving economies in those districts are buoying Republican candidates enough to guarantee victories against well-funded Democratic challengers. The concentration of battlegrounds in prosperous areas could have important policy implications for the next Congress, with swing-district representatives more concerned with preserving their region's own good fortunes than with helping large parts of the country that continue to lag economically.\"</p><p>- Trump slams Cordray, Warren.\u00a0By way of endorsing Ohio gubernatorial candidate Mike DeWine, the president fit two criticims\u00a0of the founding forces behind the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u00a0into one tweet this morning:\u00a0</p><p>             - Luetkemeyer poised to rise on Financial Services.Reuters's Pete Schroeder and Michelle Price: \"Next week's U.S. elections could see Wall Street's favorite congressman assume one of the most coveted roles setting financial policy on Capitol Hill - if Republicans retain control of the House of Representatives...Republican Blaine Luetkemeyer, a key banking industry ally, is the front-runner to lead the panel.</p><p>\"A congressman since 2009 but relatively unknown at a national level, Luetkemeyer has emerged as a favorite of bankers who have found him responsive to complaints that overzealous regulation is hurting the economy. Commercial banks have donated more than $300,000 to Luetkemeyer's re-election campaign this year, making him the top recipient of bank cash in Congress, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics.\"</p><p>- Land O'Lakes, Purina drop support for Steve King.\u00a0 Bloomberg's Deena Shanker and Lydia Mulvany: \"Dairy giant Land O'Lakes\u00a0announced on Tuesday\u00a0that it will no longer make financial contributions to Representative Steve King of Iowa after a gun-fueled massacre at a Pittsburgh synagogue brought new attention to the Republican's incendiary comments about race and association with white nationalism. Purina PetCare made a\u00a0similar announcement\u00a0Tuesday afternoon. The murder of 11 people, many elderly, in the mass shooting this weekend resulted in the arrest of a man who allegedly made anti-Semitic and anti-immigrant rants online. King has been at the forefront of a right-wing push to\u00a0end birthright citizenship, a policy [Trump] said in an interview with Axios he would seek to enact, despite protections\u00a0under the U.S. Constitution.\"</p><p>- DOJ, SEC probe GE. The Post's Taylor Telford: \"Embattled industrial giant General Electric said Tuesday that federal regulators are looking into its accounting practices regarding a $22 billion write-down from the company's power business. The disclosure came the same day the company released its third-quarter earnings report under new chief executive Larry Culp, formerly of Danaher Corp.</p><p> \"The $22 billion charge highlights the failings of GE's investments in its power unit. When the charge was announced Oct. 1, along with the news of Culp's appointment, the company said it would miss earnings expectations for 2018. During a conference call with investors Tuesday, Chief Financial Officer Jamie S. Miller said that the charge, tied to acquisitions in GE's power businesses, had prompted the Securities and Exchange Commission to expand its investigation. The Justice Department is also looking into the charges.\"</p><p>             Today          </p><p>             Coming soon          </p><p>- A New Yorker cartoon by Jason Chatfield:</p><p>Whitey Bulger: Murderer, robber, racketeer.</p><p>\"I can't turn back\": Migrant children trek through southern Mexico.</p><p>Late-night reactions to Trump's interview on birthright citizenship:</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-2bd97d95659d4de1be854cfd9e542f0a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TM8-SY91-DXKP-J18T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2912\"/><timeReceived>12:10 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 31, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>CC000858D</classCode><className>LPL FINANCIAL CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>SIC6289 SERVICES ALLIED WITH THE EXCHANGE OF SECURITIES OR COMMODITIES, NEC</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Securities Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkFFMTQ3ODhCRDYyNDkyN0IwQkEyQzRCRDlFMEM5ODc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Administration &amp;

Griffiths          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">President Trump blasted income inequality for growing out of control during the pandemic, pointing to a report noting billionaires have seen their wealth boom as up to 30 million Americans collect unemployment. \"Changes must be made, and soon!\" Trump tweeted Saturday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But his response to the economic crisis has dealt a major blow to his image as a populist billionaire fighting for workers where Democratic elites had not - a sentiment that helped carry Trump to victory in 2016.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Consider the optics: Just hours before Trump's tweet, his top emissaries were on Capitol Hill pushing against a full and lengthy extension of $600 in enhanced federal benefits to jobless Americans that expired last week. And on Sunday - as the talks dragged on, with millions of people in limbo - Trump made the 284th visit of his presidency to one of his own golf courses.</p><p>Now polls indicate voters now think Trump is the one who has lost touch. Just 37 percent in a recent Quinnipiac University survey say he cares about average Americans, while 61 percent say he doesn't. That represents a low for him on the matter -and a sharp drop from the 51 percent of Americans who gave him favorable marks on the question in late November 2016. Voters give former vice president Joe Biden a markedly better score, with 59 percent telling Quinnipiac in its most recent survey he cares about average Americans while a third of them say he does not.</p><p>The president's most outspoken priorities for the next round of emergency economic relief, meanwhile, haven't centered on the jobless Americans closest to the brink. Instead, he continues to push for a payroll tax cut that even those in his own party have rejected as providing help to the wrong people - those who already have jobs - while doing little to encourage hiring. And his team has insisted on providing $1.75 billion for a new FBI headquarters in downtown Washington, an initiative with no discernible relevance to the economic crisis. The president's push has drawn criticism from Democrats that Trump is moving to stifle competition for the Trump International Hotel, a block away.</p><p>Trump himself has only known life on the rarefied end of the income divide, a fact underscored by the latest financial disclosures from his business empire: The Trump Organization reported $446 million in revenue in 2019, up about 2 percent from the previous year, according to disclosures the White House released on Friday. \"The documents do not give details about 2020,when Trump's company has been slammed by the coronavirus pandemic,\" David Fahrenthold and Joshua Partlow note. \"Some Trump properties were closed for weeks at a time, and others saw their occupancy rates nosedive, as the broader travel industry declined.\"</p><p>Eric Trump, the president's second son and an executive at the company, put a bullish spin on the report: \"Our businesses thrived with strong revenues while remaining underleveraged and maintaining very low levels of debt,\" his statement said.</p><p>Trump's golf courses proved a strength, with several reporting double-digit revenue gains, per the New York Times.</p><p>Trump has received some heat for the amount of time he has managed to spend golfing, especially in light of the criticism he heaped on then-President Barack Obama for the same activity. But the visual carries the potential to do more damage to Trump amid public health and economic crises, conveying a sense Trump is taking his leisure while the country suffers. From Atlanta Journal-Constitution cartoonist Mike Luckovich last month:</p><p>Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, meanwhile, earned at least $36.2 million while they served in the White House last year, according to disclosures the president's daughter and her husband filed Friday. The average American household pulled in about $63,000 last year - or roughly what Ivanka and Jared earned in 15 hours from their outside companies and investments.</p><p>Trump's daughter took heat last month for urging out-of-work Americans to \"find something new,\" as part of a White House effort to promote skills-based jobs that don't require a college degree. It landed with a thud. Critics noted the multimillionaire daughter of a billionaire for whom she now works in the White House is not the most credible messenger to the millions seeking work amid an economic collapse, when job seekers outnumber open positions by more than three-to-one.</p><p>Mnuchin argued on Sunday the $600 federal payments to the unemployed are too generous. Republicans are proposing instead to cut the payment to $200 or use a formula that would peg it to two-thirds of their wages before they lost their jobs. \"In some cases, people are overpaid, and we want to make sure there are the right incentives,\" he said on ABC's \"This Week.\"</p><p>\"But some preliminary studies on the issue have not found the temporary bump is a disincentive for a noticeable number of workers,\" Erica Werner and Eli Rosenberg report. \"A recentstudy by three Yale economistsfound workers receiving the extra benefits returned to work at roughly the same rate as others, finding 'no evidence that more generous benefits disincentivized work.'\"</p><p>The extra payments have helped people meet basic needs, including making rent and mortgage payments. But the benefit expired last week, along with a moratorium on evictions from federally-backed housing, putting more than 12 million renters at risk of losing their homes.</p><p>Mnuchin, the Goldman Sachs veteran now helping lead the administration's response to this crisis, found opportunity to profit in the last one. He led a group of investors that put up $1.6 billion to buy the failed IndyMac Bank from the FDIC in 2009 as the great financial crisis hit full tilt. They completed a $3.4 billion merger with CIT Group in 2015, and Mnuchin walked away with a $10.9 million severance, on top of what he earned from stock options and a multimillion-dollar salary running the bank.</p><p>Mnuchin contended in his Senate confirmation hearings that his group stepped in to salvage a failed institution no others would touch. \"OneWest inherited some178,000 foreclosuresalready in the pipeline,\" Politico reported. \"As house prices fell and job losses mounted, more home seizures were inevitable.\" Mnuchin emphasized the bank under his leadership made more than 100,000 modification offers to borrowers.</p><p>But the bank also foreclosed on some 36,000 homes, by one estimate, and its federal regulator detailed cases of bank employees falsely claiming to review individual foreclosure filings. In 2011, the Treasury Department that Mnuchin would later lead forced his bank into an agreement to monitor the conduct of its employees.</p><p>The divergence between stocks and the economy continues to worry some investors: But \"most money managers are wary of cutting equity exposure too drastically in a market that has rallied more than 40 percent since late March and stands near all-time highs despite widespread economic devastation and a global pandemic,\" Reuters's April Joyner reports.</p><p>\"That disconnect is pushing some investors to beef up cash positions or tilt their portfolios toward Europe, where economic prospects appear to be brighter than in the United States.\"</p><p>Fed's Kashkari calls for economy to shut down for another four to six weeks. Per Reuters: \"The U.S. economy could benefit if the nation were to \"lock down really hard\" for four to six weeks, a top Federal Reserve official said on Sunday, adding that Congress can well afford large sums for coronavirus relief efforts. The economy, which in the second quarter suffered its biggest blow since the Great Depression, would be able to mount a robust recovery, but only if the virus were brought under control, Neel Kashkari, president of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank, told CBS's 'Face the Nation.'\"</p><p>The news offers some hope about the recovery: \"More than halfway through second-quarter earnings, 82.1 percent of companies reporting have surpassed profit expectations, which would be the highest in the history of Refinitiv IBES data going back to 1994,\" Reuters's Caroline Valetkevitch reports.</p><p>\"What's more, the size of the beats is well above what is typical. S&amp;P 500 companies have beaten earnings expectations by a whopping 21.7 percent, also set to be the highest on record since 1994, based on Refinitiv's data as of Friday. The latest big boost to numbers came late last week, when results from Facebook and trillion-dollar market value companies Apple, Amazon.com and Google parent Alphabet surpassed forecasts.\"</p><p>There is one big caveat: \"In many cases, estimates had been lowered so much ahead of earnings season that they were easier to beat, strategists said. Still, the results bolster the case for investors betting that the impact of coronavirus-led lockdowns and layoffs on companies' bottom lines may not be quite as dire as previously believed.\"</p><p>Fed weighs abandoning preemptive rate moves to curb inflation: \"Instead, Fed officials would take a more relaxed view by allowing for periods in which inflation would run slightly above the central bank's 2 percent target, to make up for past episodes in which inflation ran below the target,\" the WSJ's Nick Timiraos reports.</p><p>\"Fed Chairman Jerome Powell hinted at the shift at a news conference last week when he said the central bank would soon conclude a comprehensive review of its policy-making strategy that began last year ... Even before the severe shock from the pandemic, the Fed had grown concerned about spells of low inflation that have bedeviled authorities in Japan over the past two decades and in Europe for the past decade.\"</p><p>Bitcoin is gaining again: \"After trading flat for months, bitcoin rose as high as $11,868 on Saturday from around $9,100 in early July, extending its gain for 2020 to 65 percent,\" the WSJ's Paul Vigna reports.</p><p>\"While volatility is nothing new for bitcoin, the latest run came abruptly. Since surging on a wild boom in 2017, bitcoin and its cryptocurrency peers have been largely flying under the radar. Meanwhile, companies including Facebook Inc. and central banks have got most of the attention as they build their own digital currencies.\"</p><p>Birx says nation is in \"new phase\" of pandemic: \"I want to be very clear: What we're seeing today is different from March and April,\" Deborah Birx, the physician overseeing the White House coronavirus response told CNN's \"State of the Union,\" noting that cases were increasing in rural and urban areas. \"It is extraordinarily widespread.\"</p><p>Experts caution against putting too much hope on a vaccine: \"The confident depiction by politicians and companies that a vaccine is imminent and inevitable may give people unrealistic beliefs about how soon the world can return to normal - and even spark resistance to simple strategies that can tamp down transmission and save lives in the short term,\" Carolyn Y. Johnson reports.</p><p>New states to watch: \"Alaska, Hawaii, Missouri, Montana and Oklahoma are among the states witnessing the largest surge of infections over the past week, according to a Washington Post analysis of health data. Experts also see worrisome trends emerging in major East Coast and Midwest cities, and anticipate major outbreaks in college towns as classes resume this month,\" Antonia Noori Farzan reports.</p><p>MLB continues to face struggles: \"Major League Baseball's hopes of salvaging its 2020 season amid a pandemic took another ominous turn Saturday, when the St. Louis Cardinals received word of additional positive tests for the novel coronavirus, requiring the postponement of the entire Cardinals-Brewers weekend series in Milwaukee and deepening the level of pessimism around the sport that the season can go on,\" Dave Sheinin reports.</p><p>HSBC profit slumps: \"Profit for the global bank with Asian roots fell96 percent to $192 million in the three months ended June.TheLondon-based lender set aside $3.83 billion in provisions for losses fromloans during the quarter, almost seven times more than in the same period last year. HSBC set aside $3 billion of provisions in the first quarter,\" the Wall Street Journal's Simon Clark reports.</p><p>Lord and Taylor files for bankruptcy: \"The country's oldest department store chain, filed for bankruptcy protection joining about a dozen iconic retailers that have succumbed to Chapter 11 protection during the pandemic,\" Abha Bhattarai reports.</p><p>Retail rents plummet across New York City: \"America's glitziest and most expensive retail districts are losing tenants, and rents are in a free fall. The pressures ... will likely have a lasting impact on shopping streets such as Michigan Avenue - better-known as the 'Magnificent Mile' - in Chicago, the Las Vegas Strip, and Rodeo Drive in Los Angeles, to name a few,\" CNBC's Lauren Thomas reports.</p><p>Around the world:</p><p>Numerous countries hit grim milestones: \"South Africa surpassed 500,000 confirmed cases on Saturday, meaning that the country now accounts for more than half the infections reported in Africa to date, and has the fifth-highest number of cases worldwide ... Several Latin American nations are also seeing alarming upticks in both fatalities and new cases. The region's cumulative death toll topped 200,000 on Saturday night, according to Reuters, with many of the new fatalities coming from Brazil, Mexico and Peru,\" Antonia Farzan reports.</p><p>Melbourne implements curfew: \"Under the new regulations, residents can only leave their homes to shop food and other essential supplies, and to exercise for up to an hour a day. Both activities must take place within roughly three miles of their homes. Under the new regulations, residents can only leave their homes to shop food and other essential supplies, and to exercise for up to an hour a day. Both activities must take place within roughly three miles of their homes,\" Antonia Farzan reports.</p><p>Dozens of crew members test positive after cruises resume in Norway: \"In June, Norwegian operator Hurtigruten became the first cruise line to set sail in the midst of a pandemic. Now, roughly two months later, at least 36 crew members aboard one ship have tested positive for covid-19, and all further cruises have been put on hold,\" Antonia Farzan reports.</p><p>The company's CEO spoke to Trump: \"Microsoft said in a blog post that chief executive Satya Nadella and Trump had spoken and that the company is committed to addressing Trump's concerns about the social media platform. Trump previously indicated he was not in favor of a deal and said that he planned to ban TikTok in the United States,\" Rachel Lerman reports.</p><p>\"If it goes through, the acquisition could dramatically shift the Big Tech landscape, adding a legacy giant into the scramble for social media users' attention. Microsoft, currently valued at $1.55 trillion, is the third-most valuable company in the world and is one of the only ones positioned to take on such a purchase. Microsoft was conspicuously absent from a landmark antitrust hearing on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, when Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon chief executives testified on their companies' power.\"</p><p>But time may be of the essence: \"He only agreed to allow Microsoft to negotiate a deal if it could secure a deal in 45 days ...,\" Reuters's Yingzhi Yang and Brenda Goh report of Trump's view.</p><p>A number of Republican lawmakers are backing the sale: But \"Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), who chairs the Commerce Committee, [cautioned] that \"tight security measures need to be part of any deal in order to protect consumer data and ensure no foreign access,\" Reuters's David Shepardson reports.</p><p>\"Mnuchin said he and U.S. congressional leaders 'all agree there has to be a change.' He added that Trump could \"either force a sale or the president can block the app using (International Emergency Economic Powers Ac).\"</p><p>The probe will focus on a 2013 transaction with a Kushner-owned company. \"In June 2013, the banker, Rosemary Vrablic, and two of her Deutsche Bank colleagues purchased a Park Avenue apartment for about $1.5 million from a company called Bergel 715 Associates, according to New York property records,\" the NYT's Jesse Drucker and David Enrich report.</p><p>\"Mr. Kushner, a senior adviser to the president, disclosed in an annual personal financial report late Friday that he and his wife, Ivanka Trump, had received $1 million to $5 million last year from Bergel 715. A person familiar with Mr. Kushner's finances, who wasn't authorized to speak publicly, said he held an ownership stake in the entity at the time of the transaction with Ms. Vrablic... Typically banks restrict employees from doing personal business with clients because of the potential for conflicts between the employees' interests and those of the bank.\"</p><p>Today:</p><p>The Institute for Supply Management releases the manufacturing index for July</p><p>Clorox, AIG, Lowes, Tyson Foods, Texas Roadhouse and Cooper Tire &amp;

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), polling well ahead of her rivals on the stage, started the bidding by pushing back on a question about whether her economic plans are too bold \"at a time when 71 percent of Americans say the economy is doing well.\"\u00a0</p><p>Warren said the economy is \"doing great for a thinner and thinner slice at the top,\" drug companies, private prison companies, and oil giants. \"When you've got a government, when you've got an economy that does great for those with money and isn't doing great\u00a0for\u00a0everyone else, that is corruption, pure and simple,\" she said. \"We need to call it out. We need to attack it head on. And we need to make structural change in our government, in our economy, and in our country.\"</p><p>The answer was squarely on brand for Warren. But then Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), who has staked out more moderate ground in her campaign, dodged an invitation to repeat criticisms she's made previously of sweeping plans offered by Warren and other liberals (maybe, ahem, because she read Wednesday's Ticker\u00a0about the risks of attacking last night's frontrunner). \"I do get concerned about paying for college for rich kids,\" she said of a proposal to entirely eliminate student debt. And she summed up with another shot at the ultra-wealthy. \"If billionaires can pay off their yachts, students should be able to pay off their student loans.\"          </p><p>             Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) similarly ducked an opportunity to draw a distinction with Warren. Asked why he disagrees with Warren's call to break up big tech companies like Facebook, Amazon and Google - as he has said, policymakers shouldn't \"be running around pointing at companies and breaking them up without any kind of process\" - Booker said he doesn't in fact disagree with his colleague from Massachusetts.\u00a0</p><p>\"I think we have a serious problem in our country with corporate consolidation,\" he said. \"I see every single day that this economy is not working for average Americans. The indicators that are being used, from GDP to Wall Street's rankings, is not helping people in my community.\"          </p><p>Booker name-checked Halliburton and Amazon as companies \"that pay nothing in taxes\" and said that needs to change. (Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos also owns The Post.) And he said he would beef up antitrust enforcement by appointing judges who would make it a priority and ensure his Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission focus on it, too.\u00a0</p><p>             On taxes, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke declined to say whether he would support a top marginal rate of 70 percent for those making more than $10 million a year - a proposal championed by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.). But he blasted \"a system that favors those who can pay for access and outcomes. That's how you explain an economy that is rigged to corporations and to the very wealthiest.\"\u00a0</p><p>He said he favors taxing capital gains at the same rate as ordinary income and would raise the corporate tax rate to 28 percent. That would hike it from its current rate of 21 percent to the level President Obama proposed in 2012 when the rate was 35 percent.</p><p>Chiming in from the far left edge of the stage, and angling to claim the far left mantle in the debate, New York City Mayor Bill DeBlasio endorsed all of the most liberal policy prescriptions that had been invoked. \"Yes, we're supposed to be for a 70 percent tax rate on the wealthy,\" he said. \"Yes, we're supposed to be for free college, free public college, for our young people. We are supposed to break up big corporations when they're not serving our democracy.\" He called the questions central to a \"battle for the heart and soul of our party.\"\u00a0</p><p>             Later on, DeBlasio had a ready replacement for the immigrants that Trump won office in part by demonizing to economically dislocated voters. \"For all the American citizens out there who fear you're falling behind, the immigrants didn't do that to you,\" he said. \"The corporations did that to you, the 1 percent did that to you.\"          </p><p>             TRADE FLY-AROUND:\u00a0          </p><p>- Xi to present terms for ending trade war. WSJ's Lingling Wei and Bob Davis: \"Chinese President Xi Jinping plans to present [Trump] with a set of terms the U.S. should meet before Beijing is ready to settle a market-rattling trade confrontation, raising questions of whether the two leaders will agree to relaunch talks.</p><p> \"Among the preconditions, said Chinese officials with knowledge of the plan, Beijing is insisting that the U.S. remove its ban on the sale of U.S. technology to Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei Technologies Co. Beijing also wants the U.S. to lift all punitive tariffs and drop efforts to get China to buy even more U.S. exports than Beijing said it would when the two leaders last met in December.</p><p> \"The U.S. chief trade negotiator, Robert Lighthizer, and his Chinese counterpart, Liu He, talked by telephone this week on ways to get the talks back on track and expect to meet in person in advance of\u00a0the presidents' Saturday lunch meeting\u00a0after a Group of 20 summit in Osaka, said people familiar with the discussions. It is far from clear what the two will manage-and whether their bosses will approve their work.\"</p><p>             As\u00a0Trump threatens China with new tariffs: \"[Trump] on Wednesday played down the importance of securing a trade deal with China as he prepared to meet with [Xi]\u00a0saying he was ready to proceed with additional tariffs if negotiations between the countries failed to get back on track,\" the New York Times' Ana Swanson and Adam Satariano report.</p><p>\"Mr. Trump said it was 'possible'\u00a0that a deal could ultimately be reached and that China was eager for an agreement. But he said he was prepared to impose tariffs on another $300 billion worth of Chinese products, on top of the 25 percent tax already in place on $250 billion of Chinese imports. Mr. Trump also indicated he might limit the next round of tariffs to just 10 percent.\"</p><p>(Trump also lashed out at India, Germany, and Japan - all allies - as he made his way to Osaka, the NYT's Peter Baker notes. He called new Indian tariffs on American goods \"unacceptable.\")</p><p>             Another bearish sign for the summit: Peter Navarro is going. The Post's Damian Palletta writes his inclusion raises \"the possibility that the White House doesn't plan to cut a quick deal.\"</p><p>-\u00a0How companies are dodging U.S. tariffs on China: \"Billions of dollars worth of China-made goods subject to tariffs by the Trump administration in its trade fight with Beijing are dodging the China levies by entering the U.S. via other countries in Asia, especially Vietnam, according to trade data and overseas officials,\" the WSJ's Chuin-Wei Yap reports.</p><p>\"The Trump administration has for more than a year sought to weed out the practice known as transshipment, in which Chinese exports typically are minimally processed or altered during a brief stop in a third port and then re-exported as a product originating from the third port. Such circumvention threatens to crimp U.S. plans as it prepares to add tariffs on to $300 billion of Chinese exports, from toys to electronics, essentially covering all its China trade.\"</p><p>             New tariffs would damage ports: \"Along with dealing a fresh blow to China's economy, the tariffs would mean unexpected cost increases for vital port modernization projects around the United States, damaging local economies and imperiling U.S. hopes of keeping pace with foreign rivals,\" my colleague David J. Lynch reports.</p><p>\"At least one dozen ports in places such as Baltimore, New Orleans, Seattle and Fort Lauderdale, Fla., which together have ordered more than 20 of these cranes, also face multimillion-dollar tariff bills if the president proceeds. Officials from those ports testified before officials of the U.S. Trade Representative's office (USTR) in hearings that ended Tuesday, in hopes of getting the cranes exempted.\"</p><p>- Huawei employees worked on military projects. Bloomberg: \"Several\u00a0Huawei Technologies Co.\u00a0employees have collaborated on research projects with Chinese armed forces personnel, indicating closer ties to the country's military than previously acknowledged by the smartphone and networking powerhouse.</p><p> \"Over the past decade, Huawei workers have teamed with members of various organs of the People's Liberation Army on at least 10 research endeavors spanning artificial intelligence to radio communications. They include a joint effort with the investigative branch of the Central Military Commission -- the armed forces' supreme body -- to extract and classify emotions in online video comments, and an\u00a0initiative\u00a0with the elite\u00a0National University of Defense Technology\u00a0to explore ways of collecting and analyzing satellite images and geographical coordinates.\"</p><p>-\u00a0Dem lawmaker says Canada and Mexico might be open to tweaking USCMA: \"Canada and Mexico may be open to a limited renegotiation of aspects of the United States-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement to satisfy U.S. lawmakers' concerns, a top U.S. Democrat said on Wednesday, opening the door to its passage in the fall,' Reuters' Jonas Ekblom reports.</p><p>'There are alternatives, including strategically opening [the agreement] on specific items,' said Earl Blumenauer, the Oregon Democrat who chairs the trade subcommittee of the House of Representatives Ways &amp; Means Committee. He said that the trade agreement could be modified to address specific concerns, but was skeptical about using so-called side agreements, which he said had proven problematic in the current trade agreement among the three nations.\"</p><p>-\u00a0Trump continues to attack Powell: \"A day after the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome H. Powell, asserted his independence from the White House, [Trump] responded by suggesting that nobody had heard of Mr. Powell until Mr. Trump tapped him to run the Fed and implying that the head of Europe's central bank was making better decisions,\" the Times' Jeanna Smialek reports.</p><p>\"Mr. Trump also voiced jealousy over Europe's monetary policy. Last week, he criticized Mario Draghi, the head of the European Central Bank, for saying the bank was prepared to prop up Europe's economy unless it improves. Mr. Trump said Mr. Draghi was trying to push down the value of the euro to give Europe an unfair advantage.\"</p><p>             Trump's Wednesday assault on Powell: \"Here's a guy, nobody ever heard of him before, and now I made him and he wants to show how tough he is? O.K. Let him show how tough he is. He's not doing a good job.\"</p><p>-\u00a0Bank of America to stop lending to private prisons: \"Bank of America Corp., the second-biggest U.S. bank, will stop lending to companies that run private prisons and detention centers,\" Bloomberg's Lananh Nguyen reports.</p><p>\"The move followed a review by the bank's environmental, social and governance, or ESG, committee, which included site visits and consultation with clients, civil rights leaders, criminal justice experts and academics. The Charlotte, North Carolina-based lender also met with its internal Hispanic and black leaders. The company will stop its activities in the industry as soon as it can, while meeting contractual obligations, said Finucane, who leads Bank of America's ESG efforts.\"</p><p>             -- Wayfair is supplying beds to Texas detention centers for children - and its employees are protesting: \"Employees at online furniture giant Wayfair are organizing a walkout to protest the retailer's sale of $200,000 worth of beds and other furniture to a Texas detention center for migrant children,\" my colleague Abha Bhattarai reports.</p><p>\"The walkout, planned for Wednesday at 1:30 p.m. near the company's Boston headquarters, comes after Wayfair executives said they would fulfill an order for beds and other items for\u00a0a detention center in Carrizo Springs, Tex., according to two Wayfair employees who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The order was placed by BCFS, a government contractor that manages the facility.\"</p><p>-\u00a0Boeing's struggles loom large: \"New orders for long-lasting U.S.-made goods fell for a second straight month in May as troubles at Boeing weighed on demand for aircraft, suggesting manufacturing could remain weak even as business spending on equipment appears to stabilize,\" Reuters' Lucia Mutikani reports.</p><p>\"The report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday added to a raft of weak data on trade, consumer confidence, housing and employment growth that have indicated a sharp loss of momentum in economic activity in the second quarter. The economy, which will celebrate a record 10 years of expansion next month, is losing speed amid an ebb in both business and consumer confidence in the wake of an escalation in trade tensions between the United States and China.\"\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>-\u00a0Tesla has a secret lab to build its own battery cells: \"Tesla\u00a0is developing the means to manufacture its own battery cells, according to five current and recent employees, something that the electric vehicle maker has relied on\u00a0Panasonic\u00a0to do since the companies signed an extensive\u00a0partnership deal\u00a0in 2014,\" CNBC's Lora Kolodny reports.</p><p>The move could help Tesla offer cheaper, higher-performance electric vehicles than it does today, without having to pay or share data and resources with outside vendors or partners. The battery pack and battery cells are the main cost component in an electric vehicle, according to research by\u00a0IHS Markit.</p><p>-\u00a0Waters backs down after Ex-Im debate: \"House Financial Services Chairwoman Maxine Waters on Wednesday shelved a bipartisan Export-Import Bank bill that sparked a fierce backlash from her own caucus, in the first big blow to her leadership of the powerful committee,\" Politico's Zachary Warmbrodt reports.\u00a0</p><p>\"Just before the panel was scheduled to take up the bill this afternoon, the California Democrat informed her members that she would not move ahead with a vote this week on the legislation she negotiated with Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) to reauthorize and revamp the bank, which provides loan guarantees to foreign buyers of U.S. goods.\"</p><p>- Harris, Porter bill would strengthen state oversight of banks. The Daily Beast's Gideon Resnick: \"Sen. Kamala Harris\u00a0(D-CA) and freshman\u00a0Rep. Katie Porter\u00a0(D-CA) are teaming up on legislation to hold banks and Wall Street executives accountable. The bill, the Accountability for Wall Street Executives Act, would allow for state attorneys general and state law enforcement to conduct oversight of national banks regarding compliance with state law, including\u00a0giving them the ability to issue subpoenas to examine bank records and interview bank executives.\u00a0The goal of the legislation is to deter the conditions that, experts say, led to the subprime mortgage crisis in the late aughts. And none of the major banks would seem to be immune.\"</p><p>-\u00a0SCOTUS rules in favor of federal agencies expertise on ambiguous regulations: \"The Supreme Court on Wednesday weakened but upheld a long-standing precedent that says judges should generally defer to a federal agency's expertise when ambiguous regulations are challenged,' my colleagues Robert Barnes and Ann E. Marimow report.</p><p>\"The court's most conservative members, who have said the deference gives too much power to unelected bureaucrats in the 'administrative state,'' were not satisfied. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. joined the court's liberals to preserve the precedent. But he, too, said the vote should not be seen as a signal that deference to agency expertise is settled.\u00a0</p><p>Judging strictly by Google searches, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) and Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) had the best nights Wednesday at the first Democratic presidential debate.

But in a sign the agreement has more to do with rebranding than substance, economists project the deal will provide a minimal macroeconomic boost.\u00a0          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Studies by both the International Monetary Fund and the International Trade Commission conclude the revamped pact won't meaningfully goose economic growth: The ITC projects it will raise GDP by 0.35 percent after six years; and the IMF says its broad effects will be \"negligible.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             Indeed, economists say the agreement may be most important for what it prevents. Trump had threatened to pull the United States out of NAFTA if the three countries couldn't reach a deal. That would have spelled a disastrous breakdown in cross-border commerce with the two most important U.S. trading partners. \"At a time when slower global growth, rising protectionism, lingering policy uncertainty and a strong dollar are constraining activity, the deal prevents a negative impact worth 0.5% of GDP from a dissolution of Nafta,\" Oxford Economics chief U.S. economist Gregory Daco writes in a note to clients.</p><p>             Investors largely             shrugged off             the announcement of the deal, with the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&amp;P 500 actually shedding 0.1 percent on the day.          </p><p>The updated pact - officially the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) - along with a Phase 1 agreement with China to ease trade tensions with that country \"will provide only limited overall gains for the economy, according to independent studies, economists and executives,\" my colleague David Lynch writes. \"In particular, there is little chance that large numbers of outsourced factory jobs will return to the United States, as the president promised.\"</p><p>             The United States shed nearly 6 million manufacturing jobs after NAFTA took effect in 1994 and China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, but the tweaked USMCA deal stands to replace only 50,000 of them, Lynch notes, citing the ITC study.</p><p>The assessments stand in stark contrast to the Trump administration's messaging on the deal. White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham called it \"the biggest and best trade agreement in the history of the world.\" U.S. Trade Representative Robert E. Lighthizer likewise hailed it as \"the best trade agreement in history.\"</p><p>The administration has some rare backup from congressional Democratic leaders, though they are apportioning the credit differently. \"There is no question that this trade agreement is much better than NAFTA. It is infinitely better than what was initially proposed by the administration,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said. \"We're declaring victory for the American worker.\"</p><p>And business groups from those representing steel to semiconductors praised the agreement and urged its swift ratification.</p><p>             But not all industries fared equally. Tech, for example,             emerged             as a winner, per the Wall Street Journal's Natalie Andrews, William Mauldin and Anthony Harrup: \"The final deal still included liability protections for online content, language backed by technology firms that Pelosi\u00a0sought to strip out of the bill. Mrs. Pelosi said she realized the tech protections were in the deal after she had already set the negotiating parameters. 'I was too late going into it,' Mrs. Pelosi said. 'I lost.'\"</p><p>             Drugmakers, meanwhile, got shafted, per my colleague Heather Long: \"Last year's USMCA deal gave a certain type drug known as 'biologics' 10 years of exclusivity on the market. Democrats say this is now gone, a blow to drug companies that wanted more years to be able to charge higher prices. A factsheet Democrats provided also says that pharma companies won't get three additional years of patent protection when they submit paperwork about a new use of a drug.\"</p><p>             And the auto industry will face rules mandating higher worker pay and the use of a larger share of North American components. That will mean higher costs, and, as Heather writes, it could also crimp selection, \"especially on small cars that used to be produced in Mexico but may not be able to be brought across the border duty-free anymore.\"</p><p>You are reading              The Finance 202          , our must-read tipsheet on where Wall Street meets Washington.</p><p>- Fed expected to hold steady. WSJ's Nick Timiraos: \"Federal Reserve officials are likely to hold their benchmark interest rate steady after their two-day meeting concludes Wednesday and aren't expected to make\u00a0notable\u00a0changes to their wait-and-see posture on more rate reductions. The Fed cut interest rates by a quarter-percentage point at its past three meetings, most recently in late October to a range between 1.5% and 1.75%. This week's meeting is shaping up as a comparatively uneventful end to a year that has been 'far from dull,' as Fed Chairman Jerome Powell dryly observed in a speech last month...</p><p> \"Mr. Powell has said the economic outlook would need to weaken materially for the Fed to consider lowering rates further. His press conference is the most likely venue for any cues about whether this has changed, but recent data-including soft manufacturing activity but strong hiring-offer little reason for him to recast this message.\"</p><p>- Tech stocks enjoy banner year, in the face of serious threats. NYT's Matt Phillips: \"This year, the S&amp;P 500 tech sector is up more than 40 percent, handily outpacing the 25 percent gain for the benchmark index over all, which is itself the third-best annual return of the past two decades. Apple stock is up 70 percent, and it set a high-water mark last week. Google's parent company, Alphabet, is up 28.5 percent, and set its own record on Monday. Microsoft shares have soared 49 percent in 2019, and Amazon is up 16 percent.</p><p> \"And Facebook - whose chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, has spent much of the past two years telling lawmakers why his company can be trusted on issues as varied as personal data and cryptocurrency - is up 53 percent. Tech has surged in part thanks to the tide of rate cuts unleashed by the Federal Reserve, which has lifted all boats. The gains also reflect the relief investors are feeling that the trade war's worst outcomes haven't come to pass.\"</p><p>- Gundlach: Recession risk recedes. Bloomberg News: \"Jeffrey Gundlach said the odds of a recession have fallen and warned investors to steer clear of corporate debt because of rising risks of a weak dollar. There's a 35% chance of a recession by the end of next year, the bond manager said Tuesday. In September, he predicted 75%... While the bull market shows no signs of abating, investors and analysts have been watching closely for any weakness in the economy. Gundlach's forecast is in step with economists who see the recession odds at 33%.\"</p><p>             TRADE FLY-AROUND:          </p><p>             -\u00a0U.S. and China planning for tariff delay: \"U.S. and Chinese trade negotiators are laying the groundwork for a delay of a fresh round of tariffs set to kick in on Dec. 15, according to officials on both sides, as they continue to haggle over how to get Beijing to commit to massive purchases of U.S. farm products President Trump is insisting on for a near-term deal,\" the Wall Street Journal's Lingling Wei and Bob Davis\u00a0report.</p><p>\"In recent days, officials in both Beijing and Washington have signaled that Sunday is not the final date for reaching a so-called phase-one deal - even though that is the date President Trump has set for tariffs to increase on $165 billion of Chinese goods. That date could be extended, as has happened several times when the two sides thought they were on the verge of a deal. Those prior deals, though, never held and tariffs continued to mount.\"</p><p>- Kudlow: No decision yet on Brazil, Argentina tariffs. Bloomberg News's Saleha Mohsin and Rachel Gamarski: \"Trump's top economic adviser said Tuesday the administration hasn't made a decision about re-imposing steel tariffs on Brazil and Argentina, even though the president said last week the duties were 'effective immediately.' Reinstating such tariffs has been discussed but there's no decision yet, Larry Kudlow, the director of the White House's National Economic Council, said at the Wall Street Journal's CEO Council in Washington.</p><p> \"The Brazilian government has yet to be notified by the U.S. about the intention to impose more duties on the country's steel, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. Brazil plans to wait until it has official communication from the U.S. to make any decisions, the person said.\"</p><p>             -\u00a0Barr says antitrust tech probes will be completed in 2020: \"Attorney General William Barr said on Tuesday that he hoped to have Justice Department investigations of the big tech platforms - Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc's Google, Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc - completed next year,\" Reuters's Diane Bartz\u00a0reports.</p><p>\"The four tech companies have been lightning rods for regulator probes this year. In addition to the Justice investigations, the Federal Trade Commission, state attorneys general and Congress are looking at one or more of the companies. Barr said that the Justice Department review was not limited to antitrust, but that looking for anti-competitive behavior was 'front and center.' \" (Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post)</p><p>             -\u00a0Exxon cleared in climate-change accounting case: \"A New York state judge cleared Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM of fraud claims, saying New York's attorney general had failed to establish that the oil giant had deceived investors about how it accounted for the cost of future climate-change regulation,\" the WSJ's Corinne Ramey\u00a0reports.</p><p>\"The verdict Tuesday capped a nearly three-week civil trial between the state and Exxon, which had spent several years fighting the case. The company is battling similar accusations in other state and federal courts. In his 55-page ruling, New York State Supreme Court Justice Barry Ostrager said the attorney general's office didn't prove that the company had violated the Martin Act, a broad antifraud statute commonly used to pursue financial crime, or other similar laws.\"</p><p>             -\u00a0Chevron makes more than $10 billion write-down: \"Chevron Corp. is writing down the value of its assets by more than $10 billion, a concession that in an age of oil and gas overabundance, some will not be profitable anytime soon,\" the WSJ's Christopher M. Matthews and Rebecca Elliott\u00a0report.</p><p>\"In the largest write-down by an energy producer in years, Chevron said Tuesday that it was cutting the value of a number of properties, notably its U.S. shale holdings in Appalachia, by a combined $10 billion to $11 billion. Chevron is also restructuring its operations to focus on fewer prospects in the face of persistently low natural gas prices, and will explore sales of some assets.\"</p><p>             -\u00a0Boeing's struggles continue: \"Boeing Co. delivered less than half as many planes in the first 11 months of 2019 as in the same period a year earlier, the planemaker said ... as it continued to struggle with the grounding of its best-selling 737 MAX jets,\" Sanjana Shivdas and Eric Johnson\u00a0report.</p><p>\"Deliveries totaled 345 aircraft in the 11 months ended November, compared to 704 last year and were also less than half the number delivered by European rival Airbus in the same period. Customers typically pay over the bulk of the money for a new jetliner on delivery, making it a crucial metric for the world's big two jetliner producers.\"</p><p>- Bloomberg pledges $10 million to boost House Democrats.The Post's Michael Scherer: \"Presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg will donate $10 million Thursday to defend vulnerable Democratic House members against paid Republican attacks on their support for impeachment proceedings against President Trump. The money, which is meant to even an arms race on the 2020 congressional battlefield, was cheered by [Pelosi], who has been fielding concerns from some of her members over a costly Republican advertising offensive as the House moves toward an impeachment vote next week.\"</p><p>Bloomberg remains widely unpopular with voters.The Post's Scott Clement and Emily Guskin: \"Electability is a central pillar of former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg's newly launched presidential campaign, but a poll released Tuesday finds he is deeply unpopular with voters nationwide.</p><p> \"A Monmouth University poll found about twice as many registered voters rated Bloomberg negatively as positively - 54 percent unfavorable, 26 percent favorable. That margin was significantly worse than for five other Democratic candidates, as well as for President Trump. That same measure hampered Hillary Clinton's campaign in 2016. A separate Quinnipiac University poll released Tuesday found that despite Bloomberg's negative personal ratings, he led Trump by six percentage points in a head-to-head matchup, 48 percent to 42 percent.\"</p><p>             -\u00a0Buttigieg releases names of McKinsey clients: \"Presidential contender Pete Buttigieg released the names of his private and government clients during his stint as a consultant at McKinsey &amp; Company, following weeks of demands from his critics for greater transparency about his fundraising and his past employment,\" my colleagues Chelsea Janes and Amy B Wang report.\u00a0</p><p> \"The list includes Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, the Canadian supermarket Loblaws, Best Buy, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Energy, the U.S. Postal Service and the Department of Defense. According to the campaign, Buttigieg's work for Blue Cross Blue Shield 'looked at overhead expenditures such as rent, utilities, and company travel. The project he was assigned to did not involve policies, premiums, or benefits.'\"</p><p>             -\u00a0Investors fear Pelosi's drug plan will hurt small biotech firms: \"Private equity investors are lobbying against [Pelosi's] sweeping drug pricing bill, telling her legislative aides in a series of private meetings in recent weeks that the plan would dry up financing for small biotech companies,\" CNBC's Berkeley Lovelace Jr.\u00a0reports.</p><p>\"A group of venture capitalists, including Peter Kolchinsky of RA Capital Management, Johannes Fruehauf of BioInnovation Capital and Sara Nayeem of New Enterprise Associates, met with Pelosi's staff as well as moderate House and Senate Democrats on Oct. 29 to discuss their concerns. The investors have had follow-up meetings since, according to John Stanford, executive director of venture capital advocacy group Incubate.\"</p><p>             -\u00a0Senators threaten to regulate encryption: Lawmakers \"threatened to pass litigation that would force technology companies to provide court-ordered access to encrypted devices and messages unless the businesses can come up with a solution,\" CNBC's Lauren Feiner\u00a0reports.</p><p>\"The company representatives were joined by Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance and Matt Tait, a cybersecurity fellow at the University of Texas at Austin, to discuss encryption and lawful access.

Tory Newmyer has you covered.                       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             Businesses come in first under the tax plan that House Republicans debuted Thursday. Yet some of them have formed the point of the spear already aimed against it.          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The mixed reviews from the crowd that stands to reap some of the greatest rewards from the GOP's first draft of a tax overhaul reflects in part the complexity of a plan that cuts jaggedly across the existing code.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             It also flashes a red warning signal for Republicans as they try to compress the bulk of work on a once-in-a-generation project into what amounts to a legislative month.\u00a0          </p><p>             The plan's top-line benefits for business interests are plain. After flirting as late as Wednesday with a proposal that offered only a temporary cut to the corporate rate, Republicans instead rolled out a plan that dramatically and permanently chops that rate from 35 percent to 20 percent, while skewing more than two-thirds of its benefits to businesses both large and small. That amounts to about\u00a0$1 trillion of the $1.5 trillion in cuts the package hands out, according to a preliminary analysis by the Joint Committee on Taxation released Thursday by the House Ways and Means Committee.\u00a0</p><p>But a motley though potent array of industry groups has aligned against the package (see the bill text here), and its ranks could swell in the days ahead. Before the plan was even unveiled, the National Association of Home Builders and the National Association of Realtors signaled their opposition, pointing to new limits on deductions for mortgage interest and state and local taxes.\u00a0</p><p>On Thursday, they were joined by the National Federation of Independent Business - the small-business lobby, a political powerhouse whose approval Republicans typically crave. The group said the plan doesn't do enough to relieve its members' burden, since it limits a reduced rate for small businesses that pay through the individual side to only 30 percent of their income.</p><p>The BUILD Coalition -\u00a0a collective of financial services firms, private equity investors, real estate developers and farmers - came out against the bill for scaling back the write-off for interest on business debt. And the National Farmers Union, a group that rivals the NFIB's apple-pie credentials, said it will oppose the package for what it called shifting the tax burden from \"top earners to the backs of American family farmers, ranchers and the middle class.\"</p><p>Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Tex.) vowed the tax cuts in the plan would be \"transformational:\"</p><p>             Other industry groups released placeholder statements, praising the release of the plan but indicating room for improvement. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, for one, noted that \"a lot of work remains to be done.\" Meanwhile, tax departments in corporate headquarters across the country spent Thursday sifting through the 400 pages of bill text to try to assess what the proposal would mean for their bottom lines.\u00a0</p><p>Big tech companies - blue-state stalwarts unloved by Republicans in general and facing new heat from Democrats over their role in the 2016 election - are on especially high alert, industry lobbyists tell me. The proposal forces home their stash of overseas profits at a at a 12 percent rate, two points higher than they anticipated. And it subjects their\u00a0future earnings to a new minimum tax - changes that could add up to higher tax bills for some tech giants than the ones they pay now.\u00a0(Rep. Ro Khanna, a\u00a0Democrat whose Silicon Valley district includes the corporate headquarters for Apple, Intel, Yahoo and eBay, tells me that he's \"perfectly confident that the tech companies in my district are going to do great.\" But an industry lobbyist lamented that the sector finds itself seemingly friendless on the Hill all of a sudden.)</p><p>             Wall Street,\u00a0that other money center in a liberal bastion, got what CapAlpha's Charles Gabriel described as \"generally benign\" treatment in the bill. That maybe shouldn't come as a shock, considering two of the Big Six negotiators who spent months behind closed doors developing a framework for the plan - namely Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and top White House economic advisor Gary Cohn - just left financial services jobs last year to join the policymaking arena, both for the first time.</p><p>             Yet the industry, like tech, offers a juicy target for Republicans desperate for revenue and loathe to look for it in their own backyards. (Wonkblog has this analysis of how the bill's proposed elimination of deductions would hit blue states hardest.)</p><p>House Speaker Paul D. Ryan unveils the GOP tax plan:</p><p>             Big banks pay high effective rates, so the corporate\u00a0cut would mean a windfall. \"The five biggest diversified U.S. banks alone might have had tax savings of $11.5 billion in 2016 at that rate, the biggest sum for any sub-industry group tracked by S&amp;P,\" WSJ's\u00a0Rachel Louise Ensign and\u00a0Telis Demos write.</p><p>             The bill also favors financiers by what it leaves out. The package doesn't revive a bank tax included in the last comprehensive Republican tax package, from then-Rep. Dave Camp in 2014, though it would stop big banks from expensing assessments they pay to the FDIC; it abandoned a cap on tax-free contributions to retirement plans, to the relief of asset managers; and it dropped a Trump campaign promise to hike the capital gains rate for carried interest earned by private equity investors and others.\u00a0</p><p>             Further, an idea that Rep. Tom Reed (R-N.Y.) has been developing to impose a new tax on derivatives didn't make it into the bill - and it won't be added later. \"We were ready to go, but there are so many ripple effects in this world,\" Reed, a Ways and Means member, tells me. \"This is going to be a longer-term effort, once tax reform is done, to normalize a lot of what we were discussing, getting support from all the stakeholders and educating people off the committee.\"\u00a0</p><p>             Much is still subject to change. But those businesses that find themselves on the losing side of the bill's math face a challenge. Tax writers used up all the deficit-spending leash\u00a0the budget unspooled, so convincing lawmakers to write back in a preferencs\u00a0means forcing them to pay for it elsewhere. The zero-sum battle will be joined as quickly as vested interests determine what side they're on.\u00a0</p><p>(Read my colleague Steven Mufson's\u00a0rundown on how a host of other industries look primed to fare, including manufacturers, oil and gas companies, and the renewable energy sector -\u00a0and this broader look from Heather Long at the bill's winners and losers, from the super-rich to the working poor.)</p><p>Watch President Trump say\u00a0the GOP tax plan will make the U.S. \"competitive again\":</p><p>Watch this video explainer of the tax plan released yesterday:</p><p>             FED WATCH:          </p><p>             - Powell's Rose Garden nod. FT's\u00a0Sam Fleming and\u00a0Demetri Sevastopulo:\u00a0\"Jay Powell was named by President Donald Trump as his nominee to serve as the next chair of the Federal Reserve, as he moved to make his mark on the world's most powerful central bank...\u00a0The 64-year-old Mr. Powell has been a serving Fed governor since 2012. A centrist on monetary policy, he is known as a pragmatic and down-to-earth official with private sector and government experience. A trained lawyer and former partner at private equity firm Carlyle, he also served in the Treasury under former president George H W Bush in the 1990s.\u00a0Underlining the sense of stability he is expected to bring to the role, Mr. Powell said he would continue to work with colleagues 'to ensure that the Federal Reserve remains vigilant and prepared to respond to changes in markets and evolving risks'.\"</p><p>             - \"A safe gamble.\" \u00a0WSJ's Greg Ip: \"Trump's selection of Federal Reserve governor Jerome Powell to succeed Janet Yellen as chairman of the central bank is something of a gamble. Unemployment is at a 16-year low, economic growth is picking up, the stock market is setting records, and yet he's changing leaders at the institution most responsible for all of that.</p><p>As gambles go, it looks like a safe one. Of all the candidates Mr. Trump considered after deciding not to keep on Ms. Yellen, Mr. Powell's temperament and views come closest to hers. He believes the Fed should use all available tools-bond buying, interest rates and verbal guidance-to get unemployment down and keep inflation at its target of 2%. He backs the regulatory framework put in place under President Barack Obama, albeit with less strict implementation.\u00a0Mr. Powell's job will be turning those beliefs into effective policy.\"          </p><p>Who is Powell?

The fortunes of different candidates rose, fell and rose again as Mr. Trump brought them in for interviews and peppered friends and advisers with questions about whom to tap. At times he seemed torn. After the White House spent months winnowing the field to five finalists, aides worried that Mr. Trump might scrap the whole lot and nominate someone else entirely. 'He's always got somebody else in his head and he's polling everyone around him for more names,'\u00a0a person familiar with the search said last week...</p><p>             The decision also underscored the influence of...\u00a0Mnuchin, who helped lead the search. Mr. Mnuchin was the biggest 'cheerleader'\u00a0for Mr. Powell, one White House official said...\u00a0As recently as mid-October, the president was still privately raising concerns about Mr. Cohn's Charlottesville comments, according to a White House official. In a private meeting at the White House, the president questioned whether Mr. Cohn was \"up to the job\" of Fed chairman, the official said.\"</p><p>             TAX DAY FLY-AROUND:          </p><p>- House GOP unified, for now. Politico's Brian Faler: \"But, as expected, it didn't take long for various interest groups that feel stung by the measure to make their views known, and that will likely make the lawmakers' unity fleeting.\u00a0Even before the legislation was formally unveiled, one of the most powerful groups in conservative circles, Americans for Prosperity, warned that plans to slap a tax on imports from U.S. companies that move jobs abroad 'has the potential to derail much-needed reform.'\"</p><p>- Schumer calls it a stinker: \"In the old days you could give a crumb to the middle class and give most of the tax breaks to the wealthy, and people would say, 'Okay,' \" Schumer said in an interview with Washington Post reporters hours after House Republicans released a draft tax bill. \"But with income distribution, sourness and populism where they are, that's not working, so I think this bill has real trouble...\u00a0The more people find out about it, the less they'll like. This bill is like a dead fish. The more it's in sunlight, the more it stinks, and that's what's going to happen.\"</p><p>- Blankfein: Now's not the time for tax cuts. The Goldman Sachs chief executive tells Bloomberg that he \"can't say this is the moment where you want the most fiscal stimulus in the market, when we're mostly at full employment, when GDP last registered at 3 percent. I don't know that this is the moment that you provide the biggest stimulus.\" Instead, he advocates\u00a0encouraging growth through deregulation. (Blankfein can make the case to Trump himself: He's set to join the president on his trip to Asia as part of a business delegation.Here's a roster of who else is going.)\u00a0</p><p>             And economists are divided.The New York Times's Patricia Cohen: \"Economists are still parsing the details, but even some ardent supporters of the plan say expectations about heady growth and job gains are exaggerated. Interest rates are already at bargain-basement levels, plenty of potential investment capital is sloshing around, and the official jobless rate is at lows not seen in many years. Moreover, the cost of the tax package will inevitably deepen the deficit and lead to spending cuts that are likely to hit low- and middle-income workers.\"</p><p>- The hidden 46 percent\u00a0bracket.\u00a0Politico's Danny Vinik: \"House Republicans claim the tax plan they introduced Thursday keeps the top individual rate unchanged at 39.6 percent-the level at which it's been capped for much of the past quarter-century. But a little-noticed provision effectively creates a new band in which income is taxed at over 45 percent. Thanks to a quirky proposed surcharge, Americans who earn more than $1 million in taxable income would trigger an extra 6 percent tax on the next $200,000 they earn-a complicated change that effectively creates a new, unannounced tax bracket of 45.6 percent. It hasn't been advertised by Republicans, who have described their plan as maintaining the current top tax rate of 39.6 percent. And it goes against decades of GOP orthodoxy that raising taxes on the rich discourages work and reduces economic growth.\"</p><p>- Estate tax gone, after 6 years.CNBC: \"Under the new proposal, coined the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the estate tax exemption will double and then be repealed as of 2024. In addition, there would continue to be a \"step-up in basis,\" which means if you inherit shares of stock, for example, and turn around and sell those shares, you wouldn't pay any capital gains taxes either.\u00a0Because of the sky-high threshold, only the wealthiest Americans now pay the federal levy. The Tax Policy Center estimated there were about 11,310 estate returns filed and about half of those were taxable for 2017. Still, the amount of tax collected on those returns was just under $20 billion, the Tax Policy Center said.\"</p><p>- Housing market shakeup?The New York Times's\u00a0Conor Dougherty: \"The Republican tax plan unveiled on Thursday takes aim at the most sacred of cows: the provision that subsidizes homeownership by allowing the deduction of interest on mortgage debt... If\u00a0the idea holds - and history suggests that will be difficult - it will echo loudly through higher-priced cities on the coasts. 'The impact on the market is going to be recognizable,'\u00a0said Ure R. Kretowicz, chief executive of Cornerstone Communities, a homebuilder in San Diego. 'There's going to be less incentive to build, and less incentive to buy.'\u00a0For the builders, it will also squeeze the high end of the market, where the biggest profits lie. The stocks of homebuilders fell sharply on Thursday: Lennar was down 3.3 percent, KB Home dropped 3 percent and Toll Brothers plummeted 6.1 percent.\"</p><p>Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) is already raising deficit concerns:</p><p>- H&amp;R Block hates postcards. This is the kind of selloff Republicans can cheer. CNBC's Thomas Franck: \"The new tax bill unveiled by House Republicans Thursday is so simple that taxpayers will be able to file using a postcard, according to GOP lawmakers...\u00a0As both Brady and House Speaker Paul Ryan delivered the news, shares of tax-planning firm H&amp;R Block fell about 2.7 percent Thursday.\"</p><p>             - Changes coming. The \"chairman's mark,\" with changes to the bill, is expected out today, before a mark up on Monday.</p><p>- Ivanka stiffed. Politico's Nancy Cook: \"Ivanka Trump doesn't always get what she wants. The House Republican tax plan unveiled on Thursday includes one of Trump's pet issues - the child tax credit - but expands it less generously than the White House senior adviser and first daughter had hoped.\u00a0Recently, Trump has been lobbying lawmakers on expanding the credit, hosting both Republicans and Democrats for private dinners at her Kalorama home and visiting a handful of Republicans on Capitol Hill.\"</p><p>Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) counts himself an ally in her push:\u00a0</p><p>- Odds and ends. The bill knocks out a bunch of smaller deductions, some more politically consequential than others. It eliminates the write-off for medical expenses, for example - a proposal that's already raising alarm among some taxpayers, if my inbox Thursday was any indication. Alimony payments would no longer be tax deductible. And the package scotches a tax break for electric cars. More, from the New York Times, here.\u00a0</p><p>And here's another example, via Axios:</p><p>- Corey's new side hustle. \"An issue advocacy group aligned with Donald Trump plans to spend about $1 million on ads promoting the Republican tax proposal and will feature the president's first campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, as its pitchman,\" Bloomberg's John McCormick reports. \"The television and online campaign is the biggest yet financed by the White House-sanctioned America First Policies political organization. The spending is an initial down payment on what the group says will be a multi-million dollar effort it hopes will help the president and Republicans score their first major legislative win.\"</p><p>From Politico's Gabriel Debenedetti:</p><p>-- Here's a great interactive from The Post that tackles your major unanswered questions about the Republican tax plan. Here are just a few of the common questions you may have, answered:</p><p>             How big is the tax cut in this bill?\u00a0          </p><p>             How are individual tax rates changing?          </p><p>             Will I have issues with my 401(k)?          </p><p>What we know about Russia's cyber tactics:</p><p>RUSSIA WATCH:\u00a0          </p><p>- Sessions faces new questions.\u00a0The Post's\u00a0Karoun Demirjian, Sari Horwitz and Adam Entous: \"Senate Democrats have demanded that Attorney General Jeff Sessions explain why he did not disclose a March 2016 gathering with then-candidate Donald Trump and members of his campaign team at which an adviser offered to set up a meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin. Sessions's participation in the gathering was detailed in court documents released Monday by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. The adviser who offered to set up the meeting was George Papadopoulos, who has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, according to the documents. Sessions had not previously disclosed the meeting, despite being asked over multiple appearances on Capitol Hill whether he or anyone on the campaign ever discussed meeting with Russians.\"</p><p>- Manafort, Gates under house arrest. USA Today: \"Lawyers defending President Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort mounted their first counterattack against federal money laundering and conspiracy charges on Thursday, insisting that federal prosecutors had \"embellished\" the strength of their case.\u00a0</p><p>Manafort and another former Trump aide, Rick Gates, have been under house arrest since Monday, when special counsel Robert Mueller unsealed a 12-count indictment tied to their work on behalf of a pro-Russian faction in Ukraine. The charges that both served as unregistered agents of a foreign government then laundered their profits into the United States are part of Mueller's wide-ranging investigation into Russian efforts to influence the 2016 election.\"</p><p>- Poll: Half think Trump committed a crime.\u00a0The Post's\u00a0Emily Guskin and Matt Zapotosky: \"More than twice as many Americans approve as disapprove of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's investigation of possible coordination between Donald Trump's 2016 campaign and the Russian government, a new Washington Post-ABC News poll finds, indicating that the conservative effort to discredit the probe has fallen flat as the case has progressed toward its first public charges. A 58 percent majority say they approve of Mueller's handling of the investigation, while 28 percent say they disapprove, the Post-ABC poll finds. People's views depend in large part on their political leanings, but overall, Americans are generally inclined to trust Mueller and the case he has made so far. Meanwhile, fewer than 4 in 10 Americans say they believe Trump is cooperating with Mueller's investigation, while about half believe he is not.\"</p><p>- NAFTA chaos.WSJ's William Maudlin: \"In recent weeks, as the Trump administration's efforts to renegotiate Nafta have grown contentious, concerns of a withdrawal have clouded the outlook for a range of businesses, including Midwest farms, Detroit auto makers, vegetable importers and more. These businesses are increasingly being warned of potential risks on all sides of the borders. On a conference call with investors last week, Alberto Chretin, chief executive of real estate investment trust Terrafina, a commercial landlord with interests in Mexico, said it is discussing contingency plans with its manufacturer tenants in case they face new tariffs after a potential collapse of Nafta.\"</p><p>             POST PROGRAMMING ALERT:\u00a0The\u00a0Post and Live Nation will bring the \"Can He Do That?\" podcast to a live audience at\u00a0the\u00a0Warner Theatre on Tuesday, Nov. 7.\u00a0In this live taping, political reporters Bob Woodward, David Fahrenthold and Karen Tumulty will join host Allison Michaels to review the past year in President Trump's White House and the biggest moments that made people wonder\u00a0\"Can He Do That?\"\u00a0Tickets can be purchased now at\u00a0Live Nation.\u00a0Attendees will also receive a free 30-day digital subscription to The Washington Post.\u00a0</p><p>             Today          </p><p>             Coming Up          </p><p>From The Post's Tom Toles: \"Trump is hardly working on his Asian trip:\"</p><p>President Trump called it \"shocking\" that The Post's Fact Checker gave four Pinocchios to Senate Democrats' claim the\u00a0tax plan would raise taxes for most middle-income families:</p><p>President Trump jokes that his mother would have never thought he'd be president:</p><p>Paul Manafort's 'lavish lifestyle,' by the numbers:</p><p>Seth Meyers takes a closer look at the GOP tax plan and Trump's comments after the recent attack in New York:</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-5a79d7e2cfb147c6a5a4cf58b8e1c082</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PW3-BG81-DXKP-J0N0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3722\"/><timeReceived>12:21 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"11\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>November 3, 2017 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Real Property Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUUyRTcxRURBNEY2NEE2MDk3QzBCNzRDOEY0NTZDQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Real Estate Investment Trusts</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0VBOTBEMUNGMjA5NEMxN0JBRTE1M0MxQzM4QzE1Nzc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDA0QjAwN0E3NDgwNDhBRjgxMDIzRUFDQkNERDc0ODQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>STX001688</classCode><className>TAXES &amp;

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) for her soak-the-rich tax plan. The 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful is relishing it.\u00a0          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             Warren's\u00a0campaign sent out a fundraising appeal yesterday featuring headlines about Wall Streeters' laments, telling prospective donors the stories have \"something in common:\u00a0The wealthy and well-connected are scared. Scared that under a Warren Administration, they would finally have to pay their fair share.\" And the email said the ultrarich are \"right to be scared.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The solicitation was the clearest signal yet that the Warren camp views her Wall Street critics as a useful foil for a bid framed around confronting runaway inequality and an entrenched political class. And they serve as\u00a0bogeymen as the candidate takes heat from within her own party about the sweep and price tag of her $20.5 trillion plan to overhaul the U.S. health care system - a proposal that's drawn criticism from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) in addition to her more moderate rivals in the field. (Former vice president Joe Biden is accusing Warren\u00a0of being an \"elitist\" who is\u00a0\"condescending to the millions of Democrats who have a different view.\")</p><p>             Warren's wealth tax \"is extremely popular, so I don't think they needed this, but it's a huge bonus,\" one source close to the campaign tells me. \"I don't actually think they anticipated people would be going on CNBC and crying. But they love it. These are the bad guys, and people out in the rest of the country think they're the bad guys. They're the only ones who think they're the good guys. They tell themselves that, and CNBC tells them that, but nobody else thinks so.\"</p><p>             The cohort of financiers going public with their sky-falling claims about Warren's economic program continues to grow. Just this week:\u00a0</p><p>             Others are predicting\u00a0the stock market will tank if she wins. (Comedy Central's \"The Daily Show\"\u00a0just dedicated a segment to Warren's fight with the Wall Street.)\u00a0Warren has highlighted the criticisms on Twitter. It's a tactic she's used for months, with supporters jokingly referring to the attacks as in-kind contributions to her campaign. But the drumbeat of criticism has grown louder as her star has risen in the Democratic primary and the industry more seriously grapples with the potential consequences of a Warren win. Some, however, think the increasingly aggressive language aimed at Warren by two of her primary rivals -- Biden and Pete Buttigieg -- has a gendered quality to it.          </p><p>             And the candidate recently raised the stakes. The wealth tax proposal she rolled out in January would impose a 2 percent levy\u00a0on households worth more than $50 million and a 3 percent tax on those worth more than $1 billion. To pay for her\u00a0Medicare-for-all plan, she just doubled to 6 percent the tax\u00a0she would impose on net worths greater than nine figures.\u00a0</p><p>Microsoft founder Bill Gates is\u00a0the latest to criticize the proposal. The second-richest person in the world - behind Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who also owns the Washington Post - tells the New York Times's Andrew Ross Sorkin he's paid \"over $10 billion in taxes. I've paid more than anyone in taxes. If I had to have paid $20 billion, it's fine. But when you say I should pay $100 billion, then I'm starting to do a little math about what I have left over.\"</p><p>             The outspoken Trump critic\u00a0wouldn't say whom he'd vote for in a matchup between Warren and the president. And asked if he would meet with Warren to discuss the his concerns, Gates questioned her open-mindedness, adding he's not sure \"she'd even be willing to sit down with somebody who has large amounts of money.\" That also drew a response from Warren on Twitter:</p><p>You are reading              The Finance 202          , our must-read tipsheet on where Wall Street meets Washington.</p><p>             TRADE FLY-AROUND:\u00a0          </p><p>             - BREAKING OVERNIGHT. China says both sides agree to roll back tariffs in deal. Bloomberg: \"China and the U.S. have agreed to roll back tariffs on each other's goods in phases as they work toward a deal between the two sides, a Ministry of Commerce spokesman said. 'In the past two weeks, top negotiators had serious, constructive discussions and agreed to remove the additional tariffs in phases as progress is made on the agreement,'\u00a0spokesman Gao Feng said Thursday.</p><p> \"'If China, U.S. reach a phase-one deal, both sides should roll back existing additional tariffs in the same proportion simultaneously based on the content of the agreement, which is an important condition for reaching the agreement,'\u00a0Gao\u00a0said. If confirmed by the U.S., such an understanding could help provide a road-map to a deal de-escalating the trade war that's cast a shadow over the world economy. China's key demand since the start of negotiations has been the removal of punitive tariffs imposed by [Trump], which by now apply to the majority of its exports to the U.S.\"</p><p>- Trump-Xi meeting could be delayed, again: \"A meeting between [Trump] and Chinese President Xi Jinping to sign a long-awaited interim trade deal could be delayed until December as discussions continue over terms and venue, a senior official of the Trump administration told Reuters,\" Reuters's David Brunnstrom and Matt Spetalnick report.</p><p>\"The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said it was still possible the 'phase one' agreement aimed at ending a damaging trade war would not be reached, but a deal was more likely than not.\"</p><p>             Schwarzman is still optimistic about a deal: \"Private equity firm Blackstone Group Inc.

WSJ's Justin Lahart: \"More than ever, the U.S. economy needs productivity to get going. Unfortunately, that isn't happening. The Labor Department on Wednesday reported that real output per hour-the standard measure of worker productivity-fell an annualized 0.3% in the third quarter\u00a0from the second, marking its first quarterly decline in nearly four years. The productivity data can be volatile on a quarterly basis, but the longer-term trend doesn't look good either. From a year earlier, productivity was up just 1.4%.

The stark warning comes after the latest data showed that the euro-area economy is proving more resilient than anticipated, driven by robust expansion in countries such as France. Still, Germany probably went into a technical recession during the last quarter, and the labor market in the continent's biggest economy started to deteriorate.\"</p><p>- Sackler legacy at stake as future of Purdue is decided: \"A battle over billions of dollars in the bankruptcy case of Purdue Pharma has eclipsed what observers see as a key element of a proposed settlement of thousands of opioid lawsuits: a bid to repair the Sackler family legacy,\" my colleague Christopher Rowland reports.</p><p>\"The Sackler family's Purdue Pharma - widely blamed for fueling the opioid epidemic with its marketing of the addictive pain killer OxyContin - would be reinvented in the proposed bankruptcy settlement as a public interest trust dedicated to fighting addiction and overdose deaths. If successful, it would be a startling turnaround. The Sackler family business would be transformed from a maker of a well-known prescription narcotic into an entity focused on manufacturing and distributing overdose antidote drugs free or at a low cost to communities hit hard by addiction.\"</p><p>- Company insiders are taking advantage of buybacks: \" ...

At least 500 insiders sold during buyback programs at their companies in just one 15-month period in 2017 and 2018, according to The Post analysis of data compiled by the SEC as well as regulatory filings. More than 50 of the insider sellers were chief executives ...

But a who's who of finance heavyweights saw their records dented Tuesday night as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez dominated the in-person voting over their preferred candidate in the Democratic primary for New York's 14th congressional district.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Michelle Caruso-Cabrera, a former CNBC anchor and onetime registered Republican, was always a long shot against Ocasio-Cortez. After pulling in 18.7 percent of the in-person vote, while Ocasio-Cortez won 69.6 percent of it, the             Associated Press             and the             New York Times             called the race for the incumbent, who             declared             victory.\u00a0          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">By one measure, Caruso-Cabrera made the race competitive, raising an impressive war chest of more than $2 million for her bid, most of it in big checks from the financiers whom Ocasio-Cortez has made a point of targeting. That haul paled in comparison to the roughly $10.5 million Ocasio-Cortez raised mostly in small donations. Here's a Financial Times visualization of how the candidates raised their money, respectively:\u00a0</p><p>The caliber of the executives lining up against Ocasio-Cortez points to the threat they perceive from her.\u00a0</p><p>In two short years, she went from a no-name who shocked the political world by             knocking off             a powerful, business-friendly incumbent - to a celebrity pol in her own right with the clout to bend the debate in her party toward her democratic socialist views. A member of the House Financial Services Committee, Ocasio-Cortez has pushed a slate of proposals targeting the sector and its executives. She wants to impose a financial transactions tax, for example, and has floated taxing individual income over $10 million at 70 percent.</p><p>Perhaps no surprise then that Caruso-Cabrera pulled in $23,850 from employees of the largest U.S. banks, including $5,600 from Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, according to Federal Election Commission records. She raised another $16,800 from six executives at private equity giant Blackstone Group, including CEO Steve Schwarzman.</p><p>And a parade of Wall Street's top investors also donated the maximum allowable to Caruso-Cabrera. They include hedge fund billionaires: Christopher Flowers; Tudor Investment's Paul Tudor Jones; Paulson &amp; Co.'s John Paulson; and Trian Fund Management's Nelson Peltz and Peter May. The list goes on, as she also collected checks from Interactive Brokers founder and multibillionaire Thomas Peterffy; Crestview Partners CEO Barry Volpert; and Key Square Group founder Scott Bessent.\u00a0</p><p>A number of her backers were traditionally GOP donors: TD Ameritrade founder Joe Ricketts, Elliott Management executive and former Bush administration official Dan Senor; former Bush administration economist Larry Lindsey; Home Depot founder and billionaire investor Ken Langone; billionaire Gristedes Foods CEO John Catsimatidis; and billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller. (Druckenmiller also contributed $25,000 to a super PAC called Fight for Our Communities, which spent $28,000 on digital ads and direct mail targeting Ocasio-Cortez; Caruso-Cabrera's husband, Stephen Dizard, managing partner at investment firm Wood Capital Partners, was the group's top donor, contributing $30,000, per FEC records.)</p><p>Caruso-Cabrera attempted to use Ocasio-Cortez's national profile against her.\u00a0</p><p>She accused the incumbent of neglecting her district, which spans from Queens to parts of the Bronx. She referred to Ocasio-Cortez as \"MIA\" and noted in their debate she remained in Washington - in a \"luxury apartment over a Whole Foods\" - for a week after the pandemic broke out.</p><p>Caruso-Cabrera also drew active support from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The business lobby encouraged her to get in the race last fall, Scott Reed, the group's senior political strategist, told the Associated Press's Alan Fram.</p><p>Reed said the group plowed six figures into digital ads promoting her. But he also indicated the chamber opposed Ocasio-Cortez in part to send a signal.           \"We play to win, but sometimes we play to make a statement,\" he told the AP.</p><p>Ocasio-Cortez took the challenge seriously and worked to frame her challenger as an industry ally.\u00a0</p><p>\"Ms Caruso-Cabrera's credentials as a Democrat have been questioned by Ms Ocasio-Cortez,\" the FT wrote. \"She was registered as a Republican as recently as 2015. In 2010 the former broadcaster wrote a book about the financial crisis titled You Know I'm Right that said her favourite president was Ronald Reagan and described the Democratic party as 'out of control when it comes to spending'. The book's foreword was written by Larry Kudlow, a former CNBC colleague who is now Mr Trump's economic adviser.\"</p><p>             Ocasio-Cortez highlighted Caruso-Cabrera's fundraising in the closing days of the race:</p><p>She took a victory lap around those Wall Street donors in a late-night tweet Tuesday, perhaps reminding the executives why they tried to sink her:</p><p>             Stocks rallied but point to losses at the open.\u00a0</p><p>             A second straight day of gains lost steam toward the close. \"The S&amp;P 500 jumped as much as 1.2% before paring the gain by two-thirds on reports that spiking cases in several           hotspots           in the South and Southwest threatened to derail plans to ramp up reopening,\" Bloomberg's Sarah Ponczek reports. \"The Nasdaq Composite hit an all-time high, with investors keying on signs of continued economic growth and the idea that any setback will be met with increased government spending and Federal Reserve moves.\"       </p><p>             Some Republicans are open to a second round of stimulus checks.          </p><p>             But Trump's private backing comes as divisions in the White House remain: \"Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) suggested he would back smaller versions of the initial measure if targeted for 'the people who are hurting the most.' Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) said it should be considered as part of the discussion on how to handle the increase in unemployment benefits approved by Congress in March,\" Jeff Stein, Josh Dawsey and Erica Werner report.</p><p>             Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin confirmed he is open to more stimulus: \"'It's something we're very seriously considering,' Mnuchin said in an interview during the Bloomberg Invest Global virtual event. He said he expects the U.S. economy to exit recession by year's end,\" Bloomberg's Saleha Mohsin and Erik Wasson report.</p><p>\"Mnuchin joined GOP senators at their weekly policy lunch and talked up the impact of the stimulus checks,\" my colleagues report. \"'He just said that when he went around the country, people came up and thanked him for it. It seemed to have made a difference to them,' Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) told reporters.\"</p><p>             14 percent of businesses still expect layoffs even after PPP funds: The finding headlines a survey published by the National Federation of Independent Business, CNBC's Greg Iacurci reports.</p><p>\"Nearly half\u00a0- 47\u00a0percent - of entrepreneurs who received a PPP loan or a loan through another relief measure, the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program, anticipate needing additional financial support over the next 12 months, according to the NFIB survey. More than half of survey respondents - 56 percent - said they'd likely need $50,000 or less over the next year, while 27 percent anticipate needing more than $100,000.\"</p><p>From the U.S.:</p><p>             Covid-19 has unleashed a wave of \"zombie\" companies.          </p><p>             Responses to the pandemic have accelerated a growing trend: \"Nearly one in every five publicly traded U.S. companies is a zombie, according to data compiled by Deutsche Bank Securities. That figure has doubled since 2013 and is up dramatically from the late 1990s, when there were almost no half-dead companies staggering across the landscape,\" David J. Lynch reports.</p><p>\"Years of ultralow interest rates intended to stimulate the economy after each of three 21st-century recessions created the conditions for zombies to proliferate, according to economists. Since the pandemic sideswiped the U.S. economy in March, the Federal Reserve has again lowered borrowing costs to near zero and further eased credit conditions by purchasing corporate bonds ... Nonfinancial business debt grew in the first quarter by almost 19 percent, the biggest percentage jump in at least 40 years, according to the Federal Reserve.

In recent days, it has\u00a0more closely resembled a pantomime, the policymaking equivalent of what the Harlem Globetrotters used to do to the Washington Generals. In this case, the Tax-Cutters are steamrolling the Budget Balancers -\u00a0and making it look easy.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             In the Senate, <person><nameText>Bob Corker (R</nameText></person>-Tenn.) was primed to force a reckoning over deficit spending in the Budget Committee. Republicans on the panel need to agree on a spending blueprint to lock in special instructions allowing them to pass a tax package without Democratic support. And with a one-vote edge in the committee, the GOP can't afford to lose Corker. The Tennessean signaled that he'd drive a hard bargain over adding to the now $20 trillion federal debt, which he called \"the greatest threat to our country\" in an op-ed earlier this month.\u00a0</p><p>             But Corker on Tuesday struck a deal with Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), the committee's leading supply-sider, that skews in favor of slashing taxes, deficits be damned. The agreement is expected to give the go-ahead\u00a0to $1.5 trillion in tax cuts over 10\u00a0years. Corker says that will give Republicans running room to craft a tax package, and he reserves the right to oppose the final product if it unleashes too much red ink. Yet he's already given away his moment of maximum leverage.\u00a0</p><p>             Over in the House, the self-appointed fiscal scolds in the Freedom Caucus have talked tough on deficits all year. That included threats to blow up their chamber's budget if it failed to carry some $400 billion in mandatory savings. But the proposed House GOP spending plan trims only half that sum.</p><p>And the hard right has since witnessed the collapse of an Obamacare repeal bill that would have slashed\u00a0the deficit by $119 billion -\u00a0and a debt ceiling hike that rode\u00a0along with an unpaid-for, $15 billion down payment on hurricane relief. Ringing up those charges has darkened a deficit picture that Republicans vowed to address:\u00a0Federal spending this year is set to exceed collections by the widest gap since 2009, and the national debt topped $20 trillion this month for the first time in its history.\u00a0          </p><p>             Yet leaders of the Freedom Caucus are no longer conditioning their support for a budget on fiscal discipline.\u00a0Instead, they are demanding details of the tax proposal the budget\u00a0would fast-track. \"The House Freedom Caucus will gladly start the process if we are confident the tax plan will actually cut taxes for families, simplify the code and create jobs,\" House Freedom Caucus co-founders <person><nameText>Mark Meadows </nameText></person>(R-N.C.) and Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed this week. \"We will gladly pass the budget when basic questions are answered.\"</p><p>             Controlling spending, \"for whatever reason, is not at the front of the discussion,\" says Adam Michel, a tax policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation.             Michel says the Freedom Caucus has decided to make a choice between \"the tax reform debate and the big spending reform debate,\" instead of linking one to the other.\u00a0          </p><p>Congressional Republican leaders are on board, having walked away from commitments they made earlier this year to ensure a tax overhaul pays for itself. Both Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) now give themselves more wiggle room to accept spending\u00a0as the price of a tax overhaul.</p><p>The GOP's abandonment of the green-eyeshade approach hasn't gone unnoticed by independent budget minders. \"With the U.S. in such a dangerous fiscal situation, policymakers shouldn't even consider voluntarily adding another $1.5 trillion to our national debt,\" Michael Peterson, president of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, said Tuesday. \"Reaching $20 trillion in debt should be a wake-up call to solve our fiscal challenges, not an invitation to add to the problem.\"</p><p>But others noted that the GOP always seems to lose its religion on spending as soon as it has the majority.          </p><p>Here was the New York Times' Binyamin Appelbaum:\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>And Republican lawmakers are signaling a willingness to end-run the budget referees if their calls don't favor the tax plan. As Bloomberg News's Sahil Kapur and Erik Wasson report:\u00a0</p><p>Corker said he wants a credible score of the final tax bill to show the tax cuts would pay for themselves and not a \"crazy\" estimate, although he said he supports \"dynamic\"\u00a0scoring, which uses economic models that assume economic growth would result from the tax cuts and mitigate the deficit impact. He also said that the score would not have to come from Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation, which would be a major departure from Senate tradition.</p><p>             Some in the GOP -- including former Freedom Caucuser and now Office of Management and Budget head Mick Mulvaney -- has done its best to discredit the Congressional Budget Office, the official scorekeeper for the legislative branch. McConnell and company won't wait for a score of the new health-care overhaul measure for voting.\u00a0</p><p>             FED CENTRAL:          </p><p>- Fed keeps its word.\u00a0Surprising nobody, as it intended, the central bank indicated Wednesday that it remains on track for one more interest rate hike\u00a0at the end of the year and will begin unwinding its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. The Wall Street Journal's Nick Timiraos: \"The Fed left rates unchanged and penciled in one more rate rise in 2017, signaling continued optimism about the economy even though persistently low inflation has prompted some officials to voice greater skepticism about a move this year.\"\u00a0</p><p>             \"The basic message here is U.S. economic performance has been good,\" Fed Chair\u00a0Janet L. Yellen said at a news\u00a0conference after a two-day policy meeting that ended Wednesday. \"The American people should feel the steps we have taken to normalize monetary policy ... are well justified given the very substantial progress we've seen in the economy.'\"</p><p>- Stocks rise. Reuters' Sinead Carew: \"The S&amp;P 500 and the Dow ended slightly higher on Wednesday, adding to their string of closing records, after the Federal Reserve signaled it expects another interest rate hike by year-end and disclosed timing for reducing its balance sheet...\u00a0</p><p>             Financial stocks jumped after the statement as U.S. Treasury yields rose on the prospect of higher rates while utilities took a fall on concerns that the defensive sector would look less attractive as rates climb. While some investors said the Fed's tone was more hawkish than expected others were happy Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen reiterated her stance that balance sheet reduction would be data dependent.\" And the dollar rose.\u00a0</p><p>The muted market reaction affirmed that investors didn't see any surprises. The New York Times's Neil Irwin:\u00a0</p><p>- Unwinding casts the Fed into new territory.\u00a0The Post's Heather Long: \"It's not as simple as shedding all its assets at once. If the Fed moves too quickly, it risks unsettling stock and bond markets and driving investors away from investments with more potential to stimulate economic growth. But if the bank moves too slowly, it could end up still sitting on a bloated balance sheet when the economy hits its next downturn - leaving it without some of the tools it needs to push the economy. toward recovery. ... There was no guidebook for the Fed's balance sheet to grow so large, and there's no guidebook now for how to shrink it back down.\"</p><p>- Banks should benefit. Rising long-term interest rates should push up the yield curve, boosting bank profitability. The Wall Street Journal's Aaron Back: \"This effect will be limited by the fact that foreign central banks are still actively buying bonds and other securities, holding down long-term rates around the world.\"</p><p>- The Fed's new dot plot.\u00a0Via Bloomberg, here.\u00a0</p><p>RUSSIA WATCH:\u00a0          </p><p>- Manafort offered Russian billionaire private campaign briefing. \"Less than two weeks before Donald Trump accepted the Republican presidential nomination, his campaign chairman offered to provide briefings on the race to a Russian billionaire closely aligned with the Kremlin, according to people familiar with the discussions,\" The Post's Tom Hamburger, Rosalind S. Helderman, Carol D. Leonnig and Adam Entous scoop. \"Paul Manafort made the offer in an email to an overseas intermediary, asking that a message be sent to Oleg Deripaska, an aluminum magnate with whom Manafort had done business in the past, these people said. 'If he needs private briefings we can accommodate,' Manafort wrote in the July 7, 2016, email.\"</p><p>             - Mueller is casting a wide net.\u00a0Carol\u00a0and Roz\u00a0have the story: \"The special counsel investigating Russian election meddling has requested extensive records and email correspondence from the White House, covering areas including the president's private discussions about firing his FBI director and his response to news that the then-national security adviser was under investigation, according to two people briefed on the requests.\u00a0White House lawyers are now working to turn over internal documents that span 13 categories that investigators for the special counsel have identified as critical to their probe, the people said.\"</p><p>- Hackers entered Equifax systems in March.\u00a0That's two months earlier than the company had said. \"FireEye's Mandiant group, which has been hired by Equifax to investigate the breach, said the first evidence of hackers' 'interaction'\u00a0with the company occurred on March 10, according to the Mandiant report, which was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal,\"\u00a0AnnaMaria Andriotis and\u00a0Robert McMillan write. \"Equifax had previously disclosed that data belonging to approximately 143 million Americans was potentially accessed in May. It isn't known when Equifax learned from Mandiant that the hacking activity began in March, not May.\"</p><p>             - The company probably won't face any punishment. New York Times's Peter Henning: \"Equifax operates in a sphere with minimal government regulation, and its conduct is unlikely to trigger a criminal prosecution of the company or any of its executives. The worst anyone connected with Equifax may end up facing is a tongue-lashing from Congress - many hearings are already scheduled - except for the outside chance that the aggrieved public gets its own day in court. But that could be years from now.\"</p><p>Nevertheless: \"The House Financial Services Committee is seeking information about trading in Equifax options nearly three weeks before the credit reporting company disclosed a massive data breach,\" per CNBC.\u00a0</p><p>- Internet companies, on the other hand, suddenly find themselves in the Washington barrel. \"After years of largely avoiding regulation, businesses like Facebook, Google and Amazon are a focus of lawmakers, some of whom are criticizing the expanding power of big tech companies and their role in the 2016 election,\" the New York Times' Cecilia Kang writes. \"The attacks cover a smattering of issues as diverse as antitrust, privacy and public disclosure. They also come from both sides, from people like Stephen K. Bannon, President Trump's former chief strategist, as well as Senator Elizabeth Warren, a liberal Democrat from Massachusetts.\"</p><p>- GE shuts down corporate jet fleet. \"General Electric executives will have to find new ways to fly around the globe. The conglomerate is grounding its corporate fleet of jets and preparing to sell them, as new GE chief John Flannery continues to look to slash costs at the industrial giant,\" The Wall Street Journal writes.\u00a0</p><p>             Just wondering: What's it say about where we are when General Electric executives can't get on private planes and Trump administration officials can't seem to get off them?\u00a0          </p><p>- OPIC\u00a0backs Matt Damon. The Overseas Private Investment Corporation is committing $20 million to WaterEquity, a social impact investment fund the actor co-founded to support projects serving the water and sanitation needs of poor populations.\u00a0</p><p>- A plurality of Americans oppose cutting taxes. That's according to a new NBC/ Wall Street Journal poll, which found 42 percent of respondents believe Congress should not cut taxes, while 24 percent want cuts for individuals and 28 percent want them cut for both individuals and businesses. Another way of reading those\u00a0results: 52 percent of Americans support cutting taxes in some form.\u00a0But only 20 percent of respondents say businesses pay more than their fair share of taxes.\u00a0</p><p>- Goldman predicts $1 trillion tax cut.\u00a0The firm has upgraded prospects for a tax package to more likely than not\u00a0after the announcement of a Senate budget deal. CNBC's Patti Domm: \"The Goldman economists assume the tax cuts would be phased in and could boost growth by 0.1 or 0.2 percentage points of GDP in 2018-2019.\"</p><p>- SEC hacked. \"The top U.S. markets regulator disclosed on Wednesday that hackers penetrated its electronic system for storing public-company filings and may have traded illegally on the information,\" The Wall Street Journal's Dave Michaels writes. \"The Securities and Exchange Commission's chairman, Jay Clayton, revealed the breach in an unusual and lengthy statement issued Wednesday evening. The SEC said it was investigating the source of the hack, which it said exploited a software vulnerability in a part of the Edgar system.\"</p><p>             The agency said it detected the hack in 2016 but didn't learn about the possibility of illicit trading until last month.\u00a0          </p><p>From Clayton's\u00a04,000-plus word statement, innocuously titled, \"Statement on Cybersecurity\":\u00a0\"A software vulnerability in the test filing component of our EDGAR system, which was patched promptly after discovery, was exploited and resulted in access to nonpublic information. We believe the intrusion did not result in unauthorized access to personally identifiable information, jeopardize the operations of the Commission, or result in systemic risk.\u00a0Our investigation of this matter is ongoing, however, and we are coordinating with appropriate authorities.\"</p><p>-Yellen: Wells Fargo conduct \"unacceptable.\"The Post's Renae Merle: \"Federal Reserve Chair Janet L. Yellen on Wednesday delivered a bruising assessment of Wells Fargo, calling 'unacceptable'\u00a0the megabank's admissions that its employees had potentially set up as many as 3.2 million fake accounts that customers did not want so they could meet aggressive sales goals. 'Let me say that I consider the behavior of Wells Fargo toward its customers to have been egregious and unacceptable,'\u00a0Yellen said during a news conference Wednesday.The Federal Reserve has been reviewing the incident for several months, and Yellen declined to comment on the status of the investigation.\"</p><p>             Coming Up          </p><p>From The Post's Tom Toles: \"Robert Mueller gets an advance version of the Trump defense.\"</p><p>President Trump says \"Africa has tremendous business potential\":\u00a0</p><p>Watch former President Obama's speech at the Gates Foundation, in three minutes:\u00a0</p><p>Late-night laughs: President Trump's speech at the U.N.:</p><p>Watch Stephen Colbert's take on Obama's assessment of the Cassidy-Graham health-care plan:\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-f175dd12577d494dad6c8cdf33640519</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PHX-KKJ1-JB4M-V01P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2537\"/><timeReceived>12:20 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"09\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>September 21, 2017 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Lagarde said central banks had Australian court rejects regulator's record fine against Westpac[7] - Reuters An Australian court refused on Tuesday to approve a record A$35 million ($25 million) fine imposed on Westpac Banking Corp by the corporate regulator for using inappropriate calculations to determine if customers could afford home loans. Top law firm linked to subject of UK's first unexplained wealth order[8] - The Guardian Mishcon de Reya advised British Virgin Islands company owned by Zamira Hajiyeva One of London's most prestigious law firms and the Swiss arm of Barclays Bank provided services to an offshore company owned by a woman who has recently been named as the subject of the UK's first unexplained wealth The scandal of Goldman's secret agent[9] - Financial Times Banks and consultants are tarnished by doing deals for foreign governments they should avoid Goldman Sachs bankers 'cheated' Malaysia over 1MDB: PM Mahathir[10] - Reuters Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said bankers at Goldman Sachs Group Inc 'cheated' the country in dealings with state fund 1MDB and that U.S. authorities have promised to help return the fees the Wall Street bank earned from the fund.

The problem with testing technology is that it is just a test. A false implementation. It is not  Suits you sir!</p><p>[2] It's very confusing these days. I turned up at a conference recently in a suit and tie and no one, literally no one, was wearing a suit or tie. No one had told me the dress code either, so I grinned and bared it. Then  What is the preference: human or digital relationships?[3] I've often been hired to run a workshop or presentation at a bank's boardroom meeting. Usually, I'm hired by the frustrated digital guy who wants to convince the rest of the leadership team that it's important. They don't get digital, he or she will tell  It will be all right[4] I don't know how generations think. I only know how my generation thinks, and they call my generation baby boomers. It's a massive net that catches me, even though I feel like I'm Generation X - a punk and new romancer - but hey, marketing  Why investment banks have the digital edge[5] For some years, I've been heavily involved in high frequency trading and quantitative trading, areas that are highly automated and pretty complex. I don't blog about it much here, as it's not appealing to the everyday person. It involves too much dialogue explaining acronyms used This week's main news headlines are  TSB customers complain about fraud alert failures[6] - BBC TSB customers who have had money taken from their accounts say they have not received alerts warning them of fraudulent activity. Banks abandon interest-only home loans amid FCA scrutiny of 'mortgage prisoners'[7] - The Telegraph Are Apple, Amazon and Facebook the future of banking?[8] - CNN Watch out, big banks. Silicon Valley is targeting finance as the next industry ripe for disruption. In the not-too-distant-future, Amazon (AMZN) could let customers zap each other cash with Alexa, and then deposit the money in an Amazon-branded checking account. TSB accused of 'dreadful response' to meltdown[9] - BBC Some customers are still struggling to make payments nearly four weeks after the bank's IT crisis began. TSB rejected help from Lloyds at start of IT meltdown[10] - The Guardian Bank accused of 'playing fast and loose', as some users still report problems accessing accounts TSB turned down an offer of help from Lloyds Banking Group, its former owner, in the early stages of an IT meltdown that left up to 1.9 million online customers unable to access their accounts. Singapore's Biggest Bank Takes on China Giants in Fintech Battle[11] - Bloomberg Piyush Gupta sees himself as uncomfortably close to the action in the battle between traditional banks and China's insurgent fintech giants. Banks are already bumping up against the limits of AI in lending decisions[12] - Quartz While big tech companies might not face regulation of their artificial-intelligence efforts in the US, banks trying to use AI still have to contend with reams of industry-specific rules, including laws ensuring equal treatment of customers. Santander Will Roll Out New Online Bank In UK[13] - PYMNTS.com Santander, the Spanish banking giant and lender, is gearing up to launch a digital bank in the U.K. that is a standalone operation. The UK economy's slowdown is clear to all. Except the Bank of England[14] - The Guardian Mark Carney is not so much an unreliable boyfriend as a schoolboy who keeps getting his homework wrong. The Bank of England governor gave his quarterly review of the economy last week and yet again confounded earlier expectations that he would increase the cost of borrowing. HSBC says performs first trade finance transaction using blockchain[15] - ReutersHONG KONG (Reuters) - HSBC Holdings Plc said on Monday it had performed the world's first trade finance transaction using blockchain technology, a major step in boosting efficiency and reducing errors in the multi-trillion-dollar funding of international trade.If you like the Finanser, check out our latest

Nate Jones[1] reports on the only federal legislation[2] addressing the deepfake problem so far. I claim that it is well short of a serious regulatory effort - and pretty close to a fake itself.In contrast, India seems serious about imposing liability[3] on companies whose unbreakable end-to-end crypto causes harm, at least to judge from the howls of the usual defenders of such products. David Kris[4] explains how the law will work. </p><p>I ask why Silicon Valley gets to impose the externalities of encryption-facilitated crime on society when we'd never let Big Tech leave us with the tab for water or air pollution just because their products are so cool. In related news, the FBI may be turning the Pensacola military terrorism attack into a slow-motion replay[5] of its San Bernardino fight with Apple, this time with more top cover (and probably better lawyering).Poor Nate seems to draw all the fake legislation in this episode. He explains a 2020 appropriations rider requiring the State Department to report on how it issues export licenses for cyber espionage capabilities; this is a follow-up[6] to investigative reporting on the way such capabilities ended up being used against human rights activists in the UAE. As we agree, it's an interesting and likely unsolvable policy problem, so the legislation opts for the most meaningless of remedies, requiring[7] the Directorate of Defense Trade Control to report[8] \"on cybertools and capabilities licensing, including licensing screening and approval procedures as well as compliance and enforcement mechanisms\" within 90 days.Nate also gets to cover some decidedly un-fake requirements in the 2019 NDAA limiting[9] how defense contractors can use Chinese technology. The other shoe is about to drop, and if the first one was a baby shoe, the second is a Clydesdale's horseshoe.It's hard to call it fake, but the latest export control rule[10] restricting sales of AI could hardly be narrower[11]. Maury Shenk[12] and I speculate that this is because a long-term turf war has broken out again in export control policy circles. Maury's money is on the business side of that fight, and the narrowness of the AI rule gives weight to his views.And here's some Christmas cheer for DOJ and national security officials: A federal district court put a lump of coal[13] in Fast Eddie Snowden's stocking, denying him royalties from a book that violated his nondisclosure agreement. Nate thinks it's safe for me to buy a copy, but I'm waiting for appellate confirmation.Less festive news comes from the European Court of Justice's advocate general opinion[14] in Schrems II, a case that could greatly complicate EU-US data transfers[15] by purporting to put Europeans in charge of how the US defends itself from terrorism. Maury explains; I complain.David unpacks with clarity a complex Second Circuit decision[16] on the constitutionality of FISA 702 collection. On the whole, Judge Lynch did a creditable job with a messy and unprecedented set of claims[17], though I question the wisdom of erecting a baroque mansion of judge-made limits on a slippery and narrow foundation like the Fourth Amendment's requirement that searches be \"reasonable.\"And in short hits:Finally, to put everyone back in the Christmas spirit, LabMD won nearly a million dollars in fees[18] from the Federal Trade Commission for the FTC's bullheaded pursuit of the company despite the many flaws in its case. The master's opinion[19] makes clear just how badly the FTC erred in hounding LabMD.Download the 295th Episode (mp3).[20]You can subscribe to The Cyberlaw Podcast using iTunes[21], Google Play[22], Spotify[23], Pocket Casts[24], or our RSS feed[25]!As always, The Cyberlaw Podcast is open to feedback.

From cross-border payments, to alternative lending, InsurTech disruptors, to digital banks, London has been the birthplace of great FinTech start-ups, as identified in our report for the Global FinTech Hub Federation[1].But the UK cannot yet claim to be a natural home for FinTech scale-ups.A commonly-shared description of the shift into scaling is that a start-up becomes a scale-up by proving its business model.The start-up phase is all about honing the product to perfectly fit the market, bringing acquisition costs below customer lifetime revenue, and getting those first revenue-positive customers in the door.Then you can start scaling.So far, too few of our FinTech darlings can truly claim to have entered scale-up mode.This is not a FinTech-specific problem. The UK struggles to support firms in nearly all sectors into and through the scale-up period of their life-cycle. We have all heard the stats that anything between 50% and 90% of all small businesses fail.Given the productive nature of scale-up businesses, it's a problem the Government is keen to solve. </p><p>In his recent Budget, the Chancellor announced Treasury backing for a multi-billion programme of support targeted specifically at scale-ups.So what can the UK's FinTech sector do to help companies transition successfully from start-up to scale-up?Our recent Power Up: UK business[2] report on the scale-up challenge identified increased collaboration between high growth start-ups and large corporates as a potential solution.In the FinTech space, small amounts of collaboration have been happening for some time; most notably between banks and alternative lenders. But now is the time to think more seriously about the benefits both parties can receive from collaboration. In Insurance, the collaboration goes a stage further - most notably because of the cost of capital and access to regulation.The Power Up report identifies eight models[3] for start-up collaboration with big business, from low cost and speculative options such as running a hackathon programme, to acquisition which requires significant investment and commitment. The key is for businesses to be clear about what they want to achieve and pick the right model to meet specific objectives.The early stages of FinTech have been characterised by start-ups bringing single products to market that attempt to offer significantly better value and experience than the equivalent product at a financial services institution.Where these institutions have offered multiple financial products and services, in many cases little attention has been paid to relatively niche areas of their offering. This created a clear opportunity for disruption from start-ups.It hasn't been too hard for start-ups to beat banks on pricing and user experience in areas like retail FX, or small business loans. Where the start-ups find it tricky is in both customer acquisition and distributing their product. Early-adopters have flocked to these products, but breaking through into the mainstream takes considerably more effort. For a new bank or Insurance offering, what's the magic number? 10,000 customers 100,000 customers? In China for example, a new bank launched and secured over 800,000 customers in just 4 days. A huge feat when you look at it out of context.The average person doesn't want individual providers for each of the financial products they use, they prefer the ease of a one-stop shop, such as a bank.And therein lies the potential for collaboration. Much in the same way a supermarket owns the shelf space upon which the products of other companies sit, the bank can provide the metaphorical shelf space for new, innovative products created by start-ups. A concept explored in our Open Banking report[4].This enables the start-ups to dramatically increase reach, cut costs of acquisition, and get into scale-up mode.At the same time the institution can offer a better user experience, enhancing the relationship with their customers at a time when big tech companies might start treading on their territory.Of course, it's not all so easy when it comes to the nuts and bolts of collaboration.Big financial services institutions have very different cultural norms to start-ups. Start-ups might be suspicious of a bank or insurer stealing their ideas, institutions might not see the immediate benefit of handing customers off to a potential rival. The start-up might agree a deal with one part of a bank, but then find ten more people need to be convinced as well. The institution might not be certain the start-up will properly protect its customer, especially when the start-up is the subject of only light-touch regulation.The ability of start-ups and institutions to overcome these barriers will play a crucial role in their survival and success, which is why we recommend the below 'to do list' for business.Corporates should seek to collaborate with aspiring scaleups who can complement their capabilities and help stimulate the innovation that they are unable to achieve in-house.Corporates should streamline the processes that early stage businesses are subjected to during procurement and other functions to make it easier, cheaper and therefore more appealing for young businesses to engage and work with them.Aspiring scaleups should target partnerships with corporates who share their vision, can help them develop their offering and are able to connect them to bigger consumer networks.Scaleups should equally hold traditional business to account - work with the ones that deliver on the promise of engaging at the right pace and level. The worst possible positon for some of these is too many badge collectors or POC hell.Access the full Power Up: UK business[5] report, including the findings from its survey of UK businessesThe content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

It requires offering full-service offerings that are fully regulated and fully compliant. This is why Big Tech is far happier working with banks than trying to shut them down. In fact, most Big Tech - Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services for example - can make far more out of banks by offering them technology services than trying to compete with them head-to-head. But there's another reason why I don't see Big Tech moving into Big Banking. Service. Big Tech is all about digital experiences. Money is about trust. That's the reason why, when thinking about this week's Karaoke Challenge, Ghostbusters came to mind. It came to mind not only because we are busting a myth - Big Tech will not open a bank of their own to compete with Big Banks - but also because it fits perfectly to the refrain of Not Google!This refrain was kind of inspired when I realised that, if your internet search fails, who you gonna call? Not Google! They have no telephone number.[embedded content]NOT GOOGLE!When your app breaks down And you can't get cash Who you gonna call?

Rather than opening or buying bansk, most of the Big Tech firms are partnering with them. Apple and Goldman Sachs make a nice pair as does Chase and Google is partnering with a variety of banks to offer financial capabilities. Several of the Big Tech firms have danced around the edges of finance, in particular Amazon, but none of them have opened or offered a full deposit checking account. Why? Because it\u2019s too much work. It requires offering full-service offerings that are fully regulated and fully compliant. This is why Big Tech is far happier partnering with Big Banks than trying to shut them down. In fact, most Big Tech \u2013 Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services for example \u2013 can make far more out of banks by offering them technology services than trying to compete with them head-to-head. But there\u2019s another reason why I don\u2019t see Big Tech moving into Big Banking. Service. Big Tech is all about digital experiences. Money is about trust. That\u2019s the reason why, when thinking about this week\u2019s Karaoke Challenge, Ghostbusters came to mind. It came to mind not only because we are busting a myth \u2013 Big Tech will not open a bank of their own to compete with Big Banks \u2013 but also because it fits perfectly to the refrain of Not Google! This refrain was kind of inspired when I realised that, if your internet search fails, who you gonna call? Not Google! They have no telephone number.     NOT GOOGLE!   When your app breaks down And you can\u2019t get cash Who you gonna call? NOT GOOGLE!   When you\u2019re nearly broke Pick up the phone Who you gonna call? NOT GOOGLE!   I ain\u2019t afraid of no bank I ain\u2019t afraid of no bank   When you\u2019re trying hard And you\u2019re in the red Who you gonna call? NOT GOOGLE!   When you get a windfall And want to invest Who you gonna call? NOT GOOGLE!   I ain\u2019t afraid of no bank I ain\u2019t afraid of no bank   When you\u2019re buying a home And need a loan Who you gonna call? NOT GOOGLE!   I ain\u2019t afraid of the bank I\u2019m working with my bank   Lemme tell you something Banking makes me feel good   I ain\u2019t afraid of the bank I\u2019m working with my bank   For all banks\u2019 faults They\u2019re our friends too They understand risks NOT GOOGLE!   You may not like them But they understand you Better than tech NOT GOOGLE!   Who you gonna call? NOT GOOGLE!   Who you gonna call? NOT GOOGLE!   Who you gonna call? NOT GOOGLE!   Who you gonna call? NOT GOOGLE!

Rather than opening or buying banks, most of the Big Tech firms are partnering with them. Apple and Goldman Sachs make a nice pair as does Google, who partner with a variety of banks to offer financial capabilities. Several of the Big Tech firms have danced around the edges of finance, in particular Amazon, but none of them have opened or offered a full deposit checking account. Why? Because it\u2019s too much work. It requires offering full-service offerings that are fully regulated and fully compliant. This is why Big Tech is far happier working with banks than trying to shut them down. In fact, most Big Tech \u2013 Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services for example \u2013 can make far more out of banks by offering them technology services than trying to compete with them head-to-head. But there\u2019s another reason why I don\u2019t see Big Tech moving into Big Banking. Service. Big Tech is all about digital experiences. Money is about trust. That\u2019s the reason why, when thinking about this week\u2019s Karaoke Challenge, Ghostbusters came to mind. It came to mind not only because we are busting a myth \u2013 Big Tech will not open a bank of their own to compete with Big Banks \u2013 but also because it fits perfectly to the refrain of Not Google! This refrain was kind of inspired when I realised that, if your internet search fails, who you gonna call? Not Google! They have no telephone number.     NOT GOOGLE!   When your app breaks down And you can\u2019t get cash Who you gonna call? NOT GOOGLE!   When you\u2019re nearly broke Pick up the phone Who you gonna call? NOT GOOGLE!   I ain\u2019t afraid of no bank I ain\u2019t afraid of no bank   When you\u2019re trying hard And you\u2019re in the red Who you gonna call? NOT GOOGLE!   When you get a windfall And want to invest Who you gonna call? NOT GOOGLE!   I ain\u2019t afraid of no bank I ain\u2019t afraid of no bank   When you\u2019re buying a home And need a loan Who you gonna call? NOT GOOGLE!   I ain\u2019t afraid of the bank I\u2019m working with my bank   Lemme tell you something Banking makes me feel good   I ain\u2019t afraid of the bank I\u2019m working with my bank   For all banks\u2019 faults They\u2019re our friends too They understand risks NOT GOOGLE!   You may not like them But they understand you Better than tech NOT GOOGLE!   Who you gonna call? NOT GOOGLE!   Who you gonna call? NOT GOOGLE!   Who you gonna call? NOT GOOGLE!   Who you gonna call? NOT GOOGLE!

There are four big things for 2018 from a FinTech viewpoint that are obvious to me however, which are:Getting down to business with Artificial Intelligence (AI): several of the large banks like JPMorgan and UBS were doing interesting things with AI in 2017, but I think this will be a lot more pervasive and recognised across all banks in 2018. This is primarily for compliance and risk, as AI can develop and apply complex rules across all business processes in real-time, and when most banks have 1 in 3 staff checking compliance, it makes absolute sense to replace them with learning software. Rationalising and cleansing core data structures: many banks have built their core operations on fragmented systems aligned to products. This has distributed customer data across multiple platforms, and banks recognise that they cannot use AI effectively on data spread across the business. </p><p>As a result, many will develop strategies for building an Enterprise Data Architecture in 2018 which rationalises and cleanses their fragmented data stores. Continuing the digital drive: many banks are waking up to more and more challenges in digitalising their operations, and this will be even more pressured in 2018 thanks to the arrival of Open APIs under the Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2) and Open Banking in the UK in January. The open sourcing of financial services has been bubbling for a decade, and now that regulations are forcing this onto the large institutions, 2018 will be a big year for doing digital properly and becoming an Open Bank. Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) continues to rise: during the last couple of years, we have seen many proof of concept and trials of DLT, but 2018 sees it become mainstream as various institutions go live with real-world applications. The Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) is one of the first, but there are others. Watch this space carefully in 2018 as things are changing fast.These four big things are trends rather than predictions, and I've decided that predictions are no longer relevant. After all, who wants to predict the price of a bitcoin? Who had any idea it would rise from under $1,000 to $20,000 a coin last year?\u00a0Can we predict which FinTech firms will breakout this year? Who had any idea that Coinbase would become one of the biggest FinTech unicorns[1] last year? Therefore, rather than me making predictions, I thought it interesting to review the views of other commentators. Jim Marous of the Financial Brand crowdsourced a whole range of expert opinions for 2018, which are summarised as the 10 priorities for this year as being:Removing Friction from the Customer Journey Expanding Use of Data and Advanced Analytics Improving Multichannel Delivery (note: I never\u00a0use the word\u00a0channel) Embracing PSD2 and Open API Banking Building Fintech Partnerships Expansion of DigitalPayments Navigating Compliance and Regulatory Changes Exploring Advanced Technologies Competing with New Challengers Testing Blockchain Technologies (that was last year imho)The top trends for retail banking are: <url normalizedValue=\"https://thefinanser.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Q6_Three_most_important_trends_for_retail_banking_industry_in_2018-565x536.png\">https://thefinanser.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Q6_Three_most_important_trends_for_retail_banking_industry_in_2018-565x536.png</url> And the top strategic priorities for 2018 include:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://thefinanser.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Q3_top_three_strategic_priorities_for_2018-565x469.png\">https://thefinanser.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Q3_top_three_strategic_priorities_for_2018-565x469.png</url> Jim also wrote another piece that nicely summarises Forrester's predictions for 2018[2] which include:Banks not embracing Open Banking, but increasing partnerships with start-ups; Faster moves to embrace Digital Banking whilst losing focus on face-to-face communications; and Focus on back office transformation.Similar to my own views therefore. Saxo Bank's Payments business sent me a press release with their top three predictions, which are: The demise of traditional, slow, expensive cross border payments The correspondent banking network has for some time been under pressure, and 2018 will see that trend continue. Financial utilities will step in to pick up the slack. Allowing a third party to handle non-core activities enables financial institutions to innovate and expand their core domestic offering, whilst focusing its own energies on improving and maintaining the all-important customer relationship. Payment Service Providers (PSPs) will help merchants to expand internationally Many barriers to cross border trade are coming down, and payments must follow suit by removing cost and time barriers sooner rather than later. PSPs must work harder to provide new global payment methods, which meet the merchant's needs - fast payments, low fees, good FX rates, transparency, compliance, security. Otherwise, merchants will be forced to seek alternatives and PSPs will be left behind. Tech giants move into banking The current vertical separation of the value chain in the financial industry has created an opportunity for large tech businesses to monetise their user base by delivering financial services. This is why 2018 is being tipped as the year of the Bank of Amazon or Google Bank. These trusted household brand names are perfectly placed to provide banking services. Not only do they have the funding and ambition to rapidly increase scale and reach international markets, but they have enormous customer bases who already trust them with huge amounts of their personal data, so using them for banking is not such a big step. I actually disagree with the last one here, as I don't think the big Tech giants want to be banks. They want to steal bank business, particularly margin on payments and credit, but I really do not see them wanting to be full-service deposit account holding banks. Too much overhead of compliance. Another interesting forecast came from a firm called Romexsoft[3], who think that 2018 will see:Blockchain Technology Will Enter the Mainstream (last year) Asia is Becoming the Place for Fintech Investment (last year) Expect More ICO's (sure) Legacy Financial Institutions are Getting on Board (for a while) Mobile Technology Continues to Innovate (more IoT than mobile) Security, Privacy, and Trust Will Continue to Be Challenges (never goes away) Fintech Will Continue to Disrupt (or legacy firms partner with them)Let's Talk Payments[4]\u00a0has 10 2018 predictions as follows:Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies - here come the institutional investors? Crypto regulations and tax - are the regulators and tax authorities set to join the party as well? ICOs - is the child becoming a teenager? RegTech - a wave of consolidation ahead? Banks embracing FinTech - the end of innovation teams? SupTech - say hello to your new tech-driven regulator? Open Banking - aggregating your banking data with your favourite tech firm? Voice as a user interface - is Alexa your new banker? FinTech arbitrage - build in the West and sell in the East? Fraud and cybersecurity - avoiding bad apples and Black Swans?Certainly, I agree that 2018 will be the year that the regulators crack down on ICOs and cryptocurrencies or try to, at least. Pascal Bouvier, Venture Partner with Santander InnoVentures, has a slightly more negative view[5] of 2018, doubling down on his macro risks optics first discussed\u00a0in 2017[6]. Pascal believes that there is a strong possibility of trade wars between nations and regions, regulatory divergence, cryptocurrency risks, cyber attacks and such like. Not so cheerful, but useful to bear in mind. Meanwhile, I will say that one thing is certain in 2018, which is that cryptocurrencies valuations continue to rise (some say[7] bitcoin will exceed $100,000 soon), and regulators will focus upon these markets to try and lock them down. Happy New Year!

Themed 'The Centre of the Revolution', the conference brought together the leading lights of the financial service industry, VC funds and also technological innovators. Just under 4 000 delegates from 70 Countries heard from 422 speakers including leading lights such as Sir Michael Morris, Chairman of Sequoia Capital, Carlos Torres Villa CEO, BBVA, Nicolas Huss, CEO Visa Europe, Blythe Masters CEO Digital Asset holdings as well as the head of Mastercard, the VP of Amazon payments, the CEO of Visa, The COO of HSBC, the President of Alipay and the Global Head of Samsung Pay. The best FinTech start-ups in Europe also presented their products and pitches to the delegates. </p><p>Continuity for the event was provided by DJs who managed to dredge up every money-themed song published in the last few decades and The Rudimentals kept as entertained on the side-lines with their up tempo brand of music which set the tone for the pace of the conference. It is clear that the digital revolution in financial services is well underway but the impact on current banking main players is not yet fully understood. My top ten insights from Copenhagen were:The future of FinTech is already here and it is in China. AliPay (Alibaba's mobile payment wallet) already has 450 million active users. UX matters and it's all about the customer experience. If you cannot scale your FinTech start up beyond your home market then it's more likely to fail. MPesa was widely regarded as a failure by speakers at the conference. Banks view 95% of FinTech start-ups as enablers not as a threat. Not all banks are going to make the FinTech transition beyond 2020, some are not doing nearly enough to win the customer relevance battle. Consumers have more trust in their Tech Company than their bank. Tech Companies can do what banks do, more cheaply, more conveniently and with much greater transparency VR banking is coming, if Samsung has anything to do with it. The biggest FinTech opportunities for start-ups are: Insurance Tech (Top of the pops); Bring the bank to the customer; Human Interaction with the machine; AI; Reaching the unbanked; and Robo Advice.Bitcoin is not the future of banking but Ethereum may well maximise the use of Blockchain technology. Future trends: AI/Machine Learning (Payment Routing and optimisation, risk and fraud detection) Core Tech (biometrics, secure payment and digital identity), we heard about Selfies becoming a key component of KYC (Know Your Client).FemTech is strong, the President of Alipay International, CEO of Digital Asset Holdings, Global head of Samsung Pay and the head of the FinTech circle are all female The Coffee Collective in Copenhagen makes the best flat white in the world, after Rosetta Roastery at the Woodstock Exchange BanksThe move away from bricks and mortar to digital channels is accelerating at an unprecedented pace. A recent survey revealed that most consumers prefer a trip to the dentist than to visit a physical bank branch. Banks which are unable to rapidly innovate and switch their customer engagement channels fast enough will become obsolete. It's all about the culture and the ability of banks to become agile. ING and Rabobank have encouraged experimentation and for executives and teams to 'fail fast' and they have removed hierarchy, they treat failures as learning. Banks need to decide, do you want to be the tracks or the train? Great UX is seen as a critical component of a successful banking offering. Many believed that a special physical space is needed to enable innovation and to escape the traditional culture of the bank[2].Slide Credit - Ralph Hammers CEO ING GroupThe way banks tackle FinTech innovation will be critical to their future relevance and success, locally and internationally. The banks which are leading the way in innovation have a mix of their own internal incubators/accelerators and strategic FinTech Investment, some are partnering with FinTech Hubs and external accelerator/incubator's. Many are investing directly in start-ups which can fit into their value chain. Locally, Rise created by Barclays, sets a high standard in South Africa. At the conference ING, Spain's BBVA and Rabobank in Europe demonstrated a committed approach to Open Innovation and collaboration. The executive leading innovation in any bank needs to form 'a coalition of the willing' and ensure that they get out of the office as must as possible. It was widely acknowledged that banks which fail to acknowledge the impact of FinTech are putting their entire business at risk. On the upside for banks however is that overwhelmingly, consumers want their financial solutions to come from their bank. Research presented on payments revealed that trust in the entity which is providing financial services, is very important for the consumer. Will banks survive the new wave of FinTech innovation? The majority opinion in Copenhagen was that they would and that established banks would simply acquire the new players, however they would need to embrace open innovation and become collaborators. Doing so may stress the prevailing culture. Co-innovation and Open API's are also likely to be a critical success factors. Here are some recommendations for banks to come out of the conference:The window of opportunity is open - for now Invest in protection capabilities, for both banks and customers. Clearly define transformation and innovation agenda and road map. Innovate internally and through extensive partnerships with FinTech's. Maximise POCs/Pilots while minimising customer risk. Make customer access/trust a foundation of innovation and partnership strategy Don't let your accelerator become a Zoo for the banking Execs. What do consumers want from Banks?Consumer's fears are driving their desire for protection and millennials are just as fearful of the top risks as older consumers. The majority of consumers expect their bank to address these top four fears in the next two years[3]:Data theft Identity theft Fraud/Money theft Cyber attacks FinTech startupsFounders should always do a strong due diligence on investors. Ensure a culture fit and clarify expectations in advance especially around acceleration. A focus on the 'exit' is bad for everybody. FinTech start-ups need to ensure that they are sufficiently capitalised to enable a true scale up. Allow for a long time line before success, usually well beyond five years due to the regulatory environment and complexity of the financial services environment. Good corporate investors give credibility to start-ups too. Take corporate funding as late as possible. Capgemini's 2015 World Retail Banking Report found that, compared with traditional retail financial services organisations, many FinTech companies have a better feel for the customer experience and how to optimise it. They are also capable of using their expertise in innovation to reinvent banking in brand new ways. In addition, they are not burdened by the legacy systems or siloed businesses that tend to slow banks down. If you can combine VR and banking then Samsung are likely to come knocking. Ultimately this was the message for FinTech startups[4]:Rethink your exit strategy Partner to gain access to customers Get deep consumer input early and often Educate consumers to increase awareness and trust Focus significant energy on partnerships which are a necessity for broad customer access.And here's what consumers want from FinTech startups:Protection Personal Financial Management Mobile payments Personalised digital experience VCsCorporate VCs investing in FinTech start-ups doubled over the last year, and now make up one in four of all investors. Investment in financial-technology companies also grew by 201% globally in 2014, compared to 63% growth in overall venture-capital investments. All in all, it's pretty obvious that FinTech startups in the payment space are proving very attractive for VCs. The new threat - Big Tech and GAFA are comingThis threat is best summed up by a quote from the presentation by Elle Kim who is the VP of Samsung Pay: 'we can do cool stuff, we have access to the hardware'. Samsung's ability to create native payment ability with its handsets (without the need to open or access an App) is a distinct advantage. Mobile Wallet FinTech companies are likely to be the biggest losers as all the power moves to the mobile handset makers.Slide credit - Julian Skan, Accenture's managing director overseeing the FinTech Innovation Lab LondonGAFA (Google, Amazon, Facebook and Amazon) are seen as major players in the FinTech battlefield, the question is will they be collaborators or competitors. Traditional back-end platform support providers such as HP and Microsoft traditionally provided the platform, may become competitors[5].UXKeep it clean, simple and allow the customer to customise their own look and feel. Atom bank is an example of a company with a great approach to UX[6].Image - Atom bank Bitcoin, the Blockchain and EthereumBitcoin has reached a fork in the road, its pole position is being contested for the first time as Ethereum reaches a US$1-billion market capitalisation, forcing the community to redefine Bitcoin as it seeks solutions to scale. The Ethereum projects growth is directly attributable to Bitcoin scaling challenges. Whilst the Blockchain will have a profound effect on the developed world, title in the developing world will see a much bigger use case. Economist and former JP Morgan exec Blythe Masters believes that the banks will use the Blockchain to create greater internal efficiency and to cut cost.LegislationI had the feeling that once regulation started to change then the floodgates would open for FinTech startups. If you would like to understand how regulation is going to change in the future then read this press release[7] from the European Commission on PSD2, which suggests that new sets of rules will 'protect consumers better when they make payments, promote the development and use of innovative online and mobile payments and make European payment services safer.' According to commissioner Jonathan Hill, 'this legislation is a step towards a digital single market; it will benefit consumers and businesses, and help the economy grow'. I believe that this statement is most relevant as it is effectively legislating the use of innovation to improve the customer's banking experience. Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, responsible for competition policy, said: 'We have already used EU competition rules to ensure that new and innovative players can compete for digital payment services alongside banks and other traditional providers. Today's vote by the Parliament builds on this by providing a legislative framework to facilitate the entry of such new players and ensure they provide secure and efficient payment services.' When one considers the situation in Africa and the enormous amount of people who do not yet have any access to baking, remittance or payment services then the imperative for enabling FinTech regulation becomes obvious.Fintech: What's next for Africa?In closing, I believe that FinTech has a unique role to play in developing markets such as Africa. The reducing cost of smart phones and increased connectivity give us the opportunity to leverage mobile devices. The most successful applications are likely to be those which can partner with and find their way into the value chain of the big banks. Decentralised ledger technology such as the Blockchain may yet prove to be pivotal in areas requiring trust and transparency. We have a long way to go however before we become a cashless society, cash is still king when people do not have any access to financial services. Financial Inclusion is a basic human right and digital identity enables. India has a digital identity programme which is increasing financial access, we should follow that example in Africa. The development of Digital Identity applications offers enormous potential in Africa where KYC is constrained through lack of birth records and fixed address. However my view on KYC is that it is a big box ticking exercise with more CYA than authentication. 'Current ID authentication is built on a house of cards' was a strongly held view in Copenhagen. Anonymity will not be the trend of the future. The ship on privacy has already sailed and your personal data is already in the hands of all and sundry Bitcoin's inability to scale is seen as a major constraint to wider adoption and acceptance as a transactional currency. FinTech's ability to 'bring the bank to the customer' presents a big opportunity for start-ups in Africa. Skills are a constraint in Europe and a constraint in South Africa, especially those that evolve around the use of data and AI. Support for skills development in these areas, by big business and government are going to be critical if we are going to develop local capability. Lastly it was evident that Strong FinTech Hubs are critical to a healthy innovation infrastructure. This is an extremely condensed summary of some of the topics covered along with a few insights.

Themed 'The Centre of the Revolution', the conference brought together the leading lights of the financial service industry, VC funds and also technological innovators. Just under 4 000 delegates from 70 Countries heard from 422 speakers including leading lights such as Sir Michael Morris, Chairman of Sequoia Capital, Carlos Torres Villa CEO, BBVA, Nicolas Huss, CEO Visa Europe, Blythe Masters CEO Digital Asset holdings as well as the head of Mastercard, the VP of Amazon payments, the CEO of Visa, The COO of HSBC, the President of Alipay and the Global Head of Samsung Pay. The best FinTech start-ups in Europe also presented their products and pitches to the delegates. </p><p>Continuity for the event was provided by DJs who managed to dredge up every money-themed song published in the last few decades and The Rudimentals kept as entertained on the side-lines with their up tempo brand of music which set the tone for the pace of the conference. It is clear that the digital revolution in financial services is well underway but the impact on current banking main players is not yet fully understood. My top ten insights from Copenhagen were:The future of FinTech is already here and it is in China. AliPay (Alibaba's mobile payment wallet) already has 450 million active users. UX matters and it's all about the customer experience. If you cannot scale your FinTech start up beyond your home market then it's more likely to fail. MPesa was widely regarded as a failure by speakers at the conference. Banks view 95% of FinTech start-ups as enablers not as a threat. Not all banks are going to make the FinTech transition beyond 2020, some are not doing nearly enough to win the customer relevance battle. Consumers have more trust in their Tech Company than their bank. Tech Companies can do what banks do, more cheaply, more conveniently and with much greater transparency VR banking is coming, if Samsung has anything to do with it. The biggest FinTech opportunities for start-ups are: Insurance Tech (Top of the pops); Bring the bank to the customer; Human Interaction with the machine; AI; Reaching the unbanked; and Robo Advice.Bitcoin is not the future of banking but Ethereum may well maximise the use of Blockchain technology. Future trends: AI/Machine Learning (Payment Routing and optimisation, risk and fraud detection) Core Tech (biometrics, secure payment and digital identity), we heard about Selfies becoming a key component of KYC (Know Your Client).FemTech is strong, the President of Alipay International, CEO of Digital Asset Holdings, Global head of Samsung Pay and the head of the FinTech circle are all female The Coffee Collective in Copenhagen makes the best flat white in the world, after Rosetta Roastery at the Woodstock Exchange BanksThe move away from bricks and mortar to digital channels is accelerating at an unprecedented pace. A recent survey revealed that most consumers prefer a trip to the dentist than to visit a physical bank branch. Banks which are unable to rapidly innovate and switch their customer engagement channels fast enough will become obsolete. It's all about the culture and the ability of banks to become agile. ING and Rabobank have encouraged experimentation and for executives and teams to 'fail fast' and they have removed hierarchy, they treat failures as learning. Banks need to decide, do you want to be the tracks or the train? Great UX is seen as a critical component of a successful banking offering. Many believed that a special physical space is needed to enable innovation and to escape the traditional culture of the bank[2].Slide Credit - Ralph Hammers CEO ING GroupThe way banks tackle FinTech innovation will be critical to their future relevance and success, locally and internationally. The banks which are leading the way in innovation have a mix of their own internal incubators/accelerators and strategic FinTech Investment, some are partnering with FinTech Hubs and external accelerator/incubator's. Many are investing directly in start-ups which can fit into their value chain. Locally, Rise created by Barclays, sets a high standard in South Africa. At the conference ING, Spain's BBVA and Rabobank in Europe demonstrated a committed approach to Open Innovation and collaboration. The executive leading innovation in any bank needs to form 'a coalition of the willing' and ensure that they get out of the office as must as possible. It was widely acknowledged that banks which fail to acknowledge the impact of FinTech are putting their entire business at risk. On the upside for banks however is that overwhelmingly, consumers want their financial solutions to come from their bank. Research presented on payments revealed that trust in the entity which is providing financial services, is very important for the consumer. Will banks survive the new wave of FinTech innovation? The majority opinion in Copenhagen was that they would and that established banks would simply acquire the new players, however they would need to embrace open innovation and become collaborators. Doing so may stress the prevailing culture. Co-innovation and Open API's are also likely to be a critical success factors. Here are some recommendations for banks to come out of the conference:The window of opportunity is open - for now Invest in protection capabilities, for both banks and customers. Clearly define transformation and innovation agenda and road map. Innovate internally and through extensive partnerships with FinTech's. Maximise POCs/Pilots while minimising customer risk. Make customer access/trust a foundation of innovation and partnership strategy Don't let your accelerator become a Zoo for the banking Execs. What do consumers want from Banks?Consumer's fears are driving their desire for protection and millennials are just as fearful of the top risks as older consumers. The majority of consumers expect their bank to address these top four fears in the next two years[3]:Data theft Identity theft Fraud/Money theft Cyber attacks FinTech startupsFounders should always do a strong due diligence on investors. Ensure a culture fit and clarify expectations in advance especially around acceleration. A focus on the 'exit' is bad for everybody. FinTech start-ups need to ensure that they are sufficiently capitalised to enable a true scale up. Allow for a long time line before success, usually well beyond five years due to the regulatory environment and complexity of the financial services environment. Good corporate investors give credibility to start-ups too. Take corporate funding as late as possible. Capgemini's 2015 World Retail Banking Report found that, compared with traditional retail financial services organisations, many FinTech companies have a better feel for the customer experience and how to optimise it. They are also capable of using their expertise in innovation to reinvent banking in brand new ways. In addition, they are not burdened by the legacy systems or siloed businesses that tend to slow banks down. If you can combine VR and banking then Samsung are likely to come knocking. Ultimately this was the message for FinTech startups[4]:Rethink your exit strategy Partner to gain access to customers Get deep consumer input early and often Educate consumers to increase awareness and trust Focus significant energy on partnerships which are a necessity for broad customer access.And here's what consumers want from FinTech startups:Protection Personal Financial Management Mobile payments Personalised digital experience VCsCorporate VCs investing in FinTech start-ups doubled over the last year, and now make up one in four of all investors. Investment in financial-technology companies also grew by 201% globally in 2014, compared to 63% growth in overall venture-capital investments. All in all, it's pretty obvious that FinTech startups in the payment space are proving very attractive for VCs. The new threat - Big Tech and GAFA are comingThis threat is best summed up by a quote from the presentation by Elle Kim who is the VP of Samsung Pay: 'we can do cool stuff, we have access to the hardware'. Samsung's ability to create native payment ability with its handsets (without the need to open or access an App) is a distinct advantage. Mobile Wallet FinTech companies are likely to be the biggest losers as all the power moves to the mobile handset makers.Slide credit - Julian Skan, Accenture's managing director overseeing the FinTech Innovation Lab LondonGAFA (Google, Amazon, Facebook and Amazon) are seen as major players in the FinTech battlefield, the question is will they be collaborators or competitors. Traditional back-end platform support providers such as HP and Microsoft traditionally provided the platform, may become competitors[5].UXKeep it clean, simple and allow the customer to customise their own look and feel. Atom bank is an example of a company with a great approach to UX[6].Image - Atom bank Bitcoin, the Blockchain and EthereumBitcoin has reached a fork in the road, its pole position is being contested for the first time as Ethereum reaches a US$1-billion market capitalisation, forcing the community to redefine Bitcoin as it seeks solutions to scale. The Ethereum projects growth is directly attributable to Bitcoin scaling challenges. Whilst the Blockchain will have a profound effect on the developed world, title in the developing world will see a much bigger use case. Economist and former JP Morgan exec Blythe Masters believes that the banks will use the Blockchain to create greater internal efficiency and to cut cost.LegislationI had the feeling that once regulation started to change then the floodgates would open for FinTech startups. If you would like to understand how regulation is going to change in the future then read this press release[7] from the European Commission on PSD2, which suggests that new sets of rules will 'protect consumers better when they make payments, promote the development and use of innovative online and mobile payments and make European payment services safer.' According to commissioner Jonathan Hill, 'this legislation is a step towards a digital single market; it will benefit consumers and businesses, and help the economy grow'. I believe that this statement is most relevant as it is effectively legislating the use of innovation to improve the customer's banking experience. Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, responsible for competition policy, said: 'We have already used EU competition rules to ensure that new and innovative players can compete for digital payment services alongside banks and other traditional providers. Today's vote by the Parliament builds on this by providing a legislative framework to facilitate the entry of such new players and ensure they provide secure and efficient payment services.' When one considers the situation in Africa and the enormous amount of people who do not yet have any access to baking, remittance or payment services then the imperative for enabling FinTech regulation becomes obvious.Fintech: What's next for Africa?In closing, I believe that FinTech has a unique role to play in developing markets such as Africa. The reducing cost of smart phones and increased connectivity give us the opportunity to leverage mobile devices. The most successful applications are likely to be those which can partner with and find their way into the value chain of the big banks. Decentralised ledger technology such as the Blockchain may yet prove to be pivotal in areas requiring trust and transparency. We have a long way to go however before we become a cashless society, cash is still king when people do not have any access to financial services. Financial Inclusion is a basic human right and digital identity enables. India has a digital identity programme which is increasing financial access, we should follow that example in Africa. The development of Digital Identity applications offers enormous potential in Africa where KYC is constrained through lack of birth records and fixed address. However my view on KYC is that it is a big box ticking exercise with more CYA than authentication. 'Current ID authentication is built on a house of cards' was a strongly held view in Copenhagen. Anonymity will not be the trend of the future. The ship on privacy has already sailed and your personal data is already in the hands of all and sundry Bitcoin's inability to scale is seen as a major constraint to wider adoption and acceptance as a transactional currency. FinTech's ability to 'bring the bank to the customer' presents a big opportunity for start-ups in Africa. Skills are a constraint in Europe and a constraint in South Africa, especially those that evolve around the use of data and AI. Support for skills development in these areas, by big business and government are going to be critical if we are going to develop local capability. Lastly it was evident that Strong FinTech Hubs are critical to a healthy innovation infrastructure. This is an extremely condensed summary of some of the topics covered along with a few insights.

His Department of Justice made a more specific proposal[2] in mid-June. Clearly coordinating with the White House, Sen. Josh Hawley introduced[3] a bill that same morning, making clear that his 'Limiting Section 230 Immunity to Good Samaritans Act[4]' is essentially the administration's bill \u2014 as called for in the May Executive Order. </p><p>The administration is expected to make its next move next week: having NTIA (an executive agency controlled by Trump loyalists and advised by a former law professor intent on cracking down on tech companies) ask the FCC to make rules reinterpreting Section 230 to do essentially the same thing as the Hawley bill. These two approaches, both stemming from the Executive Order, are unconstitutional for essentially the same reasons: they would put a gun to the head of the largest social media websites, forcing them to give up editorial control over their services if they want to stay in business. The First Amendment would not allow Congress to directly require websites to be politically 'neutral' or 'fair': the Supreme Court has recognized that the First Amendment protects the editorial discretion of websites no less than newspapers. Both have the same right to decide what content they want to carry; whether that content is created by third parties is immaterial. Hawley's bill attempts to lawyer over the constitutional problem, using an intentionally convoluted process to conceal the bill's coercive nature and to present himself as a champion of 'free speech,' while actually proposing to empower the government to censor online content as never before. Instead of directly meddling with how websites moderate content, Hawley's bill relies on two legal sleights of hand. The first involves Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996. That law made today's Internet possible \u2014 not only social media but all websites and services that host user content \u2014 by protecting them from most civil liability (and state criminal prosecution) for content created by third parties. Given the scale of user-generated content \u2014 with every comment, post, photo and video potentially resulting in a lawsuit \u2014 websites simply could not function if Section 230 did not immunize them not just from ultimate liability but from the litigation grindstone itself. Hawley knows that all sites that host user content depend on Section 230, so he's carefully crafted a bill that turns that dependence against them \u2014 to do something the First Amendment clearly forbids: to force them to cede editorial control over their services. (Here's a redline showing how Hawley's bill would amend Section 230[5].) Second, Hawley claims that his bill 'protects consumers' by holding companies to their promises. In reality, it defines 'good faith' so broadly that 'edge providers' would face a constant threat of being sued under consumer protection and contract laws for how they exercise their editorial discretion over user content. Given the fines involved ($5,000/user plus attorneys' fees), a single court decision could bankrupt even the largest tech company. No one should have any illusion about what Hawley's bill really does: use state power to advance a political agenda. The bill's complicated structure merely masks the elaborate ways it violates the First Amendment. Conditioning 230 immunity on opening yourself up to legal liability under consumer protection law is a Rube-Goldberg-esque legal contraption intended to do what the First Amendment clearly forbids: forcing websites to host user-generated content they find objectionable. How the Hawley Bill Works Section 230(c)(1) says: 'No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.' These have been called the The Twenty-Six Words That Created the Internet[6]. When websites and services are sued for third party content they host, Section 230 allows them to cheaply get lawsuits against them thrown out with a motion to dismiss. Consequently, lawsuits are far rarer than they would be in a world without 230. Section 230(c)(1) ensures that those who create content are the ones to be sued. Courts resolve nearly all 230 cases under this provision. Republicans have insisted angrily that all of Section 230 was intended to depend on a showing of good faith, including political neutrality; however, the plain text of the statute is clear. Only Subsection 230(c)(2)(A) requires such a showing \u2014 and the statute's operative language doesn't mention neutrality. As Justice Neil Gorsuch recently declared, 'When the express terms of a statute give us one answer and extratextual considerations suggest another, it's no contest. Only the written word is the law, and all persons are entitled to its benefit.' Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S. ___ (2020). By proposing to amend Section 230(c)(1) to require both good faith and neutrality, Trump's DOJ and Hawley both concede that the President's Executive Order and other Republican clamoring for immediate legal action are simply wrong about the current state of the law. The real aim of Hawley's bill is to force the largest social media services to change how they treat content that serves the 'MAGA' political agenda \u2014 e.g., not labeling Trump's tweets, allowing far-right provocateurs to engage in bannable conduct, treating Diamond and Silk or Gateway Pundit as the journalistic equivalents of The New York Times. The bill is almost perfectly tailored to do just that while avoiding damage to smaller, alternative social networks favored by conservative activists for their 'anything goes' approach to content moderation. Hawley's bill applies only to 'edge providers': websites or services with 30+ million annual unique users, or more than 300 million unique global users, in the past year, and more than $1.5 billion in global revenue. To maintain 230(c)(1) protections, they would have to attest to 'good faith' \u2014 essentially, political neutrality \u2014 in their content moderation practices. Thus, an edge provider has to choose between two litigation risks: If it 'voluntarily' exposes itself to suit for the 'fairness' of its content moderation, it cedes editorial control to judges and regulators. If it surrenders Section 230 protections, it risks being sued for anything its users say \u2014 which may simply make it impossible for them to operate. Trump's Executive Order asks the Federal Communications Commission to collapse Section 230's three distinct immunities into a single immunity dependent on 'good faith' \u2014 and then define that term broadly to include neutrality and potentially much more. The Hawley bill does roughly the same thing by requiring large 'edge providers' to promise 'good faith.' Both would change the dynamics of litigation completely: A plaintiff with a facially plausible complaint would (1) prevail on a motion to dismiss, (2) get court-ordered discovery of internal documents and depositions of employees to assess 'good faith' (however that term is expanded), and (3) force the company to litigate all the way through a motion for summary judgment. Whether or not the plaintiff ultimately wins, this pre-trial phase of litigation is where the defendant will incur the vast majority of their legal costs \u2014 and where plaintiffs force settlements. Multiply those costs of litigation, and settlement, times the millions or billions of pieces of content posted to social media sites every day and you get 'death by ten thousand duck-bites.' Fair v. Roommates, 521 F.3d 1157, 1174 (9th Cir. 2008). That's why Judge Alex Kozinski (a longtime conservative champion once short-listed for the Supreme Court) declared: 'section 230 must be interpreted to protect websites not merely from ultimate liability, but from having to fight costly and protracted legal battles.' Id. Having to prove good faith to resolve litigation would kill most social media websites, which exist to host content by others. Ironically, it's possible that the best established social media sites with the biggest legal departments might cope; they might even be grateful that Hawley's bill had made it impossible for new competitors to get off the ground. At the same time, if (c)(1) is no longer an immunity from suit but merely a defense raised only after great expense, websites across the Internet would simply turn off their comments sections. Today, Section 230 doesn't define 'good faith.' Courts assessing eligibility for the 230(c)(2)(A) immunity have defined the term narrowly. See e.g., BFS Fin. v. My Triggers Co., No. 09CV-14836 (Franklin Cnty. Ct. Com. Pl. Aug. 31, 2011) (allowing antitrust claims); Smith v. Trusted Universal Standards in Elec. Transactions, 2011 WL 900096, at *25-26 (D.N.J. Mar. 15, 2011). Hawley's bill would add a five-factor definition of 'good faith' in a new Subsection 230(c)(3). These factors would give plaintiffs ample room to declare that an edge provider had been politically biased against them. Inevitably, courts would have to analyze the nature of third-party content, comparing content that had been removed with content that had not in order to judge overall patterns. To maintain 230 protections, an edge provider must also agree to pay up to $5,000 damages to users if it is found to have breached its (compelled) promises of 'neutrality.' Three hundred million users times $5,000 is $1.5 trillion dollars, exceeding the entire market cap of Google. The bill also adds attorneys fees, threatening to create a cottage industry of litigation against edge providers. The mere threat of such massive fines will fundamentally change how websites operate \u2014 precisely Hawley's goal. Perhaps most important is what the bill doesn't say: unlike Trump's Order, Hawley's bill doesn't directly call on the FTC or state AGs to sue websites for bias. But make no mistake; his bill would weaponize federal and state consumer protection laws to allow politicians to coerce social media into favoring their side of the culture wars. The FTC might hesitate to bring such suits, because of all the constitutional problems discussed below, but multiple Republican attorneys general have already made political hay out of grandstanding against[7] 'liberal San Francisco tech giants.' They would surely use Hawley's bill to harass edge providers, raise money for their campaigns, and run for governor \u2014 or Senate. A New Fairness Doctrine \u2014 with Even Greater First Amendment Problems The Original Fairness Doctrine required broadcasters (1) to 'adequately cover issues of public importance' and (2) to ensure that \"the various positions taken by responsible groups\" were aired, thus mandating the availability of airtime to those seeking to voice an alternative opinion. President Reagan's FCC abolished these requirements in 1987. When Reagan vetoed Democratic legislation to restore them, he noted that 'the FCC found that the doctrine in fact inhibits broadcasters from presenting controversial issues of public importance, and thus defeats its own purpose.' The Republican Party has steadfastly opposed the Fairness Doctrine for decades. The 2016 Republican platform (re-adopted verbatim for 2020) states: 'We likewise call for an end to the so-called Fairness Doctrine, and support free-market approaches to free speech unregulated by government.' Yet now, Hawley and Trump propose a version of the Fairness Doctrine for the Internet that would be more vague, intrusive, and arbitrary than the original. In Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U.S. 241 (1974), the Supreme Court struck down a 1913 state law imposing a version of the Fairness Doctrine on newspapers that required them to grant a 'right of reply' to candidates for public office criticized in their pages. The Court acknowledged that there had been a technological 'revolution' since the enactment of the First Amendment. The arguments made then about newspapers, as summarized by the Court, are essentially the same arguments conservatives make about digital media:The result of these vast changes has been to place in a few hands the power to inform the American people and shape public opinion. The abuses of bias and manipulative reportage are, likewise, said to be the result of the vast accumulations of unreviewable power in the modern media empires. The First Amendment interest of the public in being informed is said to be in peril because the 'marketplace of ideas' is today a monopoly controlled by the owners of the market.Id. at 250. And yet, the court struck down the law as unconstitutional because:a compulsion to publish that which '#8216;reason' tells them should not be published\" is unconstitutional. A responsible press is an undoubtedly desirable goal, but press responsibility is not mandated by the Constitution and like many other virtues it cannot be legislated.Id at 256. 'Government-enforced right of access inescapably 'dampens the vigor and limits the variety of public debate.'\" Id. at 257. Critically, the Court rejected the intrusion into the editorial discretion '[e]ven if a newspaper would face no additional costs to comply,' because:A newspaper is more than a passive receptacle or conduit for news, comment, and advertising. The choice of material to go into a newspaper, and the decisions made as to limitations on the size and content of the paper, and treatment of public issues and public officials \u2014 whether fair or unfair \u2014 constitute the exercise of editorial control and judgment.418 U.S. at 258. The Trump/Hawley Fairness Doctrine would impose the very same intrusion upon editorial judgments of edge providers. In addition, determining whether a website has operated 'fairly' would be 'void for vagueness since no editor could know exactly what words would call the statute into operation.' Id. at 247. The Supreme Court upheld the Fairness Doctrine for broadcasters in Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U.S. 367 (1969), but only because the Court denied broadcasters full First Amendment protection: 'Although broadcasting is clearly a medium affected by a First Amendment interest, differences in the characteristics of new media justify differences in the First Amendment standards.' The same arguments have been made about the Internet, and the Supreme Court explicitly rejected them. When the Court struck down Congress' first attempt to regulate the Internet, the Communications Decency Act (everything except Section 230), it held: 'our cases provide no basis for qualifying the level of First Amendment scrutiny that should be applied to this medium.' Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U.S. 844, 870 (1997). The Court has since repeatedly reaffirmed this holding. While striking down a state law restricting the purchase of violent video games, Justice Scalia declared: \"the basic principles of freedom of speech and the press, like the First Amendment's command, do not vary when a new and different medium for communication appears.' Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Assn., 564 U.S. 786, 790 (2011). In short, Red Lion represented an exception, and even that exception may not survive much longer. Social Media Aren't Public Fora, So the First Amendment Protects Them The President's Executive Order attempts to sidestep the Supreme Court's consistent protection of digital speech by claiming that social media are effectively 'public fora' and thus that the First Amendment limits, rather than protects, their editorial discretion \u2014 as if they were extensions of the government: 'It is the policy of the United States that large online platforms, such as Twitter and Facebook, as the critical means of promoting the free flow of speech and ideas today, should not restrict protected speech.' The Order also cites the Supreme Court's decision that shopping malls were public fora under California's constitution in Pruneyard Shopping Center v. Robins, 447 U.S. 74, 85-89 (1980). But Justice Kavanaugh, leading the five conservatives, explicitly rejected such arguments last year: 'merely hosting speech by others is not a traditional, exclusive public function and does not alone transform private entities into state actors subject to First Amendment constraints.' Manhattan Community Access Corp. v. Halleck, 139 S. Ct. 1921, 1930 (2019). Pruneyard simply doesn't apply to social media. Trump's Order cites the Supreme Court's recent decision in Packingham v. North Carolina, 137 S. Ct. 1730, 1737 (2017) (social media 'can provide perhaps the most powerful mechanisms available to a private citizen to make his or her voice heard'), but omits the critical legal detail: it involved a state law restricting the Internet use of convicted sex offenders. Thus Packingham changed nothing: the First Amendment still fully protects, rather than limits, the editorial discretion of website operators under Miami Herald and Reno. Hawley's Bill Imposes an Unconstitutional Condition Hawley's bill turns on one underlying legal claim more than any other: that Section 230 is a special privilege granted only to large websites, and withholding it does not violate the First Amendment. The factual claim is false: the law applies equally to all websites, protecting newspapers, NationalReview.com, FoxNews.com and every local broadcaster from liability for user comments posted on their website in exactly the same way it protects social media websites for user content. The legal claim is also wrong. The Supreme Court has clearly barred the government from forcing the surrender of First Amendment rights in order to qualify for a benefit or legal status. In Agency for Int'l Dev. v. All. for Open Soc'y Int'l, Inc., 570 U.S. 205 (2013), the Court said that the government couldn't condition the receipt of AIDS-related funding on the recipients' adoption of a policy opposing prostitution (a form of compelled speech). Much earlier, in Speiser v. Randall, 357 U.S. 513, 518 (1958), the Court made it clear that denying a tax exemption to claimants who engage in certain forms of speech effectively penalizes them for that speech \u2014 essentially fining them for exercising their First Amendment rights. Using Section 230 to coerce social media companies into surrendering their First Amendment rights is no different. Consider how clearly the same kind of coercion would violate the First Amendment in other contexts. Pending legislation would immunize businesses that re-open during the pandemic from liability for those who might be infected by COVID-19 on their premises. Suppose the bill included a provision requiring such businesses to be politically neutral in any signage displayed on their stores \u2014 such that, if a business put up, or allowed a Black Lives Matter sign, they would have to allow a 'right of reply' in the form of a sign from 'the other side.' The constitutional problem would be obvious and in no way ameliorated by the 'voluntary' nature of the immunity program. Social Media Companies Can't Be Forced to Risk Being Associated with Content They Find Objectionable The case against unconstitutional conditions and public forum status is even clearer for websites than it would be for retailers or shopping malls, for two reasons. First, social media companies are in the speech business, unlike businesses whose storefronts might incidentally post their own speech or host the speech of others. Reno makes clear that websites enjoy the same First Amendment right as newspapers, and '[t]he choice of material to go into a newspaper, and the decisions made as to limitations on the size and content of the paper, and treatment of public issues and public officials \u2014 whether fair or unfair \u2014 constitute the exercise of editorial control and judgment.' Miami Herald, 418 U.S. at 258. Second, Pruneyard emphasized that shopping malls could 'expressly disavow any connection with the message by simply posting signs in the area where the speakers or handbillers stand.' But users will naturally assume speech carried by a social network reflects their decision to carry it \u2014 just as Twitter and Facebook have been attacked for not removing President Trump's tweets or banning him from their services. Disclaimers may actually be less effective online. Consider the three labels Twitter has applied to President Trump's tweets (the first two of which provoked the issuance of his Executive Order).<url normalizedValue=\"https://imgur.com/jymConcThe\">https://imgur.com/jymConcThe</url> first example[8] not only fails to clearly 'disavow any connection with the message,' it is also ambiguous: it could be interpreted to mean there really is some problem with mail-in ballots. Similarly, Twitter applied a '(!) Manipulated Media' label to Trump's tweet[9] of a video purporting to show CNN's anti-Trump bias. Twitter's label is once again ambiguous: since Trump's video claims that CNN had manipulated the original footage, the 'manipulated media' claim could be interpreted to refer to either Trump's video or CNN's. Although the label links to an 'event' page[10] explaining the controversy, the warning only works if users actually click through. It's far from clear to many users that the label is actually a link that will take them to a page with more information. Finally, when Trump tweeted[11], in reference to Black Lives Matter protests, 'when the looting starts, the shooting starts,' Twitter did not merely add a label below the tweet. Instead, it hid the tweet behind a disclaimer. Clicking on 'view' allows the user to view the original tweet:<url normalizedValue=\"https://imgur.com/Vf0kgYnAnd\">https://imgur.com/Vf0kgYnAnd</url> yet Twitter has still been lambasted for not taking the tweet down completely, a decision interpreted by some as an acceptance of the validity of such an extreme position. Further, disclaimers risk creating increased liability; indeed, they may trigger lawsuits from scorned politicians. For example, labeling (and hiding) Trump's tweets provoked issuance of the Executive Order. In the end, the only truly effective way for Twitter to disavow Trump's comments would be to ban him from their platform \u2014 precisely what the Hawley bill aims to deter. In this sense, the Trump/Hawley version of the Fairness Doctrine is hugely more intrusive than the right of reply in the original Fairness Doctrine; it puts edge providers in the doubly unconstitutional position of (a) hosting content they do not want to host and (b) being afraid even to label it as content they find objectionable. Why the Hawley Bill's Good Faith Requirement Violates the First Amendment To maintain 230 immunity, edge providers would be required to promise to moderate content in 'good faith' \u2014 which the Hawley bill defines very loosely as 'honest belief and purpose...fair dealing standards, and[no] fraudulent intent' \u2014 in other words, political neutrality (and more). The bill adds this to Section 230's list of exceptions: 'Nothing in this section shall be construed to impair or limit any claim for breach of contract, promissory estoppel, or breach of a duty of good faith.'' Thus, an edge provider's compelled 'promises' could be enforced by the Federal Trade Commission, state AGs, or private plaintiffs under various federal and state consumer protection laws and common law contract theories. These enforcement mechanisms raise slightly different legal issues, but they all violate the First Amendment in essentially the same way: state action interfering with edge providers' exercise of editorial discretion. Consumer Protection Law Can't Police 'Fairness' Claims Republicans used to oppose weaponizing consumer protection laws against media companies. In 2004, MoveOn.org and Common Cause asked the FTC to proscribe Fox News' use of the slogan 'Fair and Balanced' as a deceptive trade practice. Republican Chairman Tim Muris responded[12] pithly: 'I am not aware of any instance in which the [FTC] has investigated the slogan of a news organization. There is no way to evaluate this petition without evaluating the content of the news at issue. That is a task the First Amendment leaves to the American people, not a government agency.' Similarly, the Hawley bill would necessarily embroil the FTC, state AGs, and judges in 'evaluating the content at issue.' Media companies aren't exempt from consumer protection or antitrust laws, but the First Amendment makes suing them for how they exercise their editorial discretion extremely difficult, if not impossible \u2014 which is why the FTC has never attempted to police marketing claims about editorial practices the way it polices marketing claims generally. As Chairman Muris noted, general statements about 'fairness' or 'neutrality' simply are not verifiable. This is why the Ninth Circuit recently dismissed Prager University's deceptive marketing claims against YouTube. Despite having over 2.52 million subscribers and more than a billion views, this right-wing producer[13] of '5-minute videos on things ranging from history and economics to science and happiness,' sued[14] YouTube for 'unlawfully censoring its educational videos and discriminating against its right to freedom of speech.' Specifically, Dennis Prager alleged[15] that roughly a sixth of the site's videos had been flagged for YouTube's Restricted Mode[16], an opt-in feature that allows parents, schools and libraries to restrict access to potentially sensitive (and is turned on by fewer than 1.5% of YouTube users). The Ninth Circuit ruled:YouTube's braggadocio about its commitment to free speech constitutes opinions that are not subject to the Lanham Act. Lofty but vague statements like \"everyone deserves to have a voice, and that the world is a better place when we listen, share and build community through our stories\" or that YouTube believes that \"people should be able to speak freely, share opinions, foster open dialogue, and that creative freedom leads to new voices, formats and possibilities\" are classic, non-actionable opinions or puffery. See Newcal Indus., Inc. v. Ikon Office Sol., 513 F.3d 1038, 1053 (9th Cir. 2008). Similarly, YouTube's statements that the platform will \"help [one] grow,\" \"discover what works best,\" and \"giv[e] [one] tools, insights and best practices\" for using YouTube's products are impervious to being \"quantifiable,\" and thus are non-actionable \"puffery.\" Id. The district court correctly dismissed the Lanham Act claim.Prager Univ. v. Google LLC, 951 F.3d 991, 1000 (9th Cir. 2020). Websites can't be sued today for making statements that may sound like offering neutrality \u2014 contrary to Republican claims that they should be, and Trump's call for such lawsuits in this Executive Order. The Hawley bill implicitly concedes this point. But simply forcing edge providers to be more specific in their claims about neutrality will not overcome the ultimate constitutional problem. Puffery includes 'claims [which] are either vague or highly subjective.' Sterling Drug, Inc. v. FTC, 741 F.2d 1146, 1150 (9th Cir. 1984) (emphasis added). It would be difficult to imagine a more subjective marketing claim than one about 'good faith,' 'neutrality' or 'fairness.' Ultimately, the reason consumer protection law does not attempt to police marketing claims about neutrality is not their lack of specificity but their subjectivity.  In theory, the FTC might be able to base a deception case on certain very clear, objective claims about editorial practices; that category of deception, however, would be narrow \u2014 the use of human moderators to evaluate particular pieces of content or to decide which topics are 'trending,' or the application of community standards to elected officials, for example. These deception cases would do little to address the complaints of conservatives, and even such narrow complaints might be unconstitutional. Consumer Protection Law Can't Police Non-Commercial Speech The FTC can police marketing claims for being misleading to the extent they 'propose a commercial transaction.' Central Hudson Gas &amp;#38; Elec. Corp. v. Public Service Comm'n of New York, 447 U.S. 557,561 (1980); Virginia State Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U.S. 748, 762 (1976). Community standards documents do much more than that: they are essentially statements of values, comparable to Christian retailer Hobby Lobby's statement[17] that the company is committed to '[h]onoring the Lord in all we do by operating the company in a manner consistent with Biblical principles.' Such statements are non-commercial speech, which is fully protected by the First Amendment under strict scrutiny even when it is misleading. United States v. Alvarez, 567 U.S. 709 (2012). To overcome strict scrutiny, the government must show that the bill is (1) necessary to address a compelling government interest (2) to which the law is narrowly tailored, and (3) that the government uses the least restrictive means possible to address that interest. Reed v. Town of Gilbert, 576 U.S. 155, 163, 171 (2015). In Miami Herald, the court noted that Florida's interest in 'ensuring free and fair elections' was a 'concededly important interest,' but had to yield to the 'unexceptionable, but nonetheless timeless, sentiment that liberty of the press is in peril as soon as the government tries to compel what is to go into a newspaper.\" 418 U.S. at 260. The bill also fails on the second two prongs of strict scrutiny, If the Hawley bill passes, the Trump Administration will undoubtedly argue that edge providers' community standards are ads for their services. But when speech has commercial aspects that are 'inextricably intertwined' with other fully protected speech, that speech is generally fully protected. Riley v. Nat'l Fed'n of the Blind of N.C., Inc., 487 U.S. 781, 783 (1988). For example, corporate statements endorsing Black Lives Matter receive First Amendment protection even when embedded in marketing claims. Courts are generally reluctant to label content as commercial speech because that denies the speech full First Amendment protection. Although community standards and terms of service may 'refer[] to a specific product,' they in no way resemble traditional advertising \u2014 two of the factors courts assess in drawing the line between commercial and noncommercial speech. Bolger v. Youngs Drug Prods. Corp., 463 U.S. 60, 66-67 (1983). The third factor, the profit motive \u2014 which Hawley harps on in his public statements \u2014 is not dispositive: 'If a newspaper's profit motive were determinative, all aspects of its operations\u2014from the selection of news stories to the choice of editorial position\u2014would be subject to regulation if it could be established that they were conducted with a view toward increased sales.' Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Pittsburgh Comm'n on Human Relations, 413 U.S. 376, 385 (1973) (emphasis added). Pittsburgh Press makes clear that statements about the way publishers exercise their editorial discretion are fundamentally different from statements about the health benefits of drug products, for example. Even if a court decided to treat community standards as commercial speech, the government would still face an uphill battle. 'The party seeking to uphold a restriction on commercial speech carries the burden of justifying it,' Bolger, 463 U.S. at 71, n. 20, and 'must demonstrate that the harms it recites are real, and that its restriction will in fact alleviate them to a material degree.' Edenfield v. Fane, 507 U.S. 763, 771 (1993). Because the government's interest in regulating commercial speech lies in its misleading or false nature, it would have to show that statements about a website's editorial practices are misleading. General claims about 'fairness,' however, are simply not verifiable. Why the Government Can't Compel Disclosures about Editorial Policies Compelling edge providers to change what they say about their community standards violates the First Amendment even apart from enforcement of such claims. As a condition for maintaining 230 protection, the Hawley bill requires edge providers to (1) 'describe any policies relating to restricting access to or availability of [user-generated] material' and (2) 'promise that the edge provider shall design and operate the provided service in good faith.' The first requirement seems hands-off: it does not directly dictate what an edge provider's terms of service must say. But this is simply a trick of clever drafting: this requirement does not need to be specific, because the second requirement ('good faith') will, in practice, govern both. The two inquiries will collapse into one, allowing complaints about both the fairness of content moderation practices as compared to community standards, and the adequacy of those standards. As a result, companies would (1) make their community standards as opaque or unspecific as possible and (2) minimize transparency about content moderation generally (e.g., avoiding public statements or reporting on content removals). But relying on 'good faith' does not solve the compelled speech First Amendment problem. Suppose that, instead of suing to enforce Fox News' 'Fair and Balanced' slogan in 2004, Congressional Democrats had proposed a bill like Hawley's: just replace 'community standards' with 'editorial standards' and apply the bill to cable programming networks over a certain size. It would be obvious that the government cannot compel traditional media companies to 'describe any policies relating to [selection] of [programming] material.' By contrast, the government may (and does) compel food manufacturers to disclose ingredient lists and nutritional information. The First Amendment permits such mandates because they apply to statements of objective fact, not the disclosure of opinions. This is why the seemingly simple age-based ratings systems for video games and movies have evolved as purely private undertakings. Behind each label is an editorial judgment, an opinion, about how to apply rating criteria. The government can compel neither the rating system overall, nor specific disclosures about the contents of specific films, nor disclosure of the rating methodology. By the same token, it cannot compel websites to disclose their editorial methodologies, whether implemented by humans or algorithms. Brown, 131 S. Ct. at 2740. The Hawley Bill Is Designed to Chill the Exercise of Editorial Discretion The Hawley bill proposes four criteria for assessing a website's 'good faith.' The first two concern 'selective enforcement,' whether by humans or algorithms. But what purports to be a regulation only of marketing claims would actually, inevitably embroil regulators and/or judges in evaluating the editorial discretion of edge providers \u2014 conduct that would clearly qualify for the full protection of the First Amendment as non-commercial speech under Miami Herald. Twitter's alleged political bias in applying its community standards is no more actionable under consumer protection law than would be Fox News' political bias in its editorial policies. The third criterion \u2014 'the intentional failure to honor a public or private promise made by, or on behalf of, the provider' \u2014 appears to preserve consumer protection claims, but its aim is significantly broader. In Barnes v. Yahoo!, Inc., 565 F.3d 560 (9th Cir. 2009), the court allowed the plaintiff's suit against Yahoo! to proceed. Barnes sued the company for failing to stop her ex-boyfriend from posting revenge porn. The court ruled that the company had essentially waived its Section 230 immunity when its Director of Communications promised the plaintiff she would 'personally walk the statements over to the division responsible for stopping unauthorized profiles and they would take care of it.' This promissory estoppel theory was limited to the particular facts of that case: a clear promise made directly to a specific user. The Hawley bill's 'public or private promise' language could be read to allow plaintiffs to set aside Section 230 immunity and sue edge providers for far more general statements about content moderation practices that would never qualify for promissory estoppel. By holding companies to every past statement, the Hawley bill aims to stop companies from changing their content moderation policies over time as new challenges emerge \u2014 a critical dimension of any company's editorial discretion. The fourth criterion \u2014 'any other intentional action taken by the provider without an honest belief and purpose, without observing fair dealing standards, or with fraudulent intent' \u2014 seems tailor-made for a law school exam on the 'void for vagueness' standard. In particular, it is considerably more expansive than the narrow standard the Supreme Court set forth in Central Hudson Gas Elec. v. Public Serv. Comm'n, 447 U.S. 557 (1980), for regulating commercial speech: 'there can be no constitutional objection to the suppression of commercial messages that do not accurately inform the public about lawful activity.' In other words, the Court allows the regulation of commercial speech only because of its effects, not its intent. Applying a subjective, rather than an objective standard, would make litigation significantly easier. Thus, this criterion would not be constitutional even if it were applied solely to commercial speech. But as we have already seen with the Fox News example, there would be no way to apply this standard 'without evaluating the content at issue,' as FTC Chairman Muris put it. The Bill Unconstitutionally Targets Specific Websites The bill applies to 'edge providers,' defined as providers of a website, mobile application or web application with more than $1.5 billion in global revenue and more than 30 million U.S. users or more than 300 million global users, that have accessed the site by any means in the past year. This tailors the bill to apply to just a handful of services: Google (Alphabet), Apple, Facebook (including Instagram and Whatsapp) and Amazon (the so-called 'GAFA') as well as Twitter, eBay, Microsoft, Apple, and TikTok (because the revenue threshold is global). Reddit, Flickr, and Etsy would meet the user thresholds but not the revenue thresholds. Wikipedia wouldn't be covered because it's a non-profit. What may at first seem like a sensible way to focus the effect of the bill actually creates a host of problems. First, it's possible that, despite posing an existential threat to 'Big Tech' companies, Hawley's bill could actually protect them from competition. By penalizing smaller market entrants for getting too big, Hawley's bill creates an incentive for small players to get bought-out by their 'big tech' counterparts before crossing Hawley's size threshold \u2014 big companies better equipped to handle the legal risks Hawley's bill would create. The bill's scope raises three distinct constitutional problems. First, singling out a small group of websites provides further reason for applying stricter scrutiny. 'Minnesota's ink and paper tax violates the First Amendment not only because it singles out the press, but also because it targets a small group of newspapers. And when the exemption selects such a narrowly defined group to bear the full burden of the tax, the tax begins to resemble more a penalty for a few of the largest newspapers than an attempt to favor struggling smaller enterprises.' Minneapolis Star, 460 U.S. at 591-92. Applying taxes only to large newspapers 'poses a particular danger of abuse by the State.' Arkansas Writers' Project, Inc. v. Ragland, 481 U.S. 221 (1987). Hawley's bill poses a 'danger of abuse' by focusing on only the largest social networks \u2014 all of the ones conservatives complain about being biased against them \u2014 while excluding sites with a laissez-faire approach to content moderation, where extremist right-wing content has been allowed to flourish, such as Reddit[18]. The relatively high revenue threshold excludes Reddit as well as other popular social media sites like Yelp (business reviews), IMDB (movie reviews), Fandom (a hosting platform), and Pinterest. The user threshold also excludes smaller social networks that have become gathering places for the Alt Right, like Gab (1.8 million monthly users[19] users) and Minds (1.25 million users[20] total). The bill might apply to websites for traditional media, but even this is difficult to predict. Websites the largest newspapers and cable channels all meet the monthly user threshold, but won't qualify for the revenue threshold if separate corporate digital divisions are treated as the 'edge providers' covered by the bill. In theory, it might be possible to 'pierce the corporate veil' to argue that the parent companies' revenue should be counted, but this is not what the bill says \u2014 which further suggests the bill is tailored to social media sites. In any event, including some large traditional media websites in its scope wouldn't come anywhere near making the bill broad enough to avoid the concerns of Minneapolis Star or Arkansas Writers' Project. Second, the bill applies only to a particular subset of Internet media \u2014 websites, apps and services that host user content, not services like Netflix or non Internet media. On its own, this all but ensures that the bill would be subject to strict scrutiny \u2014 which it would surely fail. See Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U.S. 622 (1994) ('Regulations that discriminate among media ... often present serious First Amendment concerns.'); Minneapolis Star Tribune, Co. v. Minnesota Commr of Revenue, 460 U.S. 575, 583 (1983) (a tax applied only to newspapers). Arguably, a bill that applied equally to all 'interactive computer service providers' would be less problematic because it would not single out a 'small group' of sites for what amounts to punishment. Abandoning user count or revenue thresholds would avoid the problem of retaliatory targeting, but additional First Amendment problems would remain. Hawley's Bill Would Backfire Against Conservatives It's impossible to anticipate, ex ante, the net effect of the law upon the decision-making of each social media service \u2014 i.e., whether they will do more or less moderation, and whether conservatives would actually benefit overall. The chief purpose of Section 230 was to avoid the 'Moderator's Dilemma,' created by Stratton Oakmont, Inc. v. Prodigy Services Co., 1995 WL 323710 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1995). The court held Prodigy more liable because it actively engaged in content moderation to create a 'family-friendly' service. If edge providers fear that removing certain content may increase their legal risks, they will moderate less. On the other hand, they may calculate that more moderation will allow them to claim a more consistent approach. That the same law could produce diametrically opposite results is not at all unusual in First Amendment jurisprudence. This is precisely the constitutional problem with vague laws: they are both unpredictable and highly subject to manipulation by those charged with enforcement. Empowering the government to determine political neutrality cuts both ways. Discouraging edge providers from moderating incendiary or abusive speech from the right will have the same kinds of effects on the left. Democrats will just as easily claim 'bias' when speech they like is removed. Consequently, social media sites will hesitate to take down content from extremist groups like Antifa or radical anti-police activists for fear that a Democratic FTCor state attorney general will sue them. More generally, if Republicans start suing edge providers for failing to deliver on the claim of neutrality required by the new Hawley bill, you could count on Democrats \u2014 when they have the chance \u2014 to start suing social media operators for not living up to other provisions in their community standards. Consider Twitter's Community Standards:<url normalizedValue=\"https://imgur.com/FXeFShyTwitter\">https://imgur.com/FXeFShyTwitter</url> has made an editorial decision not to remove tweets posted by President Trump that seem to violate all of these prongs (minus the one about child sexual exploitation). The First Amendment clearly protects their right to make that decision, but if the government could hold a company to such statements about its editorial practices, as Hawley claims, without violating the First Amendment, why couldn't a Democratic FTC make the same argument about Twitter not living up to its promise to enforce its community standards? Indeed, Facebook has been heavily criticized[21] by groups on the left for failing to do more to take down racist content that may even incite users to violence. For better or worse, the First Amendment prevents the government from forcing Facebook, Twitter or any other social media sites to change how they favor, disfavor, or remove user content. But if Hawley's bill were somehow to pass now, it could just as easily be used by a Biden administration to pressure social media sites to take down right-leaning content in the years it would take for the complex legal questions outlined here to work their way through the courts. The 'Problem' for Republicans Isn't 230, but the First Amendment In the end, Republicans' complaints aren't really about Section 230, but about the First Amendment. Yes, Section 230 protects websites from liability for user content \u2014 'death by ten thousand duck-bites.' Roommates, 521 F.3d at 1174. While the Hawley bill and Trump's Executive Order both make edge providers liable for what users say, this is only a means to an end; their real focus is not on the decision made by edge providers to host potentially unlawful content, but on their decision not to host content they deem objectionable. That decision is one the First Amendment protects as fully for websites as it does for newspapers or Fox News. Trump, Hawley and other Republicans would do well to remember what President Reagan said when he vetoed legislation to restore the Fairness Doctrine back in 1987:We must not ignore the obvious intent of the First Amendment, which is to promote vigorous public debate and a diversity of viewpoints in the public forum as a whole, not in any particular medium, let alone in any particular journalistic outlet. History has shown that the dangers of an overly timid or biased press cannot be averted through bureaucratic regulation, but only through the freedom and competition that the First Amendment sought to guarantee.Republicans should ask themselves: 'WWRD\u2014What Would Reagan Do?' The answer should, by now, be clear: 'Congress shall make no law' [ 1]: <url

Heartthrobs News out of the first Vioxx case to go to trial could not have been heartening for Merck (MRK:NYSE) fans.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Early evidence from Angleton, Texas, seems to be running against the Whitehouse Station, N.J., drugmaker. Merck sent a letter to doctors four years ago putting the painkiller's risk of \"cardiovascular events\" at 0.5%, The New York Times reported this week. But at the same time, plaintiff lawyers claim, documents submitted to regulators showed that 14.6% of Vioxx patients studied had heart problems.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Y'all didn't tell him the truth about the safety of Vioxx, did you?\" plaintiff lawyer W. Mark Lanier asked Merck's Nancy Santanello, referring to a letter sent to the doctor of a Vioxx patient who died. The plaintiff, Carol Ernst, alleges Vioxx caused the May 2001 death of her 59-year-old husband, Robert, after he had taken it for eight months to ease pain in his hands. Merck faces 4,100 lawsuits over its heavy promotion of Vioxx before it pulled the drug last fall over a link to heart problems.</p><p>\"You know the way this is written is wrong, isn't it?\" Lanier continued. Dr. Santanello, a senior scientist at the drug giant, responded, \"It's not very precise,\" the Times reports.</p><p>Merck wasn't backpedaling for long, though. \"This is no new information,\" a Merck lawyer told the Times, adding that the plaintiff lawyer has \"taken data which the whole scientific community has had, and he has played with it in front of a jury, and in doing so he's clouded what's important.\"</p><p>Oh, the irony. Who would ever accuse Merck of playing with the data?</p><p>Dumb-o-Meter score: 90. The jury will let everyone know soon enough what's important, we figure.  \u00a0(Chart Omitted)<br/>\u00a0<br/>2. San Andreas Fault Video game maker Take-Two (TTWO:Nasdaq) was humming a new tune this week after an industry panel slapped its equivalent of an X rating on the company's Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas game.<br/>The Entertainment Software Rating Board said players can use a file downloaded off the Internet -- the so-called hot coffee mod -- to view sex scenes on the disk. The board assigned the game its uncoveted adults-only rating, spurring big retailers such as Best Buy (BBY:NYSE) to yank the title. Take-Two shares tumbled after the company said its earnings would get hit.</p><p>Controversy is hardly new for Take-Two or its Rockstar unit, which cultivates an outlaw image. \"Rockstar proves that not all developers are concerned with toning down the violence in their games,\" an Amazon.com review of an earlier Grand Theft Auto game says. \"This sequel is even more bloody, violent and sadistic than its popular predecessors, offering up an enormous 3-D city in which nearly any criminal act is possible.\" Asked a few years back by The Washington Post about negative reactions to the violence, a Rockstar spokesman replied, \"Seven million copies worldwide doesn't seem like much negative feedback.\"</p><p>So last week, when critics took aim at the San Andreas sex scene, Take-Two held the line, suggesting that the modification was created by outsiders. But by Wednesday, Take-Two had had enough. Though conceding that the scene was company-created and was simply unscrambled by the modifications, Take-Two said it would be newly vigilant about game modifiers.</p><p>\"We are deeply concerned that the publicity surrounding these unauthorized modifications has caused the game to be misrepresented to the public and has detracted from the creative merits of this award-winning product,\" CEO Paul Eibeler said, vowing to explore \"legal options.\" The press release also makes a most unusual appeal: \"Rockstar encourages parent groups and political leaders to assist with distribution of the patch to prevent the content of the modification from spreading further.\"</p><p>This might be the first time Rockstar has encouraged parents and politicians to do anything but back off.</p><p>Dumb-o-Meter score: 82. Funny how Take-Two didn't call those modifications a problem till the game got banned by big retailers. \u00a0(Chart Omitted)<br/>\u00a0<br/>3. Digital Divide The picture isn't getting any prettier at Kodak (EK:NYSE).<br/>The unraveling of the company's traditional film business was exposed once again this week. For the second straight quarter, Kodak posted earnings that fell far short of Wall Street's estimates. \"Sales of our consumer traditional products and services are declining faster than expected,\" said new chief Antonio Perez. \"While we are not in a position to control the rate at which traditional markets decline, there is a lot I can do about the cost structure of the traditional portfolio.\"<br/>And indeed, Perez, who took over this spring for Daniel Carp following the first quarter's massive miss, laid out plans to cut as many as 10,000 more jobs. That's on top of 13,000 firings Kodak has made over the last year and a half. The company billed the overhaul as an effort to \"accelerate\" its \"digital transformation strategy.\"</p><p>Of course, Kodak is making other changes, too. Though the Rochester, N.Y., company \"remains committed to its practice of providing full and fair disclosure of its results,\" it's going to stop providing Wall Street with earnings guidance.</p><p>\"It has become increasingly difficult to provide per-share earnings forecasts with any reasonable precision as our business, and our entire industry, undergoes a complex and rapid transformation,\" Perez said. \"In light of this and our focus on the key digital metrics, I have decided to stop the practice of providing per-share earnings forecasts.\"</p><p>In light of Kodak having missed estimates by an average of 29 cents a share over the last two quarters, that's probably not a bad call.</p><p>Dumb-o-Meter score: 73. Tony, don't take our Kodachrome away.</p><p>To view Colin Barr's humorous video take on Kodak's refocusing and cropping, click here.<br/>\u00a0<br/>4. Ill Winds Flu bugs are having a field day with Chiron (CHIR:Nasdaq).</p><p>The Emeryville, Calif., biotech firm got stung this past week with another vaccine-making screwup. Chiron discovered that some of its Begrivac flu vaccine, which is made in Germany and sold overseas, was contaminated. The company slashed planned Begrivac shipments for next flu season by at least two-thirds, to 4 million doses or fewer.</p><p>Of course, Chiron has spent nine months trying to recover from an even bigger debacle. Shares plunged last October after regulators shuttered Chiron's Fluvirin plant in Liverpool, England, over a failed safety inspection. The move forced the company to write off its entire inventory of Fluvirin and halved the U.S. flu vaccine supply. The company has since cut back Fluvirin sales projections, and only now is the Food and Drug Administration inspecting the Liverpool plant to certify manufacturing practices there.</p><p>Chiron denies there's any link between the U.K. and German manufacturing problems. What's more, despite admitting it will record no sales of Begrivac during the third quarter, Chiron maintained full-year earnings guidance.</p><p>How does that work? Well, Chiron says it's moving to \"mitigate\" the impact of the reduced Begrivac supply on patients in the U.K. and Germany \"by reallocating non-U.S. vaccine doses among affected markets.\"</p><p>If that sounds slightly ominous and conjures up visions of a big company shifting vaccine supplies around solely for the sake of its bottom line, think again, a spokesman urges. Emphasizing that \"we have not made any decisions,\" the Chiron rep says the company is considering increasing production at other plants to make up for lost doses, as well as switching doses from non-European countries to make up the supply in the U.K. and Germany.</p><p>\"Our position is that we are not going to reallocate flu doses away from countries and leave them in the lurch,\" the spokesman says. He adds that Chiron is determined to \"do it in a responsible manner\" that won't \"leave any countries short.\"</p><p>That sounds nice, but we'll see how it works out.</p><p>Dumb-o-Meter score: 73. Maybe Chiron could avoid this sort of mess by running those vaccine plants in a more responsible manner.<br/>\u00a0<br/>5. Breeding Ground The American Stock Exchange was taking it on the chin again this week, but that didn't make them any less proud down on Trinity Place.</p><p>The Barclays Global Investors unit of Barclays (BCS:NYSE) said Wednesday that it would move its popular iShares exchange-traded funds to the NYSE over the next two years. Exchange-traded funds, of course, offer mutual fund-like diversification while still trading much like stocks.</p><p>Barclays' decision comes as a major setback for the Amex, which has increasingly depended on ETFs and similar securities as its common stock listings have plummeted.</p><p>Indeed, it has been years since the Amex was seen as the nation's No. 2 stock exchange, behind the NYSE. Big tech stocks, from Microsoft (MSFT:Nasdaq) and Intel (INTC:Nasdaq) to Dell (DELL:Nasdaq) and Cisco (CSCO:Nasdaq), famously chose the tech-friendly Nasdaq. And it was only last fall that the Amex surrendered the heavily traded Nasdaq 100 contract, then called the QQQ and now redubbed the QQQQ, to Nasdaq itself.</p><p>But Amex wasn't worrying about little details like that. \"We take great pride in the significant contribution we have made to the success of the iShares product line and our support of BGI's efforts to build their brand,\" said Cliff Weber, senior vice president of the Amex's ETF marketplace. \"The Amex has never been just a listing venue for ETFs, it has always been known as the premier breeding ground for innovation and intellectual capital in the ETF industry. We wish BGI well in their efforts.\"</p><p>We're sure the feeling is mutual.</p><p>Dumb-o-Meter score: 68. Yes, the Amex has long been synonymous with innovation and intellectual capital.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSC-#10233939#</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSC2005</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4GPB-W9W0-01HP-126M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">220623</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1601\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName> TheStreet.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19301\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><copyright>Copyright 2005 TheStreet.com, Inc.</copyright><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"07\" year=\"2005\"><dateText>July 22, 2005 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><className>MERCK &amp;

The majority of money invested in U.S. stock funds is now in index funds, according to Morningstar, and any US$100 going into an S&amp;P 500 index fund is automatically putting nearly US$18 of it into just those five stocks.</p><p>The trends mean investors are increasingly beholden to the fortunes of five companies. Consider last Thursday, when Microsoft alone accounted for two-thirds of S&amp;P 500 index funds' gains. These tech giants can carry just as much weight on the way down, and that increases risk for investors, particularly when the threat of additional, profit-reducing government regulation is hanging over the industry.</p><p>\"This doesn't have to correct itself immediately,\" Morgan Stanley strategists wrote in a recent report for investors, but they nevertheless see it as unsustainable.</p><p>The most recent time five stocks controlled this much of the S&amp;P 500 was during the tech bubble at the turn of the millennium. That bubble eventually popped, and stocks such as Cisco Systems Inc. and General Electric Co. shrank to become smaller players. Microsoft was also among them, but it has since climbed back to the top.</p><p>One difference between this time and the dot-com bubble is that many analysts don't see prices as grossly over-inflated now. Each of today's Big Five is producing strong growth even though the global economy has been stuck in a sluggish pace for years. Apple's earnings per share surged 19 per cent in the in the past three months of 2019 from a year earlier, for example.</p><p>Morgan Stanley sees the top 1 per cent loosening its hold on the S&amp;P 500 in one of two ways. The first scenario has investors deciding on their own to move their dollars to less-loved areas of the market, which would be a positive for the overall stock market. The second would be more negative: investors leave once the Big Five show they're unable to sustain their eye-popping growth.</p><p>Until then, the concentration at the top of the S&amp;P 500 puts more pressure on investors to keep their portfolios diversified, said Emily Roland, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management.</p><p>One of the tenets of investing is to have a diversified portfolio, where some pieces can zig when others zag in hopes of keeping the overall pot safer. An index fund owning hundreds of stocks may be less diversified than it appears, though, when the five most dominant companies within it can often move in a herd given how much overlap is in their businesses.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOBML-GAM20200208rbgiusstocks</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOBML2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6058-SV11-JCRP-C1H4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303830</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"519\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Globe and Mail, a division of CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.

Reports surfaced that users are bombarded with Holocaust denial when they search the phrase \"did the Holocaust really happen?\" That left the search giant with a dilemma: override the algorithm and the integrity of the product gets degraded while a damaging news cycle gets extended.\\n Government figures like the Clintons or Bushes or Henry Kissinger had allegedly attended the event.</p><p/></bodyText></abstract></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><h>FULL TEXT</h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A couple of days before the Future Today Summit at the 92nd Street Y in uptown Manhattan, a gunman walked into a pizza shop 230 miles south of it, fired into the air, and demanded to see the child sex ring in its basement. The basement didn't exist, and neither did the child sex ring, but the weird flattening of information that comes with leaving every fact in the world to an algorithm and occasionally checking in on it is very real, and it is here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's what led Edgar M. Welch to easily find a video on InfoWars called \"PIZZAGATE: The Bigger Picture,\" and text his friend to \"watch [the video] on Youtube\" a few hours before he failed to find the child sex tunnel behind the fridge where they kept the pepperoni.</p><p/><p>This whole thing really messed up the mood for the Future Today Summit, which would typically be one of those events where a guy in a hoodie proclaims that we can cure syphilis if only someone would completely dismantle the taxi industry.</p><p/><p>This time, a lot of the attendees were trying to answer one big question: How do we clean up firehoses of non-stop, fetid, feel-good lies like Facebook and Google and Twitter when the companies themselves have no obligation or desire to help?</p><p/><p>Sure, there was still the robot that 3D-printed chocolate and a corner full of people goofily stumbling around with a VR headset on, evading reality at all costs. The lineup was diverse and flecked with genius. A researcher from the New York Genome Center. The woman who helped make Watson and the guy who plugs it in.</p><p/><p>But then there were the conversations with people not making and breaking tech, but living with it, like academics, ACLU lawyers, government workers, and journalists. The tone of those conversations did not resemble robot chocolate and VR roses.</p><p/><p>One panel, dubbed \"The Future of the First Amendment,\" argued about the perils of asking for help from a private company with an even more private algorithm. Another argued that doing nothing is immensely worse. The ACLU's Jay Stanley argued at one point that another panelist was basically making a case for government intervention, even though nobody wanted government intervention. They all wanted more transparency from private companies, but no one really knew how to get it.</p><p/><p>Here's the takeaway from some of the leading experts in the fields where there is no longer such thing as a fact: You're on your own.</p><p/><p>And that might be the best way to fix it.</p><p/><p>--</p><p/><p>\"There's a lot of responsibility that falls on [Facebook] to figure out where they play in this new realm,\" Stacey Dixon tells me. \"Facebook will come out and say we're not a news organization, but a lot of people get their news that way. So, inherently, they may actually be one without really wanting to be one.\"</p><p/><p>Dixon is the Deputy Director of IARPA (Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity--think DARPA, but Intelligence, and around since 2006), whose boss' boss is DNI chief James Clapper and whose agency's goal is to \"deliver innovative technology for future overwhelming intelligence advantage.\"</p><p/><p>They recently lost a round to a dangerous combo of Macedonian teenagers, propagandists, and rogue idiots trying to stir up shit and load up a Paypal account with Google AdSense money by inventing outlandish clickbait. It likely swung a part of the election and drove a North Carolinian with a gun to a D.C. pizza shop. Life comes at you fast.</p><p/><p>But Dixon has thought plenty about it, and she understands the implications on national security. That's in part why she's here on a panel called \"The Future of Techno-Governing,\" And her solution for disinformation, once it reaches the consumer level, is this: We probably shouldn't be Techno-Governing a damn thing.</p><p/><p>\"You run the risk of the government becoming the bad guy because they're trying to shut down someone's speech. That's a very delicate line. It gets back to, I don't know that it is the government's role,\" Dixon said.</p><p/><p>\"I don't know that the government has enough bandwidth to actually start indicating, or start pointing out to all these companies, all the things they're doing that have created all these unintended consequences they had no idea about.\"</p><p/><p>The unintended consequences were supposed to be the good part, remember. We got plenty of books called things like \"Why the Global Culture of Disruption is the Only Hope for Innovation\" in the past half-decade. But now we've been fully disrupted, and all we got were these bullet holes in the ceiling of a pizza shop.</p><p/><p>The ethos of disruption culture was always <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">break it first, and figure out how to fix it later. </emphasis> We're in the post-break it society. We're at the fix-it point, and companies have no desire to do it.</p><p/><p>The people who are in the best position to stomp out disinformation campaigns are almost certainly the social media and search companies themselves.</p><p/><p>\"Internally, if there's data that's within a company that's (showing disinformation) having this impact, they're the ones better positioned to do this than the government is,\" said Dixon.</p><p/><p>Problem is, companies like Facebook and Google have no obligation to help.</p><p/><p>In fact, Facebook's only legal obligation--since the company went public in 2012--is to act in the best interest of their shareholders. That means increase user growth and advertising revenue. Addict your users, societal implications and ethical obligations be damned.</p><p/><p>When particularly disgusting roadblocks show up, the goal for these companies is not to do the right thing, but to minimize negative impact on the perception of their product.</p><p/><p>This week, Google was in that precise bind. Reports surfaced that users are bombarded with Holocaust denial when they search the phrase \"did the Holocaust really happen?\" That left the search giant with a dilemma: override the algorithm and the integrity of the product gets degraded while a damaging news cycle gets extended. Do nothing and conspiracy becomes fact on the world's largest search engine.</p><p/><p>Holocaust denial remains the top search result, because the dollar trumps the ethics. But don't worry, you can always pay Google to have non-factual and antisemitic information be bumped down a peg.</p><p/><p>\"I would imagine that there's enough feedback making it to (executive) levels (of tech companies). I'd be surprised if they had no idea their sites weren't responsible for some of these things.</p><p/><p>\"Do you not feel that some of them, though, are feeling somewhat responsible?\" asked Dixon.</p><p/><p>No. Probably not.</p><p/><p>\"You'd wonder whether the pressures of society have them do the right thing. That has, in the past, encouraged companies to stop doing some of the more nefarious things that have happened. There's the social pressure. There's government pressure--regulations. Then there's the moral responsibility of the companies. What I'm hearing is that maybe the moral pressure is not the highest priority. So maybe the social is the next one.\"</p><p/><p>In other words, again: It's on us. Obnoxious, persistent pressure on the people who can fix our broken technology gets results. It is annoying and it is wildly inelegant, but it works.</p><p/><p>--</p><p/><p>Facebook, feeling the heat of constant negative press surrounding the fake news plague that has besotted its website over past year, vowed to finally do something about it this week. They'll be assigning a scarlet letter to all stories that are made up of whole cloth. \"This story has been disputed by third-party fact checkers,\" the disclaimer will read.</p><p/><p>It's not a perfect solution, since right-wing blogs are already arguing that the capital-T Truth will now be at the discretion of a series of hand-picked fact-checkers, whom websites like InfoWars and The Daily Caller reflexively deemed to have liberal biases.</p><p/><p>It is, however, something. And the public outcry had Mark Zuckerberg changing his tune from \"99 percent of the content you see on Facebook is authentic\" to \"these steps will help make spreading misinformation less profitable\" in less than a month.</p><p/><p>This approach, however, has enormous holes, created mostly by regular people's love of bullying random strangers on the internet.</p><p/><p>While Dixon and I are speaking in the hallway, fittingly, Jon Ronson is taping a podcast episode inside the auditorium. Ronson wrote <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">So You've Been Publicly Shamed</emphasis> , about our new public pastime of ruining the lives of private citizens who do something insensitive or stupid and wind up in the heart of an internet outrage hurricane.</p><p/><p>That kind of outrage is extraordinarily dangerous for regular people. A dumb joke tweet that goes viral can make private citizens wholly unemployable.</p><p/><p>\"There's the responsibility of the individual to know what they're doing and know that there's a consequence for doing something,\" said Dixon. \"But if people give that feedback to these particular apps and particular services, that we're not going to continue to follow you because we can't trust you--that can have an effect.\"</p><p/><p>Weirdly enough, Ronson himself helped create the disinformation scourge entirely by accident, by going on a half-jokey field trip two decades ago. He and then-unknown Alex Jones went to the annual Bohemian Grove gathering, which is like a ritual sacrifice but with none of the death or fun and attended mostly by high-profile people.</p><p/><p>Government figures like the Clintons or Bushes or Henry Kissinger had allegedly attended the event. The two snuck into the festivities in 2000 for Ronson's BBC documentary show.</p><p/><p>Ronson believed it to be kind of a stupid frat party and forgot about it. Alex Jones parlayed the experience into an empire of Illuminati conspiracies and crackpot bullshit that served as one of Donald Trump's most effective opposition shops in the 2016 campaign. That empire is now called InfoWars, which Jones founded.</p><p/><p>\"That slapstick, that ridiculousness, is now defining our culture,\" said Ronson. \"Fake news, even if it did just reinforce people's beliefs, it is a dangerous thing. I don't believe the alt-right is any bigger than it was in the '90s. But now that you have Alex Jones and Stephen Bannon in power, their effect could be profound.\"</p><p/><p>And that's the difference: power. The government isn't going to help quiet disinformation because the executive branch of the United States government is going to be actively spreading it.</p><p/><p>Companies have made it clear they will only refine their platforms when their users speak out and don't stop.</p><p/><p>So it's on you. Organize. Protest for better platforms with a laser-focus. That's the only way to get stuff done in our new lazy dystopia.</p><p/><p>After all, a man who primarily complained about Robert Pattinson and another man's birth certificate on Twitter for the past decade is now the President of the United States. He was onto something.</p><p/><p>\"The question is not, 'What do we do now that we're in a post-truth society?'\" said David Litt, who's Funny Or Die's head writer and a former Obama administration speechwriter.</p><p/><p>\"It's, 'What do we do now that we have an incoming administration and their political allies who are very comfortable outright lying, and don't care if they get caught?' And how do we deal with that?'\"</p><p/><p>Outrage culture has fired some practice rounds and missed wildly, but the ammo worked great. It ruined lives of seemingly random private citizens. It had the country fixated on a poacher dentist for an entire month. Combined with disinformation, it put a man with a gun in a pizza shop.</p><p/><p>It is also capable of a lot of good, and it might be the only way to ensure transparency from the most powerful media platforms in the world.</p><p/><p>\"There are challenges that come with this and advantages that come with this. You see citizen journalism has been such a big issue when it comes to criminal justice. They've shined a spotlight on where police have acted terribly,\" said Litt. \"That might not have happened without (those platforms), and at the same time, fake news might not have happened.\"</p><p/><p>Outrage is the bastard creation of the tech companies who ignored their users' best interests in an effort to get them hopelessly addicted to their websites.</p><p/><p>Well, it worked. Now there's a lot of them, and they need some answers.</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYBST-1854821105</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYBST2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TKD-HDK1-DY0W-40S0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464369</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2139\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2016 The Newsweek/Daily Beast Company LLC</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Beast</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"12\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>December 18, 2016 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>THE 92ND STREET YOUNG MEN'S &amp;

Two aspects are worth noting.<br/>First, Sen. Warren's essentially calls for a return to the regulatory structure of \"the Gilded Age, [when] waves of mergers led to the creation of some of the biggest companies in American history?-?from Standard Oil and JPMorgan to the railroads and AT&amp;T.\" But the era's efforts to pull apart companies hardly make an exemplary record.</p><p><br/>The American Tobacco case and the resulting breakup of the company serves as a useful example. Regulators thought they could easily undo a set of mergers, which had created American Tobacco a couple of years before. But separating out the one company into its constituent three was doomed to fail because the company had tightly integrated all of its business processes. The protracted and messy eight-month breakup ultimately did little to change consumer prices or the value that farmers got for their tobacco leaves, according to historian Allan M. Brandt. The moral of the American Tobacco fable is simple: Breaking up tech companies would be a difficult and technically messy process.<br/>Further, government intervention often wasn't the decisive factor in limiting the power of companies during this time, and it often itself created the monopolies. In the history of oil in the United States, the discovery of the Spindletop oil field in Texas is typically cited as being more important than antitrust proceedings against Standard Oil. This event created both Texaco and Gulf Oil, which shifted the power away from Standard. As for AT&amp;T, it got a government-granted monopoly in 1913 that was later pulled apart by the Department of Justice.<br/>Second, the most interesting policy change in Warren's plan is one that hasn't received a lot of attention. In addition to breaking up the biggest platforms, Warren wants all platforms, regardless of their size, to engage in \"fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory dealing with users.\" The need to determine what these terms mean in this context would give a government agency the impetus to try to define them as broadly as possible.<br/>There is precedent for these concepts, however. The idea that companies must be fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory is one that stretches back centuries. Common carriage has its roots in ancient Rome and its modern application can be seen in the telecommunications space. The Federal Communications Commission has regulated radio waves and telephone lines for almost 100 years. Analysis of these legal regimes, however, finds that the laws are often inconsistently applied and often lead to distorted markets. If it were applied to platforms, as Warren wants, the effect would be much of the same.<br/><br/>                                 Permalink            <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://fedsoc.org/commentary/blog-posts/the-flaws-in-the-latest-proposal-to-break-up-big-tech\">https://fedsoc.org/commentary/blog-posts/the-flaws-in-the-latest-proposal-to-break-up-big-tech</url><br/>                                            Print                    <br/><br/>                                Email            <br/><br/>Facebook Share            <br/><br/>Twitter Share            <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-62579</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WG2-55B1-F03R-W551-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"520\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Federalist Society, USA All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Federalist Society</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 15, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00027NH</classCode><className>JPMORGAN CHASE &amp;

For example, The Weather Network currently gets 23 cents per subscriber per month, which adds up to almost $31 million a year given that there 11.1 million TV subscribers across Canada.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Three weeks into a sevenweek process, there are already more than 7,500 comments on the CRTC's website in support of Pelmorex Corp., the parent company of The Weather Network and M\u00e9t\u00e9oM\u00e9dia, as well as Entiempo.es in Spain.</p><p>One woman from Calgary says her seven-year-old child loves to learn about storms. Another from Richmond Hill, Ont., uses the channel to plan when she can take public transit to visit her husband in a nursing home. A Vancouver man constantly monitors the weather, but can't afford to upgrade if the channel is bumped out of the basic cable package.</p><p>The outpouring is big for such a staid regulatory proceeding - other channels facing renewal have received a fraction of the support so far. It's this engagement that Pelmorex's new chief executive Sam Sebastian wants to build on as he vies to compete for advertising revenue in the digital world against tech giants such as Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google- his former employer of 11 years.</p><p>Despite its passionate TV viewers, Pelmorex has its eyes on a different market as advertising dollars shift toward mobile app and internet audiences.</p><p>\"I love the fact that we've got such passionate users,\" Sebastian said in an interview last week, less than two months into his tenure at the top of the 28-year-old Oakville, Ont.-based company.</p><p>Sebastian moved to Pelmorex after 3\u00bd years as vice-president and managing director of Google's Canadian operations. When he was hired in July to succeed founder and president Pierre Morrissette, Pelmorex dropped the word \"media\" from its legal name and announced a transition into the data business, using its weather and consumer data to sell marketing insights to advertising partners instead of just airtime.</p><p>Pelmorex is a private company and doesn't reveal its finances. But executives have previously pegged its annual revenue at about $100 million, about 30 per cent of which comes from broadcasting. (Sebastian called these numbers \"a little historical.\") Yet broadcasting revenue is expected to shrink. Canadian conventional television advertising revenue dropped to about $1.55 billion in 2016 from $1.94 billion in 2011, down 20 per cent over six years, according to CRTC data.</p><p>Since Sebastian's September start date, Pelmorex has acquired Toronto-based Addictive Mobility, a 55-employee mobile data and media buying platform, and hired Rory Capern, former managing director of Twitter Canada. He said hiring Capern validates the company's new direction by proving it can attract talent from Big Tech.</p><p>Sebastian doesn't hesitate when asked why high-level executives would jump from two of the world's biggest tech platforms to run a weather channel, especially in an environment of escalating cord cutting and stagnation in the broadcast industry.</p><p>First, he said, Pelmorex has been successful at embracing digital disruption. He said it was one of the first channels to launch websites and mobile apps.</p><p>\"I don't think most folks know that we're one of the top four or five digital publishers and one of the top apps in Canada,\" Sebastian said.</p><p>About 25 million people use The Weather Network's various platforms, he said, adding the app has been downloaded by 10 million users in Canada, making it the fourth most popular app after Facebook, Google and Apple, according to comScore, a media measurement and analytics company.</p><p>All this online activity generates data, including a person's location when they check the weather. Pelmorex wants to use machine learning and artificial intelligence to analyze patterns.</p><p>It would then use this data to sell highly targeted ads if it notices, for example, a web user repeatedly checks the weather at a vacation destination or a mobile user is near an outerwear store when it starts raining.</p><p>\"Most folks recognize that digital advertising is driving folks in store, but very few can prove it,\" Sebastian said, adding that the Googles, Facebooks and Pelmorexes of the world are trying to figure out how to use data signals to prove digital ads get people in the door.</p><p>Weather data may be widely available, but Sebastian said Pelmorex owns its weather forecasts that keep users checking in repeatedly.</p><p>The Weather Network's user demographics mirror the census, he said, so the platform reaches \"pretty much\" everyone. (He added one caveat: Young teens are more likely to be found on Snapchat.) These users are willing to give up their personal data - including their location - so long as they get a good product and the assurance that their data won't be compromised, something Pelmorex takes very seriously, Sebastian said. It removes all identifying information from its databases.</p><p>But his second reason for joining Pelmorex has more to do with Google's market dominance in the digital advertising space - a problem that has left the media industry, including newspapers, grappling with declining revenue as businesses shift their advertising dollars online.</p><p>\"They had developed the scale, they had the people, they had the products, and it was difficult for many other local regional brands to compete. At some point, that just makes for an unhealthy ecosystem,\" Sebastian said.</p><p>\"That's why I loved coming here. I think I can help build us up so that we're the next best local alternative to Google and Facebook in this market. We just have to work harder, we have to be scrappier, we have to continue to build really good products, we have to make sure we keep building up our reach so that we have the scale.\" U.S. tech giants have thus far been the major winners of the explosion in online advertising, which increased to about $5.5 billion in 2016 from $560 million in 2005, according to the Canadian Media Concentration Research Project.</p><p>Google and Facebook captured nearly three-quarters of that revenue in 2016, up from about two-thirds in 2015, said Dwayne Winseck, a Carleton University professor and director of the research project. The pair captured all of the growth in internet advertising revenue in the past year and then some, he said, indicating smaller local players are losing ground.</p><p>\"The distance between Google and Facebook and everybody else in the field is enormous,\" he said.</p><p>But Winseck thinks Pelmorex has a shot at capturing more of the pie. He noted it's the second most popular news source for Canadians after the CBC, according to comScore data, and its internet advertising revenue is growing.</p><p>Plus, he added, political backlash to the consolidation of power by Google and Facebook may eventually lead to regulations that will help local advertisers.</p><p>For Sebastian, even capturing one or two points of the digital ad revenue growth would \"help build up a very strong Canadian brand so that we don't get swallowed up by a lot of the larger folks.\"</p><p>Getting a point or two is a goal shared by many across the media industry, which has faced structural declines over the past decade.</p><p>What was once a sector split into \"reasonably homogeneous\" segments of TV, radio, print, commercial printing and advertising services is now a collection of disparate business models, RBC Capital Markets analyst Drew McReynolds said in an October research report, and none is immune to the disruption.</p><p>\"Over the last decade, most Canadian media stocks have been rerated down driven mainly by deteriorating growth outlook as structural headwinds intensified,\" he noted. This environment, he added, \"leaves us largely on the sidelines in Canadian media the Canadian media sector.\"</p><p>But Sebastian is convinced he can make it work despite the backdrop. Plus, he and his family love Canada and wanted to stay.</p><p>\"We really like a lot of the momentum that's going on in the country, especially around the tech space,\" he said.</p><p>It doesn't hurt business that Canadians are obsessed with the weather. In Spain, where Pelmorex owns the leading weather service, online traffic and engagement dropped after a 40-day dry spell of perfect temperatures.</p><p>\"In Canada, you have so much variability across the country. There's kind of more reasons to be checking in to see what the state of the state is,\" Sebastian said.</p><p>The Weather Network sees increased engagement anytime there is severe weather, even if it's outside Canada, he said, noting a big jump in September as people tracked the hurricanes through the Caribbean and U.S.</p><p>\"It's a little weird when you kind of almost hope for bad weather because it has a good impact on business,\" he said.</p><p>Going forward, Pelmorex hopes to expand internationally, much like it did in Spain when it bought the leading network, Eltiempo Previsto SLU, in 2012. It's also open to more acquisitions similar to Addictive Mobility in order to improve its ability to mine mobile data and sell better-targeted advertising.</p><p>\"To give us that opportunity to be that next best local alternative to the big boys that I mentioned,\" Sebastian said, \"we have to have the products, we have to have the team, we have to have the thinking to compete with some of those larger players.\"</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:ejackson@nationalpost.com\">ejackson@nationalpost.com</email> Twitter.com/theemilyjackson</p><p>25M number of people who use The Weather Network</p><p>$5.5B Current value of Canadian online advertising</p><p>10M The Weather Network app downloads !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2017 Postmedia Network Inc.

Another from Richmond Hill, Ont., uses the channel to plan when she can take public transit to visit her husband in a nursing home. A Vancouver man constantly monitors the weather, but can't afford to upgrade if the channel is bumped out of the basic cable package.</p><p>The outpouring isbig for such a staid regulatory proceeding - other channels facing renewal have received a fraction of the support so far. It's this engagement that Pelmorex's new chief executive Sam Sebastian wants to build on as he vies to compete for advertising revenue in the digital world against tech giants such as Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google- his former employer of 11 years.</p><p>Despite its passionate TV viewers, Pelmorex has its eyes on a different market as advertising dollars shift toward mobile app and internet audiences.</p><p>\"I love the fact that we've got such passionate users,\" Sebastian said in an interview last week, less than two months into his tenure at the top of the 28-year-old Oakville, Ont.-based company.</p><p>Sebastian moved to Pelmorex after three and a half years as vicepresident and managing director of Google's Canadian operations. When he was hired in July to succeed founder and president Pierre Morrissette, Pelmorex dropped the word \"media\" from its legal name and announced a transition into the data business, using its weather and consumer data to sell marketing insights to advertising partners instead of just airtime.</p><p>Pelmorex is a private company and doesn't reveal its finances. But executives have previously pegged its annual revenue at about $100 million, about 30 per cent of which comes from broadcasting. (Sebastian called these numbers \"a little historical.\") Yet broadcasting revenue is expected to shrink. Canadian conventional television advertising revenue dropped to about $1.55 billion in 2016 from $1.94 billion in 2011, down 20 per cent over six years, according to CRTC data.</p><p>Since Sebastian's September start date, Pelmorex has acquired Toronto-based Addictive Mobility, a 55-employee mobile data and media buying platform, and hired Rory Capern, former managing director of Twitter Canada. He said hiring Capern validates the company's new direction by proving it can attract talent from Big Tech.</p><p>Sebastian doesn't hesitate when asked why high-level executives would jump from two of the world's biggest tech platforms to run a weather channel, especially amid escalating cord-cutting and stagnation in the broadcast industry.</p><p>First, he said, Pelmorex has been successful at embracing digital disruption.</p><p>He said it was one of the first channels to launch websites and mobile apps.</p><p>\"I don't think most folks know that we're one of the top four or five digital publishers and one of the top apps in Canada,\" Sebastian said.</p><p>About 25 million people use The Weather Network's various platforms, he said, adding the app has been downloaded by 10 million users in Canada, making it the fourth most-popular app after Facebook, Google and Apple, according to comScore, an analytics company.</p><p>All this online activity generates data, including a person's location when they check the weather. Pelmorex wants to use machine learning and artificial intelligence to analyze patterns. It would then use this data to sell highly targeted ads if it notices, for example, a web user repeatedly checks the weather at a vacation destination or a mobile user is near an outerwear store when it starts raining.</p><p>\"Most folks recognize that digital advertising is driving folks in store, but very few can prove it,\" Sebastian said, adding that the Googles, Facebooks and Pelmorexes of the world are trying to figure out how to use data signals to prove digital ads get people in the door.</p><p>Weather data may be widely available, but Sebastian said Pelmorex owns its forecasts that keep users checking in repeatedly.</p><p>The Weather Network's user demographics mirror the census, he said, so the platform reaches \"pretty much\" everyone. (He added one caveat: Young teens are more likely to be found on Snapchat.)</p><p>These users are willing to give up their personal data - including their location - so long as they get a good product and the assurance that their data won't be compromised, something Pelmorex takes very seriously, Sebastian said. It removes all identifying information from its databases.</p><p>But his second reason for joining Pelmorex has more to do with Google's market dominance in the digital advertising space - a problem that has left the media industry, including newspapers, grappling with declining revenue as businesses shift their advertising dollars online.</p><p>\"They had developed the scale, they had the people, they had the products, and it was difficult for many other local regional brands to compete. At some point, that just makes for an unhealthy ecosystem,\" Sebastian said.</p><p>\"That's why I loved coming here.</p><p>I think I can help build us up so that we're the next best local alternative to Google and Facebook in this market.</p><p>We just have to work harder, we have to be scrappier, we have to continue to build really good products, we have to make sure we keep building up our reach so that we have the scale.\" U.S. tech giants have thus far been the major winners of the explosion in online advertising, which increased to about $5.5 billion in 2016 from $560 million in 2005, according to the Canadian Media Concentration Research Project. Google and Facebook captured nearly three-quarters of that revenue in 2016, up from about two-thirds in 2015, said Dwayne Winseck, a Carleton University professor and director of the research project. The pair captured all of the growth in internet advertising revenue in the past year and then some, he said, indicating smaller local players are losing ground.</p><p>\"The distance between Google and Facebook and everybody else in the field is enormous,\" he said.</p><p>But Winseck thinks Pelmorex has a shot at capturing more of the pie. He noted it's the second most popular news source for Canadians after the CBC, according to comScore data, and its internet advertising revenue is growing.</p><p>Plus, he added, political backlash to the consolidation of power by Google and Facebook may eventually lead to regulations that will help local advertisers.</p><p>For Sebastian, even capturing one or two points of the digital ad revenue growth would \"help build up a very strong Canadian brand so that we don't get swallowed up by a lot of the larger folks.\"</p><p>Getting a point or two is a goal shared by many across the media industry, which has faced structural declines over the past decade. But Sebastian is convinced he can make it work in despite the backdrop.</p><p>\"We really like a lot of the momentum that's going on in the country, especially around the tech space,\" he said.</p><p>It doesn't hurt business that Canadians are obsessed with the weather.</p><p>\"In Canada, you have so much variability across the country, there's kind of more reasons to be checking in to see what the state of the state is,\" Sebastian said. <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:ejackson@nationalpost.com\">ejackson@nationalpost.com</email> !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2017 Sun Media Corporation.

Another from Richmond Hill, Ont., uses the channel to plan when she can take public transit to visit her husband in a nursing home. A Vancouver man constantly monitors the weather, but can't afford to upgrade if the channel is bumped out of the basic cable package.</p><p>The outpouring is big for such a staid regulatory proceeding - other channels facing renewal have received a fraction of the support so far. It's this engagement that Pelmorex's new chief executive Sam Sebastian wants to build on as he vies to compete for advertising revenue in the digital world against tech giants such as Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google- his former employer of 11 years.</p><p>Despite its passionate TV viewers, Pelmorex has its eyes on a different market as advertising dollars shift toward mobile app and internet audiences.</p><p>\"I love the fact that we've got such passionate users,\" Sebastian said in an interview last week, less than two months into his tenure at the top of the 28-year-old Oakville, Ont.-based company.</p><p>Sebastian moved to Pelmorex after three and a half years as vicepresident and managing director of Google's Canadian operations. When he was hired in July to succeed founder and president Pierre Morrissette, Pelmorex dropped the word \"media\" from its legal name and announced a transition into the data business, using its weather and consumer data to sell marketing insights to advertising partners instead of just airtime.</p><p>Pelmorex is a private company and doesn't reveal its finances. But executives have previously pegged its annual revenue at about $100 million, about 30 per cent of which comes from broadcasting. (Sebastian called these numbers \"a little historical.\") Yet broadcasting revenue is expected to shrink. Canadian conventional television advertising revenue dropped to about $1.55 billion in 2016 from $1.94 billion in 2011, down 20 per cent over six years, according to CRTC data.</p><p>Since Sebastian's September start date, Pelmorex has acquired Toronto-based Addictive Mobility, a 55-employee mobile data and media buying platform, and hired Rory Capern, former managing director of Twitter Canada.</p><p>He said hiring Capern validates the company's new direction by proving it can attract talent from Big Tech.</p><p>Sebastian doesn't hesitate when asked why high-level executives would jump from two of the world's biggest tech platforms to run a weather channel, especially amid escalating cord-cutting and stagnation in the broadcast industry.</p><p>First, he said, Pelmorex has been successful at embracing digital disruption.</p><p>He said it was one of the first channels to launch websites and mobile apps.</p><p>\"I don't think most folks know that we're one of the top four or five digital publishers and one of the top apps in Canada,\" Sebastian said.</p><p>About 25 million people use The Weather Network's various platforms, he said, adding the app has been downloaded by 10 million users in Canada, making it the fourth most-popular app after Facebook, Google and Apple, according to comScore, an analytics company.</p><p>All this online activity generates data, including a person's location when they check the weather. Pelmorex wants to use machine learning and artificial intelligence to analyze patterns. It would then use this data to sell highly targeted ads if it notices, for example, a web user repeatedly checks the weather at a vacation destination or a mobile user is near an outerwear store when it starts raining.</p><p>\"Most folks recognize that digital advertising is driving folks in store, but very few can prove it,\" Sebastian said, adding that the Googles, Facebooks and Pelmorexes of the world are trying to figure out how to use data signals to prove digital ads get people in the door.</p><p>Weather data may be widely available, but Sebastian said Pelmorex owns its forecasts that keep users checking in repeatedly.</p><p>The Weather Network's user demographics mirror the census, he said, so the platform reaches \"pretty much\" everyone. (He added one caveat: Young teens are more likely to be found on Snapchat.)</p><p>These users are willing to give up their personal data - including their location - so long as they get a good product and the assurance that their data won't be compromised, something Pelmorex takes very seriously, Sebastian said. It removes all identifying information from its databases.</p><p>But his second reason for joining Pelmorex has more to do with Google's market dominance in the digital advertising space - a problem that has left the media industry, including newspapers, grappling with declining revenue as businesses shift their advertising dollars online.</p><p>\"They had developed the scale, they had the people, they had the products, and it was difficult for many other local regional brands to compete. At some point, that just makes for an unhealthy ecosystem,\" Sebastian said.</p><p>\"That's why I loved coming here.</p><p>I think I can help build us up so that we're the next best local alternative to Google and Facebook in this market. We just have to work harder, we have to be scrappier, we have to continue to build really good products, we have to make sure we keep building up our reach so that we have the scale.\" U.S. tech giants have thus far been the major winners of the explosion in online advertising, which increased to about $5.5 billion in 2016 from $560 million in 2005, according to the Canadian Media Concentration Research Project. Google and Facebook captured nearly three-quarters of that revenue in 2016, up from about two-thirds in 2015, said Dwayne Winseck, a Carleton University professor and director of the research project. The pair captured all of the growth in internet advertising revenue in the past year and then some, he said, indicating smaller local players are losing ground.</p><p>\"The distance between Google and Facebook and everybody else in the field is enormous,\" he said.</p><p>But Winseck thinks Pelmorex has a shot at capturing more of the pie. He noted it's the second most popular news source for Canadians after the CBC, according to comScore data, and its internet advertising revenue is growing.</p><p>Plus, he added, political backlash to the consolidation of power by Google and Facebook may eventually lead to regulations that will help local advertisers.</p><p>For Sebastian, even capturing one or two points of the digital ad revenue growth would \"help build up a very strong Canadian brand so that we don't get swallowed up by a lot of the larger folks.\"</p><p>Getting a point or two is a goal shared by many across the media industry, which has faced structural declines over the past decade. But Sebastian is convinced he can make it work in despite the backdrop.</p><p>\"We really like a lot of the momentum that's going on in the country, especially around the tech space,\" he said.</p><p>It doesn't hurt business that Canadians are obsessed with the weather.</p><p>\"In Canada, you have so much variability across the country, there's kind of more reasons to be checking in to see what the state of the state is,\" Sebastian said.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:ejackson@nationalpost.com\">ejackson@nationalpost.com</email> !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2017 Postmedia Network Inc.

For example, The Weather Network currently gets 23 cents per subscriber per month, which adds up to almost $31 million a year given that there 11.1 million TV subscribers across Canada.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Three weeks into a sevenweek process, there are already more than 7,500 comments on the CRTC's website in support of Pelmorex Corp., the parent company of The Weather Network and M\u00e9t\u00e9oM\u00e9dia, as well as Entiempo.es in Spain.</p><p>One woman from Calgary says her seven-year-old child loves to learn about storms. Another from Richmond Hill, Ont., uses the channel to plan when she can take public transit to visit her husband in a nursing home. A Vancouver man constantly monitors the weather, but can't afford to upgrade if the channel is bumped out of the basic cable package.</p><p>The outpouring is big for such a staid regulatory proceeding - other channels facing renewal have received a fraction of the support so far. It's this engagement that Pelmorex's new chief executive Sam Sebastian wants to build on as he vies to compete for advertising revenue in the digital world against tech giants such as Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google- his former employer of 11 years. fgfghfgh x8m fgfghfgh x8m Despite its passionate TV viewers, Pelmorex has its eyes on a different market as advertising dollars shift toward mobile app and internet audiences.</p><p>\"I love the fact that we've got such passionate users,\" Sebastian said in an interview last week, less than two months into his tenure at the top of the 28-year-old Oakville, Ont.-based company.</p><p>Sebastian moved to Pelmorex after 3\u00bd years as vice-president and managing director of Google's Canadian operations. When he was hired in July to succeed founder and president Pierre Morrissette, Pelmorex dropped the word \"media\" from its legal name and announced a transition into the data business, using its weather and consumer data to sell marketing insights to advertising partners instead of just airtime.</p><p>Pelmorex is a private company and doesn't reveal its finances. But executives have previously pegged its annual revenue at about $100 million, about 30 per cent of which comes from broadcasting. (Sebastian called these numbers \"a little historical.\") Yet broadcasting revenue is expected to shrink. Canadian conventional television advertising revenue dropped to about $1.55 billion in 2016 from $1.94 billion in 2011, down 20 per cent over six years, according to CRTC data.</p><p>Since Sebastian's September start date, Pelmorex has acquired Toronto-based Addictive Mobility, a 55-employee mobile data and media buying platform, and hired Rory Capern, former managing director of Twitter Canada. He said hiring Capern validates the company's new direction by proving it can attract talent from Big Tech.</p><p>Sebastian doesn't hesitate when asked why high-level executives would jump from two of the world's biggest tech platforms to run a weather channel, especially in an environment of escalating cord cutting and stagnation in the broadcast industry.</p><p>First, he said, Pelmorex has been successful at embracing digital disruption. He said it was one of the first channels to launch websites and mobile apps.</p><p>\"I don't think most folks know that we're one of the top four or five digital publishers and one of the top apps in Canada,\" Sebastian said.</p><p>About 25 million people use The Weather Network's various platforms, he said, adding the app has been downloaded by 10 million users in Canada, making it the fourth most popular app after Facebook, Google and Apple, according to comScore, a media measurement and analytics company.</p><p>All this online activity generates data, including a person's location when they check the weather. Pelmorex wants to use machine learning and artificial intelligence to analyze patterns.</p><p>It would then use this data to sell highly targeted ads if it notices, for example, a web user repeatedly checks the weather at a vacation destination or a mobile user is near an outerwear store when it starts raining.</p><p>\"Most folks recognize that digital advertising is driving folks in store, but very few can prove it,\" Sebastian said, adding that the Googles, Facebooks and Pelmorexes of the world are trying to figure out how to use data signals to prove digital ads get people in the door.</p><p>Weather data may be widely available, but Sebastian said Pelmorex owns its weather forecasts that keep users checking in repeatedly.</p><p>The Weather Network's user demographics mirror the census, he said, so the platform reaches \"pretty much\" everyone. (He added one caveat: Young teens are more likely to be found on Snapchat.) These users are willing to give up their personal data - including their location - so long as they get a good product and the assurance that their data won't be compromised, something Pelmorex takes very seriously, Sebastian said. It removes all identifying information from its databases.</p><p>But his second reason for joining Pelmorex has more to do with Google's market dominance in the digital advertising space - a problem that has left the media industry, including newspapers, grappling with declining revenue as businesses shift their advertising dollars online.</p><p>\"They had developed the scale, they had the people, they had the products, and it was difficult for many other local regional brands to compete. At some point, that just makes for an unhealthy ecosystem,\" Sebastian said.</p><p>\"That's why I loved coming here. I think I can help build us up so that we're the next best local alternative to Google and Facebook in this market. We just have to work harder, we have to be scrappier, we have to continue to build really good products, we have to make sure we keep building up our reach so that we have the scale.\" U.S. tech giants have thus far been the major winners of the explosion in online advertising, which increased to about $5.5 billion in 2016 from $560 million in 2005, according to the Canadian Media Concentration Research Project.</p><p>Google and Facebook captured nearly three-quarters of that revenue in 2016, up from about two-thirds in 2015, said Dwayne Winseck, a Carleton University professor and director of the research project. The pair captured all pair captured all of the growth in internet advertising revenue in the past year and then some, he said, indicating smaller local players are losing ground.</p><p>\"The distance between Google and Facebook and everybody else in the field is enormous,\" he said.</p><p>But Winseck thinks Pelmorex has a shot at capturing more of the pie. He noted it's the second most popular news source for Canadians after the CBC, according to comScore data, and its internet advertising revenue is growing.</p><p>Plus, he added, political backlash to the consolidation of power by Google and Facebook may eventually lead to regulations that will help local advertisers.</p><p>For Sebastian, even capturing one or two points of the digital ad revenue growth would \"help build up a very strong Canadian brand so that we don't get swallowed up by a lot of the larger folks.\"</p><p>Getting a point or two is a goal shared by many across the media industry, which has faced structural declines over the past decade.</p><p>What was once a sector split into \"reasonably homogeneous\" segments of TV, radio, print, commercial printing and advertising services is now a collection of disparate business models, RBC Capital Markets analyst Drew McReynolds said in an October research report, and none is immune to the disruption.</p><p>\"Over the last decade, most Canadian media stocks have been rerated down driven mainly by deteriorating growth outlook as structural headwinds intensified,\" he noted. This environment, he added, \"leaves us largely on the sidelines in Canadian media the Canadian media sector.\"</p><p>But Sebastian is convinced he can make it work despite the backdrop. Plus, he and his family love Canada and wanted to stay.</p><p>\"We really like a lot of the momentum that's going on in the country, especially around the tech space,\" he said.</p><p>It doesn't hurt business that Canadians are obsessed with the weather. In Spain, where Pelmorex owns the leading weather service, online traffic and engagement dropped after a 40-day dry spell of perfect temperatures.</p><p>\"In Canada, you have so much variability across the country. There's kind of more reasons to be checking in to see what the state of the state is,\" Sebastian said.</p><p>The Weather Network sees increased engagement anytime there is severe weather, even if it's outside Canada, he said, noting a big jump in September as people tracked the hurricanes through the Caribbean and U.S.</p><p>\"It's a little weird when you kind of almost hope for bad weather because it has a good impact on business,\" he said.</p><p>Going forward, Pelmorex hopes to expand internationally, much like it did in Spain when it bought the leading network, Eltiempo Previsto SLU, in 2012. It's also open to more acquisitions similar to Addictive Mobility in order to improve its ability to mine mobile data and sell better-targeted advertising.</p><p>\"To give us that opportunity to be that next best local alternative to the big boys that I mentioned,\" Sebastian said, \"we have to have the products, we have to have the team, we have to have the thinking to compete with some of those larger players.\"</p><p>Financial Post <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:ejackson@nationalpost.com\">ejackson@nationalpost.com</email> Twitter.com/theemilyjackson 25M number of people who use The Weather Network $5.5B Current value of Canadian online advertising 10M The Weather Network app downloads !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2017 Postmedia Network Inc.

For example, The Weather Network currently gets 23 cents per subscriber per month, which adds up to almost $31 million a year given that there are 11.1 million TV subscribers across Canada.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Three weeks into a seven-week process, there are already more than 7,500 comments on the CRTC's website in support of Pelmorex Corp., the parent firm of The Weather Network and M\u00e9t\u00e9oM\u00e9dia, as well as Entiempo.es in Spain.</p><p>One woman from Calgary says her seven-year-old child loves to learn about storms. Another from Richmond Hill, Ont., uses the channel to plan when she can take public transit to visit her husband in a nursing home. A Vancouver man constantly monitors the weather, but can't afford to upgrade if the channel is bumped out of the basic cable package.</p><p>The outpouring is big for such a staid regulatory proceeding - other channels facing renewal have received a fraction of the support so far. It's this engagement that Pelmorex's new chief executive Sam Sebastian wants to build on as he vies to compete for advertising revenue in the digital world against tech giants such as Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google- his former employer of 11 years.</p><p>Despite its passionate TV viewers, Pelmorex has its eyes on a different market as advertising dollars shift toward mobile app and internet audiences.</p><p>\"I love the fact that we've got such passionate users,\" Sebastian said in an interview last week, less than two months into his tenure at the top of the 28-year-old Oakville, Ont.-based company.</p><p>Sebastian moved to Pelmorex after three and a half years as vicepresident and managing director of Google's Canadian operations. When he was hired in July to succeed founder and president Pierre Morrissette, Pelmorex dropped the word \"media\" from its legal name and announced a transition into the data business, using its weather and consumer data to sell marketing insights to advertising partners instead of just airtime.</p><p>Pelmorex is a private company and doesn't reveal its finances. But executives have previously pegged its annual revenue at about $100 million, about 30 per cent of which comes from broadcasting. (Sebastian called these numbers \"a little historical.\") Yet broadcasting revenue is expected to shrink. Canadian conventional television advertising revenue dropped to about $1.55 billion in 2016 from $1.94 billion in 2011, down 20 per cent over six years, according to CRTC data.</p><p>Since Sebastian's September start date, Pelmorex has acquired Toronto-based Addictive Mobility, a 55-employee mobile data and media buying platform, and hired Rory Capern, former managing director of Twitter Canada. He said hiring Capern validates the company's new direction by proving it can attract talent from Big Tech.</p><p>Sebastian doesn't hesitate when asked why high-level executives would jump from two of the world's biggest tech platforms to run a weather channel, especially amid escalating cord-cutting and stagnation in the broadcast industry.</p><p>First, he said, Pelmorex has been successful at embracing digital disruption. He said it was one of the first channels to launch websites and mobile apps.</p><p>\"I don't think most folks know that we're one of the top four or five digital publishers and one of the top apps in Canada,\" Sebastian said.</p><p>About 25 million people use The Weather Network's various platforms, he said, adding the app has been downloaded by 10 million users in Canada, making it the fourth most-popular app after Facebook, Google and Apple, according to comScore, an analytics company.</p><p>All this online activity generates data, including a person's location when they check the weather. Pelmorex wants to use machine learning and artificial intelligence to analyze patterns. It would then use this data to sell highly targeted ads if it notices, for example, a web user repeatedly checks the weather at a vacation destination or a mobile user is near an outerwear store when it starts raining.</p><p>\"Most folks recognize that digital advertising is driving folks in store, but very few can prove it,\" Sebastian said, adding that the Googles, Facebooks and Pelmorexes of the world are trying to figure out how to use data signals to prove digital ads get people in the door.</p><p>Weather data may be widely available, but Sebastian said Pelmorex owns its forecasts that keep users checking in repeatedly.</p><p>The Weather Network's user demographics mirror the census, he said, so the platform reaches \"pretty much\" everyone. (He added one caveat: Young teens are more likely to be found on Snapchat.)</p><p>These users are willing to give up their personal data - including their location - so long as they get a good product and the assurance that their data won't be compromised, something Pelmorex takes very seriously, Sebastian said. It removes all identifying information from its databases.</p><p>But his second reason for joining Pelmorex has more to do with Google's market dominance in the digital advertising space - a problem that has left the media industry, including newspapers, grappling with declining revenue as businesses shift their advertising dollars online.</p><p>\"They had developed the scale, they had the people, they had the products, and it was difficult for many other local regional brands to compete. At some point, that just makes for an unhealthy ecosystem,\" Sebastian said. U.S. tech giants have thus far been the major winners of the explosion in online advertising, which increased to about $5.5 billion in 2016 from $560 million in 2005, according to the Canadian Media Concentration Research Project. Google and Facebook captured nearly three-quarters of that revenue in 2016, up from about two-thirds in 2015, said Dwayne Winseck, a Carleton University professor and director of the research project. The pair captured all of the growth in internet advertising revenue in the past year and then some, he said, indicating smaller local players are losing ground.</p><p>\"The distance between Google and Facebook and everybody else in the field is enormous,\" he said.</p><p>But Winseck thinks Pelmorex has a shot at capturing more of the pie. He noted it's the second most popular news source for Canadians after the CBC, according to comScore data, and its internet advertising revenue is growing.</p><p>Plus, he added, political backlash to the consolidation of power by Google and Facebook may eventually lead to regulations that will help local advertisers.</p><p>For Sebastian, even capturing one or two points of the digital ad revenue growth would \"help build up a very strong Canadian brand so that we don't get swallowed up by a lot of the larger folks.\"</p><p>Getting a point or two is a goal shared by many across the media industry, which has faced structural declines over the past decade. But Sebastian is convinced he can make it work in despite the backdrop.</p><p>\"We really like a lot of the momentum that's going on in the country, especially around the tech space,\" he said.</p><p>It doesn't hurt business that Canadians are obsessed with the weather.</p><p>\"In Canada, you have so much variability across the country, there's kind of more reasons to be checking in to see what the state of the state is,\" Sebastian said.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:ejackson@nationalpost.com\">ejackson@nationalpost.com</email> !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2017 Postmedia Network Inc.

For example, The Weather Network currently gets 23 cents per subscriber per month, which adds up to almost $31 million a year given that there are 11.1 million TV subscribers across Canada.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Three weeks into a seven-week process, there are already more than 7,500 comments on the CRTC's website in support of Pelmorex Corp., the parent firm of The Weather Network and M\u00e9t\u00e9oM\u00e9dia, as well as Entiempo.es in Spain.</p><p>One woman from Calgary says her seven-year-old child loves to learn about storms. Another from Richmond Hill, Ont., uses the channel to plan when she can take public transit to visit her husband in a nursing home. A Vancouver man constantly monitors the weather, but can't afford to upgrade if the channel is bumped out of the basic cable package.</p><p>The outpouring is big for such a staid regulatory proceeding - other channels facing renewal have received a fraction of the support so far. It's this engagement that Pelmorex's new chief executive Sam Sebastian wants to build on as he vies to compete for advertising revenue in the digital world against tech giants such as Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google- his former employer of 11 years.</p><p>Despite its passionate TV viewers, Pelmorex has its eyes on a different market as advertising dollars shift toward mobile app and internet audiences.</p><p>\"I love the fact that we've got such passionate users,\" Sebastian said in an interview last week, less than two months into his tenure at the top of the 28-year-old Oakville, Ont.-based company.</p><p>Sebastian moved to Pelmorex after three and a half years as vicepresident and managing director of Google's Canadian operations. When he was hired in July to succeed founder and president Pierre Morrissette, Pelmorex dropped the word \"media\" from its legal name and announced a transition into the data business, using its weather and consumer data to sell marketing insights to advertising partners instead of just airtime.</p><p>Pelmorex is a private company and doesn't reveal its finances. But executives have previously pegged its annual revenue at about $100 million, about 30 per cent of which comes from broadcasting. (Sebastian called these numbers \"a little historical.\") Yet broadcasting revenue is expected to shrink. Canadian conventional television advertising revenue dropped to about $1.55 billion in 2016 from $1.94 billion in 2011, down 20 per cent over six years, according to CRTC data.</p><p>Since Sebastian's September start date, Pelmorex has acquired Toronto-based Addictive Mobility, a 55-employee mobile data and media buying platform, and hired Rory Capern, former managing director of Twitter Canada. He said hiring Capern validates the company's new direction by proving it can attract talent from Big Tech.</p><p>Sebastian doesn't hesitate when asked why high-level executives would jump from two of the world's biggest tech platforms to run a weather channel, especially amid escalating cord-cutting and stagnation in the broadcast industry.</p><p>First, he said, Pelmorex has been successful at embracing digital disruption. He said it was one of the first channels to launch websites and mobile apps.</p><p>\"I don't think most folks know that we're one of the top four or five digital publishers and one of the top apps in Canada,\" Sebastian said.</p><p>About 25 million people use The Weather Network's various platforms, he said, adding the app has been downloaded by 10 million users in Canada, making it the fourth most-popular app after Facebook, Google and Apple, according to comScore, an analytics company.</p><p>All this online activity generates data, including a person's location when they check the weather. Pelmorex wants to use machine learning and artificial intelligence to analyze patterns. It would then use this data to sell highly targeted ads if it notices, for example, a web user repeatedly checks the weather at a vacation destination or a mobile user is near an outerwear store when it starts raining.</p><p>\"Most folks recognize that digital advertising is driving folks in store, but very few can prove it,\" Sebastian said, adding that the Googles, Facebooks and Pelmorexes of the world are trying to figure out how to use data signals to prove digital ads get people in the door.</p><p>Weather data may be widely available, but Sebastian said Pelmorex owns its forecasts that keep users checking in repeatedly.</p><p>The Weather Network's user demographics mirror the census, he said, so the platform reaches \"pretty much\" everyone. (He added one caveat: Young teens are more likely to be found on Snapchat.)</p><p>These users are willing to give up their personal data - including their location - so long as they get a good product and the assurance that their data won't be compromised, something Pelmorex takes very seriously, Sebastian said. It removes all identifying information from its databases.</p><p>But his second reason for joining Pelmorex has more to do with Google's market dominance in the digital advertising space - a problem that has left the media industry, including newspapers, grappling with declining revenue as businesses shift their advertising dollars online.</p><p>\"They had developed the scale, they had the people, they had the products, and it was difficult for many other local regional brands to compete. At some point, that just makes for an unhealthy ecosystem,\" Sebastian said.</p><p>\"That's why I loved coming here.</p><p>I think I can help build us up so that we're the next best local alternative to Google and Facebook in this market. We just have to work harder, we have to be scrappier, we have to continue to build really good products, we have to make sure we keep building up our reach so that we have the scale.\" U.S. tech giants have thus far been the major winners of the explosion in online advertising, which increased to about $5.5 billion in 2016 from $560 million in 2005, according to the Canadian Media Concentration Research Project. Google and Facebook captured nearly three-quarters of that revenue in 2016, up from about two-thirds in 2015, said Dwayne Winseck, a Carleton University professor and director of the research project. The pair captured all of the growth in internet advertising revenue in the past year and then some, he said, indicating smaller local players are losing ground.</p><p>\"The distance between Google and Facebook and everybody else in the field is enormous,\" he said.</p><p>But Winseck thinks Pelmorex has a shot at capturing more of the pie. He noted it's the second most popular news source for Canadians after the CBC, according to comScore data, and its internet advertising revenue is growing.</p><p>Plus, he added, political backlash to the consolidation of power by Google and Facebook may eventually lead to regulations that will help local advertisers.</p><p>For Sebastian, even capturing one or two points of the digital ad revenue growth would \"help build up a very strong Canadian brand so that we don't get swallowed up by a lot of the larger folks.\"</p><p>Getting a point or two is a goal shared by many across the media industry, which has faced structural declines over the past decade. But Sebastian is convinced he can make it work in despite the backdrop.</p><p>\"We really like a lot of the momentum that's going on in the country, especially around the tech space,\" he said.</p><p>It doesn't hurt business that Canadians are obsessed with the weather.</p><p>\"In Canada, you have so much variability across the country, there's kind of more reasons to be checking in to see what the state of the state is,\" Sebastian said.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:ejackson@nationalpost.com\">ejackson@nationalpost.com</email> !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2017 Postmedia Network Inc.

For example, The Weather Network currently gets 23 cents per subscriber per month, which adds up to almost $31 million a year given that there are 11.1 million TV subscribers across Canada.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Three weeks into a seven-week process, there are already more than 7,500 comments on the CRTC's website in support of Pelmorex Corp., the parent firm of The Weather Network and M\u00e9t\u00e9oM\u00e9dia, as well as Entiempo.es in Spain.</p><p>One woman from Calgary says her seven-year-old child loves to learn about storms. Another from Richmond Hill, Ont., uses the channel to plan when she can take public transit to visit her husband in a nursing home. A Vancouver man constantly monitors the weather, but can't afford to upgrade if the channel is bumped out of the basic cable package.</p><p>The outpouring is big for such a staid regulatory proceeding - other channels facing renewal have received a fraction of the support so far. It's this engagement that Pelmorex's new chief executive Sam Sebastian wants to build on as he vies to compete for advertising revenue in the digital world against tech giants such as Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google- his former employer of 11 years.</p><p>Despite its passionate TV viewers, Pelmorex has its eyes on a different market as advertising dollars shift toward mobile app and internet audiences.</p><p>\"I love the fact that we've got such passionate users,\" Sebastian said in an interview last week, less than two months into his tenure at the top of the 28-year-old Oakville, Ont.-based company.</p><p>Sebastian moved to Pelmorex after three and a half years as vicepresident and managing director of Google's Canadian operations. When he was hired in July to succeed founder and president Pierre Morrissette, Pelmorex dropped the word \"media\" from its legal name and announced a transition into the data business, using its weather and consumer data to sell marketing insights to advertising partners instead of just airtime.</p><p>Pelmorex is a private company and doesn't reveal its finances. But executives have previously pegged its annual revenue at about $100 million, about 30 per cent of which comes from broadcasting. (Sebastian called these numbers \"a little historical.\") Yet broadcasting revenue is expected to shrink. Canadian conventional television advertising revenue dropped to about $1.55 billion in 2016 from $1.94 billion in 2011, down 20 per cent over six years, according to CRTC data.</p><p>Since Sebastian's September start date, Pelmorex has acquired Toronto-based Addictive Mobility, a 55-employee mobile data and media buying platform, and hired Rory Capern, former managing director of Twitter Canada.

Now he's got lots of company. What does science have to say about it?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On a Thursday evening in late January, the faithful gather. They trickle into the Church of Perpetual Life, about an hour's drive north of Miami, until a throng of around 100 people cram around tables lining the first-floor hall of this renovated house of worship. Along one wall is a display of reading material: pamphlets on heart disease, flyers itemizing the additives in Cheez-Its and their detrimental health effects, a handbill about the Ms. Senior Florida pageant. On the other side of the room, there's a snack buffet with beans, broccoli, carrots, cubed cheese, sliced meats, and olives. It's easy to pick out the regulars, who mingle clutching biology textbooks or readily shaking hands.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Many of them pause to greet the diminutive man who is their host: Bill Faloon. Clean-shaven and youthfully slim in a dark suit, with jet-black hair and a formidably bridged nose, he is the church's founder. Just yesterday, he laid out its gospel to me, saying, \"We're talking about immortality.\" His followers, he says, are \"people trying to live as long as possible, maybe even forever.\"</p><p>At 63, Faloon is old enough to remember when such talk labeled you a kook or charlatan. In the late 1970s, he co-founded the Life Extension Foundation, a nonprofit promoting the notion that people don't need to die-and later started a business to sell them the supplements and lab tests to help make that dream real. Nowadays he also distributes a magazine to 300,000 people nationwide and invites speakers to monthly gatherings at the church, billed as a science-based, nondenominational meeting place where supporters learn about the latest developments in the battle against aging. Their faith is in human technologies that might one day end involuntary death.</p><p>After an hour of mixing, we all head to the secondfloor nave and fill the pews for the evening's event. Several rows back sits a beer scientist. Next to me, two women in dresses and heels. At the front, an elderly gentleman with hearing aids. Tonight's speaker is Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical gerontologist and chief science officer of SENS Research Foundation, a Mountain View, California, outfit that studies regenerative medicines that might cure diseases associated with old age.</p><p>De Grey 's startup reflects the rush ofBig Tech money into this arena as the U.S. population ages. Baby boomers are retiring, and the Census Bureau estimates older people will outnumber children by 2035. Google launched Calico in 2013 to solve the challenges ofaging and associated illnesses. Two years later, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, started the $3 billion Chan Zuckerberg Science program, whose lofty goals include curing all disease. And Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel invested in Unity Biotechnology, launched in 2016 to develop therapies for age-related ailments.</p><p>Today, it's also easy to locate university-affiliated labs at places such as Harvard and Stanford investigating their own interventions in the process of growing old. Since the National Institutes of Health established its Institute on Aging division in 1974, scientists have dedicated more and more resources to the challenge. Over the past dozen years, the NIA's budget has doubled to more than $2 billion.</p><p>Faloon predates them all. These days, the several hundred people who regularly attend events at the church are personal validation for Faloon, who thinks that anyone his age and younger, given the proper physiological tweaking, could live to a healthy age of 130. The hope is that, by then, new solutions will make death truly optional. Yet no amount of self-tinkering can assure him and his followers that day will ever come.</p><p>Faloon was 8 years old and living in Pittsburgh when his mother told him that dying was a part of life. The concept didn't sit well with him. \"I was determined to find a way to conquer death,\" he says.</p><p>As a teenager, he became fascinated by the nascent and dubious field of cryonics- freezing the body upon death in hopes that a future technology can reanimate it. After high school, Faloon studied mortuary science so he could cryopreserve people. To this day, he is a licensed funeral director and embalmer. In the early '70s, at age 19, he moved to South Florida and soon fell in with folks equally fascinated by cryonics. At a get-together of local enthusiasts, he met Saul Kent, a fellow believer, and in 1977, the two founded what would eventually become the Life Extension Foundation.</p><p>A few years later, the two men formed a business-the Life Extension Buyers Club-to sell supplements. The problem was that they were also helping their members obtain medications that were not approved in the U.S. In 1987, federal agents kicked in their doors, seizing their products. In 1991, the U.S. government indicted them for helping to distribute unapproved drugs and pharmaceuticals without a prescription.</p><p>\"We were promoting all kinds of ways to slow aging that nowadays are recognized but hadn't made it into the mainstream yet,\" Faloon says. For instance, metformin. Approved for prescription in England in 1958 and in Canada in 1972, the drug increases insulin sensitivity, improving the body's ability to process sugars. This effect on glucose metabolism is the main reason metformin is now commonly used in the U.S. to treat type 2 diabetes, but the Food and Drug Administration didn't approve it until 1994. Studies since then show that diabetics on the medication generally live longer and appear to get cancer as much as 40 percent less than diabetics on other medications.</p><p>Back in the '80s, Faloon considered what he'd read about metformin enough for him to recommend it to buyers. But science isn't so quick to repurpose a drug. First, a randomized controlled trial has to show results . This year, one such test, called Targeting Aging with Metformin, or TAME, should get underway. It is the only FDA-sponsored study to look at whether a specific drug can slow aging.</p><p>FDA approval is predicated on outcomes. If you want permission to sell a new kind of pharmaceutical for lowering cholesterol, you will first need to show that it decreases a person's risk of developing heart disease. That it took the regulatory agency this many decades even to consider greenlighting an anti-aging drug speaks to how complex a challenge it is to untangle the process of growing old.</p><p>Aging begins at the cellular level. But it took a long time to figure that out. For much of the 20 th century, biologists thought that cells were immortal. That changed in the 1960s, when microbiologist Leonard Hayflick discovered that some human cells divide 40 to 60 times before stopping at what we now call the Hayflick Limit. That division is important. It's what helps your body grow, or repair damage (like after you cut your finger ), or fend off attack (like when your immune system defends against a virus).</p><p>Since then, researchers have discovered that even cells that keep dividing age, and they become inefficient at basic functions such as repairing DNA and recycling proteins, lipids, and other key molecules. Unable to maintain themselves, they accumulate damage, which impedes their ability to function normally or repair bodily tissues. Think of a car that falls into disrepair until one day, it just won't start. Our senses diminish, our skin goes slack, our joints creak, our muscles atrophy, and eventually the diseases associated with our older years creep in to finish us off: stroke, Alzheimer's, pulmonary fibrosis, diabetes, heart disease, cancer.</p><p>Faloon was determined to use the Life Extension Foundation to search for alternatives. He persisted even while under indictment; the foundation and buyers club remained legally free to market and sell supplements. Federal prosecutors, struggling to find testifying witnesses, ended up dropping all charges by 1996.</p><p>In 2013, he and Kent took their mission a step further, spending $880,000 to buy a building and open the Church of Perpetual Life. At first attendance was low, but now the venue is regularly packed. The place attracts medical doctors and laypeople alike. For several hours each month, they swap the latest information, take in what visiting researchers have to say, and, afterward, enjoy a catered meal together (January's menu offered chicken, salmon, and tilapia).</p><p>\"The idea is to bring people together and talk about a lot of ideas,\" says Faloon. \"It's a real attempt to persuade more of the public that dying is not a good thing.\"</p><p>In 2013, the academic journal Cell published a paper called \"The Hallmarks of Aging,\" which identified nine factors. Some contribute to the decline of young cells, while others play a role in driving the pathologies that lead to our demise. The report also highlighted several experimental therapies that have yielded encouraging results so far.</p><p>Most of the approaches that are mentioned in the paper fit into particular buckets: drugs that regulate metabolic pathways related to aging; tactics for killing off cells that have hit their division limit; restorative treatments to supply missing stem cells, which divide to repair tissues and organs. Researchers had previously tested all of the remedies in rodents.</p><p>\"We don't know for sure that the same tricks we use in laboratory animals will work in people, but probably some of them will,\" says Matt Kaeberlein, a pathology professor at the University ofWashington Medical Center in Seattle.</p><p>Metformin and rapamycin are two drugs with promising implications. In mice and rat trials, both extended life span. Some of Kaeberlein's work shows that rapamycin, typically delivered as an immunosuppressant following organ transplants in humans, mimics the effects of caloric restriction. Eating less puts strain on the body, and might alert cells that it's time to halt division and focus on repair and stress resistance, both of which could contribute to longevity. Rapamycin might create the same effect without requiring you to skip a meal.</p><p>Nir Barzilai likes metformin because it is safe. Diabetics have used metformin, a modified version of a plant compound, for decades. Barzilai is director of the Institute for Aging Research at New York's Albert Einstein College of Medicine, the lead sponsor of the five-year TAME trial that will soon enroll 3,000 participants between ages 65 and 80. He believes that the drug does more to alleviate damage in an aging cell than it does for improving glucose metabolism.</p><p>\"People with diabetes on metformin have 17 percent less mortality than people without diabetes, even though they are more obese and more sick to begin with,\" Barzilai says of the drug's effect. \"So metformin is really about aging much more than diabetes.\"</p><p>The Cell paper highlighted other ways to disrupt the aging process. If these units of living matter become inefficient as they age and divide, couldn't we just replace them? In the case of stem cells, yes.</p><p>\"What's the key to being able to turn a 1950 Chevrolet into a useful operating tool?\" asks surgeonturned-biomedical pioneer Bob Hariri. \"It's all about replacement parts, right? Look at what happens to people who get stem-cell transplants for bone-marrow reconstitution. If the donor is younger than the recipient, quite often the biology of that recipient improves.\"</p><p>Hariri is a co-founder of Human Longevity Inc., a Silicon Valley venture using supercomputers to search for genes related to human aging. But he's better known for his research into stem-cell therapies, first as CEO of Celgene Cellular Therapeutics, and now as founder of Celularity, a startup that launched this year. Its plan: Harvest stem cells from human placentas and inject them into older people. Hariri believes the usually frail organ systems of older individuals will improve because they will, in effect, be composed of younger cells.</p><p>Another strategy is to try to clear senescent cells- older ones that stop dividing-from the body. Research shows that some of these old-timers produce chemical signals that interfere with the functions of healthy cells. They can also cause symptoms such as inflammation, and help bring on fatal age-associated diseases.</p><p>Killing those rogues is a new focus among researchers. A team at the Mayo Clinic's Kogod Center on Aging recently managed to destroy senescent cells in mice using a new class of medications called senolytic agents. As reported this past summer in Nature Communications, other testing on human cells in culture showed that senolytic drugs targeted senescent cells while leaving other types alone. A clinical trial to test the drugs in humans with chronic kidney disease is underway.</p><p>\"We've got approval to start trials, and some are just beginning, but they're in people who've got serious illnesses directly tied to cellular senescence,\" says Kogod Center director James Kirkland. He adds that they need to see what happens before moving on to healthier populations.</p><p>Across all these potential aging interventions, there is one common denominator, and that is their fallibility. The medical community doesn't know what slows or reverses the process in humans, let alone what might cause harm. For that reason, Kirkland and his peers caution against the kind of self-experimentation Faloon practices.</p><p>\"We're playing with a new treatment paradigm,\" Kirkland says of their research. \"I've been around long enough to know there are going to be unpredictable things that happen as we get into people.\"</p><p>Faloon believes he faces a bigger risk from ' waiting than from being his own guinea pig. \"I'm afraid that with aging research, some of : the people don't have a sufficient sense of urgency,\" he says. He continually incorporates different interventions into his life-extension regimen. He restricts his calories to some 1,200 a day, about half what the average man consumes. He also ingests more than 50 medications daily, including metformin and Life Extension's own concoctions of nutraceuticals with names like Cell Regenerator and LongevityAI. \"Anything that might work, I am doing,\" he says.</p><p>Most recently, Faloon underwent a series of infusions of NAD+ molecules, which David Sinclair, co-director of the Glenn Center for the Biology of Aging at Harvard Medical School, has called \"the closest we've gotten to a fountain of youth.\" The molecules help regulate cellular aging but diminish over time. In studies, older mice given NAD+ molecule precursors look and act younger.</p><p>Because he's impatient for clinical trials to yield conclusive results, Faloon gives about $5 million a year in profits from the buyers club to underwrite medical research. So far, the data from two recent studies on NAD+ and rapamycin that he backed are unpublished. \"If we don't accelerate all these different projects, I'm not going to make it,\" Faloon says.</p><p>But there's a reason that science is slow. Most researchers will say that aging, if not an outright mystery, remains a cross between a jigsaw puzzle and an aggravating game of Whac-A-Mole. They warn that meddling with nature can carry unforeseen consequences. For instance, one experimental strategy, which deploys the enzyme telomerase to renew old cells, might encourage premalignant cells to turn cancerous.</p><p>\"People look at aging as something that is very simple,\" says Michael Fossel, a former professor of the biology of aging at Grand Valley State University in Michigan. \"They pick their favorite parameter, and then they push it. Can we reverse aging in people in clinical trials? Nobody knows yet.\"</p><p>Most current studies have a more circumscribed objective, which is to ameliorate the diseases that occur in our senior years. Take, for example, the TAME trial. According to lead scientist Barzilai, the FDA will consider metformin a sufficient anti-aging drug if it can delay age-related diseases for two years.</p><p>In other words, radical life extension-the notion of immortality that the Church of Perpetual Life promotes- is not the goal. Pushing back the onset of major maladies so we live a little longer and die a little healthier is.</p><p>For the Silicon Valley companies and barons of Big Tech assisting this effort, there's clearly a business imperative. \"Anything that extends life and maintains health is the biggest potential business in the history of mankind,\" Celularity's Hariri says. Another researcher, Kris Verburgh, a professor at Silicon Valley-based think tank Singularity University, aptly points out in his book The Longevity Code, \"If there is one thing multimillionaires dislike, it is having to die.\"</p><p>But aging research can't promise them-or Bill Faloon-anything. \"Gerontology is science, and immortalism is religion,\" says rapamycin researcher Kaeberlein. \"It's based on the faith that human technology will get to the point where you can actually live forever.

A place of rich beauty and a largely unspoiled natural environment. A place many of us in the UK see as made up of kinfolk, people with historic links[4] to us, today part of an evolving diverse society just as we are.No, the worst part of it is the way in which the awfulness played out live[5] in a 17-minute video event that was planned with malicious foresight by an individual who leveraged the ability of having unfettered access to a truly global broadcast medium to expose his evil act in real time, broadcast to Facebook Live via a headcam he wore, as it happened, and potentially reach hundreds of millions of people.Many of those people amplified what they saw, some unwittingly through sharing comment on social networks linking to it. </p><p>But many deliberately downloaded copies and shared those copies with their networks online on Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Reddit and other places, thus proliferating the morbid content as fast as they could upload it.On Sunday, Facebook said[6] on Twitter that it had removed 1.5 million copies of the killer's video being shared on Facebook.  <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/fbnewsroom/status/1107117981358682112\">https://twitter.com/fbnewsroom/status/1107117981358682112</url> But, as TechCrunch points out[7], 300,000 copies of the video made it to Facebook timelines before the social network could take them down.And therein lies the huge dilemma facing social networks, social media generally and society at large.Since the advent of social media in the early years of this century that gave anyone with an opinion, a place online to share it, and an Internet connection to that place to enable you to share it, we have grown accustomed to this ability, this gift of freedom of expression at scale, that enables ideas to be shared online.A great thing about this is that anyone can do this. But one consequence also is that anyone can do this.The online world of social networks and media - ranging from the huge like Facebook and YouTube to the relatively niche like Reddit to friend-to-friend peer-to-peer networks on the dark web - reflect the total spectrum of human behaviour that represents our daily lives and experiences in the real world. The good, the bad, and the ugly. All of it.To some, the online landscape we see today is not a pretty sight. According to Tim Berners' Lee[8], the inventor of the World Wide Web thirty years ago this past March 12:while the web has created opportunity, given marginalised groups a voice, and made our daily lives easier, it has also created opportunity for scammers, given a voice to those who spread hatred, and made all kinds of crime easier to commit.The Internet Society[9], my employer, strongly believes that the Internet is a force for good in society and follows a clear path[10] to that end:Working for an open, globally-connected, secure, and trustworthy Internet for everyone.What happened in New Zealand is a stark indicator of the magnitude of these tasks ahead. Such issues are big, unquestionably, and should involve the widest possible range of people from across society at large working together in seeking ways to find answers that are realistic and have a chance of making a genuine difference.A significant part of this process is figuring out a way to un-enable people with evil intent to use the web, and the Internet upon which it is layered, to further their intent, corrupt and pollute the medium for all, and destroy our trust in others.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/15/technology/facebook-youtube-christchurch-shooting.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/15/technology/facebook-youtube-christchurch-shooting.html</url> What form might this take? How would we stop acts like live-streaming unspeakable violence for the world to see, or prevent others from sharing such content and spreading hatred online?Could it take the form of something designed to give more weight to the force for good to society argument than on an individual's right to free speech?For instance, that could work where the moment Facebook, YouTube or any other online place becomes aware of a live-streaming event like that in New Zealand, they simply shut down all live streaming - no one can do it. That would prevent the specific evil-doer spreading his hatred, even though it also prevents every other person with a legitimate, positive, act.At the same time, Facebook could freeze any upload to that service thus preventing the widespread sharing of recordings. Sure, it would affect everyone uploading video, but you'd stop the bad people.A bit of a blunt-object approach to the problem, perhaps. Yet with such terrible events, speed is of the essence surely, and the tech isn't yet advanced enough to moderate everything without human assistance. We can already see how such content proliferates at incredible speed where stopping it after the event is an almost unending game of whack-a-mole[11].Maybe there ought to be greater scrutiny of what people do on a social network. Behavioural analysis, content analysis, network-effect analysis that tech surely exists in a way to use it at huge scale.And not forgetting the flip side of a right to freedom of expression is the responsibility that comes with the right[12].I'm not saying there are any easy answers here. All of this involves social networks run by influential big tech companies. And there are huge trust issues in that area about how such companies use or misuse the personal data of people. Governments would necessarily be involved, some of whom are pretty zealous in their approach to regulation.But it seems to me that we are at a fork in the road where the time has come to consider whether free and open access to means of communication that enable evil-doers to get away with murder is worth the human cost.
