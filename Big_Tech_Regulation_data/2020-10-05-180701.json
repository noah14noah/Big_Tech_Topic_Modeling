Europe has been the most aggressive in taking on Silicon Valley, but a tougher approach is gaining ground in the United States, where the Federal Trade Commission is considering imposing a multibillion-dollar fine against <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>and lawmakers have called for new data-privacy regulations.</p><p>  The parliamentary report recommends the creation of a British watchdog to oversee the technology industry, similar to the country's approach to regulating media companies. It also suggested legally requiring <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>and other large internet platforms to remove what the government determines to be harmful content, or risk fines or other punishments.</p><p>  Silicon Valley has long opposed making tech companies responsible for content on their sites. The industry argues that websites like <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>YouTube and Twitter are simply unbiased platforms for others to share material, and that new restrictions could impede free speech.</p><p>  ''Social media companies cannot hide behind the claim of being merely a 'platform' and maintain that they have no responsibility themselves in regulating the content of their sites,'' the parliamentary report said.</p><p><person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>acknowledged past mistakes and said it was open to ''meaningful regulation.''</p><p>  ''While we still have more to do, we are not the same company we were a year ago,'' said Karim Palant, a public policy manager for <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>in Britain. ''We have tripled the size of the team working to detect and protect users from bad content to 30,000 people and invested heavily in machine learning, artificial intelligence and computer vision technology to help prevent this type of abuse.''</p><p>  The blistering report concludes the committee's work, which started as a study of how social media can be manipulated to influence elections like Britain's 2016 vote to exit the European Union, but became a closer examination of <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>business practices. The committee held several hearings related to <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>relationship with Cambridge Analytica, the voter-targeting firm that gained access to 87 million <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>users.</p><p>  The committee does not have lawmaking authority on its own, but Mr. Collins said in an interview that he hoped the recommendations would be incorporated into a broader review of technology regulation underway within the British government. Policymakers are debating new rules to prevent online election meddling, and the spread of hate speech and terrorist content.</p><p>  A British parliamentary committee would not typically cause much worry for a company of <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>size, but the panel became a persistent challenge for the social media company.</p><p>  Mr. Collins has threatened to force <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, to testify if he ever travels to Britain. In December, the committee released a trove of secret internal emails in which Mr. Zuckerberg and other <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>executives discussed sharing access to user data with certain companies, like Netflix and Airbnb, while cutting off others.</p><p>  The committee said the emails showed <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>willingness to sacrifice user privacy to maximize revenue and generate more money from advertising. Without new oversight, technology companies cannot be expected to change, the report concluded.</p><p>  ''The big tech companies must not be allowed to expand exponentially, without constraint or proper regulatory oversight,'' the report said. ''But only governments and the law are powerful enough to contain them.''</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYT-657735190219</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VFW-K3M1-JBG3-63X8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6742</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"701\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The New York Times Company</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times</publicationName><edition>Late Edition - Final</edition><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/18/business/facebook-uk-parliament-report.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/18/business/facebook-uk-parliament-report.html</url><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 19, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>LL0009VDU</classCode><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

AP Photo  Courtesy ofBhaskar Chakravorti[1], Tufts University[2] Big tech is back in the spotlight. The chief executives of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google are testifying before Congress[3] on July 29 to defend their market dominance from accusations they're stifling rivals. Lawmakers and regulators are increasingly talking about antitrust action[4] and possibly breaking the companies up into smaller pieces. I study the effects of digital technologies on lives[5] and livelihoods across 90 countries. </p><p>I believe advocates[6] of breaking up big technology companies, as well as opponents[7], are both falling prey to some serious myths and misconceptions. Myth 1: Comparing Google with Standard Oil Arguments for and against antitrust action often use earlier cases[8] as reference points. The massive 19th-century monopoly Standard Oil[9], for example, has been referred to as the 'Google of its day[10].' There are also people who are recalling the 1990s antitrust case against Microsoft[11]. Those cases may seem similar to today's situation, but this era is different in one crucial way: the global technology marketplace. Currently, there are two 'big tech' clusters. One is in the U.S., dominated by Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple[12]. The other is in China, dominated by Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent, Huawei[13] and TikTok[14]-maker ByteDance. This global market is subject to very different political and policy pressures than regulators faced when dealing with Standard Oil and Microsoft. For example, the Chinese government has blocked most[15] of the U.S. companies from entering its market. And the U.S. government has done likewise[16], blacklisting some Chinese outfits over perceived national security threats while discouraging others. Since the COVID-19 outbreak, the Chinese government has doubled down[17] on championing its own technology companies. U.S. companies' size and data accumulation capabilities give the country economic and political influence around the globe. If the U.S. technology giants are broken up, the result would be a vastly uneven global playing field, pitting fragmented U.S. companies against consolidated state-protected Chinese firms. Myth 2: Antitrust is about money There are two main views of antitrust action among legal experts. One focuses on consumer welfare, which has been the prevailing approach federal lawyers have taken since the 1960s[18]. The other suggests that regulators should look at the underlying structure of the market[19] and potential for powerful players to exploit[20] their positions. Those two sides seem to agree that price plays a key role. People who argue against breaking up the tech giants point out that Facebook and Google provide services that are free to the consumer[21], and that Amazon's marketplace power drives its products' costs down. On the other side, though, are those who say that having low or no prices[22] is evidence that these companies are artificially lowering consumer costs to draw users into company-controlled systems that are hard to leave[23]. Both sides are missing the fact that the monetary price is less relevant as a measure of what users pay in the technology industry than it is in other types of business. Users pay for digital products with their data[24], rather than just money. Regulators shouldn't focus only on the monetary costs to the users. Rather, they should ask whether users are being asked for more data than is strictly necessary, whether information is being collected in intrusive or abusive ways[25] and whether customers are getting good value in exchange for their data[26]. Myth 3: Trust-busting is all or nothing There aren't just two ways for this debate to end, with either a breakup of one or more technology giants or simply leaving things as they are for the market to develop further. In my view, the best outcome is right in the middle. The errant company is sued to make necessary changes but isn't broken up. The very fact that the government filed a lawsuit leads to progress with other companies. That is exactly what happened in past cases against the Bell System, IBM and Microsoft. In the 1956 federal consent decree against the Bell System[27] telephone company, for example, which settled a seven-year legal saga, the company wasn't split up. Instead, Bell was required to license all its patents royalty-free[28] to other businesses. This meant that some of the most profound technological innovations in history - including the transistor[29], the solar cell[30] and the laser[31] - became widely available, yielding computers, solar power and other technologies that are crucial to the modern world. When the Bell System was eventually broken up[32] in 1982, it did not do nearly as much to spread innovation and competition[33] as the agreement that kept the Bells together a quarter-century earlier. The antitrust action against IBM lasted 13 years and didn't break up the company. However, as part of its tactics to avoid appearing to be a monopoly, IBM agreed to separate pricing for its hardware and software products[34], previously sold as an indivisible bundle. This created an opportunity for entrepreneurs Bill Gates and Paul Allen to create a new software-only company called Microsoft. The surge of software innovations that have followed can clearly trace their origins to the IBM settlement. Two decades later, Microsoft was itself the target of an antitrust action. In the resulting settlement, Microsoft agreed to ensure its products were compatible[35] with competitors' software. That made room in the emerging internet marketplace for web browsers, the predecessors of Apple's Safari, Mozilla's Firefox and Google Chrome. Even Margrethe Vestager, the European Union's top antitrust official and frequent tech-giant nemesis, has said that 'antitrust prosecutions are part of how technology grows[36].' But that doesn't mean they all have to achieve their most extreme ends and be broken up. Myth 4: COVID-19 and the end of tech bashing The current pandemic has highlighted the value of the technological innovations of the big tech companies. Americans are relying more than ever on the internet and online shopping and delivery, while mobility data[37] has been critical in gauging social distancing behaviors and guiding policy. Digital tools[38] for tracking coronavirus cases, deaths and social distancing behaviors in the smallest counties have circulated widely[39], and social media and smartphone videos were crucial[40] to the recent protests and calls for social justice. Altogether, this has led to a softening[41] of public opinion toward big tech[42] and calls[43] for an end to talk[44] of breaking them up[45]. But the pandemic has also revealed numerous digital fault lines: differences in access by country[46], race[47] and region[48]; the ability of tech companies to exploit labor[49]; and potential for new kinds of misuse of data[50]. Far from giving the technology industry a free pass, the pandemic is an opportunity to take a more balanced view. Yes, let's celebrate the Silicon Valley's value, but let's not turn a blind eye to the problems they create or worsen. During the hearings, you'll likely hear politicians accentuate the bad stuff, while the tech CEOs will paint an overly rosy image of themselves. Antitrust is complicated enough without misconceptions clouding their judgments as well. This is an updated and expanded version of an article originally published[51] on July 17, 2019.

The chief executives of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google are testifying before Congress on July 29 to defend their market dominance from accusations they''re stifling rivals. Lawmakers and regulators are increasingly talking about antitrust action and possibly breaking the companies up into smaller pieces. I study the effects of digital technologies on lives and livelihoods across 90 countries. I believe advocates of breaking up big technology companies, as well as opponents , are both falling prey to some serious myths and misconceptions. </p><p>Myth 1: Comparing Google with Standard OilArguments for and against antitrust action often use earlier cases as reference points.The massive 19th-century monopoly Standard Oil , for example, has been referred to as the '' Google of its day .'' There are also people who are recalling the 1990s antitrust case against Microsoft . Those cases may seem similar to today''s situation, but this era is different in one crucial way: the global technology marketplace. Currently, there are two ''big tech'' clusters. One is in the U.S., dominated by Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple . The other is in China, dominated by Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent, Huawei and TikTok -maker ByteDance. This global market is subject to very different political and policy pressures than regulators faced when dealing with Standard Oil and Microsoft. For example, the Chinese government has blocked most of the U.S. companies from entering its market. And the U.S. government has done likewise , blacklisting some Chinese outfits over perceived national security threats while discouraging others.Since the COVID-19 outbreak, the Chinese government has doubled down on championing its own technology companies.U.S. companies'' size and data accumulation capabilities give the country economic and political influence around the globe. If the U.S. technology giants are broken up, the result would be a vastly uneven global playing field, pitting fragmented U.S. companies against consolidated state-protected Chinese firms.Myth 2: Antitrust is about moneyThere are two main views of antitrust action among legal experts. One focuses on consumer welfare, which has been the prevailing approach federal lawyers have taken since the 1960s . The other suggests that regulators should look at the underlying structure of the market and potential for powerful players to exploit their positions.Those two sides seem to agree that price plays a key role. People who argue against breaking up the tech giants point out that Facebook and Google provide services that are free to the consumer , and that Amazon''s marketplace power drives its products'' costs down. On the other side, though, are those who say that having low or no prices is evidence that these companies are artificially lowering consumer costs to draw users into company-controlled systems that are hard to leave .Both sides are missing the fact that the monetary price is less relevant as a measure of what users pay in the technology industry than it is in other types of business. Users pay for digital products with their data , rather than just money.Regulators shouldn''t focus only on the monetary costs to the users. Rather, they should ask whether users are being asked for more data than is strictly necessary, whether information is being collected in intrusive or abusive ways and whether customers are getting good value in exchange for their data .Myth 3: Trust-busting is all or nothingThere aren''t just two ways for this debate to end, with either a breakup of one or more technology giants or simply leaving things as they are for the market to develop further. In my view, the best outcome is right in the middle. The errant company is sued to make necessary changes but isn''t broken up. The very fact that the government filed a lawsuit leads to progress with other companies. That is exactly what happened in past cases against the Bell System, IBM and Microsoft. In the 1956 federal consent decree against the Bell System telephone company, for example, which settled a seven-year legal saga, the company wasn''t split up. Instead, Bell was required to license all its patents royalty-free to other businesses. This meant that some of the most profound technological innovations in history - including the transistor , the solar cell and the laser - became widely available, yielding computers, solar power and other technologies that are crucial to the modern world. When the Bell System was eventually broken up in 1982, it did not do nearly as much to spread innovation and competition as the agreement that kept the Bells together a quarter-century earlier. The antitrust action against IBM lasted 13 years and didn''t break up the company. However, as part of its tactics to avoid appearing to be a monopoly, IBM agreed to separate pricing for its hardware and software products , previously sold as an indivisible bundle. This created an opportunity for entrepreneurs Bill Gates and Paul Allen to create a new software-only company called Microsoft. The surge of software innovations that have followed can clearly trace their origins to the IBM settlement. Two decades later, Microsoft was itself the target of an antitrust action. In the resulting settlement, Microsoft agreed to ensure its products were compatible with competitors'' software. That made room in the emerging internet marketplace for web browsers, the predecessors of Apple''s Safari, Mozilla''s Firefox and Google Chrome.Even Margrethe Vestager, the European Union''s top antitrust official and frequent tech-giant nemesis, has said that '' antitrust prosecutions are part of how technology grows .'' But that doesn''t mean they all have to achieve their most extreme ends and be broken up. Myth 4: COVID-19 and the end of tech bashingThe current pandemic has highlighted the value of the technological innovations of the big tech companies. Americans are relying more than ever on the internet and online shopping and delivery, while mobility data has been critical in gauging social distancing behaviors and guiding policy. Digital tools for tracking coronavirus cases, deaths and social distancing behaviors in the smallest counties have circulated widely , and social media and smartphone videos were crucial to the recent protests and calls for social justice. Altogether, this has led to a softening of public opinion toward big tech and calls for an end to talk of breaking them up . But the pandemic has also revealed numerous digital fault lines: differences in access by country , race and region ; the ability of tech companies to exploit labor ; and potential for new kinds of misuse of data . Far from giving the technology industry a free pass, the pandemic is an opportunity to take a more balanced view. Yes, let''s celebrate the Silicon Valley''s value, but let''s not turn a blind eye to the problems they create or worsen. During the hearings, you''ll likely hear politicians accentuate the bad stuff, while the tech CEOs will paint an overly rosy image of themselves. Antitrust is complicated enough without misconceptions clouding their judgments as well.

I believe <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.politico.com/2020-election/candidates-views-on-the-issues/technology/tech-competition-antitrust/\">advocates</url> of breaking up big technology companies, as well as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/07/these-are-some-of-the-best-quotes-about-technology-monopolies-in-2019/\">opponents</url>, are both falling prey to some serious myths and misconceptions. </p><h>Myth 1: Comparing Google with Standard Oil</h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Arguments for and against antitrust action <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/19/business/microsoft-trial-precedents-previous-antitrust-cases-leave-room-for-both-sides.html\">often use earlier cases</url> as reference points.</p><p>The massive <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/for-tech-giants-a-cautionary-tale-from-19th-century-railroads-on-the-limits-of-competition-91616\">19th-century monopoly Standard Oil</url>, for example, has been referred to as the \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/20/magazine/the-case-against-google.html\">Google of its day</url>.\" There are also people who are recalling the 1990s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/18/opinion/microsoft-antitrust-case.html\">antitrust case against Microsoft</url>. </p><p>Those cases may seem similar to today's situation, but this era is different in one crucial way: the global technology marketplace. </p><p>Currently, there are two \"big tech\" clusters. One is in the U.S., dominated by <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/big-tech-isnt-one-big-monopoly-its-5-companies-all-in-different-businesses-92791\">Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple</url>. The other is in China, dominated by <url normalizedValue=\"https://singularityhub.com/2018/08/17/baidu-alibaba-and-tencent-the-rise-of-chinas-tech-giants/\">Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent, Huawei</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/26/technology/tiktok-china-ban-model.html\">TikTok</url>-maker ByteDance. </p><p>This global market is subject to very different political and policy pressures than regulators faced when dealing with Standard Oil and Microsoft. For example, the Chinese government <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/tech/china-tech/article/2120913/china-recruits-baidu-alibaba-and-tencent-ai-national-team\">has blocked most</url> of the U.S. companies from entering its market. And the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-27/alibaba-pulls-back-in-u-s-amid-trump-crackdown-on-chinese-investment\">U.S. government has done likewise</url>, blacklisting some Chinese outfits over perceived national security threats while discouraging others.</p><p>Since the COVID-19 outbreak, the Chinese government <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/04/how-china-used-technology-to-combat-covid-19-and-tighten-its-grip-on-citizens/\">has doubled down</url> on championing its own technology companies.</p><p>U.S. companies' size and data accumulation capabilities give the country economic and political influence around the globe. If the U.S. technology giants are broken up, the result would be a vastly uneven global playing field, pitting fragmented U.S. companies against consolidated state-protected Chinese firms.</p><h>Myth 2: Antitrust is about money</h><p>There are two main views of antitrust action among legal experts. </p><p>One focuses on consumer welfare, which has been the prevailing approach federal lawyers have taken <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/724991\">since the 1960s</url>. The other suggests that regulators should look at the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox\">underlying structure of the market</url> and potential for <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pbwt.com/antitrust-update-blog/a-brief-overview-of-the-new-brandeis-school-of-antitrust-law\">powerful players to exploit</url> their positions.</p><p>Those two sides seem to agree that price plays a key role. People who argue against breaking up the tech giants point out that Facebook and Google provide services that are <url normalizedValue=\"https://slate.com/technology/2019/06/facebook-big-tech-antitrust-breakup-mistake.html\">free to the consumer</url>, and that Amazon's marketplace power drives its products' costs down. On the other side, though, are those who say that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox\">having low or no prices</url> is evidence that these companies are artificially lowering consumer costs to draw users into company-controlled systems that are <url normalizedValue=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/04/why-no-one-really-quits-google-or-facebook/\">hard to leave</url>.</p><p>Both sides are missing the fact that the monetary price is less relevant as a measure of what users pay in the technology industry than it is in other types of business. Users <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/how-much-is-your-data-worth-to-tech-companies-lawmakers-want-to-tell-you-but-its-not-that-easy-to-calculate-119716\">pay for digital products with their data</url>, rather than just money.</p><p>Regulators shouldn't focus only on the monetary costs to the users. Rather, they should ask whether users are being asked for more data than is strictly necessary, whether information is being collected in <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/7-in-10-smartphone-apps-share-your-data-with-third-party-services-72404\">intrusive or abusive ways</url> and whether customers are <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.axios.com/mark-warner-josh-hawley-dashboard-tech-data-4ee575b4-1706-4d05-83ce-d62621e28ee1.html\">getting good value in exchange for their data</url>.</p><h>Myth 3: Trust-busting is all or nothing</h><p>There aren't just two ways for this debate to end, with either a breakup of one or more technology giants or simply leaving things as they are for the market to develop further. </p><p>In my view, the best outcome is right in the middle. The errant company is sued to make necessary changes but isn't broken up. The very fact that the government filed a lawsuit leads to progress with other companies. That is exactly what happened in past cases against the Bell System, IBM and Microsoft. </p><p>In the 1956 federal consent decree against the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.beatriceco.com/bti/porticus/bell/bellsystem_history.html\">Bell System</url> telephone company, for example, which settled a seven-year legal saga, the company wasn't split up. Instead, Bell was required to <url normalizedValue=\"https://economics.yale.edu/sites/default/files/how_antitrust_enforcement.pdf\">license all its patents royalty-free</url> to other businesses. This meant that some of the most profound technological innovations in history - including the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.computerhistory.org/atchm/who-invented-the-transistor/\">transistor</url>, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.popsci.com/article/science/invention-solar-cell/\">solar cell</url> and the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.photonics.com/Articles/A_History_of_the_Laser_1960_-_2019/a42279\">laser</url> - became widely available, yielding computers, solar power and other technologies that are crucial to the modern world. When the Bell System was <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cio.com/article/3267826/breaking-up-is-hard-to-do-why-the-bell-system-breakup-isn-t-a-model-for-tech.html\">eventually broken up</url> in 1982, it did not do nearly as much to spread <url normalizedValue=\"https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BF-AV826_ATT_16U_20171120171814.jpg\">innovation and competition</url> as the agreement that kept the Bells together a quarter-century earlier. </p><p>The antitrust action against IBM lasted 13 years and didn't break up the company. However, as part of its tactics to avoid appearing to be a monopoly, IBM agreed to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/ibm-and-microsoft-antitrust-then-and-now/\">separate pricing for its hardware and software products</url>, previously sold as an indivisible bundle. This created an opportunity for entrepreneurs Bill Gates and Paul Allen to create a new software-only company called Microsoft. The surge of software innovations that have followed can clearly trace their origins to the IBM settlement. </p><p>Two decades later, Microsoft was itself the target of an antitrust action. In the resulting settlement, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/6/17827042/antitrust-1990s-microsoft-google-aol-monopoly-lawsuits-history\">Microsoft agreed to ensure its products were compatible</url> with competitors' software. That made room in the emerging internet marketplace for web browsers, the predecessors of Apple's Safari, Mozilla's Firefox and Google Chrome.</p><p>Even Margrethe Vestager, the European Union's top antitrust official and frequent tech-giant nemesis, has said that \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/20/magazine/the-case-against-google.html\">antitrust prosecutions are part of how technology grows</url>.\" But that doesn't mean they all have to achieve their most extreme ends and be broken up. </p><h>Myth 4: COVID-19 and the end of tech bashing</h><p>The current pandemic has highlighted the value of the technological innovations of the big tech companies. </p><p>Americans are relying more than ever on the internet and online shopping and delivery, while <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/\">mobility data</url> has been critical in gauging social distancing behaviors and guiding policy. <url normalizedValue=\"https://sites.tufts.edu/digitalplanet/covid-19-hotspots-rural-america/\">Digital tools</url> for tracking coronavirus cases, deaths and social distancing behaviors in the smallest counties <url normalizedValue=\"https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\">have circulated widely</url>, and social media and smartphone videos were <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/18/technology/social-media-protests.html\">crucial</url> to the recent protests and calls for social justice. </p><p>Altogether, this has led to a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.coindesk.com/public-opinion-shifts-on-big-tech-and-privacy-during-pandemic\">softening</url> of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.coindesk.com/public-opinion-shifts-on-big-tech-and-privacy-during-pandemic\">public opinion toward big tech</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/3/26/21193902/tech-backlash-covid-19-coronavirus-google-facebook-amazon\">calls</url> for an <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.brookings.edu/techstream/covid-and-the-future-of-techlash/\">end to talk</url> of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/09/opinion-covid-19-response-will-end-all-the-big-tech-bashing/\">breaking them up</url>. </p><p>But the pandemic has also revealed numerous digital fault lines: differences in access by <url normalizedValue=\"https://hbr.org/2020/04/which-countries-were-and-werent-ready-for-remote-work\">country</url>, <url normalizedValue=\"https://sites.tufts.edu/digitalplanet/how-digital-disparities-across-the-us-disproportionately-hurt-black-and-latinx-communities/\">race</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://sites.tufts.edu/digitalplanet/urban-rural-divide-in-the-us-during-covid-19/\">region</url>; the ability of tech companies to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jul/27/california-investigations-amazon-workers-coronavirus\">exploit labor</url>; and potential for new kinds of misuse of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.brookings.edu/techstream/the-dangers-of-tech-driven-solutions-to-covid-19/\">data</url>. </p><p>Far from giving the technology industry a free pass, the pandemic is an opportunity to take a more balanced view.

Democratic lawmakers criticized the tech  companies for buying startups to stifle them and for unfairly using  their data hoards to clone and kill off competitors, while  Republicans questioned whether the platforms had muzzled  conservative viewpoints and were unpatriotic.</p><p> \"As gatekeepers to the digital economy, these platforms enjoy  the power to pick winners and losers, shake down small businesses  and enrich themselves while choking off competitors,\" said Rep.  David Cicilline, D-R.I., chairman of the House Judiciary  Committee's antitrust subcommittee. \"Our founders would not bow  before a king. Nor should we bow before the emperors of the online  economy.\"</p><p> In response, Pichai, Zuckerberg, Cook and Bezos, who testified  via videoconference because of the coronavirus pandemic, were  forced to strike a more humble chord. They presented themselves as  participants in enormously competitive and fast-changing digital  marketplaces, and they evaded questions about the decisions that  turned their companies into giants.</p><p> \"We approach this process with respect and humility, but we  make no concession on the facts,\" said Cook at the outset of his  testimony.</p><p> Not since Microsoft stood trial in the late 1990s for antitrust  charges have tech chief executives been under such a microscope for  the power of their businesses. With echoes of the trustbusting of  U.S. Steel and Standard Oil more than a century ago and AT&amp;T in  1984, the hearing underlined the government's recognition that this  cohort of tech companies -- which wield immense control over  commerce, communications and public discourse -- had become the new  trusts of the internet age.</p><p> President Donald Trump also used the event to rail against tech  power. In a post on Twitter before the hearing began, he said that  he would issue executive orders to rein in the companies if  Congress did not.</p><p> From its conception, the House antitrust hearing was set to be  a spectacle, lining up four of the world's most powerful executives  -- with two of them among the planet's richest individuals -- to  answer largely hostile questions together. .</p><p> House lawmakers, who had opened an investigation into the tech  companies in June 2019, made the most of it. Rep. Jerry Nadler,  D-N.Y., confronted Zuckerberg with the CEO's own emails, saying  they showed a plot to take out a young competitor. Rep. Jim Jordan,  R-Ohio, said Google was biased and asked Pichai whether the company  would change its products to help elect Joe Biden for president.</p><p> In one of the sharpest exchanges, Rep. Pramila Jayapal,  D-Wash., confronted Bezos on accusations that an Amazon lawyer had  lied to the committee about how the company develops its own  products. She asked him to answer with a yes or no.</p><p> \"I can't answer that question yes or no,\" said Bezos, appearing  rattled.</p><p> Yet while the hearing was ripe with theater, any effect will be  limited by antitrust laws that were created a century ago and that  are imperfect for corralling internet firms. Since the 1980s,  enforcement officials have used the notion of consumer welfare as  the predominant test for antitrust violations -- generally meaning  that if prices are not going up, the markets are most likely  competitive enough. The tech giants have generally not driven up  prices of digital services or consumer goods; many do not charge at  all for services like Google Maps or Instagram.</p><p> While Democrats at the hearing indicated they were more  inclined to change antitrust law, Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wis.,  said he did not think the laws needed to change. Ultimately,  Congress doesn't have the power to break up the companies.</p><p> Still, the proceedings provided fuel to other investigations of  the tech companies by the Justice Department, the Federal Trade  Commission and state attorneys general. The Justice Department is  expected to soon announce charges against Google accusing it of  abusing its dominance in online advertising, people with knowledge  of the investigation have said. The FTC is preparing to question  Zuckerberg under oath in its investigation of Facebook's grip over  social networking and acquisitions of nascent rivals.</p><p> \"This is a critical juncture in how the Washington policy clash  with the titans of Silicon Valley unfolds,\" said Gene Kimmelman, a  former Justice Department antitrust official and a special adviser  to consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge.</p><p> Regulators around the world are also moving to limit the power  of the tech giants. Europe has led the charge with antitrust  investigations, and Margrethe Vestager, the region's top  trustbuster, recently vowed to take a harder line on the companies.  On Wednesday, Turkey passed legislation giving its government  sweeping new powers to regulate social media content.</p><p> The hearing Wednesday was a turnabout from just a few years  ago, when Face-book, Google, Amazon and Apple were emblems of  national pride for their innovation and growth. But the expanding  reach of the four -- which are involved in everything from  smartphones to e-commerce to digital payments -- and their stumbles  in misinformation, privacy, election interference and labor issues  have increasingly raised hackles.</p><p> Even so, the companies have continued growing as more people  live their lives online, with all of them expected to post solid  financial performances when they report quarterly earnings  Thursday.</p><p> The tone of the hearing was set with Cicilline's very first  question, directed at Pichai. \"Why does Google steal content from  honest businesses?\" Cicilline asked. Pichai replied: \"Mr. Chairman,  with respect, I disagree with that characterization.\"</p><p> Pichai was repeatedly asked about Google's dominance in search  and how the company was potentially trying to keep users within \"a  walled garden.\" He said Google had many competitors for specific  categories of search, such as shopping.</p><p> Zuckerberg was asked about Facebook emails in which executives  discussed the company's 2012 acquisition of Instagram as a possible  strategy to take out a nascent competitor. Zuckerberg said that, in  fact, Instagram's success had never been guaranteed and was the  result of Facebook's investment in the product.</p><p> When lawmakers asked Bezos if Amazon had bullied small  merchants, he said that it was \"not how we operate the business\" --  before being confronted by an audio recording of a bookseller  begging him directly for relief.</p><p> In response to questions about whether Apple favored some app  developers over others, Cook said there were \"open and transparent  rules\" that applied \"evenly to everyone.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYGAZ-DLYGAZ20200730Ar00401</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYGAZ2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G9-C441-DXVP-V1W1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388131</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1214\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Daily Gazette Co.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Companies would need permission to release such information. If it takes effect, a law would also likely shrink Big Tech's profits from its lucrative business of making personal data available to advertisers so they can pinpoint specific consumers to target.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Behind the drive for a law is rising concern over the compromise of private data held by Facebook, Google and other tech giants that have earned riches by aggregating consumer information. The industry traditionally has been lightly regulated and has resisted closer oversight as a threat to its culture of free-wheeling innovation.</p><p> Support for a privacy law is part of a broader effort by regulators and lawmakers to lessen the domination of companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon. Some, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic presidential candidate, have called for the tech giants to be split up.</p><p> The Trump White House has said in the past that it could endorse a broad data privacy law.</p><p> The big tech companies have been nervously eyeing a tough privacy law taking effect next year in California. That measure will allow Californians to see the personal data being collected on them and where it's being distributed and to forbid the sale of it. With some exceptions, consumers could also request that their personal information be deleted entirely.</p><p> Whatever federal privacy law eventually emerges is expected to be less stringent than the California measure and to supersede it. As a result, the tech industry is trying to help shape any national restrictions.</p><p> \"This is the first time ever that the industry wants legislation,\" said Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a privacy advocacy group. \"The industry is terrified.\"</p><p> Today, a House committee will press Google and Facebook executives about another urgent concern involving Big Tech: Whether they're doing enough to curb the spread of hate crimes and white nationalism through online platforms. The Judiciary Committee hearing follows a series of violent incidents fueled in part by online communication.</p><p>Facebook, used by 2-billion-plus people including over 200 million in the U.S., has been a particular lightning rod for industry critics. Having had its reputation tarnished over data privacy lapses, a tide of hate speech and a spread of disinformation that allowed Russian agents to target propaganda campaigns, Facebook appears ready to embrace a national privacy law.</p><p>Facebook's founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, published a column last month in the Washington Post calling for tighter regulations to protect consumer data, control harmful content and ensure election integrity and data portability.</p><p> \"The internet,\" Zuckerberg wrote, \"needs new rules.\"</p><p>Amazon says it has built its business on protecting people's information, \"and we have been working with policymakers on how best to do that.\"</p><p> \"There is real momentum to develop baseline rules of the road for data protection,\" Google's chief privacy officer, Keith Enright, has said in a policy paper. \"Google welcomes this and supports comprehensive, baseline privacy regulation.\"</p><p> A sweeping \"privacy shield\" law in the European Union, covering how tech companies handle personal data in the 28-country bloc, should be a model, Zuckerberg wrote. EU regulators recently fined Google $1.7 billion for freezing out rivals in the online ad business - their third penalty against the search giant in two years. The EU watchdogs have also ordered Apple and Amazon to pay back taxes and fined Facebook for providing misleading information in its acquisition of WhatsApp.</p><p> On Monday, Britain unveiled plans to vastly increase government oversight of social media companies, with a watchdog that could fine executives or even ban companies that fail to block such content as terrorist propaganda and images of child abuse.</p><p> The entire debate cuts to the heart of Big Tech's hugely profitable commerce in online users' personal data. The companies gather vast data on what users read and like and leverage it to help advertisers target their messages to the individuals they want to reach. Facebook drew 99 percent of its revenue from advertising last year. For Google's parent Alphabet, it was 85 percent, according to Scott Kessler of the research firm CFRA.</p><p>Amazon, too, doesn't just sell products online; it provides ad space, too.

Companies would need permission to release such information. If it takes effect, a law would also likely shrink Big Tech's profits from its lucrative business of making personal data available to advertisers so they can pinpoint specific consumers to target.</p><p>Behind the drive for a law is rising concern over the compromise of private data held by Facebook, Google, and other tech giants that have earned riches by aggregating consumer information. The industry traditionally has been lightly regulated and has resisted closer oversight as a threat to its culture of free-wheeling innovation.</p><p>Support for a privacy law is part of a broader effort by regulators and lawmakers to lessen the domination of companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon. Some, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic presidential candidate, have called for the tech giants to be split up.</p><p>The Trump White House has said in the past that it could endorse a broad data privacy law.</p><p>The big tech companies have been nervously eyeing a tough privacy law taking effect next year in California. That measure will allow Californians to see the personal data being collected on them and where it's being distributed and to forbid the sale of it. With some exceptions, consumers could also request that their personal information be deleted entirely.</p><p>Whatever federal privacy law eventually emerges is expected to be less stringent than the California measure and to supersede it. As a result, the tech industry is trying to help shape any national restrictions.</p><p>\"This is the first time ever that the industry wants legislation,\" said Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a privacy advocacy group. \"The industry is terrified.\"</p><p>On Tuesday, a House committee will press Google and Facebook executives about another urgent concern involving Big Tech: Whether they're doing enough to curb the spread of hate crimes and white nationalism through online platforms. The Judiciary Committee hearing follows a series of violent incidents fueled in part by online communication.</p><p>Facebook, used by 2-billion-plus people including over 200 million in the United States, has been a particular lightning rod for industry critics. Having had its reputation tarnished over data privacy lapses, a tide of hate speech, and a spread of disinformation that allowed Russian agents to target propaganda campaigns, Facebook appears ready to embrace a national privacy law.</p><p>Facebook's founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, published a column last month in the Washington Post calling for tighter regulations to protect consumer data, control harmful content, and ensure election integrity and data portability.</p><p>\"The Internet,\" Zuckerberg wrote, \"needs new rules.\"</p><p>Amazon says it has built its business on protecting people's information, \"and we have been working with policymakers on how best to do that.\"</p><p>\"There is real momentum to develop baseline rules of the road for data protection,\" Google's chief privacy officer, Keith Enright, has said in a policy paper. \"Google welcomes this and supports comprehensive, baseline privacy regulation.\"</p><p>A sweeping \"privacy shield\" law in the European Union, covering how tech companies handle personal data in the 28-country bloc, should be a model, Zuckerberg wrote. EU regulators recently fined Google $1.7 billion for freezing out rivals in the online ad business \u2014 their third penalty against the search giant in two years. The EU watchdogs have also ordered Apple and Amazon to pay back taxes and fined Facebook for providing misleading information in its acquisition of WhatsApp.</p><p>On Monday, Britain unveiled plans to vastly increase government oversight of social media companies, with a watchdog that could fine executives or even ban companies that fail to block such content as terrorist propaganda and images of child abuse.</p><p>The entire debate cuts to the heart of Big Tech's hugely profitable commerce in online users' personal data. The companies gather vast data on what users read and like and leverage it to help advertisers target their messages to the individuals they want to reach. Facebook drew 99% of its revenue from advertising last year. For Google's parent Alphabet, it was 85%, according to Scott Kessler of the research firm CFRA.</p><p>Amazon, too, doesn't just sell products online; it provides ad space, too. The company doesn't say how much but has said that the \"other\" revenue in its financial reports is mainly from ads. Its \"other\" revenue topped $10 billion last year, more than double what it was in 2017.</p><p>The tech giants' problematic relationship with advertisers was spotlighted by action regulators took last month. The Department of Housing and Urban Development filed civil charges against Facebook, accusing it of allowing landlords and real estate brokers to exclude certain racial or ethnic groups from seeing ads for houses and apartments. Facebook could face penalties.</p><p>The company has separately agreed to overhaul its ad targeting system and end some of the practices noted by HUD to prevent discrimination in housing listings as well as credit and employment ads. That move was part of a settlement with the American Civil Liberties Union and other activists.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BGLOBE-f6f5804e-5a36-11e9-8ede-aa64e2b639fa</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BGLOBE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VVB-H231-JC2G-C2T5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8110</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"971\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Boston Globe</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 9, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on  the Senate Intelligence Committee, has written a paper outlining  potential policies to regulate social media platforms like Facebook  and Twitter. The suggestions made by Warner's office aim to address  how privacy, competition and public discourse are being affected by  the misuse of those companies' services.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The existence of the paper was first reported by Axios and  confirmed by The New York Times.</p><p> In Britain, the House of Commons Digital, Culture, Media and  Sport Committee also has published a report that provided the  government with recommendations about how to achieve similar  results.</p><p> Both documents stemmed from investigations into misinformation  on social media platforms and offer some common solutions. For  instance, the reports propose large tech companies should: u  Undergo audits of their data and algorithms. u Be liable if they  fail to take down illegal or damaging content. u Have a duty to  identify and remove fake accounts. u Be subject to legislation  demanding their transparency.</p><p> Many of the 20 policy proposals put forward by Warner's office  are specific to the United States. For example, the paper proposed  the United States adopt sweeping new privacy legislation similar to  the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation and provide  the Federal Trade Commission with greater rule-making authority to  protect the digital lives of consumers.</p><p> Talk of regulating big tech companies began to gain momentum  after it came to light that Russia had used platforms including  Facebook and Twitter in its attempt to interfere with the 2016  presidential election race. The efforts gained greater urgency in  March after Facebook's Cambridge Analytica data scandal.</p><p> These new proposals are among the first to be made by lawmakers  since Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive of Facebook, testified  before Congress in April about misinformation and data privacy  issues on his company's platform.</p><p> For their part, big technology companies are well aware that  they must act to solve their problems or risk regulation. Facebook  and Twitter spent heavily in the second quarter to shore up their  networks against abuse.</p><p> Neither document pushed for a breakup of big technology  companies. Warner's office focused on increasing competition in the  technology sector. The report proposes making it easier for users  to move their data between digital platforms and limiting what  companies can do with products, such as Google Maps, that are  deemed to be so dominant that they have become \"essential  facilities\" for users. The House of Commons report said the  portrayal of tech companies as monopolies \"does not appreciate the  benefits of a shared service, where people can communicate freely.\"</p><p> Still, the initiatives outlined in these documents are a long  way from becoming law. Some of them -- such as thorough audits of  data and algorithms -- may be technically difficult to achieve.  Many will require legislation that, at best, will be slow to enact,  and, more likely, may never achieve the momentum and support among  lawmakers to pass.</p><p>Warner's office acknowledged as much. \"In many cases, there may  be flaws in each proposal that may undercut the goal the proposal  is trying achieve,\" its paper reads, \"or pose a political problem  that simply can't be overcome at this time.\"</p><p> The point of the proposal, though, the paper claims, was merely  to prompt conversations: \"The hope is that the ideas enclosed here  stir the pot and spark a wider discussion -- among policymakers,  stakeholders, and civil society groups -- on the appropriate  trajectory of technology policy in the coming years.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYGAZ-DLYGAZ20180731Ar00803</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYGAZ2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SXM-MVP1-DXVP-V48K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388131</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"654\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Daily Gazette Co.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

As outlined by the Free Speech Alliance[8], governing authorities should seek action that addresses four key issues in order for Big Tech companies to rectify their credibility problem and rebuild trust with conservatives:1) Provide Transparency: The companies need to design open systems so that they can be held accountable, while giving weight to privacy concerns.2) Provide Clarity on 'Hate Speech': Today, hate speech means anything liberals don't like. Silencing those you disagree with is dangerous. If companies can't tell users clearly what it is, then they shouldn't try to regulate it.3) Provide Equal Footing for Conservatives: Tech companies need to embrace viewpoint diversity.4) Mirror the First Amendment: Tech giants should afford their users nothing less than the free speech and free exercise of religion embodied in the First Amendment as interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court.

I think we are the best one.\"</p><p>- Playing politics -</p><p>President Donald Trump, who has accused Facebook and Twitter of censoring his remarks and being biased against conservatives, weighed in with a tweet shortly before the hearing.</p><p>\"If Congress doesn't bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders,\" Trump said. </p><p>Representative Jim Jordan, a Republican from Ohio, said during the hearing: \"I'll just cut to the chase -- Big Tech is out to get conservatives. That's not a suspicion. That's not a hunch. That's a fact.\"</p><p>Democrat Jamie Raskin of Maryland rejected the argument, saying Facebook and other platforms have failed to contain misinformation from Trump and his supporters, including unverified COVID-19 claims.</p><p>\"If Facebook is out there trying to repress conservative speech they're doing a terrible job,\" Raskin said. \"I don't understand this endless whining\" from Republicans.</p><p>- Moving forward -</p><p>Some analysts said the hearing could set the stage for revising US antitrust laws, which at present make it difficult for enforcers to target companies simply for being big.</p><p>\"There was considerable skepticism toward the tech sector as legislators worry about unfair competition and unfair practices,\" said Darrell West, director of the center for technology innovation at the Brookings Institution.</p><p>\"If Democrats gain control in the (November elections), this hearing will serve as a blueprint for enhanced regulatory oversight,\" West said.</p><p>Michael Carrier, a Rutgers University professor of antitrust law, said that while \"the hearing showed that the representatives did their homework\" he didn't think the hearing would lead to quick action.</p><p>Avery Gardiner, a former government antitrust lawyer who follows competition for the Center for Democracy &amp; Technology, said the hearing failed to demonstrate specific anticompetitive actions, leaving the matter now to regulatory agencies.</p><p>bur-gc-cl-rl/ch</p><p>FACEBOOK</p><p>Spotify</p><p>AMAZON.COM</p><p>APPLE INC.</p><p>GOOGLE</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFP-Lawmakers pummel Big Tech CEOs at US antitrust hearing </dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFP2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G6-XC51-JBV1-X14R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10903</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"820\"/><timeReceived>2:30 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Agence France Presse All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Agence France Presse -- English</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20278\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 30, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

CEOs Tim Cook of Apple, J...</p><p>(AFP)  Big Tech executives faced an onslaught of criticism from US lawmakers Wednesday at a high-stakes antitrust hearing which could lay the groundwork for tougher regulation and legal actions against the major internet platforms.  CEOs Tim Cook of Apple, Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Sundar Pichai of Google were grilled for more than five hours in the unprecedented joint appearance -- by video -- before a House of Representatives panel investigating market dominance.  While the hearing was called to focus on whether the companies have abused their dominant positions in the market, it veered quickly into other topics including political bias, privacy, dealings with China and how platforms deal with misinformation.  \"Simply put, they have too much power,\" said Representative David Cicilline, a Democrat from Rhode Island who chairs the panel conducting a year-long investigation into the business practices of the four companies.  Cicilline said the hearing made clear that the firms \"have monopoly power -- some need to be broken up, all need to be properly regulated and held accountable.\"  Congress has no formal role in antitrust enforcement, but several lawmakers appeared intent on revising US laws to deal with the extraordinary market power and dominance of large technology firms.  - Pandemic strength -  Cicilline said the coronavirus outbreak has strengthened the economic clout of the four, saying: \"They are likely to emerge (from the pandemic) stronger and more powerful than ever before.\"  A few comments from lawmakers sought to play down the competitive harms of the companies, which have also won praise for innovating and introducing new technologies and offering lifelines during the virus lockdowns.  \"Being big is not inherently bad,\" said Jim Sensenbrenner, a Republican from Wisconsin. \"Quite the opposite, in America you should be rewarded for success.  - Abusing platforms? -  Some lawmakers sought to highlight problems with tech companies operating platforms while competing with rivals on those systems.  Democrat Pramila Jayapal of Washington state question Pichai on how Google operates its ad platform, claiming that this hurts other online services such as news outlets.  Google \"is running the marketplace it's acting on the buy side and it's acting on the sell side, which is a major conflict of interest,\" Jayapal said.  Apple's Cook faced tough questioning over the market power of the company's App Store and its treatment of developers.  \"We treat all app developers the same,\" Cook said. \"We do not retaliate or bully people.\"  Bezos, in his first appearance before a congressional committee, defended Amazon's dealings with third-party sellers after a blistering attack from Cicilline.  \"Isn't it true that small businesses have no real option but rely on Amazon to connect with customers to make online sales?\" the committee chair asked.  \"We've heard from third party sellers again and again during the course of our investigation that Amazon is the only game in town.\"  Bezos disputed the characterization while adding, \"There are a lot of options for small firms..  I think we are the best one.\"  - Playing politics -  President Donald Trump, who has accused Facebook and Twitter of censoring his remarks and being biased against conservatives, weighed in with a tweet shortly before the hearing began, and some Republican lawmakers echoed those remarks.  \"If Congress doesn't bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders,\" Trump said.  Representative Jim Jordan, a Republican from Ohio, said during the hearing: \"I'll just cut to the chase -- Big Tech is out to get conservatives. That's not a suspicion. That's not a hunch. That's a fact.\"  Democrat Jamie Raskin of Maryland rejected the argument, saying Facebook and other platforms have failed to contain misinformation from Trump and his supporters, including unverified COVID-19 claims.  \"If Facebook is out there trying to repress conservative speech they're doing a terrible job,\" Raskin said. \"I don't understand this endless whining\" from Republicans.  - Moving forward -  Some analysts said the hearing could set the stage for revising US antitrust laws, which at present make it difficult for enforcers to target companies simply for being large or dominant without also showing harm to consumers or abuse of market power.  \"There was considerable skepticism toward the tech sector as legislators worry about unfair competition and unfair practices,\" said Darrell West, director of the center for technology innovation at the Brookings Institution.  \"If Democrats gain control in the (November elections), this hearing will serve as a blueprint for enhanced regulatory oversight,\" West said.  Michael Carrier, a Rutgers University professor of antitrust law, said that \"the hearing showed that the representatives did their homework\" and showed documents hinting at anticompetitive actions.  \"I don't think any immediate changes will result from the hearing, but it will provide support for the continuing momentum to challenge these companies,\" he said.  Avery Gardiner, a former government antitrust lawyer who follows competition for the Center for Democracy &amp; Technology, said the hearing was \"an opportunity squandered\" which failed to demonstrate specific anticompetitive actions, leaving the matter now to regulatory agencies.  \"Congressional hearings, which by their nature are broad-ranging, do not lend themselves well to thoughtful analysis about what Big Tech does that could affect competition,\" she said.  bur-gc-cl-rl/ch  FACEBOOKSpotifyAMAZON.COM  APPLE INC.

Big Tech CEOs Mark Zuckerberg, Sundar Pichai, Tim Cook and Jeff Bezos testified remotely at a congressional antitrust hearing. Photo: AFP / BERTRAND GUAY \"Simply put, they have too much power,\" said Representative David Cicilline, a Democrat from Rhode Island who chairs the panel conducting a year-long investigation into the business practices of the four companies.Cicilline said the hearing made clear that the firms \"have monopoly power -- some need to be broken up, all need to be properly regulated and held accountable.\"Congress has no formal role in antitrust enforcement, but several lawmakers appeared intent on revising US laws to deal with the extraordinary market power and dominance of large technology firms. </p><p>The major tech firms have seen their market value soar in recent months despite a pandemic-induced economic slump Photo: AFP / Lionel BONAVENTURE  Cicilline said the coronavirus outbreak has strengthened the economic clout of the four, saying: \"They are likely to emerge (from the pandemic) stronger and more powerful than ever before.\"A few comments from lawmakers sought to play down the competitive harms of the companies, which have also won praise for innovating and introducing new technologies and offering lifelines during the virus lockdowns.\"Being big is not inherently bad,\" said Jim Sensenbrenner, a Republican from Wisconsin. \"Quite the opposite, in America you should be rewarded for success. Rep. David Cicilline heads the House of Representatives panel holding the antitrust hearing on Big Tech Photo: POOL / Susan Walsh Some lawmakers sought to highlight problems with tech companies operating platforms while competing with rivals on those systems.Democrat Pramila Jayapal of Washington state question Pichai on how Google operates its ad platform, claiming that this hurts other online services such as news outlets. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos testified before the antitrust hearing in the House of Representatives by video Photo: POOL / MANDEL NGAN Google \"is running the marketplace it's acting on the buy side and it's acting on the sell side, which is a major conflict of interest,\" Jayapal said.Apple's Cook faced tough questioning over the market power of the company's App Store and its treatment of developers.\"We treat all app developers the same,\" Cook said. \"We do not retaliate or bully people.\"Bezos, in his first appearance before a congressional committee, defended Amazon's dealings with third-party sellers after a blistering attack from Cicilline. Google CEO Sundar Pichai disputed claims of political bias at the House antitrust hearing Photo: POOL / MANDEL NGAN \"Isn't it true that small businesses have no real option but rely on Amazon to connect with customers to make online sales?\" the committee chair asked.\"We've heard from third party sellers again and again during the course of our investigation that Amazon is the only game in town.\"Bezos disputed the characterization while adding, \"There are a lot of options for small firms.. I think we are the best one.\"President Donald Trump, who has accused Facebook and Twitter of censoring his remarks and being biased against conservatives, weighed in with a tweet shortly before the hearing began, and some Republican lawmakers echoed those remarks.\"If Congress doesn't bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders,\" Trump said.Representative Jim Jordan, a Republican from Ohio, said during the hearing: \"I'll just cut to the chase -- Big Tech is out to get conservatives. That's not a suspicion. That's not a hunch. That's a fact.\"Democrat Jamie Raskin of Maryland rejected the argument, saying Facebook and other platforms have failed to contain misinformation from Trump and his supporters, including unverified COVID-19 claims.\"If Facebook is out there trying to repress conservative speech they're doing a terrible job,\" Raskin said. \"I don't understand this endless whining\" from Republicans.Some analysts said the hearing could set the stage for revising US antitrust laws, which at present make it difficult for enforcers to target companies simply for being large or dominant without also showing harm to consumers or abuse of market power.\"There was considerable skepticism toward the tech sector as legislators worry about unfair competition and unfair practices,\" said Darrell West, director of the center for technology innovation at the Brookings Institution.\"If Democrats gain control in the (November elections), this hearing will serve as a blueprint for enhanced regulatory oversight,\" West said.Michael Carrier, a Rutgers University professor of antitrust law, said that \"the hearing showed that the representatives did their homework\" and showed documents hinting at anticompetitive actions.\"I don't think any immediate changes will result from the hearing, but it will provide support for the continuing momentum to challenge these companies,\" he said.Avery Gardiner, a former government antitrust lawyer who follows competition for the Center for Democracy &amp;#38; Technology, said the hearing was \"an opportunity squandered\" which failed to demonstrate specific anticompetitive actions, leaving the matter now to regulatory agencies.\"Congressional hearings, which by their nature are broad-ranging, do not lend themselves well to thoughtful analysis about what Big Tech does that could affect competition,\" she said. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-IBTX108767159607354262775776100197</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IBTX-7212</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G7-H9H1-F03R-N3GG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1041\"/><timeReceived>1:45 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>International Business Times News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 30, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

CEOs Tim Cook of Apple, Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Sundar Pichai of Google were grilled for more than five hours in the unprecedented joint appearance -- by video -- before a House of Representatives panel investigating market dominance. While the hearing was called to focus on whether the companies have abused their dominant positions in the market, it veered quickly into other topics including political bias, privacy, dealings with China and how platforms deal with misinformation.\"Simply put, they have too much power,\" said Representative David Cicilline, a Democrat from Rhode Island who chairs the panel conducting a year-long investigation into the business practices of the four companies. </p><p>Cicilline said the hearing made clear that the firms \"have monopoly power -- some need to be broken up, all need to be properly regulated and held accountable.\" Congress has no formal role in antitrust enforcement, but several lawmakers appeared intent on revising US laws to deal with the extraordinary market power and dominance of large technology firms. The major tech firms have seen their market value soar in recent months despite a pandemic-induced economic slump AFP / Lionel BONAVENTURE  Cicilline said the coronavirus outbreak has strengthened the economic clout of the four, saying: \"They are likely to emerge (from the pandemic) stronger and more powerful than ever before.\" A few comments from lawmakers sought to play down the competitive harms of the companies, which have also won praise for innovating and introducing new technologies and offering lifelines during the virus lockdowns. \"Being big is not inherently bad,\" said Jim Sensenbrenner, a Republican from Wisconsin. \"Quite the opposite, in America you should be rewarded for success. Rep. David Cicilline heads the House of Representatives panel holding the antitrust hearing on Big Tech POOL / Susan Walsh  Some lawmakers sought to highlight problems with tech companies operating platforms while competing with rivals on those systems. Democrat Pramila Jayapal of Washington state question Pichai on how Google operates its ad platform, claiming that this hurts other online services such as news outlets. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos testified before the antitrust hearing in the House of Representatives by video POOL / MANDEL NGAN Google \"is running the marketplace it's acting on the buy side and it's acting on the sell side, which is a major conflict of interest,\" Jayapal said. Apple's Cook faced tough questioning over the market power of the company's App Store and its treatment of developers. \"We treat all app developers the same,\" Cook said. \"We do not retaliate or bully people.\" Bezos, in his first appearance before a congressional committee, defended Amazon's dealings with third-party sellers after a blistering attack from Cicilline. Google CEO Sundar Pichai disputed claims of political bias at the House antitrust hearing POOL / MANDEL NGAN \"Isn't it true that small businesses have no real option but rely on Amazon to connect with customers to make online sales?\" the committee chair asked. \"We've heard from third party sellers again and again during the course of our investigation that Amazon is the only game in town.\" Bezos disputed the characterization while adding, \"There are a lot of options for small firms.. I think we are the best one.\"President Donald Trump, who has accused Facebook and Twitter of censoring his remarks and being biased against conservatives, weighed in with a tweet shortly before the hearing began, and some Republican lawmakers echoed those remarks. \"If Congress doesn't bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders,\" Trump said.  Representative Jim Jordan, a Republican from Ohio, said during the hearing: \"I'll just cut to the chase -- Big Tech is out to get conservatives. That's not a suspicion. That's not a hunch. That's a fact.\" Democrat Jamie Raskin of Maryland rejected the argument, saying Facebook and other platforms have failed to contain misinformation from Trump and his supporters, including unverified COVID-19 claims. \"If Facebook is out there trying to repress conservative speech they're doing a terrible job,\" Raskin said. \"I don't understand this endless whining\" from Republicans.Some analysts said the hearing could set the stage for revising US antitrust laws, which at present make it difficult for enforcers to target companies simply for being large or dominant without also showing harm to consumers or abuse of market power. \"There was considerable skepticism toward the tech sector as legislators worry about unfair competition and unfair practices,\" said Darrell West, director of the center for technology innovation at the Brookings Institution. \"If Democrats gain control in the (November elections), this hearing will serve as a blueprint for enhanced regulatory oversight,\" West said. Michael Carrier, a Rutgers University professor of antitrust law, said that \"the hearing showed that the representatives did their homework\" and showed documents hinting at anticompetitive actions. \"I don't think any immediate changes will result from the hearing, but it will provide support for the continuing momentum to challenge these companies,\" he said. Avery Gardiner, a former government antitrust lawyer who follows competition for the Center for Democracy &amp;#38; Technology, said the hearing was \"an opportunity squandered\" which failed to demonstrate specific anticompetitive actions, leaving the matter now to regulatory agencies. \"Congressional hearings, which by their nature are broad-ranging, do not lend themselves well to thoughtful analysis about what Big Tech does that could affect competition,\" she said. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-IBTX132857159607123788775776100064</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IBTX-132857</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G7-H9H1-F03R-N3HD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1016\"/><timeReceived>1:07 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>International Business Times Australia</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 30, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

While the hearing was called to focus on whether the companies have abused their dominant positions in the market, it veered quickly into other topics including political bias, privacy, dealings with China and how platforms deal with misinformation.\"Simply put, they have too much power,\" said Representative David Cicilline, a Democrat from Rhode Island who chairs the panel conducting a year-long investigation into the business practices of the four companies.Cicilline said the hearing made clear that the firms \"have monopoly power \u2014 some need to be broken up, all need to be properly regulated and held accountable.\"Congress has no formal role in antitrust enforcement, but several lawmakers appeared intent on revising US laws to deal with the extraordinary market power and dominance of large technology firms. Pandemic strength Cicilline said the coronavirus outbreak has strengthened the economic clout of the four, saying: \"They are likely to emerge (from the pandemic) stronger and more powerful than ever before.\" </p><p>A few comments from lawmakers sought to play down the competitive harms of the companies, which have also won praise for innovating and introducing new technologies and offering lifelines during the virus lockdowns.\"Being big is not inherently bad,\" said Jim Sensenbrenner, a Republican from Wisconsin. \"Quite the opposite, in America you should be rewarded for success. Abusing platforms? Some lawmakers sought to highlight problems with tech companies operating platforms while competing with rivals on those systems.Democrat Pramila Jayapal of Washington state question Pichai on how Google operates its ad platform, claiming that this hurts other online services such as news outlets.Google \"is running the marketplace it's acting on the buy side and it's acting on the sell side, which is a major conflict of interest,\" Jayapal said.Apple's Cook faced tough questioning over the market power of the company's App Store and its treatment of developers.\"We treat all app developers the same,\" Cook said. \"We do not retaliate or bully people.\"Bezos, in his first appearance before a congressional committee, defended Amazon's dealings with third-party sellers after a blistering attack from Cicilline.\"Isn't it true that small businesses have no real option but rely on Amazon to connect with customers to make online sales?\" the committee chair asked.\"We've heard from third party sellers again and again during the course of our investigation that Amazon is the only game in town.\"Bezos disputed the characterization while adding, \"There are a lot of options for small firms.. I think we are the best one.\" Playing politics President Donald Trump, who has accused Facebook and Twitter of censoring his remarks and being biased against conservatives, weighed in with a tweet shortly before the hearing began, and some Republican lawmakers echoed those remarks.\"If Congress doesn't bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders,\" Trump said.Representative Jim Jordan, a Republican from Ohio, said during the hearing: \"I'll just cut to the chase \u2014 Big Tech is out to get conservatives. That's not a suspicion. That's not a hunch. That's a fact.\"Democrat Jamie Raskin of Maryland rejected the argument, saying Facebook and other platforms have failed to contain misinformation from Trump and his supporters, including unverified COVID-19 claims.\"If Facebook is out there trying to repress conservative speech they're doing a terrible job,\" Raskin said. \"I don't understand this endless whining\" from Republicans. Moving forward Some analysts said the hearing could set the stage for revising US antitrust laws, which at present make it difficult for enforcers to target companies simply for being large or dominant without also showing harm to consumers or abuse of market power.\"There was considerable skepticism toward the tech sector as legislators worry about unfair competition and unfair practices,\" said Darrell West, director of the center for technology innovation at the Brookings Institution.\"If Democrats gain control in the (November elections), this hearing will serve as a blueprint for enhanced regulatory oversight,\" West said.Michael Carrier, a Rutgers University professor of antitrust law, said that \"the hearing showed that the representatives did their homework\" and showed documents hinting at anticompetitive actions.\"I don't think any immediate changes will result from the hearing, but it will provide support for the continuing momentum to challenge these companies,\" he said.Avery Gardiner, a former government antitrust lawyer who follows competition for the Center for Democracy &amp; Technology, said the hearing was \"an opportunity squandered\" which failed to demonstrate specific anticompetitive actions, leaving the matter now to regulatory agencies.\"Congressional hearings, which by their nature are broad-ranging, do not lend themselves well to thoughtful analysis about what Big Tech does that could affect competition,\" she said.\u00a0\u00a0 Be Part of Quality Journalism Quality journalism takes a lot of time, money and hard work to produce and despite all the hardships we still do it.

They made the request during a hearing for the House Judiciary's Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law, which has been holding a series of hearings dubbed Online Platforms and Market Power.</p><p>'Despite mounting evidence of illegal monopolization activity by some of the dominant platforms and numerous cases brought by international enforcers, US enforcers appear to be paralyzed,' Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said in an opening statement. 'It has been decades -- decades -- since the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission has brought a significant monopolization case in the tech sector.'</p><p>Wednesday's hearing included just two witnesses: FTC Chairman Joseph Simons and Makan Delrahim, the assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's Antitrust Division. The tone was largely collegial, with the subcommittee's antitrust efforts becoming a rare case of bipartisan work in a polarized Capitol. There were also few people in the audience, perhaps owing to the hearing being overshadowed by the highly anticipated House impeachment public hearings kicking off the same day.</p><p>Delrahim and Simons attended a similar hearing in September held by the Senate Judiciary Committee, pointing to just how much attention tech antitrust concerns have grown in Washington DC.</p><p>The hearing came as regulators and lawmakers have been shining a harsher light on many of the biggest US tech companies -- Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple -- and their potential monopolies. So far, Facebook has publicly disclosed investigations into the social giant by both the Justice Department and the FTC, and Google disclosed a Justice Department investigation.</p><p>Added to that, the House Judiciary Committee and a group of state attorneys general are investigating these tech titans, too.</p><p>This work could have huge implications for the future of tech, potentially resulting in the breakup of dominant players like Facebook, the prevention of future tech mergers, or the creation of additional regulatory restrictions on tech giants. Regulators and lawmakers say they are pursuing this work to ensure customers can benefit from the growth of innovative new startups and healthy competition.</p><p>For their part, many major tech companies say they remain small players in their fields, such as Amazon being a fraction of global retail, and point to long lists of competitors in their markets.</p><p>While several committee members on Wednesday called for more regulatory action, Simons, from the FTC, warned that his agency lacked the authority to pursue more privacy-related enforcement. He said Congress would first need to enact privacy-focused laws, similar to the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation or the California Consumer Privacy Act.</p><p>'If you want us to do more on the privacy front, then we need more tools from you,' he said.</p><p>Additionally, Republicans Jim Sensenbrenner and Doug Collins on Wednesday both warned of unintended consequences of new regulations and government overreach that could stifle innovation. For instance, Simons mentioned how Europe's GDPR may have ended up reinforcing market leaders there and suppressing new competitors.</p><p>'Proposals to break up big companies just because they are big risks throwing out the baby with the bathwater and are simply punishing success,' Collins said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS2610480</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XH7-SP11-JDG9-Y1G5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"610\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 14, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

That frustrated some of the lawmakers at the hearing, held by the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust.</p><p>  ''The fact that you're coming here without any specifics I think reinforces the impression that federal antitrust enforcement is an empty suit,'' said Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut. ''What the public sees is a facade with respect to Big Tech -- and no immediate prospect of urgency or active enforcement.''</p><p>  [Read more: 16 ways Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon are in the government's cross hairs.]</p><p>  The tech giants are embroiled in investigations around the world over concerns they have abused their market power. In the United States, federal agencies and House lawmakers are looking into the power and influence of Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook. Many state attorneys general have announced investigations into Facebook and Google.</p><p>  The scrutiny has helped upend the companies' usual place in Washington, where they have long been cheered on as pillars of innovation and a major engine of the country's economy. The companies' troubles have escalated in recent years from a range of scandals, including how they handle consumer data and their role in spreading disinformation during the 2016 presidential election.</p><p>  In July, the Federal Trade Commission approved a fine of roughly $5 billion against Facebook for mishandling users' personal information, by far the largest fine against a technology company in the United States. But Senator Josh Hawley, a conservative Republican from Missouri, on Tuesday questioned Mr. Simons of the F.T.C. about whether the settlement was too weak.</p><p>  Mr. Hawley homed in on the fact that the agency never talked to Facebook's top executives during the privacy investigation, using it to suggest that there could be a lack of determination at the agency.</p><p>  ''Did you interview Mark Zuckerberg during your investigation?'' Mr. Hawley asked Mr. Simons. ''Did you interview Sheryl Sandberg during the investigation?''</p><p>  Mr. Simons answered no to both questions.</p><p>  Concerns about the tech companies vary. Facebook is accused of shutting out nascent competitors. Google has drawn scrutiny for its smartphone software, ad and search businesses. Critics say Amazon uses its knowledge of independent merchants on its platform to make competing generic products. And software developers chafe at Apple's status as a gatekeeper for iPhone apps.</p><p>  At the federal level, Mr. Simons and Mr. Delrahim have divided up responsibility for handling antitrust complaints about the companies. The Justice Department took Google and Apple, and the F.T.C. got Facebook and Amazon.</p><p>  The regulators and companies have confirmed only two formal investigations. Google disclosed in August that it had received a formal request from the Justice Department for information related to a previous investigation of the company, signaling a new inquiry was underway. Facebook is the subject of an F.T.C. antitrust investigation related to its acquisition of other services.</p><p>  But the accord between the agencies appears tenuous. Lawmakers pressed the regulators on Tuesday on reports that they were at odds over the investigations.</p><p>  When Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, said it sounded like ''things have broken down at least in part'' between the agencies, Mr. Simons replied: ''I would agree with that.'' Asked later to expand on his comments, Mr. Simons declined.</p><p>  Mr. Delrahim also acknowledged that there was some overlap on the tech investigations. And he said that the state attorneys general investigations could complicate matters, too.</p><p>  ''I think at the early stage we've got to make sure that we're not tripping over each other,'' said Mr. Delrahim, calling discussions with the states ''productive.''</p><p>  Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota and a presidential candidate, said her concern was not of multiple agencies looking into one company -- but that the companies do not get enough scrutiny.</p><p>  ''I just look at this is in such a different way,'' she said. ''I'd rather have a split investigation than no investigation.''</p><p>  Mr. Lee expressed another concern: that the investigations would start to look like those in Europe. Regulators in Europe have been far more aggressive about bringing antitrust cases against the tech companies. But Mr. Lee warned that the motivations were not necessarily to protect consumers.</p><p>  ''The primary concern'' in Europe, he said, ''seems to be protecting competitors rather than competition itself.''</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: Makan Delrahim, the top antitrust official at the Justice Department, testifying on Tuesday in Washington.

The probe of Google has drawn participation by 50 states and U.S. territories -- not including California or Alabama.</p><p>\"We have to act if we see that they're breaking the law,\" FTC Commissioner Rohit Chopra told CNBC on Friday.

Quick Fix    \u2014 Tussling over tech hearing:  House Judiciary\u2019s top Republican says Democrats are flouting committee rules in their proposed framework for the upcoming, must-watch hearing with the CEOs of Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon \u2014 another sign of partisan tension.   \u2014 EU court ruling strikes blow to transatlantic data flows:  The annulment of Privacy Shield is a major indictment of U.S. surveillance powers that throws billions of dollars in digital trade into question.   \u2014 TikTok\u2019s bad week continues:  As a Senate committee prepares to take up legislation to ban TikTok on government devices, two-dozen House Republicans wrote to President Donald Trump in support of a U.S. ban on the social media app.   IT\u2019S THURSDAY; WELCOME TO MORNING TECH.

Mark Zuckerberg and Dr. Anthony Fauci, the US\u2019s top infectious disease expert, discuss the latest efforts to combat the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Watch now       Tech of the Town    Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Apple were among the tech players affected by Wednesday\u2019s unprecedented Twitter hack. (We tried to share more then, but our Twitter accounts were locked .) More here from POLITICO .   FIRST IN MT: TOP REPUBLICAN TAKES ISSUE WITH ANTITRUST HEARING SETUP \u2014 The House Judiciary Committee\u2019s proposed framework for its blockbuster hearing with the CEOs of Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook runs afoul of the chamber\u2019s rules, Ranking Member Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) wrote in new a letter to Chair Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.). It marks the latest sign of friction over the session between Judiciary leaders and Jordan, who has jabbed Democrats for excluding some committee members by holding it at the subcommittee level.   \u2014 Timing is everything: According to Jordan, Antitrust Subcommittee Chair David Cicilline (D-R.I.) is planning to \u201callow more time for Member questions\u201d by granting lawmakers double the usual five minutes and later also recognizing \u201ca single Democrat and Republican Member for a period of extended questioning of up to thirty minutes.\u201d The remarks provide a peek into the behind-the-scenes negotiations over the format for the hearing, which hasn\u2019t been announced. But Jordan took issue with the plan, saying lawmakers should instead stick to the usual five minutes per member to allow the full committee to partake in the session.   A Judiciary spokesperson declined to comment on the Jordan letter.   \u2014 Little details, big stakes: Lawmakers and advocacy groups have been jockeying to shape the framework of the historic hearing, which they say could have a major impact on whether officials are able to pin the tech moguls down on key questions. A coalition of prominent big tech critics made an argument counter to Jordan\u2019s on Monday, calling for the committee to have the big tech CEOs testify individually to give lawmakers more time for questioning. The committee can change the question format for a hearing with unanimous consent or by a majority vote.   TODAY IN EUROPE: COURT RULING SHREDS PRIVACY SHIELD \u2014 Europe's top court handed down a searing verdict on U.S. surveillance powers today \u2014 a ruling that could have a major impact on thousands of companies, including Silicon Valley firms like Facebook that operate overseas.   \u2014 The verdict: The Court of Justice of the European Union ruled for the second time that EU data would not be safe from snooping under a transatlantic data protection deal known as Privacy Shield. The ruling, which cancels that agreement, throws billions of dollars in digital trade into legal limbo and reignites a spat over surveillance that dates back more than five years to U.S. whistleblower Edward Snowden's revelations about American spying, as our colleague Vincent Manancourt reports.   \u2014 But there's a but: Somewhat muting the impact, the Luxembourg-based court upheld the legality of instruments used to export data out of Europe, called Standard Contractual Clauses. But the court required EU privacy watchdogs to suspend data transfers to any country where EU standards cannot be met, opening the way for challenges based on the surveillance systems of other countries. The scrutiny on these legal mechanisms was prompted largely by a case brought by privacy campaigner Max Schrems claiming that the U.S. government does not adequately protect Europeans' data when it crosses the Atlantic.   \u2014 What's at stake: A helluva lot. Thousands of companies that rely on either SCCs or the Privacy Shield to export data out of Europe could be sent scrambling, and we've written before about the geopolitical tensions that could arise . The decision will have \u201cdirect, meaningful impacts on the ability of firms established in the EU to conduct business globally, and a particular impact on the largest commercial relationship in the world,\u201d ITI\u2019s senior manager of policy, Alexa Lee, wrote in a blog post ahead of the verdict. \u201cA negative ruling would create enormous legal uncertainty, negatively affecting trade and the economy during the most significant health crisis of this century,\u201d she wrote.   SENATE PANEL TO TAKE UP BILL BANNING TIKTOK ON FEDERAL DEVICES \u2014 The Senate Homeland Security committee will next week take up legislation to ban federal employees from using social media app TikTok on government devices \u2014 escalating Washington\u2019s bout with the company. Sens. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Rick Scott (R-Fla.) introduced the No TikTok on Government Devices Act , S. 3455 (116) , amid concerns that the platform, owned by Chinese tech giant ByteDance, poses national security risks. The session, slated for Wednesday , arrives as Republicans in the House push to include a similar ban in the annual defense policy bill.   \u2014 Speaking of the House: Rep. Ken Buck (R-Colo.), who in May introduced companion House legislation to Hawley and Scott\u2019s Senate bill and is leading the NDAA push , led two-dozen GOP lawmakers in a letter Wednesday to President Trump supporting a potential U.S. ban of TikTok .   \u2014 Meanwhile, in the White House: Chief of staff Mark Meadows weighed in Wednesday on the administration's possible action against the video app. \"I think we are looking at weeks,\u201d he said, according to a pool report, \"not months.\"   COMPETITION CORNER: PANDEMIC MAY LEAVE U.S. EVEN LESS COMPETITIVE  \u2014 The coronavirus pandemic may leave the U.S. economy with a \u201cmissing generation\u201d of start-ups and smaller firms that collapsed or were bought out, even as the biggest U.S. firms get bigger, according to a new essay by a former Obama-administration economist. Nancy Rose, the top economist at the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division from 2016 to 2018, will talk about her essay on how Covid may impact competition at an event hosted today by Brookings\u2019 Hamilton Project.   \u2014 Losing the next Google : \u201cThe smaller firms often are hit harder when there\u2019s a significant downturn,\u201d she told MT. \u201cWe won\u2019t ever know who would have been the next potential entrant to grow larger and become a real competitor.\u201d At the same time, e-commerce giant Amazon and its Whole Foods grocery arm have seen even greater use as consumers move to online shopping and delivery services, said Rose, now an economics professor at MIT.   \u2014  What to do : Rose is advocating for more money and focus on antitrust enforcement, particularly through cases zeroing in on anticompetitive behavior by big firms, or blocking buy-ups of nascent competitors. While she acknowledged that both types of cases are hard to win, particularly given the current state of U.S. antitrust law, \u201cI think we still should try,\u201d she said.     Broadband Land    TODAY: FCC VOTES ON SUICIDE HOTLINE SHORTCODE, BROADBAND  \u2014 The FCC this morning will vote on seven items at its July meeting , including a report and order designating 988 as a new short-code for the national suicide hotline.   \u2014 There\u2019s bipartisan backing for this effort  on both Capitol Hill and at the commission. On Wednesday, the House Energy and Commerce committee unanimously voted on its own legislation, H.R. 4194 , to direct FCC designation of this hotline short-code (they unanimously adopted substitute bill text ). \u201cThe suicide hotline should be just as easy to remember\u201d as 911, Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.) said during Wednesday\u2019s markup. FCC Commissioner Geoffrey Starks noted his support during a Monday session he hosted on Black mental health, while Commissioner Brendan Carr visited a Baltimore mental health center earlier this week to tout the issue .   \u2014 Other items: Commissioners will vote to advance broadband mapping regulations even though Chairman Ajit Pai has said more funding is essential. Commissioners are also set to vote on an order to shield telecom providers from liability for wrongfully blocking calls in the commission\u2019s robocall-fighting efforts.   AND THE FCC\u2019S END-OF-SUMMER AGENDA?  \u2014 Pai also unveiled what the commission will vote on at its Aug. 6 meeting: proposals aimed at curbing high inmate calling costs and bidding procedures for the FCC\u2019s December auction of 5G-friendly C-band airwaves.   \u2014 One notable absence catching MT\u2019s eye: Nothing on carving up the 5.9 GHz airwaves, which are dedicated to automotive safety. Commissioners voted in December on an initial plan to slice up the band to allow more flexible transportation safety tech use and other uses like Wi-Fi. Commissioner Mike O\u2019Rielly not long ago forecast that the FCC would vote to conclude these plans this summer. It looks like that\u2019ll have to wait until fall (the next commission meeting isn\u2019t till Sept. 30).

A message from Facebook:     WATCH: Mark Zuckerberg talks live with Dr. Fauci about COVID-19   Mark Zuckerberg and Dr. Anthony Fauci, the US\u2019s top infectious disease expert, discuss the latest efforts to combat the spread of the COVID-19 virus.   Watch now       Silicon Valley Must Reads    What happened to contact tracing?: \u201cNone of the states that planned to use coronavirus tracking technology developed by Apple and Google have deployed the system to date,\u201d POLITICO reports , \u201cdespite hype from health and business leaders who had hoped it could reduce the virus' spread.\u201d   State Department moves against Huawei: \u201cThe Trump administration is escalating its fight against the Chinese telecom giant Huawei by placing unspecified restrictions on visas of company employees within U.S. borders,\u201d John reports .

Trump <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.blockchaintechnews.com/news/trump-trashes-bitcoin-facebook-libra/\">tweeted out</url> his disapproval of Facebook's Libra and Bitcoin alike.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air. Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity,\" Trump said in a tweet.</p><p>U.S. lawmakers have also been heavily suspicious of cryptocurrency, with members of Congress calling for Facebook to halt development on the cryptocurrency until they can examine it closely. And then, two weeks ago, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.blockchaintechnews.com/news/us-lawmakers-to-question-facebook-on-libra/\">representatives and Senators</url> grilled Facebook executive David Marcus about it.</p><p>\"They're motivated by one thing: surely their own bottom line,\" Sen. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, said in a statement.\u00a0\"Allowing Big Tech companies to take over the payment system or position themselves to influence monetary policy would be a huge mistake.\"</p><p>Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin also\u00a0said\u00a0during a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/18/mnuchin-says-us-will-ensure-bitcoin-doesnt-become-like-anonymous.html\">CNBC interview</url> last month that he would make sure, \"Bitcoin doesn't become the equivalent of Swiss-numbered bank accounts, which were obviously a risk in the financial system.\"</p><p>From these comments, it seems that many lawmakers view cryptocurrency as being a national security issue, and there are a variety of reasons for this perspective.</p><p>\"It's no surprise to see certain US officials align with President Trump on the subject of cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies have boxed technology, economic and governance matters all together,\" Christophe de Courson, CEO of asset management fund Olymp Capital, said in an email. \"Thus, Facebook's Libra is seen as a\u00a0 major threat to the US dollar's supremacy and the role the FED plays in the U.S. economy. \"</p><p>Jose Llisterri, co-founder of cryptocurrency trading platform Interdax, said in an email that a project as large as Libra's could potentially disrupt the U.S. dollar as a global reserve currency, which would certainly qualify as a national security risk.</p><p>On the other hand, Courson believes that regulators are mainly worried about the potential for cryptocurrency to be used for illegal activities and are not looking at the bigger picture of crypto's benefits. However, some experts view this complaint as just being a cover for big banks.</p><p>\"The conflation of cryptocurrency with criminality has become the standard position of big banks because it is their last rhetorical line of defense against a new technology that threatens their stronghold of global financial power,\" Sky Guo, CEO of blockchain platform Cypherium, said in an email. \"Steve Mnuchin, a second-generation career banker and former CIO of Goldman Sachs, has criticized cryptocurrencies in the same week that a shipment owned by his former bank was seized by U.S. Customs authorities for containing over one billion dollars in cocaine. This is far from earnest criticism of our technology.\"</p><p>However, not everyone agrees with this assessment. Lars Seier Christensen, chairman of Concordium, a blockchain network said in an email that is only natural for regulators to take a close eye at the cryptocurrency space.</p><p>\"Regulators would not be doing their job if they did not try to clarify the risks implicit in the cryptocurrency space. Clearly, there are major flaws in the ability to do appropriate KYC and AML monitoring and this has to be a concern for the authorities,\" Christensen said.</p><p>There is a possibility that an early wave of regulation could kill off early adopters, according to Christensen. However, this wave could help the U.S. government nail down the key differences between cryptocurrencies and blockchain and pave the way for mainstream blockchain acceptance.</p><p>\"Blockchain is the real deal, while cryptocurrencies are an accessory oiling the wheels of blockchains. When the cryptocurrency becomes the main item \u2014 like placing the cart in front of the horse \u2014 it falls victim to excessive speculation and sometimes criminal use,\" Christensen said. \"It is essential that we get the message through to politicians that blockchain is a massive growth driver and that with an appropriate design, ID/KYC issues are manageable and in fact, more traceable than in most current business models.\"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"/media/filer_public_thumbnails/filer_public/79/02/79023c22-dfc1-47fa-94df-613b8b3f8a0f/istock-1151040156.jpg__300x170_q85_crop_subsampling-2.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MBLTDY-whyiscryptocurrencyseenasanaturalsecurityissue2</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MBLTDY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XD2-KV71-JB5Y-B45N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">405478</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"730\"/><timeReceived>1:02 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Networld Media Group All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Mobile Payments Today</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 30, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0001RKX</classCode><className>GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Trump tweeted out[1] his disapproval of Facebook's Libra and Bitcoin alike.\"I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air. Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity,\" Trump said in a tweet.U.S. lawmakers have also been heavily suspicious of cryptocurrency, with members of Congress calling for Facebook to halt development on the cryptocurrency until they can examine it closely. And then, two weeks ago, representatives and Senators[2] grilled Facebook executive David Marcus about it.\"They're motivated by one thing: surely their own bottom line,\" Sen. </p><p>Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, said in a statement.\"Allowing Big Tech companies to take over the payment system or position themselves to influence monetary policy would be a huge mistake.\"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin alsosaidduring a CNBC interview[3] last month that he would make sure, \"Bitcoin doesn't become the equivalent of Swiss-numbered bank accounts, which were obviously a risk in the financial system.\"From these comments, it seems that many lawmakers view cryptocurrency as being a national security issue, and there are a variety of reasons for this perspective.\"It's no surprise to see certain US officials align with President Trump on the subject of cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies have boxed technology, economic and governance matters all together,\" Christophe de Courson, CEO of asset management fund Olymp Capital, said in an email. \"Thus, Facebook's Libra is seen as a major threat to the US dollar's supremacy and the role the FED plays in the U.S. economy. \"Jose Llisterri, co-founder of cryptocurrency trading platform Interdax, said in an email that a project as large as Libra's could potentially disrupt the U.S. dollar as a global reserve currency, which would certainly qualify as a national security risk.On the other hand, Courson believes that regulators are mainly worried about the potential for cryptocurrency to be used for illegal activities and are not looking at the bigger picture of crypto's benefits. However, some experts view this complaint as just being a cover for big banks.\"The conflation of cryptocurrency with criminality has become the standard position of big banks because it is their last rhetorical line of defense against a new technology that threatens their stronghold of global financial power,\" Sky Guo, CEO of blockchain platform Cypherium, said in an email. \"Steve Mnuchin, a second-generation career banker and former CIO of Goldman Sachs, has criticized cryptocurrencies in the same week that a shipment owned by his former bank was seized by U.S. Customs authorities for containing over one billion dollars in cocaine. This is far from earnest criticism of our technology.\"However, not everyone agrees with this assessment. Lars Seier Christensen, chairman of Concordium, a blockchain network said in an email that is only natural for regulators to take a close eye at the cryptocurrency space.\"Regulators would not be doing their job if they did not try to clarify the risks implicit in the cryptocurrency space. Clearly, there are major flaws in the ability to do appropriate KYC and AML monitoring and this has to be a concern for the authorities,\" Christensen said.There is a possibility that an early wave of regulation could kill off early adopters, according to Christensen. However, this wave could help the U.S. government nail down the key differences between cryptocurrencies and blockchain and pave the way for mainstream blockchain acceptance.\"Blockchain is the real deal, while cryptocurrencies are an accessory oiling the wheels of blockchains. When the cryptocurrency becomes the main item \u2014 like placing the cart in front of the horse \u2014 it falls victim to excessive speculation and sometimes criminal use,\" Christensen said. \"It is essential that we get the message through to politicians that blockchain is a massive growth driver and that with an appropriate design, ID/KYC issues are manageable and in fact, more traceable than in most current business models.\" [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.blockchaintechnews.com/news/trump-trashes-bitcoin-facebook-libra/\">https://www.blockchaintechnews.com/news/trump-trashes-bitcoin-facebook-libra/</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.blockchaintechnews.com/news/us-lawmakers-to-question-facebook-on-libra/\">https://www.blockchaintechnews.com/news/us-lawmakers-to-question-facebook-on-libra/</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/18/mnuchin-says-us-will-ensure-bitcoin-doesnt-become-like-anonymous.html\">https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/18/mnuchin-says-us-will-ensure-bitcoin-doesnt-become-like-anonymous.html</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-NWMG1183021566300349436251762500072</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NWMG-118302</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WVS-B671-F03R-N2HR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"795\"/><timeReceived>11:25 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Mobilepaymentstoday.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 20, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Chris Coons, </nameText></person>D-Del., who also serves on the Judiciary Committee, said Congress has other options if it runs out of time this year to hold hearings or vote on the Wyden-Poe bill.</p><p>Coons said lawmakers could delay implementation of the rule for six months to give the new Congress more time to hold hearings and thoroughly consider the bill. Congress also could pass legislation next year to undo the rule after it takes effect, Coons said.</p><p>\"More than anything else, the challenge is to get my colleagues to focus on issues like that,\" Coons said. \"I understand that many members are distracted by their reelection campaigns. But that doesn't explain why we're not doing our work.\"</p><p>Sens. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., and Mike Lee, R-Utah, have written a letter urging Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley to hold a hearing. So far, Grassley has not scheduled one.</p><p>\"I am very concerned if we don't even have any hearings on this, that about six months from now, or eight months from now, we're going to find ourselves with some unintended consequences and everyone is going to say how'd that happen?\" said Leahy, who is the senior Democrat on the panel. \"We've still got time to do it. ... With the reaction to what we've seen before in hacking, do we really want to say, oh, but the government can do it?\"</p><p>The Justice Department, which has pushed for the rule, says it's necessary to keep pace with changes in the technology used by criminals, particularly the increased use of \"botnets.\" These are clusters of computers infected by malware that can be controlled remotely and used by hackers to steal financial data.</p><p>Opponents of the new rule say it goes too far, and they've got backing from big tech companies that want it stopped. They are pushing to get a vote on the Stopping Mass Hacking Act, a bipartisan bill that would bar the change in federal criminal procedures from taking effect. Congress is scheduled to return from recess on Nov. 15 for about four weeks of work.</p><p>\"We're really up against the clock,\" said Wyden, who serves on the Senate Intelligence Committee. \"If Congress does what it does best and does nothing, then a lot of people are going to have to explain to their constituents why they let this happen without even a debate.\"</p><p>The controversy centers on an obscure government regulation known as Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The Justice Department began about three years ago to seek changes to it. Those changes were adopted by the U.S. Federal Courts and approved on April 28 by the Supreme Court, which sent them to Congress for review. The new rule will automatically take effect on Dec. 1 unless Congress acts to stop it.</p><p>Federal prosecutors say the updated rule is needed in part to investigate criminals' use of \"botnets.\" The risk became more apparent with the recent release of source code for Mirai, a tool to create botnets that helps hackers take over home devices like DVRs and routers and use their combined power to launch denial of service attacks on targets.</p><p>To thwart criminals, federal agents already hack into victims' computers, but the government could greatly expand that ability under the new rule.</p><p>Currently, FBI agents must go to magistrates in every judicial district where infected computers are known to be located and request warrants to hack into those machines, which may number in the thousands or even the millions and be scattered across the country. The change to Rule 41 would allow them to go to just one judge to get a warrant to access all those computers, regardless of their locations.</p><p>\"For example, agents may seek a search warrant to assist in the investigation of a ransomware scheme facilitated by a botnet that enables criminals abroad to extort thousands of Americans,\" wrote Assistant Attorney General Leslie Caldwell of the Criminal Division in a blog post. She was referring to criminals who install malware in their victims' computers and then demand money to remove it.</p><p>\"This change would not permit indiscriminate surveillance of thousands of victim computers,\" she added.</p><p>But critics of the new rule are skeptical of such assurances.</p><p>\"This is lazy investigation on the part of the DOJ,\" Poe said. \"I never had a policeman come to me when I was a judge and say, 'We're looking for stolen property in a particular neighborhood, and we want one warrant to search every house in the ZIP code.' No judge would agree to that. But the DOJ wants to be able to go to one judge and say, 'We've got 100,000 infected computers, and we want to go in with a single warrant and snoop around. And we're not going to tell the victims.' That's an abuse of power.\"</p><p>Federal agents must make \"reasonable efforts\" to tell people that their property was remotely searched or that their information was seized or copied.</p><p>\"That's not a very high bar,\" said Robyn Greene, policy counsel at New America's Open Technology Institute. \"It's entirely possible that you might never be told.\"</p><p>Google Inc., which opposes the new rule, said government hacking could inadvertently damage victims' computer systems and make them more vulnerable to future cyberattacks after they've been searched and, in some cases, \"cleaned\" by federal agents.</p><p>\"The use of various forms of (hacking) ... are more invasive than other searches because they often have unknown, widespread, and sometimes destructive consequences,\" wrote Richard Salgado, Google's director of law enforcement and information security.</p><p>Wyden said the government would be rehacking Americans who have already been hacked by criminals.</p><p>\"You're essentially hitting an innocent victim twice,\" Wyden said. \"I think people are going to be furious.\"</p><p>Leahy said he believes a public hearing when Congress returns next month is essential.</p><p>\"If we do it publicly, I have a feeling we could bring people across the political spectrum together to accomplish two things: one, protect the privacy of Americans, and secondly, give law enforcement the tools they need to go after everybody from child pornographers to sex traffickers,\" he said.</p><p>Follow @ngaudiano on Twitter.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWJNL-wil-1684549233</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWJNL2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5M19-K9F1-DYJJ-P4BY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">255272</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-05-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1122\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 The News Journal All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The News Journal (Wilmington, Delaware)</publicationName><edition>1 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"10\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>October 25, 2016 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002LOB</classCode><className>DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001020</classCode><className>LEGISLATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009TCX</classCode><className>US DEMOCRATIC PARTY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009TD5</classCode><className>US REPUBLICAN PARTY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008X5W</classCode><className>SPECIAL INVESTIGATIVE FORCES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N813940MM</classCode><className>POLITICAL PARTIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00097CZ</classCode><className>ELECTIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N921100MM</classCode><className>US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkM1MTYwRDE0NkJBNEVFMEIxQjM3RUE2NDRFQUFEODY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA</classCode><className>Federal Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009J0N</classCode><className>CRIMINAL LAW</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEU0RkE1OUQwNUQwNDgxODhEODZCMjkzOTg3NThBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><className>Criminal Law &amp;

Meanwhile, regulators plan to probe four tech giants in particular. The drumbeat to crack down on Facebook, Amazon, Google and Apple is growing louder here in the U.S.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">NPR's Aarti Shahani has been following the latest developments. And Aarti, to begin, it's been a long time - right? - where the American political establishment has been criticized for basically giving tech giants a pass. That doesn't seem to be the case now. What's going on?             </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 Yeah, that's right. The House Judiciary Committee announced yesterday they're going to hold multiple hearings on antitrust issues. So much like we saw lots of investigation and testimony on Russian interference in U.S. elections and the role of Facebook in that, lawmakers are turning to look at the economics of Silicon Valley and equity fairness.             </p><p>                I'd say this shift got a real jump-start with the presidential candidates earlier this year, especially Elizabeth Warren, calling for the breakup of the largest companies. What's interesting with the House move is that it is bipartisan. In a statement, Congressman Doug Collins, a Republican from Georgia - he said lawmakers have got to take a look at whether the market remains competitive. I don't think that means he's going to echo Warren's call any time soon, though.             </p><p>                And it's not just Congress. According to multiple news reports, the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission are going to probe specific companies, and they struck a deal to divide up the work. Justice may take Apple and Alphabet - that's the parent company of Google - and the FTC, Facebook and Amazon.             </p><p>AUDIE CORNISH:                 What's the thinking behind that division of labor?             </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 So antitrust is a quick label for a long list of concerns. One concern is mergers that make a company way too big. The FTC formed a task force a few months back to look at that. Think Facebook acquiring WhatsApp and Instagram, Amazon buying Whole Foods and Audible. So that could be why the FTC is focusing on those two companies.             </p><p>                Meanwhile, critics have raised questions about what's happening inside the big app stores. Are developers of apps getting a fair deal? Are consumers? So it could be that's why Justice would take Google and Apple.             </p><p>AUDIE CORNISH:                 Aarti, how does this compare to the developments in the European Union? They've been at the forefront of the so-called techlash.             </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 Yeah. It is absolutely the case that Europe has acted quicker. They've drafted and passed laws on hate speech. They've leveled multibillion-dollar fines against Google and Apple. But whether or not they're a model of action - well, you know, that depends on who you ask.             </p><p>                I spoke with two lawyers, both antitrust experts - one from Paris, the other Chicago. The Paris lawyer says, listen; you Americans fell asleep at the wheel back in the 1980s. You let your antitrust approach focus way too narrowly on one issue. If consumers are getting a bum deal, because Facebook is free, according to the American approach, it can't be bad. But he said European regulators understand the real problem is competition. When companies get way too big, there's no space for startups.             </p><p>                Now, Randy Picker - he's at the University of Chicago Law School. He thinks the U.S. needs to take a hard look at Big Tech. But he does not want Americans following the European approach, even if they've been far more aggressive.             </p><p>RANDY PICKER:                 I do not think they've accomplished very much. I do not. They've extracted a bunch of money, but have they actually changed competition on the ground in these areas? I don't think so.             </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 He says what might really matter is looking at specific, well-defined ways companies have gotten too much power - say, over data, over industries - and then make them share.             </p><p>AUDIE CORNISH:                 So what can we expect to see in the coming months?             </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 Well, I'd say years, not months. Tech CEOs are going to be sitting in hearings, answering hours of questions, much like we saw Mark Zuckerberg do last year. Investors are going to keep an eye on this. So stocks will go up and down a lot. And this question of whether tech companies are too big - the outsized role they play in everything we do, the fact that one platform can reach, you know, more than two billion people - that's becoming a mainstream political issue.             </p><p>AUDIE CORNISH:                 That's NPR's Aarti Shahani.

Lawmakers sought to determine whether decades-old antitrust laws should be revised to address the realities of the digital age, which the four companies dominate.</p><p>\"When the American people confronted monopolists in the past-be it the railroads and oil tycoons or AT&amp;T and Microsoft-we took action to ensure no private corporation controls our economy or our democracy,\" Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) said in his opening statement. \"We face similar challenges today.\"</p><p>The congressional investigation is one of several inquiries into the tech firms' practices. The Trump administration, federal regulators, and the Justice Department are looking into the four companies' businesses. In September last year, the attorneys general in 50 states and territories opened an antitrust probe of Google's advertising business. Apple is facing scrutiny in the European Union over its App Store practices.</p><p>The scrutiny intensified on July 29 after President Donald Trump said he would take matters in his own hands if Congress fails to deliver a legislative solution.</p><p>\"If Congress doesn't bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders. In Washington, it has been ALL TALK and NO ACTION for years, and the people of our Country are sick and tired of it!\" the president wrote on Twitter.</p><p>The July 29 hearing marked the first congressional appearance of Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon and the world's richest man. In opening remarks, he underlined his humble roots as the son of a single mother in high school.</p><p>Some of Amazon's third-party vendors have accused the online retail giant of using internal data to copy-cat successful products. Critics also argue that the company has virtually cornered the online market in several product categories, especially books.</p><p>Bezos countered the concerns by pointing out that the company faces intense competition, including from companies that have adopted its successful thirdparty marketplace platform. There are now 1.7 million small and medium-sized businesses selling on Amazon's marketplace around the world, he said.</p><p>Bezos devoted a substantial portion of his speech to the collateral benefits of Amazon's growth and wealth, including profits for the shareholders, large-scale innovation, and charitable works.</p><p>\"More than 80% of Amazon shares are owned by outsiders, and over the last 26 years-starting from zero-we've created more than $1 trillion of wealth for those outside shareholders. Who are those shareowners? They are pension funds: fire, police, and school teacher pension funds,\" Bezos said in written testimony.</p><p>In its bipartisan investigation, the Judiciary subcommittee collected testimony from mid-level executives of the four firms, competitors, and legal experts, and pored over more than a million internal documents from the companies.</p><p>Cicilline has called the four companies monopolies, although he says breaking them up should be a last resort. He also said that in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, \"these giants stand to profit\" and become even more powerful as millions shift more of their work and commerce online.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook, is faced with questions that range beyond the topic of market competition. His platform's role as a place to share views and ideas has become the target of conservatives, who say they are singled out for censorship. Recently released undercover videos by investigative journalism outfit Project Veritas show Facebook moderators saying they delete everything conservative and pro-Trump.</p><p>\"Big Tech is out to get conservatives,\" said Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio).</p><p>In the meantime, the company is under pressure from liberals to delete so-called \"hate speech\" and information on controversial topics.</p><p>\"We believe in values-democracy, competition, inclusion, and free expression-that the American economy was built on,\" Zuckerberg said in written testimony.</p><p>\"Ultimately, I believe companies shouldn't be making so many judgments about important issues like harmful content, privacy, and election integrity on their own,\" he added. \"That's why I've called for a more active role for governments and regulators, and updated rules for the internet.\"</p><p>Zuckerberg has said Facebook aims to allow as much free expression as possible unless it causes imminent risk of specific harm or damage.</p><p>European regulators have concluded that Google manipulated its search engine to gain an unfair advantage over other online shopping sites in the e-commerce market, and fined Google, whose parent is Alphabet Inc., a record $2.7 billion. Google has disputed the findings and is appealing.</p><p>\"Google operates in highly competitive and dynamic global markets, in which prices are free or falling, and products are constantly improving,\" Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said in his written testimony. \"Competition in ads-from Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, Comcast, and others-has helped lower online advertising costs by 40% over the last 10 years, with these savings passed down to consumers through lower prices.\"</p><p>Apple, whose iPhone is the third-largest seller in the world, faces EU investigations over the fees charged by its App Store. Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) said lawmakers have learned over the course of the investigation that Apple doesn't share its criteria for approval for the app store and that the rules are \"arbitrarily interpreted and enforced.\"</p><p>Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company treats every developer the same.</p><p>\"We have open and transparent rules,\" Cook said. \"Those rules apply evenly to everyone.\"</p><p>Apple's App Store opened with 500 apps and has grown to 1.7 million today, according to Cook. The App Store business supports more than 1.9 million American jobs, he said.</p><p>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</p><p>If Congress doesn't bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders.</p><p>President Donald Trump</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ENW-2431218047</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">1576348ENW</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60JN-7S81-JC85-J455-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11341</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1100\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Epoch Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Epoch Times</publicationName><issueNumber>No. 760</issueNumber><aggregationName>Ethnic NewsWatch</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 30, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Others</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English UK</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Feature</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Democratic lawmakers criticized the tech companies for buying startups to stifle them and for unfairly using their data hoards to clone and kill off competitors, while Republicans questioned whether the platforms had muzzled conservative viewpoints and were unpatriotic.</p><p>\"As gatekeepers to the digital economy, these platforms enjoy the power to pick winners and losers, shake down small businesses and enrich themselves while choking off competitors,\" said Representative David Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island and chairman of the House Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee. \"Our founders would not bow before a king. Nor should we bow before the emperors of the online economy.\"</p><p>In response, Pichai, Zuckerberg, Cook, and Bezos, who testified via videoconference because of the coronavirus pandemic, were forced to strike a more humble chord. They presented themselves as participants in enormously competitive and fast-changing digital marketplaces, and they evaded questions about the decisions that turned their companies into giants.</p><p>\"We approach this process with respect and humility, but we make no concession on the facts,\" said Cook at the outset of his testimony.</p><p>Not since Microsoft stood trial in the late 1990s for antitrust charges have tech chief executives been under such a microscope for the power of their businesses. With echoes of the trustbusting of U.S. Steel and Standard Oil more than a century ago and AT&amp;T in 1984, the hearing underlined the government's recognition that this cohort of tech companies - which wield immense control over commerce, communications and public discourse - had become the new trusts of the internet age.</p><p>President Trump also used the event to rail against tech power. In a post on Twitter before the hearing began, he said that he would issue executive orders to rein in the companies if Congress did not.</p><p>House lawmakers, who had opened an investigation into the tech companies in June 2019, made the most of it. Representative Jerry Nadler, Democrat of New York, confronted Zuckerberg with the CEO's own e-mails, saying they showed a plot to take out a young competitor. Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio, said Google was biased and asked Pichai whether the company would change its products to help elect Joe Biden for president.</p><p>In one of the sharpest exchanges, Representative Pramila Jayapal, Democrat of Washington, confronted Bezos on accusations that an Amazon lawyer had lied to the committee about how the company develops its own products. She asked him to answer with a yes or no.</p><p>\"I can't answer that question yes or no,\" said Bezos, appearing rattled.</p><p>Yet while the hearing was ripe with theater, any effect will be limited by antitrust laws that were created a century ago and that are imperfect for corralling Internet firms. Since the 1980s, enforcement officials have used the notion of consumer welfare as the predominant test for antitrust violations - generally meaning that if prices are not going up, the markets are most likely competitive enough. The tech giants have generally not driven up prices of digital services or consumer goods; many do not charge at all for services like Google Maps or Instagram.</p><p>While Democrats at the hearing indicated they were more inclined to change antitrust law, Representative Jim Sensenbrenner, Republican of Wisconsin, said he did not think the laws needed to change. Ultimately, Congress doesn't have the power to break up the companies.</p><p>Still, the proceedings provided fuel to other investigations of the tech companies by the Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general. The Justice Department is expected to soon announce charges against Google accusing it of abusing its dominance in online advertising, people with knowledge of the investigation have said. The FTC is preparing to question Zuckerberg under oath in its investigation of Facebook's grip over social networking and acquisitions of nascent rivals.</p><p>\"This is a critical juncture in how the Washington policy clash with the titans of Silicon Valley unfolds,\" said Gene Kimmelman, a former Justice Department antitrust official and a special adviser to consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge.</p><p>Regulators around the world are also moving to limit the power of the tech giants. Europe has led the charge with antitrust investigations, and Margrethe Vestager, the region's top trustbuster, recently vowed to take a harder line on the companies. On Wednesday, Turkey passed legislation giving its government sweeping new powers to regulate social media content.</p><p>The hearing Wednesday was a turnabout from just a few years ago, when Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple were emblems of national pride for their innovation and growth. But the expanding reach of the four - which are involved in everything from smartphones to e-commerce to digital payments - and their stumbles in misinformation, privacy, election interference, and labor issues have increasingly raised hackles.</p><p>Even so, the companies have continued growing as more people live their lives online, with all of them expected to post solid financial performances when they report quarterly earnings Thursday.</p><p>The tone of the hearing was set with Cicilline's very first question, directed at Pichai. \"Why does Google steal content from honest businesses?\" Cicilline asked. Pichai replied: \"Mr. Chairman, with respect, I disagree with that characterization.\"</p><p>Pichai was repeatedly asked about Google's dominance in search and how the company was potentially trying to keep users within \"a walled garden.\" He said Google had many competitors for specific categories of search, such as shopping.</p><p>Zuckerberg was asked about Facebook e-mails in which executives discussed the company's 2012 acquisition of Instagram as a possible strategy to take out a nascent competitor. Zuckerberg said that, in fact, Instagram's success had never been guaranteed and was the result of Facebook's investment in the product.</p><p>When lawmakers asked Bezos if Amazon had bullied small merchants, he said that it was \"not how we operate the business\" - before being confronted by an audio recording of a bookseller begging him directly for relief.</p><p>In response to questions about whether Apple favored some app developers over others, Cook said there were \"open and transparent rules\" that applied \"evenly to everyone.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BGLBCM-GO7A7YGR7MI6VIOXK5RDGFYOUQ</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BGLBCM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G8-CFX1-DXH7-50GN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">469785</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1223\"/><timeReceived>12:59 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>bostonglobe.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 29, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0001YF9</classCode><className>UNITED STATES STEEL CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Democratic lawmakers criticized the tech companies for buying start-ups to stifle them and for unfairly using their data hoards to clone and kill off competitors, while Republicans questioned whether the platforms had muzzled conservative viewpoints and were unpatriotic.</p><p>\u201cAs gatekeepers to the digital economy, these platforms enjoy the power to pick winners and losers, shake down small businesses and enrich themselves while choking off competitors,\u201d said Representative David Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island and chairman of the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s antitrust subcommittee. \u201cOur founders would not bow before a king. Nor should we bow before the emperors of the online economy.\u201d</p><p>In response, Mr. Pichai, Mr. Zuckerberg, Mr. Cook and Mr. Bezos, who testified via videoconference because of the coronavirus pandemic, were forced to strike a more humble chord. They presented themselves as participants in enormously competitive and fast-changing digital marketplaces, and they evaded questions about the decisions that turned their companies into giants.</p><p>\u201cWe approach this process with respect and humility, but we make no concession on the facts,\u201d said Mr. Cook at the outset of his testimony.</p><p>Not since <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/podcasts/the-daily/congress-facebook-amazon-google-apple.html\">Microsoft stood trial in the late 1990s</url> for antitrust charges have tech chief executives been under such a microscope for the power of their businesses. With echoes of the trustbusting of U.S. Steel and Standard Oil more than a century ago and AT&amp;amp;T in 1984, the hearing underlined the government\u2019s recognition that this cohort of tech companies \u2014 which wield immense control over commerce, communications and public discourse \u2014 had become the new trusts of the internet age.</p><p>President Trump also used the event to rail against tech power. In a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/podcasts/the-daily/congress-facebook-amazon-google-apple.html\">post on Twitter</url> before the hearing began, he said that he would issue executive orders to rein in the companies if Congress did not.</p><p>From its conception, the House antitrust hearing was set to be a spectacle, lining up four of the world\u2019s most powerful executives \u2014 with two of them among the planet\u2019s richest individuals \u2014 to answer largely hostile questions together. While the joint appearance limited sustained questioning of any one executive, it created a side-by-side image that recalled the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/podcasts/the-daily/congress-facebook-amazon-google-apple.html\">1994 congressional</url>hearing of top American tobacco executives, who said they did not believe that cigarettes were addictive.</p><p>House lawmakers, who had opened an investigation into the tech companies in June 2019, made the most of it. Representative Jerry Nadler, Democrat of New York, confronted Mr. Zuckerberg with the C.E.O.\u2019s own emails, saying they showed a plot to take out a young competitor. Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio, said Google was biased and asked Mr. Pichai whether the company would change its products to help elect Joseph R. Biden for president.</p><p>In one of the sharpest exchanges, Representative Pramila Jayapal, a Washington Democrat, confronted Mr. Bezos on accusations that an Amazon lawyer had lied to the committee about how the company develops its own products. She asked him to answer whether it misused data with a yes or no.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t answer that question yes or no,\u201d said Mr. Bezos, appearing rattled.</p><p>Yet while the hearing was ripe with theater, any impact will be limited by antitrust laws that were created a century ago and that are <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/podcasts/the-daily/congress-facebook-amazon-google-apple.html\">imperfect for corralling internet firms</url>. Since the 1980s, enforcement officials have used the notion of consumer welfare as the predominant test for antitrust violations \u2014 generally meaning that if prices are not going up, the markets are most likely competitive enough. The tech giants have generally not driven up prices of digital services or consumer goods; many do not charge at all for services like Google Maps or Instagram.</p><p>While Democrats at the hearing indicated they were more inclined to change antitrust law, Representative Jim Sensenbrenner, Republican of Wisconsin, said he did not think the laws needed to change. Ultimately, Congress doesn\u2019t have the power to break up the companies.</p><p>Still, the proceedings provided fuel to other investigations of the tech companies by the Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general. The Justice Department is expected to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/podcasts/the-daily/congress-facebook-amazon-google-apple.html\">soon announce charges against Google</url>accusing it of abusing its dominance in online advertising, people with knowledge of the investigation have said. The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/podcasts/the-daily/congress-facebook-amazon-google-apple.html\">F.T.C. is preparing to question Mr. Zuckerberg</url> under oath in its investigation of Facebook\u2019s grip over social networking and acquisitions of nascent rivals.</p><p>\u201cThis is a critical juncture in how the Washington policy clash with the titans of Silicon Valley unfolds,\u201d said Gene Kimmelman, a former Justice Department antitrust official and a special adviser to the consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge.</p><p>Regulators around the world are also moving to limit the power of the tech giants. Europe has led the charge with antitrust investigations and Margrethe Vestager, the region\u2019s top trustbuster, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/podcasts/the-daily/congress-facebook-amazon-google-apple.html\">recently vowed to take a harder line</url> on the companies. On Wednesday, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/podcasts/the-daily/congress-facebook-amazon-google-apple.html\">Turkey passed legislation</url> giving its government sweeping new powers to regulate social media content.</p><p>The hearing on Wednesday was a turnabout from just a few years ago, when Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple were emblems of national pride for their innovation and growth. But the expanding reach of the four \u2014 which are involved in everything from smartphones to e-commerce to digital payments \u2014 and their stumbles in<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/podcasts/the-daily/congress-facebook-amazon-google-apple.html\">misinformation</url>, privacy, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/podcasts/the-daily/congress-facebook-amazon-google-apple.html\">election interference</url> and labor issues have increasingly raised hackles.</p><p>Even so, the companies have continued growing as more people live their lives online, with all of them expected to post solid financial performances when they report quarterly earnings on Thursday.</p><p>The hearing was made more bizarre by Mr. Bezos, Mr. Cook, Mr. Pichai and Mr. Zuckerberg dialing in remotely using Cisco\u2019s Webex videoconferencing service. Lawmakers \u2014 who mostly appeared in person wearing masks in a House hearing room \u2014 faced empty chairs and a jumbo screen with the faces of the executives, who looked soberly into their cameras.</p><p>Lawmakers nonetheless drilled down on key moments when the companies had gained power or allegedly squeezed consumers, competitors and small businesses. They directed most of their questions to Mr. Zuckerberg and Mr. Pichai, then to Mr. Bezos, according to<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/podcasts/the-daily/congress-facebook-amazon-google-apple.html\">a tally</url> by The New York Times. Mr. Cook was asked the fewest questions.</p><p>The tone of the hearing was set with Mr. Cicilline\u2019s very first question, directed at Mr. Pichai. \u201cWhy does Google steal content from honest businesses?\u201d Mr. Cicilline asked. Mr. Pichai replied: \u201cMr. Chairman, with respect, I disagree with that characterization.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Pichai was repeatedly asked about Google\u2019s dominance in search and how the company was potentially trying to keep users within \u201ca walled garden.\u201d He said Google had many competitors for specific categories of search, such as shopping.</p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg was asked about Facebook emails where executives discussed the company\u2019s 2012 acquisition of Instagram as a possible strategy to take out a nascent competitor. Mr. Zuckerberg said that, in fact, Instagram\u2019s success had never been guaranteed and was the result of Facebook\u2019s investment in the product.</p><p>When lawmakers asked Mr. Bezos if Amazon had bullied small merchants, he said that it was \u201cnot how we operate the business\u201d \u2014 before being confronted by an audio recording of a bookseller begging him directly for relief.</p><p>In response to questions about whether Apple favored some app developers over others, Mr. Cook said there were \u201copen and transparent rules\u201d that applied \u201cevenly to everyone.\u201d</p><p>David Heinemeier Hansson, the co-founder of Basecamp, a project-management company that has battled with both Google and Apple over their market power, said the hearing would be irrelevant if the government did not act to rein in the tech giants.</p><p>\u201cWhat we ultimately need is relief. We don\u2019t just need a historic moment. We need this to lead to legislation and regulation and enforcement,\u201d he said.</p><p>But, Mr. Heinemeier Hansson added, \u201cthankfully I\u2019ve never been more optimistic for that than I am right now.\u201d</p><p>Reporting was contributed by Jack Nicas, Mike Isaac, Daisuke Wakabayashi, Karen Weise and Kellen Browning.</p><p>PHOTOS: Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook chief executive, testifying Wednesday via teleconference before a House antitrust subcommittee.

That frustrated some of the lawmakers at the hearing, held by the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust.</p><p>\u201cThe fact that you\u2019re coming here without any specifics I think reinforces the impression that federal antitrust enforcement is an empty suit,\u201d said Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut. \u201cWhat the public sees is a facade with respect to Big Tech \u2014 and no immediate prospect of urgency or active enforcement.\u201d</p><p>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/technology/tech-investigations.html\">Read more: 16 ways Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon are in the government\u2019s cross hairs.</url>]</p><p>The tech giants are embroiled in investigations around the world over concerns they have abused their market power. In the United States, federal agencies and House lawmakers are looking into the power and influence of Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook. Many state attorneys general have announced investigations into Facebook and Google.</p><p>The scrutiny has helped upend the companies\u2019 usual place in Washington, where they have long been cheered on as pillars of innovation and a major engine of the country\u2019s economy. The companies\u2019 troubles have escalated in recent years from a range of scandals, including how they handle consumer data and their role in spreading disinformation during the 2016 presidential election.</p><p>In July, the Federal Trade Commission approved a fine of roughly $5 billion against Facebook for mishandling users\u2019 personal information, by far the largest fine against a technology company in the United States. But Senator Josh Hawley, a conservative Republican from Missouri, on Tuesday questioned Mr. Simons of the F.T.C. about whether the settlement was too weak.</p><p>Mr. Hawley homed in on the fact that the agency never talked to Facebook\u2019s top executives during the privacy investigation, using it to suggest that there could be a lack of determination at the agency.</p><p>\u201cDid you interview Mark Zuckerberg during your investigation?\u201d Mr. Hawley asked Mr. Simons. \u201cDid you interview Sheryl Sandberg during the investigation?\u201d</p><p>Mr. Simons answered no to both questions.</p><p>Concerns about the tech companies vary. Facebook is accused of shutting out nascent competitors. Google has drawn scrutiny for its smartphone software, ad and search businesses. Critics say Amazon uses its knowledge of independent merchants on its platform to make competing generic products. And software developers chafe at Apple\u2019s status as a gatekeeper for iPhone apps.</p><p>At the federal level, Mr. Simons and Mr. Delrahim have divided up responsibility for handling antitrust complaints about the companies. The Justice Department took Google and Apple, and the F.T.C. got Facebook and Amazon.</p><p>The regulators and companies have confirmed only two formal investigations. Google<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/technology/tech-investigations.html\">disclosed in August</url> that it had received a formal request from the Justice Department for information related to a previous investigation of the company, signaling a new inquiry was underway. Facebook is       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/technology/tech-investigations.html\">the subject</url> of an F.T.C. antitrust investigation related to its acquisition of other services.</p><p>But the accord between the agencies appears tenuous. Lawmakers pressed the regulators on Tuesday on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/technology/tech-investigations.html\">reports</url> that they were at odds over the investigations.</p><p>When Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, said it sounded like \u201cthings have broken down at least in part\u201d between the agencies, Mr. Simons replied: \u201cI would agree with that.\u201d Asked later to expand on his comments, Mr. Simons declined.</p><p>Mr. Delrahim also acknowledged that there was some overlap on the tech investigations.

Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.) opened the hearing of the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Commerce by slamming Facebook's new policy.</p><p>\"Big Tech failed to respond to the grave threats posed by deepfakes, as evidenced by Facebook scrambling to announce a new policy that strikes me as wholly inadequate,\" Schakowsky, the subcommittee chairwoman, said, noting that the video of Pelosi has already been viewed millions of times.</p><p>Facebook's new policy bans videos that have been \"edited or synthesized\" by technology like artificial intelligence in a way that is not \"apparent to an average person.\"</p><p>The social media giant's vice president of global policy management, Monika Bickert, stressed during Wednesday's testimony that the new rule is an addition to a broad set of existing community standards intended to target disinformation.</p><p>Schakowsky pressed Bickert on whether the new policy would cover the edited Pelosi video.</p><p>\"It would not fall under that policy, but it would still be subject to our other policies that address misinformation,\" Bickert explained.</p><p>Democrats on the committee suggested that more stringent regulations would be necessary to deal with deepfakes, but some of their colleagues across the aisle expressed concern about stifling innovation and expression with new regulations.</p><p>\"Deepfakes and disinformation can be handled with innovation and empowering people with more information,\" subcommittee ranking member Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.) said in her opening remarks. \"It makes far more productive outcomes when people can make the best decisions for themselves, rather than relying on the government to make decisions for them.\"</p><p>Lawmakers though pressed Bickert to better clarify the rules, with one Republican, Rep. Larry Bucshon (Ind.), asking the Facebook executive how the company identified an \"average person\" under their guidelines for detecting deepfakes.</p><p>Bickert said the company was working with experts to detail the best approach.</p><p>\"Congressman, these are exactly the questions we've been discussing with more than 50 experts as we've tried to write this policy,\" Bickert replied, adding that Facebook is focused on making more information available to the public.</p><p>Critics have also called Facebook's new policy vague.</p><p>\"The notion of misleading an average person ... in order to evaluate this policy as good, bad or pretty much impotent \u00af which is what I see it as \u00af you would need to know what the process of adjudication is here and how they're considering these issues,\" Britt Paris, an expert on audiovisual manipulation at Rutgers University, told The Hill. \"It's pretty toothless and incompetent language.\"</p><p>A spokesperson for Facebook declined to clarify the term further to The Hill.</p><p>Facebook is one of many tech giants struggling to deal with disinformation on their platforms, but the company has been a particular target for critics over its refusal to take down the edited videos of Pelosi and Biden.</p><p>Spokesmen for both Pelosi and Biden were quick to blast Facebook's policies as being inadequate.</p><p>\"Facebook's announcement today is not a policy meant to fix the very real problem of disinformation that is undermining faith in our electoral process, but is instead an illusion of progress,\" Biden campaign spokesman Bill Russo told The Hill.</p><p>\"Facebook's policy does not get to the core issue of how their platform is being used to spread disinformation, but rather how professionally that disinformation is created. Banning deepfakes should be an incredibly low floor in combating disinformation. Today's announcement falls short of the mark again,\" he said.</p><p>Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill tweeted on Tuesday that the \"real problem is Facebook's refusal to stop the spread of disinformation.\"</p><p>Rep. Darren Soto (D-Fla.) pressed Facebook about its approach to manipulated videos that don't qualify as deepfakes during the hearing.</p><p>\"Why wouldn't Facebook simply take down the fake Pelosi video?\" he asked.</p><p>\"Our approach is to give people more information, so that if something's going to be in the public discourse they will know how to assess it, how to contextualize it,\" Bickert responded.</p><p>\"[The Pelosi video] was labeled false at the time, we think we could have gotten that to fact-checkers quicker and we think the label could have been clearer. We now have the label for something that has been rated false [so] you have to click through it, it actually obscures the image.\"</p><p>The emergence of deepfakes, which use technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning to manipulate videos, has raised serious concerns from lawmakers.</p><p>The technology has not advanced far enough for forged videos to be indistinguishable from real ones, but experts warn that moment is rapidly approaching.</p><p>\"We're in a technological arms race, as detection technology improves, so does the deceptive technology,\" Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. (D-N.J.), the chairman of the full Energy and Commerce Committee, said during Wednesday's hearing.</p><p>Many experts have warned that along with the increasing quality of deepfakes, the proliferation of artificial intelligence technology may soon allow any online user to create deepfakes.</p><p>The concerns from lawmakers at the hearing were echoed by testimony from experts who said social media platforms should do more to stop simple forms of deceptive content.</p><p>Cheapfakes \u00af like the slowing down or selective cropping used in the Pelosi and Biden videos \u00af \"are a wider threat,\" Joan Donovan, research director of the Technology and Social Change Project at the Harvard Kennedy School, said at the hearing.</p><p>\"The world online is the real world, and this crisis of counterfeits threatens to disrupt the way Americans live our real lives,\" she continued.</p><p>\"Right now, malicious actors jeopardize how we make informed decisions about who to vote for and what causes we support, while platform companies' own products facilitate this manipulation, placing our democracy and economy at significant risk.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HILLNW-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HILLNW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y5W-JKT1-DYTB-V015-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">153182</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1101\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright  2020 Capitol Hill Publishing Corp.

I hope that in this coming year we'll do that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ELIZABETH MACDONALD, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: Senate Democrats now face a painful reckoning with Democrats friends at Facebook. They fired off a letter to CEO Mark Zuckerberg asking, \" you, Facebook, are you undermining democracy?\" That's a quote. \"Are you using your massive data collection to get information to undermine your critics and even elected officials doing scrutiny at Facebook?\" The senators ask the Justice Department to broaden its probe as Mark Zuckerberg now says Facebook is, quote, \"at war with its critics.\"</p><p>But the real war is actually inside Facebook. Finger pointing. Lame shifting. Tensions with COO Sheryl Sandberg and Mark Zuckerberg. We've got more details tonight.</p><p>Democratic New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio creating yet another controversy saying he loves Amazon but he hates Wal-Mart. Again, should politicians be picking winners and losers? We've got that debate.</p><p>And we've got on the Florida recount circus. A top official resigning. Also, the new threat to America's military. This one is in our own backyard. The Weekly Standard's Fred Barnes weighs in.</p><p>Plus, the mayor of Tijuana, Mexico agreeing with President Trump saying there are criminals in the illegal immigrant caravan. A surprising new government date shows 500 criminals potentially in the caravan flow. Former White House press secretary Sean Spicer is here on that.</p><p>Well, thank you so much for joining us. Thank you for watching. Money, politics, we've got the debate behind tomorrow's headlines. I'm Elizabeth MacDonald. THE EVENING EDIT starts right now.</p><p>We check your 401K the Dow plunging 400 points. Trade fight with China, Boeing, had took some hits. Big tech drags down the market as things at Facebook continue to go from bad to terrible. So bad that Apple's Tim Cook warns the tech crowd overall. Watch out, regulation is coming.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE: I am not a big fan of regulation. I'm a big believer in the free market. But we have to admit when the free market isn't working and it hasn't worked here. And I think it's inevitable that there will be some level of regulation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: Worry about Democrat senators asking the Justice Department to widen its probe into Facebook. The senators ratcheting this fight up to a whole new level.</p><p>In the senator's letter to Facebook the senators asking hey, you, Facebook, you used outside contractors to retaliate against your critics by spreading inflammatory information about your critics.</p><p>So, have you, Facebook, have you ever used your own data platform to collect information to use against your critics including elected officials, elected officials who scrutinize you, including leaks to the media. All of this in possible violation of campaign laws.</p><p>Let's bring in one of the smartest guys around. He's Wall Street Journal assistant editor, James Freeman. These are pretty serious charges, James. By the way, thanks for joining us.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, WALL STREET JOURNAL: Yes. Well, you introduce like that, so I'll show up any time.</p><p>Yes, they are serious. As you said a lot of money, a lot of politics here. I guess some --I think Consumers ought to be wary here. They ought to be wary that there is some kind of a big deal between Silicon Valley and Washington to regulate this industry. It may sound good, but I think a lot of downside if you prevent competition against Facebook which is normally what regulation does.</p><p>MACDONALD: So, you are saying the market can fix the problem.</p><p>FREEMAN: I would hope so. You know, this question of Tim Cook there saying the market failed. I don't think so. I think we all know consumers that we've been trading information about ourselves in return for a lot of free services from Facebook--</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN: -- for years. You know, maybe this is a helpful reminder to people.</p><p>MACDONALD: Al right. I know that you are pretty cynical about Facebook's aptitude to do things.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FREEMAN: I would be myself as optimistic--</p><p>MACDONALD: I know you're optimistic.</p><p>FREEMAN: -- about what the markets can do.</p><p>MACDONALD: I understand what you mean. But here is the thing. Zuckerberg is under fire. The Senate Democrats are saying hey, you can't regulate yourself.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD: I'm not -- the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times stories about Facebook have been bombshells. Nobody knew the scope of what Facebook was doing to undermine its critics, right?</p><p>So, now Facebook is saying we're at war with our critics at the same time that they really can't regulate themselves. That's the issue, right.</p><p>FREEMAN: Well, I don't think any business is going to regulate itself. I think talk about self-regulation is kind of na\u2039ve. What you want is market discipline, you want customers with the ability to regulate the behavior of the provider. And if this kind of a wakeup call to people it would be more demanding as customers to look for other options, maybe that's a good thing.</p><p>But I think a lot of what's happening here is especially you mentioned that all those you've showed the Democrats really leading this attack, they are very upset that Facebook did not agree with their analysis that Russians meddling online swayed the 2016 or swung the 2016 election from--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: But they are pretty powerful. They got a lot of power.</p><p>FREEMAN: They are.</p><p>MACDONALD: What if they are using their data platform to undermine elected officials who scrutinize it. That's a heavy charge. That's a big deal.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes. I also I would worry big time about what they're doing in terms of censorship. They have thousands of editors now, are they knocking out voices they don't like. I think maybe Congress might want to relook at the 1990's decision to give social media platforms kind of protections that normal companies don't have.</p><p>MACDONALD: It's a good question.</p><p>FREEMAN: And let's -- that is a good question.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes. We'll have you back on it.</p><p>FREEMAN: It sounds good.</p><p>MACDONALD: I'll continue to say you're terrific. Thank you for--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FREEMAN: Any time.</p><p>MACDONALD: OK. Switching gears. After last week's announcement that Amazon will open one of its two new headquarters in New York City, Democrat Mayor Bill de Blasio basically said that he likes Amazon but he doesn't like Wal- Mart. He does not like Wal-Mart's behavior when it comes to labor and the environment. That's the mayor said. He even took a swipe at the Walton family over their politics.</p><p>Let's bring in the Daily Signal's Kelsey Harkness and former D.C. Chamber of Commerce chairman, Scott Bolden. Good to see both you guys.</p><p>SCOTT BOLDEN, FORMER CHAIR, D.C. CHAMBER OF COMMERCE: Good seeing you.</p><p>KELSEY HARKNESS, SENIOR REPORTER, DAILY SIGNAL: Good to see you.</p><p>MACDONALD: Kelsey, what do you think of this story.</p><p>HARKNESS: This should be frightening to all Americans regardless of your political perspective because what the mayor of New York City basically just said is that he didn't allow a company into New York City in part because of the owners of that company's political views.</p><p>Furthermore, I think there's a lot of hypocrisy going on here because of course Amazon and Wal-Mart have very different business model models. But ultimately what they're doing is attempting to provide items in mass to Americans at cheaper prices. And for them to roll out the red carpet for Amazon, giving them billions of dollars in tax incentives--</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes.</p><p>HARKNESS: -- and then block at Wal-Mart I think that is so hypocritical.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know, Scott, Mayor de Blasio he said that Wal-Mart undermines local retailers but then Amazon has been criticizing that too, right? Even though Amazon does have a lot of small businesses on its own web site.</p><p>BOLDEN: Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD: Other retailers can't really compete with it. You know what I mean, Scott?</p><p>BOLDEN: Yes. But let me tell you. The biggest difference I see is that Amazon is an internet sensation retailer as opposed to a big box retailer like Wal-Mart. I'm not saying one is better than the other.</p><p>I'm saying each company when they come to your jurisdiction, I live in D.C. and we've got Wal-Mart and now the Amazon is coming in Crystal City, they have to negotiate with politicians because they need land, they need space, they impact the economy, and a lot of them need tax incentives and that gives politicians license to either extract more or to comment or to pick and choose.</p><p>I didn't say it was right, but I got to tell you it happens all the time.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes.</p><p>BOLDEN: And these are complicated negotiations that start a long time before you to either see a Wal-Mart or you see the headquarters or second headquarters for Amazon.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes, I hear you, Scott. And Kelsey, Scott makes an important point here. The other issue too and the other side of that and I want to hear what Scott says about this.</p><p>What if the, you know, Albany or the state capitals just flatten the tax structure instead of handing out goodies in the form of tax breaks, a lot of Democrats work at Wal-Mart. What if New Yorkers do want a Wal-Mart too, you know. There's all sorts of angles here, right, Kelsey?</p><p>HARKNESS: Absolutely. I think that's the biggest irony of this whole Amazon H.Q. two story is that in many ways it makes the case for deregulating the economy and lowering taxes. New York would have had to incentivize Amazon to go there had they had an economy like you see in Texas that's already working. Instead, they had to basically bag Amazon via a lot of cronyism. I would argue to get them to another city.</p><p>MACDONALD: What do you--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLDEN: Well--</p><p>HARKNESS: And taxpayers are the ones who are paying for that.</p><p>MACDONALD: Go ahead, Scott.</p><p>BOLDEN: Yes, flattening the tax rate in any jurisdiction simply wouldn't be enough and it would take a long time for it to even, even out. The reality is this. You're going to have these negotiations and you are going to have these competitions and the municipalities of the states have the power to give these tax incentives and tax breaks like they would any other company, if you will.</p><p>MACDONALD: I hear you.</p><p>BOLDEN: And in giving those tax breaks what they get in return, at least in Crystal City is a $5 billion investment that improves infrastructure, the airport and what have you. It's hard to turn that down. It's hard to say they shouldn't be competition.</p><p>MACDONALD: And Scott, you have been in the forefront of this, you at the Chamber of Commerce in D.C. you've seen this first-hand even in the front trenches of this. Quickly, I just want to -- Kelsey, I just want to ask Scott a follow up.</p><p>The argument about this too, Scott, is what about the guys and gals in upstate New York who are basically are paying for Amazon to come here twice what people in Virginia are paying and they're kind of, you know, saying, hey what about us in upstate New York?</p><p>BOLDEN: Well, it's the cost of living difference and a lot of environmental and environmental economics what I call, and so those numbers are going to be different. If I was a partner at a law firm like mine in New York I'd probably be making more money than here because it's a different market.</p><p>MACDONALD: Kelsey, Scott, you've been great. Thank you so much. I appreciate it.</p><p>HARKNESS: Thank you.</p><p>BOLDEN: Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD: Now to more big executives behaving badly. The fallout mounting after the chairman of Nissan auto legend, Carlos Ghosn arrested in Japan on charges of hiding millions of dollars in compensation from Japanese authorities. Potentially French authorities, as well also alleged to have padded his expense account use an investment fund. Also, with the hiding of his compensation avoiding the tax man.</p><p>Hillary Vaughn with the details. Hillary?</p><p>HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Liz. Well, disappointment indignation and despair. Those are the words from Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa reacting to the news that their chairman Carlos Ghosn had been arrested following a long internal investigation at the company that reveal that the chairman frauded them by using company assets for his own use. Also misusing company investment and underreporting his salary for several years by about 44 million in U.S. dollars.</p><p>In a shocking emotional hour and half talk to the press the CEO try to put as much distance between Ghosn and the rest of the company as possible, really framing this as a betrayal as the result of a long regime of power under Ghosn that really didn't have any checks and balances in place.</p><p>So, the CEO is saying he's going to seriously reflect on what changes need to be made at the company to make sure that this does not happen again. He's also trying to reassure two other automakers that are kind of caught up in all of this. You have Mitsubishi and Renault, the French car company that is in the partnership and Ghosn was really at the head of all of this.</p><p>So Saikawa promising that this three-partnership alliance will not be jeopardized as a result of this, saying they will try to minimize any confusion. He also says that they're going to have to correct their securities report that the company published because Ghosn lied to regulators about how much his salary was.</p><p>You also have Saikawa saying he can't promise that there's going to be zero impact on their sales because of this controversy. So he's not ruling out the possibility that Nissan may file a civil lawsuit against Ghosn for this entire scandal and his misconduct at the company that really is cause shareholders to suffer some incredible losses.</p><p>The board is set to meet Thursday to officially remove him from the board. Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD: Thank you, Hillary. A quick check in the market. The Dow, the NASDAQ, and the S&amp;P were all down today. We're going to stay in that story for you throughout the hour.</p><p>To the battle for the border, homeland security now estimates -- estimates, rather, 500 criminals are in the caravans headed to the border. Fox News William La Jeunesse is in Tijuana, Mexico with more. William?</p><p>WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Well, Liz, I am at the San Isidro port of entry. And earlier today, for the first time ever, the United States shut down this border because they believed and said that the migrants were going to storm this area and go to the vehicle lanes in the United States, so they closed it. They brought an additional K-rails like you see here, and barb wire.</p><p>But I want to say this, and I think we have some video from that we shot yesterday. You know, Mexico has his invisible river of migrants coming up from Central America. They have had for generations using it as a stepping off for the United States.</p><p>Well, yesterday, about 1,000 Mexicans protested those illegal immigration, throwing bottles and cans. So, riot police shouting via to Mexico saying Hondurans go home, immigration yes, invaders no. And then they storm a police barricade outside of migrant shelter.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You see people, you know, within the migrant caravan smoking weed, drinking, throwing rocks at the cops, causing chaos.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Some of these people that are coming into this with these caravans are committing crimes, and so we are protesting. I am protesting that we want the government to take control.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEUNESSE: So, critics say these activists are leading the caravan giving them false hope that's a mistake they cannot easily cross illegally and the asylum claims is going to be five weeks away. They are in shelters now after just days looking like a refugee camp of human waste and misery. Supporters. however, say, Mexico owes them hospitality and protection.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It feels like they invaded and that was not the correct way, but I know all of them are not like that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're here for work to have a better life and no trouble. We're not trouble makers.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEUNESSE: So, about 6,000 migrants from that caravan are now in Tijuana Department of Homeland securities as there are 10,000 right along the border, and you see from those follow-on copycat caravans, Liz, but this one particularly how they came their numbers seem to awaken the silent, but now vocal minority against them. Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD: Great report. William La Jeunesse, thank you so much. I appreciate it, sir.</p><p>We have former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer with us tonight. He is now the senior advisor of the America First Action PAC. Coming up, he will be talking about the caravan crisis and the president's threat to shut down the government if he does not get money for his border wall.</p><p>In other headline news, Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi dropping the hammer on Walgreens and CBS alleging they have roles in fueling the opioid crisis gripping the country. Basically, they were added to a previously filed lawsuit targeting opioid distributors and manufacturers.</p><p>And in case you missed it, look at this video during the Macau Grand Prix over the weekend. A driver lost control of her race car driving head-on into a fence, it went airborne. That driver is Sophia Floersch. She's only 17 years old. Gracefully she survived the crash, but she fractured her spine. She is undergoing surgeries.</p><p>And to a grizzly scene for Washington Redskins quarterback Alex Smith, he broke two bones in his leg. The 34-year-old Smith underwent surgery. McCoy replaced him in the game, almost led the Redskins to a comeback win over the Houston Texans but the Texans won.</p><p>Coming up, Florida officials had damaged the state election legitimacy by turning the recount into a lawless circus. Broward County official Brenda Snipes resigns after a cascade of problems with this official. The question now is this a warm-up for the 2020 presidential race? We've got the details.</p><p>Plus, we dig deeper into the deadly Northern California fires. Eighty dead, nearly 1,000 missing and it continues to look worse and worse for Democrat Governor Jerry Brown.</p><p>We'll be right back. Stay there.</p><p>MACDONALD: Scenes from California too harrowing to believe. Eighty dead, nearly 1000 missing. And this year alone upwards of 5,600 fires have burned 2,100 square miles in California. That's bigger than the size of Delaware, it's twice the size of Rhode Island.</p><p>This as a new PG&amp;E information is coming to light. That utility now admits the problems with the second power line on the morning that the fire started in Butte County in Northern California. They admitted it late last week. California officials have taken into custody equipment from PG&amp;E. Fire investigators are on the scene.</p><p>And questions are mounting for Governor Jerry Brown. He recently signed off on legislation protecting utilities like PG&amp;E. And former top executives at that utility are part of Jerry Brown's top staff.</p><p>With me now on the phone is Scott McLean of the California Department of forestry and fire protection. Scott, thank you so much. I hear that you guys now face 4 inches of rain is there a problem now with mudslides. What's this going to do for you guys, and the recovery, Scott.</p><p>SCOTT MCLEAN, INFORMATIONOFFICER, CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTION: There's a lot of different predictions out there. Anywhere from an inch to 4 inches and then hoping we're going to see an inch if not two.</p><p>Sue of the rain there's a couple of things that case a problem. Keep in mind that where the firefighters are working currently on, they can't fire. They're working on the south, southeast corner of that fire. Heavy terrain, basically mountain, they are dealing with steep topography inaccessible in some areas. And we basically cut roads and with bulldozers so you have dig roads right now and dig trail.</p><p>So, unfortunately when the rain comes it's going to turn to it to mud so those firefighters on top of houses, they are already dealing be are going to be dealing with trying to get in and out of those areas.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes. Scott. PG&amp;E and Governor Brown have been in the spotlight. Consumer Watchdog's president Jamie Court he was in Los Angeles. He was on our show. Let's take a listen to what he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMIE COURT, CEO, CONSUMER WATCHDOG: The governor has been a very big partition for PG&amp;E and the other utilities in the state. His top aides have come from PG&amp;E. He's gotten millions of dollars from the three investor- owned utilities and he's protected them.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: Your take on less that, Scott.</p><p>MCLEAN: I won't address that due to the ongoing investigation and (Inaudible) taking at this time.</p><p>MACDONALD: PG&amp;E customers may have ending -- end up footing the bill for the liability claims. The company may turn to its own customers to help cover the cost it could turn into a rate increase for customers, Scott. What's your reaction to that?</p><p>MCLEAN: Again, I can only discuss the fire aspect of that. I don't know the PG&amp;E business.</p><p>MACDONALD: OK. Here is the fire aspect. This is all over the California newspapers and California state have said this. Seventeen of the 21 major fires in Northern California, according to state official in California have been blamed on PG&amp;E. What is your take on that?</p><p>MCLEAN: Again, due to the ongoing legal aspect of those, I cannot -- I will not discuss.</p><p>MACDONALD: Well, how are the firefighters doing, sir?</p><p>MCLEAN: Firefighters as you can imagine, you talk about the weather it's 30-degree weather, first thing in the morning during the first night as well, so they're dealing with the weather. They are working 24-hour shifts. They are doing a fantastic job.</p><p>Keep in mind the first day Thursday morning these firefighters as they arrived to this instance were put in to rescue mode rescuing thousands and thousands of people. They're just phenomenal. They're tired, they're getting the job done.</p><p>MACDONALD: It's believable. We'll stay on the story. Scott, thank you so much for being on the show with us tonight. We appreciate it.</p><p>MCLEAN: Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD: We're going to be right back. Stay right there.</p><p>MACDONALD: Welcome back. We're coming into the bottom of the hour.</p><p>After nearly two weeks and multiple recounts, Florida's recount circus finally over. Republican Governor Rick Scott defeating Democrat incumbent Bill Nelson for the Senate. And Republican Congressman Ron DeSantis winning the governorship over Democrat Andrew Gillum.</p><p>Also, this as a Broward County's election chief Brenda Snipes resigns.</p><p>Fox News Phil Keating has the story for us. Phil?</p><p>PHIL KEATING, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Yes. Can you imagine 12 long days of counting and recounting and lawsuits, but yes, 2018 Florida election is finally over. And here in beleaguered Broward County, the much-maligned supervisor of elections will soon be gone as well.</p><p>Aside from the actual races themselves, the other big election winners were all the people, locally and nationally, who have been demanding Broward Elections Chief Brenda Snipes resign or be removed after 15 years in office. Election problems have plagued her career, misplacing ballots, losing ballots, et cetera.</p><p>And this year, the nation again watched Broward messed it up, missing the recount deadline to upload the painstakingly second round of results by just two minutes.</p><p>In Snipes' resignation letter, she writes, \"although I have enjoyed this work tremendously over these many elecion cycles, both large and small, I am ready to pass the torch.\" She sent that letter up to the secretary of state's office in Tallahassee. She was appointed to this position by then Governor Jeb Bush.</p><p>And so the next supervisor of elections here to replace her because Snipes is stepping down on January 4th will be a short-term fill-in because Snipes' term expires in 2020. Twenty-twenty happens to be enormously important presidential election year and both parties really want to have somebody competent and some efficiency in the Broward County Department of Elections for that big race two years from now.</p><p>So Snipes will be gone in January and there is already at least three people throwing their name in the ring to be the next temporary supervisor of elections.</p><p>MACDONALD: Phil Keating. Great to see you, Phil. Thank you so much. Let's bring in Fred Barnes of The Weekly Standard. He is the executive editor there. I mean, this has been one lawless circus, Fred.</p><p>FRED BARNES, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, WEEKLY STANDARD: Well, it is, and it has been that for a while. I don't think it is going to be dramatically better in 2020. I mean, they are just -- after the election, there are a lot of ballots sitting around. You have provisional ballots. You have absentee ballots. You have mail ballots. They are all over the place. There are boxes of them.</p><p>And of course Democrats like to have some running room after the election where they can see what's there. In some cases, I suspect decide which are legitimate ballots and which are not. Republicans would like everything to stop on election day. Nothing after that or as little as possible.</p><p>Particularly, in the two big Democratic counties that have so many people, Palm Beach County and Broward County, they fear that Democrats are going to pull some tricks.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know, to your point, Fred, you make a good point, I mean, even CNN's John King said the Democrats were hoping the courts, the judges will bend the laws for the Democrats.</p><p>BARNES: Sure.</p><p>MACDONALD: And Fred, what's so interesting, I like your take on this, here is what The Washington Post's Marc Thiessen pointed out last week. Democrats, what they were actually doing to break the laws and bend them, they were asking things, like they were asking judges to change the Florida laws, to include ineligible votes.</p><p>They were blowing off deadlines including late vote by mail ballots that arrived after the deadline, asked those be counted. The mismatched signatures, they are supposed to be fixed, Fred, by 5:00 p.m. the day before the election.</p><p>BARNES: Right.</p><p>MACDONALD: Democrats pushing to get those counted. Now, federal prosecutors looking into Democrat Florida officials urging voters to fix their ballots after election day. Fred, this is about blowing up deadlines, isn't it?</p><p>BARNES: It is. It will probably happen again. It's been done before. And certainly the fact that judges will go along with blowing up deadlines and letting things happen, vote counting and so on to happen after the election, days, weeks after the election, that just encourages it to be tried again.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know, Fred, you have been such an astute observer of politics for so long and you've helped the country with so much of your insights. I am not just blowing smoke here. I have read your columns for a very long time. What is your chief worry? What is you major concern about the 2020 presidential race when it comes to just what we had to go through with Florida?</p><p>BARNES: Well, Florida, I think, stands out for a couple of reasons. Most states will not like Florida. I live in Virginia and there has never really been any problems with the honesty of elections, and I think that's true in many, many states.</p><p>But there are still pockets in cities all around the country where people don't feel they can go as vote watchers and be safe. It's a problem that I think -- it's something we have in politics. It is still going to be there. In a close election, it can decide things.</p><p>MACDONALD: I'm worried about copycats. Other states doing what Florida did, right, Fred? Final point.</p><p>BARNES: Absolutely.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yeah.</p><p>BARNES: Except a number of these states already do it.</p><p>MACDONALD: That's a good point. Fred Barnes, you're terrific. Come back soon.</p><p>BARNES: OK.</p><p>MACDONALD: Coming up, again, we're going to return to this story, protesters in Tijuana, Mexico taking to the streets of Mexico, saying no to the caravan, pointing out all sorts of problems within that caravan.</p><p>The media has not stayed on the story about what exactly is going on inside the caravan. Now, the mayor of Tijuana, he is agreeing with President Trump. The Tijuana mayor is saying yes, there are criminals in there.</p><p>We have Sean Spicer, former White House press secretary. He is now with America First Action PAC. He is coming up next on that.</p><p>But first, right now might be exactly the wrong time to cut defense spending. It could happen. I'm going to tell you what is going on there. Stay with us.</p><p>MACDONALD: Well, it's Thanksgiving. We give thanks to our military, our soldiers. We want to get them more money, more help. President Trump, he did ask each cabinet agency including defense to cut five percent or more from their budgets. That was before an alarming new report found that the American military could possibly actually lose wars with Russia and China. So the question tonight is, is it the wrong time to cut defense spending?</p><p>Joining me now is former senior military intelligence officer on the FBI Joint National Terrorism Task Force, Steve Rogers. Great to see you, Steve.</p><p>STEVE ROGERS, FORMER SENIOR MILITARY INTELLIGENCE OFFICER, FBI JOINT NATIONAL TERRORISM TASK FORCE: Pleasure to be here.</p><p>MACDONALD: What do you think about these defense cuts?</p><p>ROGERS: Well, to begin with, the president of the United States is the American military's best friend. In 2018, he significantly increased the budget. He's going to do more in 2019. And keep in mind, he is very well aware that we need a strong navy. He is funding the navy to forward deploy them in the Pacific and the Middle East regions to discourage anybody in those regions from attempting to challenge our U.S. military.</p><p>In addition to that, remember the space force. He's forward thinking. He's a visionary. He is going to fund that space force to ensure that we're going to have the weapons necessary in the future to defend this country. So what is he talking about? Waste. He's talking about waste. He wants to target waste and get rid of the thousand-dollar hammers that we read about, the 2,500-dollar screwdrivers. He wants to zero in on waste as a good businessman he is. That's where you are going to see cuts.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know, the president has been made fun of by the media, really a space force? Well, you know what, Steve, China and Russia is going full bore on that. It is about the space of battle. It's outer space. It's cyber space. And that's the issue, right, Steve?</p><p>BARNES: Well, absolutely. Look, I served 25 years of my life in the United States Navy, and I could remember thinking about, what are we going to do in the 21st century? Is anybody going to come with a vision of building a space force? President Trump decides he is going to look towards the future and start building space platforms and weapons --</p><p>MACDONALD: OK.</p><p>BARNES: -- that will protect us in the years to come.</p><p>MACDONALD: Here's the other issue that the critics fail to recognize when they say why are we spending more money on defense. Defense spending protects the powerful status of the U.S. dollar around the world, Steve. It is the world's reserve currency. It is used to price oil and all sorts of global trade. That defense spending helps protect the U.S. dollars. Certainly it's important in the government treasury debt markets, right?</p><p>BARNES: Absolutely right. Look, remember the saying peace through strength. A strong economy, a strong military, a strong everything. And look, from the day he took office, he made one priority, and that priority is to protect the American people. And that's exactly what he's delivering on.</p><p>MACDONALD: Steve Rogers, great to see you. As a disclosure to you, Steve Rogers is a Trump 2020 campaign advisory board member. Next up, crude oil up 30 cents to 56 in change a barrel today. Month to month, it is down more than 13 percent.</p><p>Let's get to your gas prices at the gas pump. The national average price for regular gas, $2.62. It is down more than 40 days straight. Missouri now has the cheapest gas with an average price -- look at that, $2.26. Go Missouri! California, most expensive, $3.64.</p><p>To the migrant caravan arrived at the Tijuana border now facing angry protests and clashes from people in Mexico. They don't like it. President Trump said that maybe it is a good time to shut down the government unless he gets money for his border wall. We are going to ask Sean Spicer up next about all of that and more. Stay with us.</p><p>MACDONALD: Welcome back. Hundreds of Tijuana citizens protesting the migrant caravan yesterday. They waved signs reading, \"no illegals,\" \"no to the invasion,\" and \"Mexico first.\" Now, the city's mayor, the mayor of Tijuana, even calling the caravan a horde. That's a direct quote from him. He says the caravan is infiltrated by criminals and threatening his community. This as President Trump says it might be a good time to shut down the U.S. government if there is no money for border wall. Homeland Security says there are 500 criminals in the caravans flowing to the border.</p><p>Let's take it up with the former White House press secretary. He is senior advisor of America First Action PAC. He is Sean Spicer. Great to see you, Sean.</p><p>SEAN SPICER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Hey, Liz, thanks for having me.</p><p>MACDONALD: What do you think of the story with the border, Sean?</p><p>SPICER: I think it is pretty concerning, right? I think the president has been out in front of this issue talking about it. And in many cases, folks from the left and several folks in the media mocked him. It's a reality now and you can see it full pledge in Tijuana where the mayor and the residents are experiencing what the consequences of having these folks roll through it.</p><p>It's a lot more serious. I think people kind of thought it was funny one or not serious rather when it was a few hundred miles away. Now that it's up close and touching on our border, I think the reality of the consequences of these folks coming into our country and the lack of preparedness that we have to deal with this situation is something that President Trump has been ringing the alarm bell on for a while. The reality is now coming home to roost.</p><p>MACDONALD: We are showing on the screen with you, Sean, anti-caravan protesters in Tijuana. The mayor of Tijuana, Sean, he is sounding a lot like the president. He says no city would be prepared to receive this tsunami of people. What do you think? Should the president shut down the government over the border wall?</p><p>SPICER: I don't know that he has to shut it down. I hope to god that legislators in Congress understand the reality of this. The president has been warning about this, talking about the need to secure the border, talking about protecting our people, but also making sure that we deal with these people in a humanitarian way.</p><p>You got two groups of folks. People who truly have an issue but I think more and more and you're seeing this not just from the mayor of Tijuana, but its residents who are saying that this is an invasion, that there are scary and criminal-type people in this caravan. And so I think we better heed the warning and it shouldn't be a partisan thing.</p><p>MACDONALD: Right.</p><p>SPICER: I think whether or not you are elected as a Republican or Democrat, you should understand the consequences of this.</p><p>MACDONALD: Sean, you make an important point because border security isn't some right-wing idea because in 2006, 26 Democrats including Senator Barack Obama, Senator Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, they voted for a border fence. And just five years ago, Democrats voted yes to a broader security bill.</p><p>You know, President Obama, Sean, even said we cannot have people crossing our borders unchecked. And he too sent troops to the Arizona border at one point, right?</p><p>SPICER: Absolutely. I think the reality of what we've seeing over the past two and a half -- or two years, rather, is that if President Trump is for it, we got to be against it. There is so much hypocrisy going on and debate right now, policy wise. So as long as President Trump supports it, somehow people have to be against it.</p><p>But this shouldn't be something that should divide us. This should be something that unite us, understanding that we are first and foremost a nation of laws, that we can be compassionate and caring for those who need help. But in this particular case, I think the president has been warning about the serious nature of the consequences if we don't protect our border in terms of the type of people who are trying to come into this.</p><p>MACDONALD: Right.</p><p>SPICER: Again, I would just hope that we shouldn't have to wait until they are climbing over the wall before we recognize that we need to address this in a much better way than it is currently handled.</p><p>MACDONALD: Homeland Security now says upwards of 10,500 people are heading to the border. You know, the president making this point too, Sean, that if the migrants fear their home country so much, then why are they waving the flag of Guatemala or Honduras coming in? Your reaction to that?</p><p>SPICER? We got a point. I mean, you don't celebrate the country that you're fearful of. It doesn't really make a ton of sense. And I think once -- I have seen a lot of sound from news reports. A lot of these folks are being very clear that this isn't why they are coming here. There is a big difference.</p><p>We are losing the discussion about what the need for political asylum is for, people who are truly being persecuted, who are seeking a better life for themselves because of being -- gone after or attacked for their political beliefs. But coming here to seek a job, while it's understandable that you want to make a better life for yourself or your family, is not one of the criteria for political asylum.</p><p>MACDONALD: That's a good point. Sean Spicer, come back soon. We love having you on, sir.</p><p>SPICER: You bet. Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD: Thank you. Coming up, Democratic senators declare war on President Trump over his appointment for the acting attorney general spot. That is Matthew Whitaker. He filed a lawsuit to try to put break in all of this. We are going to debate it, next. We are going to show you the facts underneath this debate. Stay there.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RUSH LIMBAUGH, TALK SHOW HOST AND CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR: None of any of that should have happened. What do you mean, Rush? The elections were closed. And by law, they had to have a recount. Yeah, yeah, but it wasn't. All of it is so unnecessary. The recounts wouldn't have happened if there had been some concessions.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: Welcome back. Three Democrat senators filing a lawsuit to block President Trump's appointment of Matthew Whitaker as temporary acting attorney general. They claim it deprives the Senate of its constitutional power to sign off on these types of appointments.</p><p>Let's take this to the political power panel. Scott Bolden is back with us along with Republican strategist Kurt Schlichter. Kurt, this is legal under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, right?</p><p>KURT SCHLICHTER, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: There is a lot of good arguments there is. There are some people who I really respect who say it isn't. Let's take it to court. Of course, the Democrats have a problem. Let's see if they can get past the standing requirement and even be able to have a judge rule on it.</p><p>But, look, I don't have a problem with people fighting over what the constitution means. I think that's vitally forward, and I'm all for it. I just wish they were as picky about the constitution when it came to things like our right to free speech, right to keep in bear arms, right to confront accusers.</p><p>MACDONALD: Scott, here is a thing, that act that I just referred to, I mean, President Obama temporarily appointed people without Senate confirmation. So did George W. Bush. You just said you (ph) fill the cabinet post for 210 days. That's it.</p><p>SCOTT BOLDEN, ATTORNEY: I think what is bothering people now politically is that under the Federal Vacancies Act, normally the first assistant would fill that role in acting capacity because that individual has been confirmed by the Senate. In this case, it would be Rosenstein. The problem there is we know that Donald Trump would never make him the acting attorney general.</p><p>Secondly, you have Whitaker who is believed to be or perceived to be a political hack and a spy for the White House and someone who has spoken against the Mueller investigation. The Democrats are trying to protect the independence of the Mueller investigation.</p><p>But my colleague is right about one thing. It is an open question. Republican and Democratic scholars say this might be a good thing.

Already, US lawmakers are calling for Facebook to pause those plans[3]. Now, some legislators want the company to stop altogether. According to Reuters[4], the Democratic majority of the House Financial Services Committee drafted legislation that would prevent big tech companies from functioning as financial institutions or issuing digital currencies.In addition to blocking Facebook's plans for Libra[5], the \"Keep Big Tech Out of Finance Act\" would prevent other firms (those mainly offering an online platform service with at least $25 billion in annual revenue) from launching similar cryptocurrencies. </p><p>Companies that violate the rules could be fined as much as $1 million per day.As Reuters notes, it's unlikely the legislation will pass, but it does reveal a growing attitude of skepticism[6] toward big tech companies, especially those looking to enter the financial services[7] realm. Tomorrow, Facebook plans to assure US lawmakers[8] that it won't launch Libra until the regulatory concerns are addressed. David Marcus, head of Facebook's digital wallet, released a prepared statement[9] promising that Libra is not being built to compete with sovereign currencies or interfere with monetary policy. Given Facebook's track record[10] of handling things like data privacy and the skepticism around Libra, it's too soon to say if that will be enough.

But the inability of Congress to pass meaningful data-privacy rules   and the poor track record of many tech firms in protecting privacy   heightens the risk, lawmakers and outside experts say. Advertisement 'If information about who has COVID-19 gets into the wrong hands, it could lead to things that are harmful,' said Rep. Anna G. Eshoo (D-Menlo Park).She is among several lawmakers calling on the Trump administration to place strict limits on what contact-tracing data can be collected and shared. </p><p>The White House has so far issued none, even as it consults behind closed doors with tech firms on the development of a tracing infrastructure.'Without a national privacy law, this is a black hole,' Eshoo said.The technology, which Google and Apple plan to launch in mid-May, enables people to have their phone track the Bluetooth signals emitted by the phones of every other person with whom they come in close contact. Advertisement  If a person tests positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, an app provided by their public health department would send an alert to all other users of the app with whom the infected person had contact over the previous two weeks. Identities would not be revealed, just the day of the contact, how long it lasted, and the strength of the Bluetooth signal. Privacy experts voice two big fears:Such a system would only be useful if it's widely used. It's unclear if tracing technology can be effective at all if the entire system is anonymous, voluntary and inhibits the creation of large surveillance databases. So once a system is launched, there will inevitably be pressure to require some people to use it.And if the system is widely used   and especially if it's connected to a database   there will be a huge risk that data would live on well beyond the pandemic, giving governments and corporations easy access to information about people's movements and healthcare needs that eclipses what they now have. Advertisement  'What I am afraid of is some folks in the tech community will use this huge public need as a way to be invasive with private data and create a beachfront in the health sector,' said Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), a technology entrepreneur himself.'It is not like the big platforms are coming at this with clean hands.'Before the pandemic hit, Warner was already investigating collaborations tech firms were forging with big healthcare and fitness companies.Access to healthcare data could enable tech companies to build profiles of people's ailments and needs, exposing them to targeted marketing campaigns, and also to potential discrimination by employers, insurance companies, landlords or others. Advertisement  Existing healthcare privacy rules don't protect Americans from many of those intrusions, and even those regulations are being eased to give medical professionals flexibility as they deal with the deluge of COVID-19 patients. The potential for tech companies to aggressively move into this area has many privacy analysts unnerved.'These companies have been lobbying all along to get the government to look the other way while they grab our healthcare information to more effectively monetize it,' said Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a group that advocates for digital privacy.'We have to get a handle on this pandemic, but we also have to look at the motivations here.'On the other side of the debate are people like Stewart Baker, who served as assistant secretary of Homeland Security in the George W. Bush administration and, earlier, as general counsel of the National Security Agency.  Advertisement  'If you asked Americans in February 2020, are they prepared to have the governor of their state tell them to go home, stay home and lose their jobs, everyone would have said no. Yet here we are,' Baker said.Baker is urging tech companies to embrace the type of monitoring system deployed in Singapore[2], where the government is collecting large amounts of Bluetooth-generated data on the movements of citizens and their social contacts and notifying anyone with a contact who later turns out to be infected.'It is a trivial intrusion on our liberty as citizens when you compare it to all the other things during this pandemic where we have said, 'This is necessary, we will do it,'' he said.Lawmakers who have taken the lead in investigating the exploitation and abuse of user data by big tech firms worry that the point of view Baker expresses is gaining currency in the White House, as officials meet behind closed doors to develop a strategy for contact tracing. They warn of implications that could last far beyond the pandemic. Advertisement  When the idea of contact-tracing apps first emerged, there were optimistic predictions that America could lean on its tech pioneers to help safely reopen the economy without the privacy intrusions embedded in tracking apps[3] in China, Taiwan and South Korea.That optimism, however, is fast fading. Even countries such as France and Germany, which adhere to strict privacy laws, are drafting plans for data-collection systems that step around those rules so public health bureaucracies can identify who went where, when they went there and   most importantly   who they may have come in contact with along the way.Some prominent computer scientists involved in building contact-tracing tools in Europe are alarmed by the direction that governments there are headed.The group, called the DP-3T Project, had been pushing a privacy-oriented approach similar to what Apple and Google have discussed   alert systems that keep the data collected anonymous and largely confined to the phones of users who opt in. Advertisement  By contrast, the contact-tracing tools some European leaders are now pursuing 'can easily be turned into an instrument of surveillance with considerable human rights implications,' the group warned in a recent white paper.The apps that American technology firms are developing are voluntary in theory, but companies could make their use a condition of employment, said Ashkan Soltani, a security researcher and former chief technologist for the Federal Trade Commission during the Obama administration.'They alert the employer whether you have been in contact with someone who has been infected,' Soltani said. But, he said, the technology is full of gaps and could potentially label employees at risk when it should not.A Bluetooth signal might be unaware that an infected individual who appeared to be in close proximity to an employee was on the other side of a wall, for example. Nor would the technology be able to register that a person identified as being at risk was wearing protective gear when they had a brush with contagion while shopping.

You may occasionally receive promotional content from the Los Angeles Times.    In some nations that are already aggressively relying on digital tracking, the technologies are far more intrusive. Taiwan is collecting personal insurance and passport travel records, as it tracks down who might be infected and orders them to quarantine.Countries that use such systems are also digitally tagging people with different color codings, which determine whether they are permitted to move freely in public.Officials at Apple and Google say their infrastructure is designed to avoid such intrusion. Yet Washington is full of questions about whether it can be effective if the companies abide by that pledge   and also whether these companies with a dismal record on privacy[4] can be trusted to be in the driver's seat at all. Advertisement  Google and Apple, at least, are acutely aware of the optics. On Friday, the companies distributed a FAQ to consumers stressing that the data accumulated by them will be anonymous, impossible to monetize and will stop being collected after the pandemic.The assurances have yet to assuage lawmakers such as Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, a fierce critic of technology firms, who sent a letter to the CEOs of both companies last week.'Americans are right to be skeptical of this project,' he wrote. 'Too often, Americans have been burned by companies who calculated that the profits they could gain by reversing privacy pledges would outweigh any later financial penalty.'Hawley challenged the executives to hold themselves personally liable financially if the firms break their privacy pledge. Advertisement  So far, the executives have not made that commitment.

But the inability of Congress to pass meaningful data-privacy rules - and the poor track record of many tech firms in protecting privacy - heightens the risk, lawmakers and outside experts say.</p><p>\"If information about who has COVID-19 gets into the wrong hands, it could lead to things that are harmful,\" said Rep. Anna G. Eshoo (D-Menlo Park).</p><p>She is among several lawmakers calling on the Trump administration to place strict limits on what contact-tracing data can be collected and shared. The White House has so far issued none, even as it consults behind closed doors with tech firms on the development of a tracing infrastructure.</p><p>\"Without a national privacy law, this is a black hole,\" Eshoo said.</p><p>The technology, which Google and Apple plan to launch in mid-May, enables people to have their phone track the Bluetooth signals emitted by the phones of every other person with whom they come in close contact.</p><p>If a person tests positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, an app provided by their public health department would send an alert to all other users of the app with whom the infected person had contact over the previous two weeks. Identities would not be revealed, just the day of the contact, how long it lasted, and the strength of the Bluetooth signal.</p><p>Privacy experts voice two big fears:</p><p>Such a system would only be useful if it's widely used. It's unclear if tracing technology can be effective at all if the entire system is anonymous, voluntary and inhibits the creation of large surveillance databases. So once a system is launched, there will inevitably be pressure to require some people to use it.</p><p>And if the system is widely used - and especially if it's connected to a database - there will be a huge risk that data would live on well beyond the pandemic, giving governments and corporations easy access to information about people's movements and healthcare needs that eclipses what they now have.</p><p>\"What I am afraid of is some folks in the tech community will use this huge public need as a way to be invasive with private data and create a beachfront in the health sector,\" said Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), a technology entrepreneur himself.</p><p>\"It is not like the big platforms are coming at this with clean hands.\"</p><p>Before the pandemic hit, Warner was already investigating collaborations tech firms were forging with big healthcare and fitness companies.</p><p>Access to healthcare data could enable tech companies to build profiles of people's ailments and needs, exposing them to targeted marketing campaigns, and also to potential discrimination by employers, insurance companies, landlords or others.</p><p>Existing healthcare privacy rules don't protect Americans from many of those intrusions, and even those regulations are being eased to give medical professionals flexibility as they deal with the deluge of COVID-19 patients. The potential for tech companies to aggressively move into this area has many privacy analysts unnerved.</p><p>\"These companies have been lobbying all along to get the government to look the other way while they grab our healthcare information to more effectively monetize it,\" said Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a group that advocates for digital privacy.</p><p>\"We have to get a handle on this pandemic, but we also have to look at the motivations here.\"</p><p>On the other side of the debate are people like Stewart Baker, who served as assistant secretary of Homeland Security in the George W. Bush administration and, earlier, as general counsel of the National Security Agency.</p><p>\"If you asked Americans in February 2020, are they prepared to have the governor of their state tell them to go home, stay home and lose their jobs, everyone would have said no. Yet here we are,\" Baker said.</p><p>Baker is urging tech companies to embrace the type of monitoring system deployed in Singapore, where the government is collecting large amounts of Bluetooth-generated data on the movements of citizens and their social contacts and notifying anyone with a contact who later turns out to be infected.</p><p>\"It is a trivial intrusion on our liberty as citizens when you compare it to all the other things during this pandemic where we have said, 'This is necessary, we will do it,'\" he said.</p><p>Lawmakers who have taken the lead in investigating the exploitation and abuse of user data by big tech firms worry that the point of view Baker expresses is gaining currency in the White House, as officials meet behind closed doors to develop a strategy for contact tracing. They warn of implications that could last far beyond the pandemic.</p><p>When the idea of contact-tracing apps first emerged, there were optimistic predictions that America could lean on its tech pioneers to help safely reopen the economy without the privacy intrusions embedded in tracking apps in China, Taiwan and South Korea.</p><p>That optimism, however, is fast fading. Even countries such as France and Germany, which adhere to strict privacy laws, are drafting plans for data-collection systems that step around those rules so public health bureaucracies can identify who went where, when they went there and - most importantly - who they may have come in contact with along the way.</p><p>Some prominent computer scientists involved in building contact-tracing tools in Europe are alarmed by the direction that governments there are headed.</p><p>The group, called the DP-3T Project, had been pushing a privacy-oriented approach similar to what Apple and Google have discussed - alert systems that keep the data collected anonymous and largely confined to the phones of users who opt in.</p><p>By contrast, the contact-tracing tools some European leaders are now pursuing \"can easily be turned into an instrument of surveillance with considerable human rights implications,\" the group warned in a recent white paper.</p><p>The apps that American technology firms are developing are voluntary in theory, but companies could make their use a condition of employment, said Ashkan Soltani, a security researcher and former chief technologist for the Federal Trade Commission during the Obama administration.</p><p>\"They alert the employer whether you have been in contact with someone who has been infected,\" Soltani said. But, he said, the technology is full of gaps and could potentially label employees at risk when it should not.</p><p>A Bluetooth signal might be unaware that an infected individual who appeared to be in close proximity to an employee was on the other side of a wall, for example. Nor would the technology be able to register that a person identified as being at risk was wearing protective gear when they had a brush with contagion while shopping.</p><p>In some nations that are already aggressively relying on digital tracking, the technologies are far more intrusive. Taiwan is collecting personal insurance and passport travel records, as it tracks down who might be infected and orders them to quarantine.</p><p>Countries that use such systems are also digitally tagging people with different color codings, which determine whether they are permitted to move freely in public.</p><p>Officials at Apple and Google say their infrastructure is designed to avoid such intrusion. Yet Washington is full of questions about whether it can be effective if the companies abide by that pledge - and also whether these companies with a dismal record on privacy can be trusted to be in the driver's seat at all.</p><p>Google and Apple, at least, are acutely aware of the optics. On Friday, the companies distributed a FAQ to consumers stressing that the data accumulated by them will be anonymous, impossible to monetize and will stop being collected after the pandemic.</p><p>The assurances have yet to assuage lawmakers such as Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, a fierce critic of technology firms, who sent a letter to the CEOs of both companies last week.</p><p>\"Americans are right to be skeptical of this project,\" he wrote. \"Too often, Americans have been burned by companies who calculated that the profits they could gain by reversing privacy pledges would outweigh any later financial penalty.\"</p><p>Hawley challenged the executives to hold themselves personally liable financially if the firms break their privacy pledge.</p><p>So far, the executives have not made that commitment.</p><p>\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tampa Bay Times coronavirus coverage</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAVE YOU LOST SOMEONE YOU LOVE TO COVID-19?:</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.tampabay.com/news/health/2020/04/10/the-floridians-lost-to-the-coronavirus/\">Help us remember them</url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">UNEMPLOYMENT Q&amp;A:</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.tampabay.com/news/business/2020/04/01/floridas-unemployment-benefits-we-answer-your-questions/\">We answer your questions about Florida unemployment benefits</url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CONTRIBUTE TO THE SCRAPBOOK:</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.tampabay.com/news/health/2020/04/01/scrapbook-help-us-tell-the-story-of-life-under-coronavirus/\">Help us tell the story of life under coronavirus</url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRIGHT SPOTS IN DARK TIMES:</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.tampabay.com/bright-spots/\">The world is hard right now, but there's still good news out there</url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LISTEN TO THE CORONAVIRUS PODCAST:</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://play.acast.com/s/coronavirusinflorida\">New episodes every week, including interviews with experts and reporters</url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAVE A TIP?:</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://projects.tampabay.com/projects/tips/?fbclid=IwAR2QiHK_nYm4wV_drnndnHlcMQQhIlz6moTgmPSEl7LqTKgIaxbxhCwr_DU\">Send us confidential news tips</url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GET THE DAYSTARTER MORNING UPDATE:</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://myaccount.tampabay.com/newsletter\">Sign up to receive the most up-to-date information, six days a week</url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WATCH VIDEO:</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.tampabay.com/video/2020/04/17/connecting-in-creative-ways-tampa-bay-finds-light-amid-escalating-pandemic/\">How some in Tampa Bay are finding light amid isolation</url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">We're working hard to bring you the latest news on the coronavirus in Florida.

Then, consent to some regulation that stops competitors from scaling up the way you did.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That's what DraftKings and FanDuel, the two 800-pound gorillas of the daily fantasy sports world - effectively major-sports-league-endorsed gambling sites - had been doing. In just a few years, they came from nowhere to become ESPN's biggest advertisers by far while taking in twice the action of the Vegas sports books and growing fast. Their endless ads boil down to the pitch that if you're smart enough to watch sports, you should probably be making money betting on them.</p><p>After beginning to probe reports a DraftKings employee had used inside information to win big on FanDuel, Attorney General Eric Schneiderman gave no warning before dropping a much bigger case-and-desist hammer Tuesday, telling the sites they were in violation of New York's constitution.</p><p>As the facing editorial details, the state bans staking \"something of value upon the outcome of a contest of chance or a future contingent event\" outside of the bettor's direct control, even if skill is also a factor. Like, say, football players' stat lines.</p><p>Pathetically, the companies seemed unprepared for this obvious, accurate hit. Never mind our TV ads, FanDuel CEO Nigel Eccles told reporters Wednesday, the sharks win, and win big, proving that fantasy betting is a skill game. That's not only cynical as hell, but a skill-luck distinction that has no bearing on New York's law.</p><p>It all sounds a lot like the poker world, right down to player concerns about cheaters and bots and big companies trying to keep the cash coming in while staying a step ahead of pesky regulators. In fact, many of the top fantasy players - who enter each tournament hundreds of times and use their own custom-built models to ensure a return on their investment - are former poker pros who followed the sucker's money here after the Justice Department effectively shut down online poker in 2011.</p><p>What the fantasy-sports guys have that the poker guys did not is sign-in from the sports leagues, which appreciate obsessive fans or Stans who stay tuned to bad games and garbage time plays to see how \"their players\" are \"producing.\"</p><p>With hardly a legal leg to stand on in New York, FanDuel has called another option from the tech play book, weaponizing its customers. (That's not new, but it's been super-charged by the Web, as when Uber earlier this year used its drivers and customers to put tire tracks on Mayor de Blasio's back after he cynically tried to freeze the service). Eccles boasted there have already been 10,000 calls to Schneiderman's office protesting the cease-and-desist letter.</p><p>The company, he said, wasn't ginning up opposition but trying to channel dedicated fans' natural anger to stand up for the little guy against the AG's \"very extreme and sudden decision that New Yorkers are not capable of making their own decisions,\" adding that \"the simple reason that hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers play fantasy sports is because it's fun.\"</p><p>Why does law nerd hate fun?</p><p>Absurdly, Eccles denied FanDuel was a gambling site, saying that while they collect entry fees and pay out winners, they're just middlemen, not staked in the action. Just like Uber says it's not in the car-ride business and Airbnb says it's not a hotelier.</p><p>Shucks, we're just people connecting people, and taking a cut for making it possible.</p><p>But Uber and Airbnb at least make credible cases they're providing public goods the market and its regulators had failed to. FanDuel? It's on \"a mission to make sports more exciting to everyone in the U.S.\"</p><p>Shucks. But this isn't just a sped-up version of traditional season-long fantasy leagues. It's a model that depends on a steady supply of suckers to throw money into the endless tide of numbers sporting events throw off, enough money to feed the companies and the sharks.</p><p>Consider the pitch a nascent competitor sent The News Wednesday, suggesting that the fantasy sites' new legal issues would make a nice hook for a story about their new real-time \"sports prediction game\" that'll let you bet on every element of every down of every NFL game - \"more than 15,000 picks per game,\" with \"dynamically changing odds\" after each play.</p><p>Daily action is so 2014. Why wait for 60 minutes, let alone for Monday, when now \"you know immediately if you've won\"? Who could be against that?</p><p>Thanks, Mr. Attorney General.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:hsiegel@nydailynews.com\">hsiegel@nydailynews.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>NLVL</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYNWS-13676926</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYNWS2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5HC4-7DD1-DY2D-J0MX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">151550</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-08-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"792\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Daily News, L.P.</copyright><publicationName>Daily News (New York)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"15040\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>SPORTS FINAL EDITION</edition><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"11\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>November 12, 2015 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>COLUMN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>OPINION</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0004F66</classCode><className>ESPN INC</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>FANTASY FOOTBALL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>GAMBLING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>FANDUEL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>DRAFTKINGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>ATTORNEY GENERAL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>INVESTIGATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>ERIC SCHNEIDERMAN</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DKDP</classCode><className>FANTASY SPORTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001615</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp;

Even criminal acts in cyberspace are rarely prosecuted.</p><p>Europe is leading the charge on regulating the internet but Australian legislators are lagging behind.</p><p>New Zealand introduced its own anti-cyberbullying legislation in 2015.</p><p>That's why we believe regulatory responsibility is urgently needed to prompt greater action from social media platforms to act on cyberbullying and violence. </p><p>If victims had the tools to take on groups such as Facebookand Twitter, then those companies would be compelled to commit serious resources to clean up their platforms.</p><p>We also want to see enforceable sanctions against employers who fail to protect against cyberbullying in workplaces.</p><p>In today's world, there is an increasing expectation for staff to be actively engaged with social media for their work, in industries such as the media in particular, yet many employers are not taking steps to protect their staff from the obvious risks that can come with this.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">John Bornstein is principal of Maurice Blackburn Lawyers.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SUNCST-NV10KSO5</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUNCST2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RTX-STP1-JDN8-2008-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408677</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"350\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 APN Newspapers Pty.

This is particularly the case given past reluctance by the platforms to move in this area.\"</p><p>As part of its Digital Platforms Inquiry draft report late last year, the ACCC called on the federal government to overhaul the patchwork of regulations \"to effectively and consistently regulate the conduct of all entities which perform comparable functions in the production and delivery of content in Australia\".</p><p>The ACCC proposed \"meaningful sanctions\" for entities that breach the laws, regardless of whether they are online companies such as Facebook, or more traditional media companies.</p><p>The Christchurch Call statement mentioned a range of measures from government and tech providers, including tech companies developing tools to prevent the upload of terrorist and violent extremist content; social moves to counter the roots of violent extremism; increasing transparency around the removal and detection of online content, and reviewing how companies' algorithms direct users to violent extremist content.</p><p>Grateful for PM <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>@jacindaardern</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>'s leadership.

To support this, <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>Facebook will invest $US7.5 million ($10.85 million) in new research partnerships</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link> with leading academics from three universities, designed to improve image and video analysis technology,\" he said.</p><p>\"We're improving our matching technology so that we can stop the spread of viral videos of this nature, regardless of how they were originally produced.</p><p>\"Our COO, Sheryl Sandberg, also recently shared some of the additional steps we're taking to stop the spread of hate online, including the use of our existing artificial intelligence tools to identify and remove a range of hate groups in Australia and New Zealand, including the Lads Society, the United Patriots Front, the Antipodean Resistance, and National Front New Zealand.\"</p><p>Distinguished Professor of Public Communication at the University of Technology Sydney Jim Macnamara said while it was a positive step for the likes of Facebook and Twitter to acknowledge and pledge to tackle the problems publicly, it was likely that governments would ultimately have to find a way to legislate the global online arena.</p><p>In the aftermath of the Christchurch shootings the Australian government <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/news/politics/national/tech-execs-face-three-years-jail-over-violent-broadcasts-20190329-p518xs\">enacted laws</url> that could mean tech industry executives face up to three years in jail and their companies fined hundreds of millions of dollars if they allow their platforms to be used to broadcast \"abhorrent violence\" material including terrorist attacks, murders and rapes.</p><p>However Professor Macnamara said the global nature of big social sites meant individual country laws were unlikely to make a meaningful difference to how the platforms operated.</p><p>\"Pulling companies together internationally is essential because these things happen across borders and you can't address the problem in any one jurisdiction,\" he said.</p><p>\"Self regulation is part of the solution, but I think governments need to collaboratively consider legislation ... If governments got together under a UN kind of arrangement and agreed on certain principles, you could aim for an Interpol style set up, where if something happens in one country they could collaborate to tackle it.\"</p><p>Despite 17 countries and the European Commission signing on to support the Christchurch Call, it received a notable snub for the United States, the home of the big tech companies, which declined to be involved on freedom of speech grounds.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-1520130263</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W46-V371-JBJ7-N2XH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"888\"/><timeReceived>03:36 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

For example, it's not easy for a neophyte business to budget thousands of dollars a year for a mashgiach who is not required to help out in the kitchen the way Fried does.</p><p>Also, the Vaad has a lot of strict rules, understandably, such as one about who can hold the keys that open and close the business every day to ensure kashrut compliance. But what if I'm the owner, my mashgiach is sick, I have a big order to fill that day, and I can't get into my own kitchen because I'm not allowed to have a key?</p><p>Shandrovsky said opting out of Vaad certification is \"my own personal choice.\" He wanted local supervision, and he didn't want to submit to the full spectrum of the Vaad's stringent regulations.</p><p>Feldman, the head of the NorCal Vaad's five-man executive committee, didn't get into specifics other than to say that L'Chaim lost its Vaad supervision because of its \"failure to comply with the Vaad's kashrut policies.\"</p><p>PASTRAMI IN A PARKLET: The owners of Saul's Deli have submitted an application to build a parklet on the street directly in front of their Berkeley restaurant.</p><p>Though Saul's wouldn't be able to serve food in the parklet because it's a public space, people could grab a takeout item and eat it there. The proposal includes seating, planter boxes and a canopy, built across three diagonal parking spaces.</p><p>To move the process along, Saul's is doing something it has never done before: selling discounted giftcards (similar to deals one might find via Groupon or LivingSocial). Through an Indiegogo campaign, co-owners Peter Levitt and Karen Adelman hope to raise $15,000 for the project, which will be privately funded at a total estimated cost of $45,000 to $50,000.</p><p>Available online only, the discount cards will be sold through Feb. 19 at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.indie\">www.indie</url> gogo.com/at/ParkletatVine.</p><p>Some of the deals: a $30 Saul's value card for $25; a $50 card for $38; a $100 card for $73; and a $300 card plus two Saul's T-shirts for $220. The Jewish Music Festival also is offering a giftcard on the same website, and other nearby merchants have some offers, too.</p><p>This story is somewhat big news in Berkeley, which so far has only one other parklet (in front of the Cheese Board). San Francisco has more than 40, although none are adjacent to chopped liver, kreplach and matzah brei.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Photographs</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ENW-3668925411</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">58912ENW</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5FX3-9T91-DYR7-842M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11341</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"931\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2015 Jewish Bulletin</copyright><publicationName>The Jewish News Weekly of Northern California : J</publicationName><volume>Vol. 119</volume><issueNumber>No. 4</issueNumber><aggregationName>Ethnic NewsWatch</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"01\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>January 23, 2015</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Other</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Commentary</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Jewish holidays</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Kosher food</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Jewish life &amp;

Leader McCarthy also argued that the United States should look to the greatest driver of competition, the free market, for the most compelling responses to these privacy concerns.</p><p>Don\u2019t Count on Government to Protect Your PrivacyLeader Kevin McCarthyThe New York TimesJuly 14, 2019</p><p>Imagine that Congress proposed a law that made postage free in the United States. Even in the digital age, this would be quite convenient. The only catch? In exchange for free mail, postmasters would be permitted to open your mail and read our letters and bills. The benefit, postmasters would insist, is they would know when you\u2019re planning a family vacation. And then the post office could send you hotel recommendations or advice for the best restaurants and activities.</p><p>Convenient, right?</p><p>On second thought, you might rather pay the 55 cents for postage if it meant keeping advertisers from knowing the location and itinerary of your family vacation before you even get on the plane.</p><p>We prefer that strangers not read our mail \u2014 that\u2019s why we\u2019ve made doing so a federal crime punishable by up to five years in prison. We have blinds because we don\u2019t want outsiders peering into our homes. We have laws to protect our health care records because we definitely don\u2019t need strangers knowing our medical history.</p><p>So why should we treat our online identities \u2014 and privacy \u2014 any differently?</p><p>The answer to this question \u2014 posed by my friend Tom Siebel, a tech entrepreneur \u2014 clearly is that we should not. But if we are to secure our data in an increasingly digital world, should we expect government to singularly and effectively do the job for us? I would argue, no.</p><p>Some politicians, primarily those running for president, have called for brute government intervention, including breaking up big companies like Google or Facebook. This clarion call has the benefit of simplicity, but has failed to explain how it will increase security for our data. What does forcing Facebook to sell WhatsApp have to do with Facebook or WhatsApp collecting, exploiting and selling our data?</p><p>Others are calling for invasive congressional regulation. But as history tells us, overly broad and indiscriminate regulation often insulates the incumbents and boxes out the upstarts and smaller firms \u2014 a consequence we\u2019ve experienced with the Dodd-Frank financial regulations law. Even Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, acknowledged this possible outcome to Congress a year ago.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, these remedies lean on the premise that only government can solve market inefficiencies that lead to irresponsible corporate behavior.</p><p>I don\u2019t think we should feel confident that the bureaucratic leviathan has what it takes to develop or enforce nimble responses to rapid change in the technology industry.We should look instead to the greatest driver of competition, the free market, for the most compelling responses to our privacy concerns.</p><p>Technological advancements can meet Americans\u2019 demands for privacy, and perhaps already are, through cryptonetworks. Cryptonetworks are decentralized platforms governed by the community of users rather than by chief executives or small management teams.</p><p>You would access these networks by logging on to a browser similar to what you use today. But the piping undergirding the decentralized networks is powered by blockchain technology capable of delivering stronger data security, portability and privacy for every user.</p><p>When you purchase or post something on a blockchain platform, the network will verify your identity using an encrypted key that is permanently and exclusively yours. Each action is recorded on a distributed ledger. This will make fraud nearly impossible.</p><p>Under the current internet framework, users\u2019 data is usually controlled by the platform \u2014 online consumers leave a trail of data bread crumbs, making us vulnerable to privacy invasions. In a decentralized network, however, our data would be controlled by this blockchain encryption. Users would grant and revoke access to data, no longer entrusting third parties or tech companies with that responsibility.</p><p>Furthermore, this technology would increase competition, because blockchain makes it easier for anyone to create an alternative platform for communicating or providing some service.

Leader McCarthy also argued that the United States should look to the greatest driver of competition, the free market, for the most compelling responses to these privacy concerns.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Don't Count on Government to Protect Your Privacy</p><p>Leader Kevin McCarthy</p><p>The New York Times</p><p>July 14, 2019</p><p>Imagine that Congress proposed a law that made postage free in the United States. Even in the digital age, this would be quite convenient. The only catch\" In exchange for free mail, postmasters would be permitted to open your mail and read our letters and bills. The benefit, postmasters would insist, is they would know when you're planning a family vacation. And then the post office could send you hotel recommendations or advice for the best restaurants and activities.</p><p>Convenient, right?</p><p>On second thought, you might rather pay the 55 cents for postage if it meant keeping advertisers from knowing the location and itinerary of your family vacation before you even get on the plane.</p><p>We prefer that strangers not read our mail -- that's why we've made doing so a federal crime punishable by up to five years in prison. We have blinds because we don't want outsiders peering into our homes. We have laws to protect our health care records because we definitely don't need strangers knowing our medical history.</p><p>So why should we treat our online identities -- and privacy -- any differently?</p><p>The answer to this question -- posed by my friend Tom Siebel, a tech entrepreneur -- clearly is that we should not. But if we are to secure our data in an increasingly digital world, should we expect government to singularly and effectively do the job for us\" I would argue, no.</p><p>Some politicians, primarily those running for president, have called for brute government intervention, including breaking up big companies like Google or Facebook. This clarion call has the benefit of simplicity, but has failed to explain how it will increase security for our data. What does forcing Facebook to sell WhatsApp have to do with Facebook or WhatsApp collecting, exploiting and selling our data?</p><p>Others are calling for invasive congressional regulation. But as history tells us, overly broad and indiscriminate regulation often insulates the incumbents and boxes out the upstarts and smaller firms -- a consequence we've experienced with the Dodd-Frank financial regulations law. Even Facebook's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, acknowledged this possible outcome to Congress a year ago.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, these remedies lean on the premise that only government can solve market inefficiencies that lead to irresponsible corporate behavior.</p><p>I don't think we should feel confident that the bureaucratic leviathan has what it takes to develop or enforce nimble responses to rapid change in the technology industry.</p><p>We should look instead to the greatest driver of competition, the free market, for the most compelling responses to our privacy concerns.</p><p>Technological advancements can meet Americans' demands for privacy, and perhaps already are, through cryptonetworks. Cryptonetworks are decentralized platforms governed by the community of users rather than by chief executives or small management teams.</p><p>You would access these networks by logging on to a browser similar to what you use today. But the piping undergirding the decentralized networks is powered by blockchain technology capable of delivering stronger data security, portability and privacy for every user.</p><p>When you purchase or post something on a blockchain platform, the network will verify your identity using an encrypted key that is permanently and exclusively yours. Each action is recorded on a distributed ledger. This will make fraud nearly impossible.</p><p>Under the current internet framework, users' data is usually controlled by the platform -- online consumers leave a trail of data bread crumbs, making us vulnerable to privacy invasions. In a decentralized network, however, our data would be controlled by this blockchain encryption. Users would grant and revoke access to data, no longer entrusting third parties or tech companies with that responsibility.</p><p>Furthermore, this technology would increase competition, because blockchain makes it easier for anyone to create an alternative platform for communicating or providing some service. With the open-source nature of blockchain technology, a community of users is free to take what they like from an existing platform to a new one if they feel their privacy has been infringed or trust violated. Accountability is built into the system.</p><p>Each new platform is a fresh opportunity for users and creators to interact, shop and communicate without Big Brother or Big Tech tracking every move.</p><p>In many respects, it is a throwback to the permission-less innovation that brought us the internet we know today. For the free market, there is no better remedy to monopolistic behavior.</p><p>That is not to say that there is zero role for government.

Leader McCarthy also argued that the United States should look to the greatest driver of competition, the free market, for the most compelling responses to these privacy concerns.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Don't Count on Government to Protect Your Privacy</p><p>Leader Kevin McCarthy</p><p>The New York Times</p><p>July 14, 2019</p><p>Imagine that Congress proposed a law that made postage free in the United States. Even in the digital age, this would be quite convenient. The only catch? In exchange for free mail, postmasters would be permitted to open your mail and read our letters and bills. The benefit, postmasters would insist, is they would know when you're planning a family vacation. And then the post office could send you hotel recommendations or advice for the best restaurants and activities.</p><p>Convenient, right?</p><p>On second thought, you might rather pay the 55 cents for postage if it meant keeping advertisers from knowing the location and itinerary of your family vacation before you even get on the plane.</p><p>We prefer that strangers not read our mail -- that's why we've made doing so a federal crime punishable by up to five years in prison. We have blinds because we don't want outsiders peering into our homes. We have laws to protect our health care records because we definitely don't need strangers knowing our medical history.</p><p>So why should we treat our online identities -- and privacy -- any differently?</p><p>The answer to this question -- posed by my friend Tom Siebel, a tech entrepreneur -- clearly is that we should not. But if we are to secure our data in an increasingly digital world, should we expect government to singularly and effectively do the job for us? I would argue, no.</p><p>Some politicians, primarily those running for president, have called for brute government intervention, including breaking up big companies like Google or Facebook. This clarion call has the benefit of simplicity, but has failed to explain how it will increase security for our data. What does forcing Facebook to sell WhatsApp have to do with Facebook or WhatsApp collecting, exploiting and selling our data?</p><p>Others are calling for invasive congressional regulation. But as history tells us, overly broad and indiscriminate regulation often insulates the incumbents and boxes out the upstarts and smaller firms -- a consequence we've experienced with the Dodd-Frank financial regulations law. Even Facebook's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, acknowledged this possible outcome to Congress a year ago.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, these remedies lean on the premise that only government can solve market inefficiencies that lead to irresponsible corporate behavior.</p><p>I don't think we should feel confident that the bureaucratic leviathan has what it takes to develop or enforce nimble responses to rapid change in the technology industry.</p><p>We should look instead to the greatest driver of competition, the free market, for the most compelling responses to our privacy concerns.</p><p>Technological advancements can meet Americans' demands for privacy, and perhaps already are, through cryptonetworks. Cryptonetworks are decentralized platforms governed by the community of users rather than by chief executives or small management teams.</p><p>You would access these networks by logging on to a browser similar to what you use today. But the piping undergirding the decentralized networks is powered by blockchain technology capable of delivering stronger data security, portability and privacy for every user.</p><p>When you purchase or post something on a blockchain platform, the network will verify your identity using an encrypted key that is permanently and exclusively yours. Each action is recorded on a distributed ledger. This will make fraud nearly impossible.</p><p>Under the current internet framework, users' data is usually controlled by the platform -- online consumers leave a trail of data bread crumbs, making us vulnerable to privacy invasions. In a decentralized network, however, our data would be controlled by this blockchain encryption. Users would grant and revoke access to data, no longer entrusting third parties or tech companies with that responsibility.</p><p>Furthermore, this technology would increase competition, because blockchain makes it easier for anyone to create an alternative platform for communicating or providing some service. With the open-source nature of blockchain technology, a community of users is free to take what they like from an existing platform to a new one if they feel their privacy has been infringed or trust violated. Accountability is built into the system.</p><p>Each new platform is a fresh opportunity for users and creators to interact, shop and communicate without Big Brother or Big Tech tracking every move.</p><p>In many respects, it is a throwback to the permission-less innovation that brought us the internet we know today. For the free market, there is no better remedy to monopolistic behavior.</p><p>That is not to say that there is zero role for government. The Federal Trade Commission should step in when companies break the law or violate settlements with consumers or the government. Indeed, the F.T.C'.s role is perhaps more important and challenging than ever, because big tech continues to grow bigger.</p><p>Congress also has a role. It should develop a clear privacy framework that sets one federal standard for the country and adheres to three simple principles: You should be able to see, control and delete your data. These standards have the advantage of being bipartisan, which in today's Washington is saying something.</p><p>While the obscurity of blockchain might make it seem intimidating, we are seeing leading technology companies and venture capitalists looking to bring it into the mainstream.</p><p>As the most technologically advanced country in the world, it is America's responsibility to give this technology space to run and grow. Companies that have repeatedly broken promises to their users deserve scrutiny. But the federal government must not mistakenly turn scrutiny into suppression.</p><p>In the right \"light touch\" regulatory environment, decentralized networks can provide the transparent, secure platforms that respect an individual's privacy and dignity.</p><p>Kevin McCarthy, a Republican of California, is the House minority leader.</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-6814967 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR6814967</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WRY-GKG1-DYG2-R4H4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1089\"/><timeReceived>8:23 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 15, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

This clarion call has the benefit of simplicity, but has failed to explain how it will increase security for our data. What does forcing Facebook to sell WhatsApp have to do with Facebook or WhatsApp collecting, exploiting and selling our data?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Others are calling for invasive congressional regulation. But as history tells us, overly broad and indiscriminate regulation often insulates the incumbents and boxes out the upstarts and smaller firms a consequence we've experienced with the Dodd-Frank financial regulations law. Even Facebook's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, acknowledged this possible outcome to Congress a year ago.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, these remedies lean on the premise that only government can solve market inefficiencies that lead to irresponsible corporate behavior.</p><p>I don't think we should feel confident that the bureaucratic leviathan has what it takes to develop or enforce nimble responses to rapid change in the technology industry.</p><p>We should look instead to the greatest driver of competition, the free market, for the most compelling responses to our privacy concerns.</p><p>Technological advancements can meet Americans' demands for privacy, and perhaps already are, through cryptonetworks. Cryptonetworks are decentralized platforms governed by the community of users rather than by chief executives or small management teams.</p><p>You would access these networks by logging on to a browser similar to what you use today. But the piping undergirding the decentralized networks is powered by blockchain technology capable of delivering stronger data security, portability and privacy for every user.</p><p>When you purchase or post something on a blockchain platform, the network will verify your identity using an encrypted key that is permanently and exclusively yours. Each action is recorded on a distributed ledger. This will make fraud nearly impossible.</p><p>Under the current internet framework, users' data is usually controlled by the platform online consumers leave a trail of data bread crumbs, making us vulnerable to privacy invasions. In a decentralized network, however, our data would be controlled by this blockchain encryption. Users would grant and revoke access to data, no longer entrusting third parties or tech companies with that responsibility.</p><p>Furthermore, this technology would increase competition, because blockchain makes it easier for anyone to create an alternative platform for communicating or providing some service. With the open-source nature of blockchain technology, a community of users is free to take what they like from an existing platform to a new one if they feel their privacy has been infringed or trust violated. Accountability is built into the system.</p><p>Each new platform is a fresh opportunity for users and creators to interact, shop and communicate without Big Brother or Big Tech tracking every move.</p><p>In many respects, it is a throwback to the permission-less innovation that brought us the internet we know today. For the free market, there is no better remedy to monopolistic behavior.</p><p>That is not to say that there is zero role for government. The Federal Trade Commission should step in when companies break the law or violate settlements with consumers or the government. Indeed, the F.T.C'.s role is perhaps more important and challenging than ever, because big tech continues to grow bigger.</p><p>Congress also has a role. It should develop a clear privacy framework that sets one federal standard for the country and adheres to three simple principles: You should be able to see, control and delete your data. These standards have the advantage of being bipartisan, which in today's Washington is saying something.</p><p>While the obscurity of blockchain might make it seem intimidating, we are seeing leading technology companies and venture capitalists looking to bring it into the mainstream.</p><p>As the most technologically advanced country in the world, it is America's responsibility to give this technology space to run and grow. Companies that have repeatedly broken promises to their users deserve scrutiny. But the federal government must not mistakenly turn scrutiny into suppression.</p><p>In the right \"light touch\" regulatory environment, decentralized networks can provide the transparent, secure platforms that respect an individual's privacy and dignity.</p><p>Kevin McCarthy, a Republican of California, is the House minority leader.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123066377</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WK3-2721-DYTH-G0P6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"772\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 15, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

That is how Gmail was created. Google says they no longer read your emails, but they allowed third parties to do it. [\u2026] When I\u2019m on Facebook, I\u2019m not the customer, I\u2019m the product.\u201d</p><p>On the Future of Cryptonetworks:</p><p>\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be afraid of technology, but we should understand it so we can get a greater sense of how we can prepare for tomorrow to be better than today\u2026</p><p>\u201cWhen I look at the rest of the world, and yes, we want our currency to be the strongest \u2014 but when you look at technology and where it\u2019s going, and you think about China and these other countries and what they\u2019re trying to do, we cannot keep our heads in the sand. How can we be more secure? How can we protect our own privacy? Privacy is the real concern.</p><p>\u201c[Bitcoin presents] challenges, but that is why we should have hearings, that\u2019s why we should discuss this, and that\u2019s why we can solve these problems.\u201d</p><p>On the Upcoming Congressional Hearing on Facebook\u2019s Libra:</p><p>\u201cNow [Facebook] wants to get into the [financial] business, but [Libra] is not bitcoin\u2026.they\u2019re not decentralized. What I\u2019m really looking for in this hearing is how and when will Libra actually become decentralized.</p><p>\u201cCompanies have to pay $10 million to get into this Libra and there\u2019s only a few selected? So a small business couldn\u2019t get in? So then you\u2019re concerned about competition \u2014 is it really an open and free market? [\u2026] These are questions and it\u2019s right that Washington asks these questions of where we\u2019re going.</p><p>\u201cWhat Facebook is doing \u2014 and you can\u2019t argue against them, they\u2019re trying to keep a monopoly \u2014 they\u2019re trying to keep control. So they went to their biggest customers, and they\u2019ve got a base to start with \u2014 millions of people on the platform \u2014 so let\u2019s control another element of what they\u2019re doing. Why? Because they see where bitcoin and blockchain are going and they want to get out in front of it.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS2215870I</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WMC-6Y51-F0YC-N2GG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"515\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 20, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"/><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>STX000556</classCode><className>EDITORIALS &amp; OPINIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009TD5</classCode><className>US REPUBLICAN PARTY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000100</classCode><className>ANTITRUST &amp; TRADE LAW</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6REEyRTNDM0JGQzYyNEMyOEFGNTAwNUJEOUU1MDg4NjU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><className>Antitrust &amp; Trade Law</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000963</classCode><className>INTERNET PRIVACY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001384</classCode><className>PRIVACY RIGHTS</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUVFRDk5RDc1NUQ4NDE3MTk4REUxMzZEOTFGOTA5ODk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkRCNkMxMjQzMDUxNEZCQ0I4QTkyQzJDOUYwNTA4NjE</classCode><className>Privacy Rights</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST0008X57</classCode><className>CONSUMER LAW</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDJBNDY2Rjc3Mzk4NDI3NUJDOTlCQTRCNzE2M0IwRTU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6REEyRTNDM0JGQzYyNEMyOEFGNTAwNUJEOUU1MDg4NjU</classCode><className>Consumer Protection</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST000DEW4</classCode><className>DIGITAL CURRENCY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>STX001581</classCode><className>SMALL BUSINESS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D7DY</classCode><className>INFORMATION SECURITY &amp; PRIVACY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000963</classCode><className>INTERNET PRIVACY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000D4VG</classCode><className>DATA SECURITY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST000DEW4</classCode><className>DIGITAL CURRENCY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>PE000A0T2</classCode><className>KEVIN MCCARTHY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

Amazon, Apple, Google, and Facebook went before the House Judiciary Committee for a much anticipated antitrust hearing, in which representatives from each company were pressed on their firms' potential anti-competitive practices. Facebook's Libra cryptocurrency faced two days of Congressional hearings and questions over how and why Facebook decided to enter the digital currency market. Overseas, Amazon is facing antitrust investigations from the European Union, and some European governments are targeting Big Tech companies with new taxes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Last week at the White House's Social Media Summit, Leader McCarthy laid the groundwork for similar conversations on Big Tech and its role in protecting consumers' data privacy. In the short term, Leader McCarthy argued, Congress should develop a clear privacy framework that sets one federal standard for the country and adheres to three simple principles: you should be able to see, control and delete your data.</p><p>In the longterm, we should look to the free market for solutions to Big Tech monopolies. For example, technological innovations like decentralized cryptonetworks have the potential to provide the transparent, secure platforms that respect an individual's privacy and dignity.</p><p>\"If there's anything on the Internet for free, you are not the client, you are the product. Facebook was not created so you could talk to one another, Facebook was created to get your data to sell to a third party [...]. The Democrats want to go and break these companies up, but that does nothing for our privacy. They want to regulate [Big Tech companies] so strongly that they create utilities and they protect them; that kills all innovation.</p><p>\"Our data is our privacy, so we should know, on a national level, what somebody can collect, we should be able to move it, and we should be able to delete it.\"</p><p>On Sunday, Leader McCarthy wrote an op-ed for The New York Times in which he postulates that the power of Big Tech has outgrown the government's ability to singularly protect consumer data. Instead, the free market offers innovative and compelling responses to the concerns that Big Tech monopolies have created.</p><p>Excerpts from Leader McCarthy's piece, titled Don't Count on Government to Protect Your Privacy:</p><p>\"I don't think we should feel confident that the bureaucratic leviathan has what it takes to develop or enforce nimble responses to rapid change in the technology industry.</p><p>\"We should look instead to the greatest driver of competition, the free market, for the most compelling responses to our privacy concerns.</p><p>\"Technological advancements can meet Americans' demands for privacy, and perhaps already are, through cryptonetworks. Cryptonetworks are decentralized platforms governed by the community of users rather than by chief executives or small management teams.\"</p><p>On Monday, Leader McCarthy joined CNBC to discuss his New York Times op-ed as well as the future of blockchain and various cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Facebook's Libra.</p><p>\"My concern is the answers that I'm hearing from Washington are really what I heard during Dodd-Frank...It's simplistic: break the companies up -- [which does] nothing to protect my privacy- or create a regulator that will make [Big Tech companies] a utility, taking away all innovation.</p><p>\"We shouldn't be afraid of technology, but we should understand it so we can get a greater sense of how we can prepare for tomorrow to be better than today...\"</p><p>At his weekly press conference on Thursday, Leader McCarthy expressed a healthy dose of skepticism for Facebook's Libra currency, but maintained that it isn't Congress's role to squash innovation. We shouldn't be afraid of new technologies, we should we explore them and modernize the U.S. government with them where possible, Leader McCarthy argued.</p><p>\"I support crypto and Bitcoin. I support innovation, but I have real concerns about Libra because it's not decentralized. I like blockchain, and I think the government should use blockchain. It gives you security...</p><p>\"I watched Chairwoman [Rep. Maxine Waters] of the Financial Services Committee introduce a bill to deny Libra to go forward before they even had a hearing. That's the difference between Democrats and Republicans. [Republicans] believe in innovation, but I also believe that we should have a hearing on [Libra], and maybe we need to put a framework around it.</p><p>\"Privacy to me is like private property, I should know when I go on a site what they're able to get and know about me. It is my property -- I should be able to move it if I want to go to another platform, and I should be able to delete it.</p><p>\"But the one thing I'm not going to do is what [Rep. Waters] did: she put her head in the sand and made sure we don't have innovation. You cannot ignore technology and innovation, but what you can do is make sure there's safeguards around it that protect the privacy of the individuals who are going to use it.\"</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-6814964 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR6814964</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WRY-GKG1-DYG2-R4H1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"849\"/><timeReceived>8:22 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 20, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Amazon, Apple, Google, and Facebook went before the House Judiciary Committee for a much anticipated antitrust hearing, in which representatives from each company were pressed on their firms\u2019 potential anti-competitive practices. Facebook\u2019s Libra cryptocurrency faced two days of Congressional hearings and questions over how and why Facebook decided to enter the digital currency market. Overseas, Amazon is facing antitrust investigations from the European Union, and some European governments are targeting Big Tech companies with new taxes.</p><p>Last week at the White House\u2019s Social Media Summit, Leader McCarthy laid the groundwork for similar conversations on Big Tech and its role in protecting consumers\u2019 data privacy. In the short term, Leader McCarthy argued, Congress should develop a clear privacy framework that sets one federal standard for the country and adheres to three simple principles: you should be able to see, control and delete your data.</p><p>In the longterm, we should look to the free market for solutions to Big Tech monopolies. For example, technological innovations like decentralized cryptonetworks have the potential to provide the transparent, secure platforms that respect an individual\u2019s privacy and dignity.</p><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s anything on the Internet for free, you are not the client, you are the product. Facebook was not created so you could talk to one another, Facebook was created to get your data to sell to a third party [\u2026]. The Democrats want to go and break these companies up, but that does nothing for our privacy. They want to regulate [Big Tech companies] so strongly that they create utilities and they protect them; that kills all innovation.</p><p>\u201cOur data is our privacy, so we should know, on a national level, what somebody can collect, we should be able to move it, and we should be able to delete it.\u201d</p><p>On Sunday, Leader McCarthy wrote an op-ed for The New York Times in which he postulates that the power of Big Tech has outgrown the government\u2019s ability to singularly protect consumer data. Instead, the free market offers innovative and compelling responses to the concerns that Big Tech monopolies have created.</p><p>Excerpts from Leader McCarthy\u2019s piece, titled Don\u2019t Count on Government to Protect Your Privacy:</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we should feel confident that the bureaucratic leviathan has what it takes to develop or enforce nimble responses to rapid change in the technology industry.\u201cWe should look instead to the greatest driver of competition, the free market, for the most compelling responses to our privacy concerns.</p><p>\u201cTechnological advancements can meet Americans\u2019 demands for privacy, and perhaps already are, through cryptonetworks. Cryptonetworks are decentralized platforms governed by the community of users rather than by chief executives or small management teams.\u201d</p><p>On Monday, Leader McCarthy joined CNBC to discuss his New York Times op-ed as well as the future of blockchain and various cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Facebook\u2019s Libra.</p><p>\u201cMy concern is the answers that I\u2019m hearing from Washington are really what I heard during Dodd-Frank\u2026It\u2019s simplistic: break the companies up \u2014 [which does] nothing to protect my privacy\u2013 or create a regulator that will make [Big Tech companies] a utility, taking away all innovation.</p><p>\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be afraid of technology, but we should understand it so we can get a greater sense of how we can prepare for tomorrow to be better than today\u2026\u201d</p><p>At his weekly press conference on Thursday, Leader McCarthy expressed a healthy dose of skepticism for Facebook\u2019s Libra currency, but maintained that it isn\u2019t Congress\u2019s role to squash innovation. We shouldn\u2019t be afraid of new technologies, we should we explore them and modernize the U.S government with them where possible, Leader McCarthy argued.</p><p>\u201cI support crypto and Bitcoin. I support innovation, but I have real concerns about Libra because it\u2019s not decentralized. I like blockchain, and I think the government should use blockchain. It gives you security\u2026</p><p>\u201cI watched Chairwoman [Rep. Maxine Waters] of the Financial Services Committee introduce a bill to deny Libra to go forward before they even had a hearing. That\u2019s the difference between Democrats and Republicans. [Republicans] believe in innovation, but I also believe that we should have a hearing on [Libra], and maybe we need to put a framework around it.</p><p>\u201cPrivacy to me is like private property, I should know when I go on a site what they\u2019re able to get and know about me. It is my property \u2014 I should be able to move it if I want to go to another platform, and I should be able to delete it.</p><p>\u201cBut the one thing I\u2019m not going to do is what [Rep. Waters] did: she put her head in the sand and made sure we don\u2019t have innovation. You cannot ignore technology and innovation, but what you can do is make sure there\u2019s safeguards around it that protect the privacy of the individuals who are going to use it.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS2215872I</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WMC-6Y51-F0YC-N2GH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"841\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 20, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

For example, technological innovations like decentralized cryptonetworks have the potential to provide the transparent, secure platforms that respect an individual's privacy and dignity.</p><p>\"If there's anything on the Internet for free, you are not the client, you are the product. Facebook was not created so you could talk to one another, Facebook was created to get your data to sell to a third party [...]. The Democrats want to go and break these companies up, but that does nothing for our privacy. They want to regulate [Big Tech companies] so strongly that they create utilities and they protect them; that kills all innovation.</p><p>\"Our data is our privacy, so we should know, on a national level, what somebody can collect, we should be able to move it, and we should be able to delete it.\"</p><p>On Sunday, Leader McCarthy wrote an op-ed for The New York Times in which he postulates that the power of Big Tech has outgrown the government's ability to singularly protect consumer data. Instead, the free market offers innovative and compelling responses to the concerns that Big Tech monopolies have created.</p><p>Excerpts from Leader McCarthy's piece, titled Don't Count on Government to Protect Your Privacy:</p><p>\"I don't think we should feel confident that the bureaucratic leviathan has what it takes to develop or enforce nimble responses to rapid change in the technology industry.</p><p>\"We should look instead to the greatest driver of competition, the free market, for the most compelling responses to our privacy concerns.</p><p>\"Technological advancements can meet Americans' demands for privacy, and perhaps already are, through cryptonetworks. Cryptonetworks are decentralized platforms governed by the community of users rather than by chief executives or small management teams.\"</p><p>On Monday, Leader McCarthy joined CNBC to discuss his New York Times op-ed as well as the future of blockchain and various cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Facebook's Libra.</p><p>\"My concern is the answers that I'm hearing from Washington are really what I heard during Dodd-Frank...It's simplistic: break the companies up [which does] nothing to protect my privacy or create a regulator that will make [Big Tech companies] a utility, taking away all innovation.</p><p>\"We shouldn't be afraid of technology, but we should understand it so we can get a greater sense of how we can prepare for tomorrow to be better than today...\"</p><p>At his weekly press conference on Thursday, Leader McCarthy expressed a healthy dose of skepticism for Facebook's Libra currency, but maintained that it isn't Congress's role to squash innovation. We shouldn't be afraid of new technologies, we should we explore them and modernize the U.S. government with them where possible, Leader McCarthy argued.</p><p>\"I support crypto and Bitcoin. I support innovation, but I have real concerns about Libra because it's not decentralized. I like blockchain, and I think the government should use blockchain. It gives you security...</p><p>\"I watched Chairwoman [Rep. Maxine Waters] of the Financial Services Committee introduce a bill to deny Libra to go forward before they even had a hearing. That's the difference between Democrats and Republicans. [Republicans] believe in innovation, but I also believe that we should have a hearing on [Libra], and maybe we need to put a framework around it.</p><p>\"Privacy to me is like private property, I should know when I go on a site what they're able to get and know about me. It is my property I should be able to move it if I want to go to another platform, and I should be able to delete it.</p><p>\"But the one thing I'm not going to do is what [Rep. Waters] did: she put her head in the sand and made sure we don't have innovation. You cannot ignore technology and innovation, but what you can do is make sure there's safeguards around it that protect the privacy of the individuals who are going to use it.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123078725</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WM4-TYV1-JCBF-S561-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"840\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 20, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Instead of forceful action against the likes of Facebook and Google, they say, the FTC leans on rules that make it hard to impose penalties bigger than rounding errors for the companies. Those critics have an unusual champion: Joseph Simons, the man running the agency. </p><p>\"We have this over-100-year-old statute that is our main authority,\" Simons said in his first sit-down interview since becoming chairman 10 months ago. \"And clearly legislators who approved that were not thinking about data security and privacy issues.\" In the deregulatory era of the Trump administration, Simons, 60, a Republican lawyer who has jumped between the public and private sectors for more than 30 years, is a rare voice for strengthening the government's hand. Simons has urged Congress to expand the FTC's privacy enforcement powers and allow it to impose fines more easily, write new rules and hire more experts. He also says the agency should police how all companies and nonprofits - not just technology companies - collect and handle people's digital data. But none of those changes will happen before Simons must make the most eagerly awaited decision on data privacy in the agency's history. In the coming weeks, he and the FTC's four other commissioners are expected to finish a probe on whether Facebook violated its promises to protect people's data. The outcome of the case is seen as a referendum on the government's ability to rein in tech giants that have amassed incredible wealth and power from collecting and bartering user data. \"The FTC's decision on Facebook will be highly consequential, for the FTC and Facebook, for the tech industry and for consumers,\" said David Vladeck, who led consumer protection at the agency during the Obama administration. \"The commission's action will set the bar.\" The case has taken on huge significance in Washington, where Facebook has become Exhibit A for an industry accused of problems ranging from enabling foreign election interference to crushing competitors. A rising chorus of Republican and Democratic lawmakers has criticized the FTC for not restraining the companies' data-collection practices, which are central to some of their businesses. The agency's biggest penalty on a tech company was a $22 million fine imposed on Google in 2012 for misrepresenting how it used some online tracking tools. Google reported $50 billion in revenue that year. On Friday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who is running for president, announced a sweeping plan to strengthen regulations against big tech companies.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HCHRN-MERLIN65153781</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HCHRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMB-MT11-DYRV-406F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8380</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"445\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Hearst Newspapers, a division of Hearst Communications, Inc.
