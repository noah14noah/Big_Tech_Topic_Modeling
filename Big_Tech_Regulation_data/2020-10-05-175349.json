The operations netted the arrest of eleven suspected mujahideen.

As today's advance Gross Domestic Product (GDP) release confirms, economic growth continued in the third quarter of 2019, beating market expectations and adding to the expansion's record length. The release also confirms that the Trump Administration's policies support sustained economic growth and lead to higher incomes for American families.[55]  Arizona Democratic Party Chairwoman Felecia Rotellini Falsely Accused President Trump of Aligning Himself With ISIS[56] Rotellini made the deranged claim on Saturday night, at the same time that President Trump was overseeing the mission to kill ISIS founder Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.[57]  Breaking: Twitter to Stop All Political Advertisements[58] Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey released a statement on Twitter, giving his reasons for why his platform would not allow paid political advertising. One of the reasons he gave was that, 'a political message earns reach when people decide to follow an account or retweet. Paying for reach removes that decision, forcing highly optimized and targeted political messages on people. We believe this decision should not be compromised by money.'[59]  Conservative Inc. vs the 'Dissident Right'[60] Is there a burgeoning civil war within the conservative movement?[61]  Dem. Prez Wannabe Kamala Harris Connected to Deep State and Clinton Organized Crime[62] Although many Americans are aware that Harris' climb up the political ladder allegedly began the 'old fashion way:' on a motel bed with former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown, who remains a powerful political figure in California. There are other stories about Sen. Harris such as her propensity for exaggerating her past and her self-congratulating description of her education and her legal training. Yet she appears ready and able to ride-out most controversies and is still considered a contender by the Trump-hating, Democratic Party water-carriers in the majority of the nation's newsrooms. However, one element of the True Kamala Harris Story that the news media avoids reporting is the connection between Sen. Harris and her Deep State operative sister, Maya Harris, 52, who worked closely with the 2016 Clinton campaign and was part of Hillary's inner-circle. In fact, during FBI Director James Comey sham investigation of Hillary Clinton's suspicious shenanigans, Maya Harris was one of the suspects given total immunity even before she said one word to FBI agents about Clinton's email, her private server or any other charges against the Clintion State Department and Bill and Hillary's financial Quid Pro Quo scam. Maya Lakshmi Harris (born January 30, 1967) is a lawyer, public policy advocate, and television commentator. Her leftist ideology made her an excellent political analyst for the deceptive and seditious MSNBC. Her trip into the Deep State came about in 2015 when he was appointed as one of three senior policy advisors to lead the development of an agenda for Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign. She also was a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress (CAP). From 2008 until she took her current position, she was Vice President for Democracy, Rights and Justice at the Ford Foundation. CAP's website presents statistics that are at best questionable especially about President Donald Trump.[63]  Famed Pathologist Dr. Baden: Evidence Shows Jeffrey Epstein's Death Was a Homicide (Video)[64] On Wednesday morning famed pathologist Dr. Michael Baden went on FOX and Friends where he said evidence points to homicide over suicide in Epstein's prison death. Dr. Baden also pointed to the three broken neck bones were 'very unusual of suicide and more indicative of homicide strangulation.[65]  House Dems Block GOP Effort to Prevent Nationwide Fracking Ban[66] House Democrats blocked Tuesday consideration of a resolution in support of hydraulic fracturing as Republicans sought to protect the U.S. energy boom from Democratic presidential candidates seeking to ban fracking nationwide. The resolution, sponsored by Rep. Rob Bishop, Utah Republican, affirmed that states should 'maintain primacy for the regulation of hydraulic fracturing for oil and natural gas production on state and private lands,' and that no president should impose a moratorium without congressional approval.[67]  Jeffrey Epstein's Autopsy More Consistent With Homicidal Strangulation Than Suicide, Dr. Michael Baden Reveals[68] The body of disgraced money man and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who was found dead in his Manhattan federal prison cell in August, bore telltale signs of homicide despite an official ruling that he killed himself, a pioneering forensic pathologist revealed to 'Fox ...iends' in an exclusive interview Wednesday. The bombshell claim by Dr. Michael Baden, a former New York City medical examiner who has worked on high-profile cases during a five-decade medical career, is certain to reignite suspicions that surfaced immediately after Epstein, who was awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges involving underage girls, was discovered dead in his cell on Aug. 10. Baden, who was hired by Epstein's brother and observed the autopsy, told Fox News its findings are more consistent with homicidal strangulation than suicidal hanging. He noted that the 66-year-old Epstein had two fractures on the left and right sides of his larynx, specifically the thyroid cartilage or Adam's apple, as well as one fracture on the left hyoid bone above the Adam's apple, Baden told Fox News.[69]  Kanye West Speaks of 'Going Alex Jones Level' During Interview[70] Kanye West raised the prospect of 'going Alex Jones level' as he railed against cancel culture and the attempt to diminish Christianity in America. West, who just dropped his highly anticipated Christian album Jesus is King, made the statement during a recent interview. The music icon mentioned Jones in response to a question about if he was afraid of losing his audience over his political opinions.[71]  Kevin Spacey Won't be Charged in Sexual Assault Case After Accuser Dies[72] The Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office has formally dropped a case against actor Kevin Spacey, after the accuser died. The accuser, a massage therapist, alleged that Spacey tried to kiss him and forced him to grab his genitals during a session in Malibu in October 2016. The accuser, who was never identified, went to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, which referred the investigation to the D.A.'s office in July 2018. The D.A.'s office has been reviewing the matter since then, and had not made a decision on whether to bring charges at the time of the accuser's death. The accuser's civil attorney, who had filed suit against Spacey in September 2018, notified Spacey's lawyers that the accuser had died last month. A source told Variety that the accuser died of cancer.[73]  Moonbeam Brown Still Blaming Trump, GOP for California Fires: 'Blood on Your Soul'[74] Former California Governor Jerry Brown told Congress on Tuesday that President Donald Trump and the Republican Party were responsible for the ongoing California fires because of their opposition to drastic climate change policies. 'California's burning while the deniers make a joke out of the standards that protect us all,' Brown told the House Oversight Committee on Tuesday, as quoted by the San Francisco Chronicle. 'The blood is on your soul here and I hope you wake up. Because this is not politics, this is life, this is morality. This is real.'[75]  Obama Slates 'Wokeness'; 'That's Not Activism'[76] 'This idea of purity and you're never compromised and you're always politically woke and all that stuff, you should get over that quickly.' Many have criticized 'woke' culture as a new form of puritanism, however a surprising development occurred Tuesday when former President Obama slated the idea as politically naive, saying that people need to 'get over that quickly.' Speaking during his foundation's third annual summit in Chicago, Obama said wokeness is 'not activism':[77]  PayPal De-Platforms Conservative Street Artist Sabo, Holds His Funds for Six Months[78] On Monday evening, Sabo, the conservative street artist who is mostly known for his street posters that randomly pop up in California, reported on his Facebook page that he has now been kicked off of PayPal. 'Today Paypal canceled my account with all of my money in it,' he announced. 'They are holding my funds for the next 6 months.' PayPal is the money exchanging platform Sabo used to earn income, and this de-platforming hits him hard financially. 'I explained to them that I live in a city with 60,000 homeless people and that they are about to make me and my wife join their ranks.'[79]  Sean Hannity Predicts Durham Investigation Will 'Shock'[80] (WASHINGTON EXAMINER) \u2014 Fox News host Sean Hannity said the Justice Department's criminal investigation into the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation will 'shock the conscience and soul of the nation.' He made the bold assertion on Saturday during a Politicon discussion with Democratic strategist James Carville in Nashville, Tennessee. 'There's a lot coming,' Hannity said. 'We got the Horowitz report on FISA abuse report coming. My sources tell me it will shock the conscience and soul of a nation and when the Durham report comes out, that will similarly shock the conscience and soul of the nation about abuse of power and corruption.'[81]  Senate Republican Says Pelosi Has 'So Much Hatred'[82] President Trump protected American troops by keeping House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in the dark about the raid that killed Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi, a Senate Republican said. 'If you're worried about our troops, you can tell that, I mean \u2014 Pelosi hates Trump, and she's going to do everything she can to hurt him,' Florida Sen. Rick Scott told the Washington Examiner. 'And you can't trust them. I think Trump made a good decision.' Scott, a Republican member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, echoed Trump's suggestion that Pelosi might have endangered U.S. forces by leaking information about the raid. Trump's stance drew condemnation from Democratic lawmakers, as the death of the world's most wanted terrorist provided another opportunity for a partisan dispute in Washington.[83]  Texas Sheriff Says He Will Not Comply With Beto's 'Unconstitutional' Gun Confiscation Plan[84] 'I feel that this type of action would be an attack on the Constitution.'[85]  The Anti-Israel J Street Democrats[86] by Ben Shapiro This week, four of the top candidates for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination \u2014 Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, Julian Castro and Bernie Sanders \u2014 gathered at the J Street Conference to explain why the United States ought to pressure the state of Israel to make concessions to terrorists, why the Obama administration was correct to appease the Iranian regime and why American Jews ought to value the opinions of Bernie Sanders over those of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the future of Jewish safety. Two other top Democrats \u2014 Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden \u2014 sent video messages in support of the group. By contrast, when the American Israel Public Affairs Committee held its annual conference in March, not a single Democratic presidential candidate showed up. The Democrats are, by and large, simply too ashamed to stand with an actual pro-Israel group, although prominent congressional leaders still show up to mouth nostrums about bipartisan support for Israel. But the heart of the Democratic Party has moved against Israel. That's because Israel is economically successful, while its enemies are not; Israel is liberal, while its enemies are not; Israel is the tip of the spear of Western civilization in an area known for its tribalism and brutality. This means that according to the radical left, Israel is an exploitative country hell-bent on domination, despite its lack of territorial ambition \u2014 Israel has signed over large swaths of land won through military victory to geopolitical enemies, and offered much more repeatedly. So the Democrats built up and gave credence to J Street, a Trojan horse group dedicated to undermining American support for Israel and justifying left-wing hatred of the Jewish state. J Street was founded by Clinton operative Jeremy Ben-Ami and Israeli far-left political figure Daniel Levy in late 2007. One of its chief sources of funding \u2014 a source obscured in the early years by its founders \u2014 was anti-Israel radical George Soros.[87]  Top Republican Devin Nunes Accuses Adam Schiff of Repeatedly Coaching Witnesses, Refusing to Allow GOP Lawmakers to Ask Questions (Video)[88] Rep. Devin Nunes: 'I have never in my life seen anything like what happened today. I mean they've been bad in most of these depositions. But to interrupt us continually, to coach the witness, to decide whether or not, what we're going to be able to ask the witness, and we don't even get any witnesses at this point. And it doesn't look like we're going to get any ever. But to not let us ask questions? I've never had that. And to see someone coach a witness? This isn't the first time. Schiff is very good at coaching witnesses. Remember? He also met with the 'whistleblower.' So this is just unprecedented.'[89]  Halloween Cancelled in Parts of Quebec, Maybe Ontario[90] Halloween is going to be a wet one this year. Torrential rain is expected throughout the country, complicating the plans of families everywhere. As well as this, snow is expected throughout southern Ontario and some parts of Quebec. Due to the volume of the expected rainfall, five Quebec municipalities have asked parents to delay their children trick-or-treating until Friday, dampening celebrations. So far, the city of Montreal has not yet asked parents to delay Halloween in Quebec's largest city.[91]  Ousted Polar Bear Scientist Deserves Academic Freedom[92] The apex predator of the north is the polar bear, which devours about 150 pounds of meat at a sitting. Fortunately for the seals (and occasional humans) polar bears dine out only every five or six days. Polar bears, of course, have been elevated by environmentalists to the status of demi-gods of the wilderness.[93]  11 Suspected Jihadists Arrested in Swiss Raids, Including Several Minors[94] A large-scale anti-terror raid in three cantons across Switzerland has led to the arrest of 11 suspected jihadists including five minors.

Click off now if you're eating your lunch. A video out of Spain posted by RT shows blood being taken out of the body via syringe, mixed with grated meat, boiled and then eaten. Gross.[99]  France: Man Arrested After Shouting 'Allahu Akbar' During Joker-Screening[100] A man who shouted 'Allah hu Akbar' in a Paris movie theatre during a screening of Joker has been arrested after causing filmgoers to panic and run out in terror. The incident occurred on Sunday evening at the Grand Rex complex, supposedly 'Europe's largest cinema', and saw the man shout the phrase that's commonly said before terrorist attacks, causing cinema-goers to panic and dash for the exits, Le Parisien reports.[101]  France: Statistics Show Paris Violent Crime and Robberies Surging[102] Crime statistics in the French capital show a continued surge in violent crime, with some areas of the city seeing as much as a 70 per cent rise in violent incidents. The statistics, which were sent to the various mayors of the districts of the Paris region, show a nine per cent rise in violent attacks for a total of more than 35,000 assaults since the start of this year alone, according to analysis by Le Figaro.[103]  Norway: Turks and Kurds Clash in Demonstrations, A Shop Looted and Cars Demolished[104] Central Oslo was hit by a brawl between Turks and Kurds, because of the situation in Turkey and Syria. It started last Saturday with two demonstrations outside the Turkish embassy in Oslo. The two demonstrations consisted of people who were for and against Turkey's invasion of northern Syria respectively. A rather peaceful pro-Turkey demonstration started at 1 pm, but two hours later a Kurdish counter-demonstration started, which was a protest against Turkey's offensive in northern Syria. A kurdish flag was spotted.[105]  Radical Muslim Arrested for Threatening to Kill Swedish and Danish Royals[106] Danish police arrested a 33-year-old Muslim man in Copenhagen after he threatened on social media to behead members of the Swedish and Danish royal families. The man, who has been described as being radicalised, made the threats on Facebook saying that he wanted to chop off the heads of the King of Sweden and the Queen of Denmark. His wife saw the remarks, and she reported him to the police, Expressen reports.[107]  Spain: Massive Machete Brawl Between Rival Pakistani Gangs[108] A massive machete brawl that broke out between rival Pakistani gangs on Tuesday night in Barcelona has left one man dead and two others badly injured. Local reports say that up to 30 men from two groups of rival Pakistani gangs were involved in the street fight where weapons like machetes, knives, and baseball bats were used, The Daily Mail reports. The fight is said to have erupted close to 10 pm last night in Badalona, a city which constitutes part of the Barcelona metropolitan area.[109]  Switzerland: Someone Named This Architectural Monstrosity 'Project of the Week'[110] A building that looks like some kind of hideously imposing Stasi spy compound has been awarded 'project of the week,' underscoring again how modern architecture is relentlessly terrible. The structure, which houses the Muse Cantonal des Beaux-Arts in Lausanne, Switzerland, appears from a distance to be an almost endless parade of faceless concrete slabs slammed together. The monstrosity has absolutely no redeeming features whatsoever, no attempt at anything ornate or anything other than a cold, functional, atomizing imposition.[111]  Switzerland: Police Conduct Large-Scale Anti-Terror Raids[112] Swiss police carried out large-scale anti-terror raids across three regions on Tuesday. During the raids, the homes of 11 people with suspected links to radical Islamic terrorist organizations were searched.

'I am, like many others, questioning whether I should keep using Facebook or not,' Thunberg wrote in a Facebook postlast week. 'Allowing hate speech, the lack of fact-checking and, of course, the issues of interfering with democracy are among many, many other things that are very upsetting.' 'The constant lies and conspiracy theories about me and countless others, of course, result in hate, death threats and ultimately violence. This could easily be stopped if Facebook wanted to. I find the lack of taking responsibility very disturbing,' she added.[115]  The BBC Thought Police[116] Celebrated interfaith activist Lord Indarjit Singh has sensationally quit BBC Radio 4 after accusing it of behaving like the 'thought police'. He alleges that the corporation tried to prevent him discussing a historical Sikh religious figure who stood up to Muslim oppression \u2014 in case it caused offence to Muslims, despite a lack of complaints. The Sikh peer, who has been a contributor on Radio Four's Thought For The Day programme for more than three decades, is also accusing Radio Four bosses of 'prejudice and intolerance' and over-sensitivity in relation to its coverage of Islam, after he says he was 'blocked' from discussing the forced conversion of Hindus to Islam, under the Mughal emperors in 17th century India. The 87-year-old peer's resignation comes as a blow to the show's flagship segment, that has been a part of Radio Four's Today programme since 1970, and has been described by Britain's former chief rabbi, Lord Jonathan Sacks, as 'one of the last remaining places in the public square where religious communities are given a voice in Britain.'[117]  UK: After Brexit Day Disappointment Farage Party Offers Tories an Alliance[118] The Brexit Party is still reportedly open to an alliance with the Tories, despite recent rebuffs, if Prime Minister Johnson backs a clean-break Brexit in the forthcoming general election. The Times reports a Brexit Party source as saying: 'Boris Johnson said that we would leave on October 31; we will be criticising him for that. The offer still stands for a Brexit alliance [at the election].'[119]  UK: Brexit Party: Labour 'Worried' About Farage Takeover of Heartlands[120] Sources within the Brexit Party have said that the Labour establishment's mood in their Leave-backing constituencies is 'absolutely febrile' due to fears Nigel Farage will wipe them out in the December 12th General Election. A Brexit Party spokesman told The Telegraph in comments published on Tuesday: 'I know for a fact that the Labour establishment in Wales and the northeast, especially Durham, are really worried.'[121]  UK: Frantic Blair Says: 'Don't Mix Up Election With Brexit', After Labour Defied His Calls to Block Vote[122] Hardline Remainer Tony Blair has said that Labour should never have agreed to a snap election, and he refused to back party leader Jeremy Corbyn as the next occupant of Number 10. Speaking to Channel 4 News's Matt Frei on Wednesday, the former Labour prime minister said his party voting for a December 12th election was 'an act of extraordinary stupidity'[123]  UK: Swansea Council Cancels Gig by Controversial Comedian Roy Chubby Brown Because He 'Doesn't Reflect' Its Values[124] Controversial comedian Roy Chubby Brown will not be performing in Swansea next year, after the city's Labour council cancelled a planned appearance because it 'doesn't reflect its values'. The entertainer, 74, was due to appear in the Welsh city next April to perform at its Grand Theatre. But Swansea Council has now scrapped the show after deciding it would not work alongside its new 'programming aspirations'.[125]  Breaking: Pentagon Releases Video of Raid on Al-Baghdadi[126] The United States Pentagon has just released air footage of the United States' raid on an ISIS compound where ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was found and later died.

'The biodiversity in Turkish seas is immense, but this abundance did not decently come to light. We worked really well in Aegean, Mediterranean and Marmara [seas]. If researches increase in the Black Sea, the diversity of species will increase as well,' Ertan Dagli, a member of the faculty, told Anadolu Agency reporters. Samples of the newly discovered species are currently kept in the faculty's museum, Dagli conveyed. While examining data from the last 14 years, scientists have come across one fish, insect and shellfish, six coral, 20 arthropod and 27 annelid species. All of the newly discovered species have entered world literature as Turkish scientists named them. One of the species was named 'Prionospio Anatolica,' an attribute to the rich biodiversity in Anatolian lands.[131]  Whaddya Know: Ukraine Whistleblower is a Biden, Schiff, And DNC Errand Boy[132] Real Clear Investigations (RCI) released a detailed examination of evidence that seems to support much of the speculation as to the real identity of the whistleblower that got the impeachment ball rolling after President Trump's now-infamous 'Ukraine call.'[133]  Hong Kong Protesters Target Party District on Potentially Hazardous Halloween[134] HONG KONG (Reuters) \u2014 Thousands of Hong Kong pro-democracy protesters, many of whom still wear now-banned face-masks, plan to combine with fancy-dress clubbers on Thursday in the party district of Lan Kwai Fong on a potentially dangerous and rowdy Halloween.

Chile also canceled APEC, the Asia Pacific Economic Conference that was to open November 16th and at which President Trump had hoped to sign a major accord with China. The shocking cancellations come as Chile has been rocked by violent protests. It appears that Chile can no longer ensure the safety of international diplomats.[141]  Belgium: 28 Illegal Migrants Arrested at Antwerp-Berchem Station[142] 28 illegal migrants were arrested at the Antwerp-Berchem train station during a large-scale police check on trains and at stations.

Less than 200 meters away from the Toronto Public Library that hosted the event, a skateboarder careened out of nowhere and hit the Uber car before skating off on his way.

Thankfully there were three police officers immediately available to take witness statements and I was keen to give my information so I could get to the event. Unfortunately, a helpful bystander kept pointing at me and saying 'She's wrong! I saw everything!!'

women, rallied hundreds of chanting protesters.[155]  The Left's Sinister View for America Involves Your Children[156] Share this link to thwart Big Tech censors![157]  The Sun Has Been Spotless for a

The aggressive migrants are allegedly armed with knives, and possibly firearms. In other news, the British Army is attempting to address a manpower shortage by looking for new recruits from the 53 nations of the Commonwealth.

Not only was network coverage of Republicans far more hostile (88% negative) than that meted out to Democrats (53% negative), but we found nearly ten times more negative statements about Republicans and President Trump (97) than all of the Democratic candidates combined (10). In fact, coverage of the entire field of Democratic candidates would have been 67 percent positive if it hadn't been for negative comments in stories about Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren's DNA test.[70]  Emergency Alert to Trump Concerning Foreign Election Meddling, Voter Fraud, ...nsorship[71] If Republicans lose midterms, it's because of coordinated fraud by Dems and foreign powers like China, EU working with collaborator traitors in U.S., and it must be challenged Note from Alex Jones: All evidence shows that a populist red wave is unstoppable worldwide, as was just witnessed in Brazil and Germany. Just as polls were fake in 2016, the polls are similarly fake now, but still show a smaller margin of defeat for Republicans. This is a major indicator that the landslide we saw for Trump in 2016 that was able to defeat the election/voter fraud carried out by the Democrats is going to be even bigger this year, but coupled with massive coordinated censorship of conservative and nationalist media, huge evidence of Democrats voting in the names of dead people, and other forms of election fraud. All this points towards the serious possibility the American people and Republican Party may have the midterms stolen from us through fraud. It must be contested by the Republicans in Congress, it must be challenged by the American People, it must be battled and overturned by the president. But even if we win, the cancer of organized crime represented by the Democrats and their foreign handlers must be challenged and removed or this country has no hope of surviving into the future. Remember, the Democrats always blame their enemies for what they themselves are doing, so when they claimed election fraud by the Russians and election meddling by Republicans, the truth was the Democrats were involved with the Russians, not the other way around. Well this time we have major election fraud by Communist China and others meddling inside our election \u2014 and worst of all it's all being done in the open, in our face. We have the proof, and future hearings and investigations will bear decisive fruit. Alex Jones, who predicted Donald Trump's presidential win in 2016, is now warning that a perfect storm of Big Tech censorship, foreign interference, and Democrat-orchestrated election fraud coupled with MSM blocking Republicans from even advertising, forms a massive Blue seawall of traitorous fraud that may stop the Red Wave. To be clear, even if America is able to fight its way through this unprecedented fraud, and Republicans hold onto Congress, we the people must go on the offensive and demand that the anti-American criminal network known as the Democrat Party be brought to justice if this nation has any hope of surviving. We have to start creating the new narrative \u2014 which is the true narrative \u2014 that we won and that populists are winning all over the world, but the globalists have made their stand here in America, and are putting in place the most incredible perfect storm of coordinated fraud we've ever seen: $32 billion pumped in by Soros, huge election meddling by the Communist Chinese and EU, armies of illegal aliens organized to vote using the names they stole from dead Americans, the total and complete draconian censorship of conservatives, the blocking of Republican ads on Facebook and CNN, by allowing Democrats to pile on and spend 10 to 1. This is all total proof of their desperate power grab and attempt to steal the election. If they win, instead of letting them go on the offense, we must go on total offense with the fact that they've hung themselves by the incredible crimes they've openly committed. This way our troops are mobilized and aren't demoralized by any defeats and understand the real fight is just starting. Bottom line, Democrats are America-hating traitors. This is a maxim they embrace. Better put, they're NOT Americans. Powerful multinational corporations allied with foreign dictatorships knew they could never take the U.S. down from without, it had to be done from the inside. You are witnessing that attempted takedown. We are literally fighting for the very existence of our Republic. In closing, we leave you with 4 tips on facing your enemies and getting your head in the game from author Robert Greene's 33 Strategies of War:[72]  Georgia Investigating Democrats for Allegedly Hacking Voting System[73] The 'vulnerabilities' could potentially allow anybody to access the voting records of individual voters Two days before the Nov. 6 midterm elections, Georgia Secretary of State and Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp revealed on Sunday that his office is opening an investigation into the Georgia Democratic Party on allegations that it attempted to hack the state's voting system, including allegations of possible cyber crimes.[74]  Georgia Democratic Party Being Investigated for 'Cyber Crimes'[75] It appears that the Russians aren't the only ones trying to hack our elections. Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, who is the Republican candidate for governor, announced that his office has opened an investigation into the state Democratic Party over possible cyber crimes. Kemp said he had notified federal agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI.[76]  Google: Biased YouTube 'Can't be Forced to Change'[77] Bloomberg's Peter Blumberg wrote that Google 'made clear that even if it does discriminate on the basis of political viewpoints \u2014 which it denies \u2014 it can't be forced to change.' While the First Amendment doesn't apply necessarily to private companies, YouTube, Google's sister company, tries to make the case that it is a neutral platform with no political bias.[78]  How to Beat 'Cabin Fever' During the Winter With Vitamin D[79] Vitamin D is an essential nutrient and one that can be synthesized by our body when sunlight hits our skin. But during the winter when we are curled up by a warm fire sipping hot cocoa, it can be hard to get enough vitamin D to keep the body running in tip-top shape. Vitamin D is a precursor hormone and has multiple roles in the human body. It helps to maintain the health of bones and teeth, support the health of the immune system, brain, and nervous system. It also helps regulate insulin levels and aid in diabetes management. Vitamin D also supports lung function and cardiovascular health while influencing the expression of genes involved in cancer development. Researchers in clinical studies had tested fifty-five adults between 18 and 65 with artificial light sources containing ultraviolet radiation or UV rays. The adults participating in this study were told to sit under a heat lamp or UV light in their underwear for up to 10 minutes. Researchers noticed that their vitamin D levels increased afterward. Of course, buying UV lights or heat lamps and sitting around under those lights in your underwear might not be the best or easiest solution for most people.[80]  Ken Starr: Trump 'Not Even Close' To Committing Impeachable Offense[81] During Sunday's broadcast of 'The Cats Roundtable' on New York AM 970 radio, former Whitewater independent counsel Ken Starr said from what he has seen, there is 'no evidence' that President Donald Trump has committed anything 'close' to an impeachable offense. Host John Catsimatidis asked Starr, 'In your opinion, has Trump done anything that is impeachable?' 'Not even close,' Starr replied. 'I know of no evidence that would suggest that he has committed high crimes and misdemeanors. You can hate the way he tweets or whatever. You can disagree with his policies. But be very careful before you move the country toward impeachment. It's inherently divisive. Essentially, you need a consensus among 'we the people.' We the American people need to agree this president should go.' 'We have a nation divided, but a nation divided does not mean let's get rid of the president,' he added.[82]  Levin: Midterms Are About Free Press, Defeating the 'Many Radicals' Nominated by Dems[83] With the midterm elections just days away, Mark Levin stressed to his viewers that the media was 'crucially' important in the United States. 'What kind of soldier are you?' he asked. 'Are you a soldier for liberty or not? Because that's what this election's all about.'[84]  N.Y. Times Finally Exposes the Cause of Mass Illiteracy[85] From FreedomProject Media: It may be a century late to the party, but the Grey Lady has finally gotten around to exposing the most destructive quackery in American history \u2014 the 'whole language' method used to 'teach reading' (or not) that is used in government schools all over America; a scam so destructive that it has some half of Americans almost functionally illiterate, according to the government's own tests. In a New York Times opinion column headlined 'Why Are We Still Teaching Reading the Wrong Way?,' researcher Emily Hanford points out that 'teacher preparation programs continue to ignore the sound science behind how people become readers.' 'It's a problem that has been hiding in plain sight for decades,' she added, without acknowledging that experts such as Rudolf Flesch of Why Johnny Can't Read fame and Dr. Samuel Blumenfeld with The New Illiterates were blowing the whistle on this for many decades. In fact, Boston's school masters rebelled against this quackery in the 1840s with a devastating critique.[86]  'Nazis Weren't Socialists' Says SJW History Major Arrested for Throwing Milk at Conservatives[87] Social justice warrior and history major Shelby Shoup was arrested for throwing chocolate milk at a fellow student and College Republican tabling at Florida State University while saying 'nazis weren't socialists.' She has been charged with battery. Check out our latest live read video, where DCNF reporters comment on her assault and campus craziness in the viral video.[88]  New Species of Tick Found in New Hampshire[89] Just what New Hampshire needs: A new species of tick has arrived. The species is called Asian longhorned tick, although to the casual eye it doesn't seem to have any horns. It is the first new tick species found in the U.S. in half a century. It has been found in nine states along the Eastern seaboard. In Asia, it is known to transmit a number of diseases, but according to reports it rarely bites humans. None of the Asian longhorned ticks found in this country have carried any human diseases. As a result, the tick is considered mostly a threat to livestock.[90]  San Andreas Fault Line: An Unstoppable Geyser of Mud[91] An unstoppable geyser of mud is continuously pouring from the San Andreas fault line and slowly creeping across California. The troublesome mud in California's Imperial County has caused local authorities to declare it an emergency earlier this year. It's called the Niland Geyser, according to Science Alert, and it's exactly that, a geyser of bubbling mud. But there's a strange twist \u2014 this menacing puddle has been slowly creeping across the ground, to the point where it's now threatening railroad tracks and a state highway. The Niland Geyser had first appeared in California in 1953 but it sat around without incident for decades. Then, around 11 years ago, things began to change. The geyser started moving across the dry ground at a glacial pace. But now, suddenly, things are starting to get serious where the mud geyser is concerned. In the last six months, the geyser's pace has picked up considerably. In just a few months, the Niland Geyser's mud has traveled 18.3 meters (60 feet). It traveled another 18 meters in a single day \u2014 bringing it ever closer to Union Pacific's railway tracks, State Route 111, a petroleum pipeline, and some fiber-optic telecommunications lines. The mud has so far traveled roughly 73 meters (240 feet) from where it all began a decade ago. The Los Angeles Times called the mysterious mud geyser a 'slow-moving disaster.' However, U.S. Geological Survey geophysicist Ken Hudnut, who visited the moving spring in July, has said there's no evidence that this is a sign that the 'Big One' is approaching. 'It's a slow-moving disaster,' said Alfredo Estrada, Imperial County's fire chief, and emergency services coordinator. But not because it could cause a massive quake.[92]  Scientists Say Mysterious 'Oumuamua' Objet Could be an Alien Spacecraft[93] Maybe it's an alien spacecraft. Scientists have been puzzling over Oumuamua ever since the mysterious space object was observed tumbling past the sun in late 2017. Given its high speed and its unusual trajectory, the reddish, stadium-sized whatever-it-is had clearly come from outside our solar system. But its flattened, elongated shape and the way it accelerated on its way through the solar system set it apart from conventional asteroids and comets. Now a pair of Harvard researchers are raising the possibility that Oumuamua is an alien spacecraft. As they say in a paper to be published Nov. 12 in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, the object 'may be a fully operational probe sent intentionally to Earth vicinity by an alien civilization.'[94]  'Sociopath' 15-Year-Old is Held Without Bail After He Took 30 Minutes and Two Attempts to Strangle His Architect Mother to Death as She Fought for Her Life in a Row Over His D Grade[95] A 15-year-old 'sociopath' who spent half an hour throttling his mother to death with his bare hands as she fought for her life after a row over bad grades appeared in court on Sunday where he was denied bail and remanded in custody. Gregory Logan Ramos murdered mother Gail Cleavenger, 46, in her own bed at their family home in Florida shortly after midnight on Friday last week. He then enlisted two of his friends to help him stage a burglary in his home and called 911 to report his mother missing. Gregory was arrested after confessing to killing his mother it during police questioning. Volusia County Sheriff Mike Chitwood described the schoolboy as 'soulless', said he showed no remorse, and is 'among the top three sociopaths I have ever encountered'. In his police confession, Ramos told how he had argued with his mother on Thursday evening after getting a D grade at school. Prosecutors are now weighing up whether or not to charge Ramos as an adult.[96]  The Dems Are Mad as Hell[97] It's not a surprise we see this consistent reaction of rage and hatred coming from the Democratic Party leadership, or the leftist mainstream media. The entire group of them does hate Trump, and their pogrom to destroy him has been ramping up into our discourse since Trump declared his candidacy. I think most of us know that they hate us, as well. My take is simple. This has been a coordinated effort on the left to take Trump out. Destroy him, and his family. Sadly, it has taken over the left. Its main success has been keeping most on the center-left filled with 24/7 hate. I originally thought they would eventually have to pull back from this effort. I couldn't imagine that they would still be developing and making up new reasons to hate Trump several times a week for two years. Unfortunately, the left did it. And they did it with relish, with gusto, and with blinders on. The media, bless their hearts, stoked the flames. Their staggering hatred, their staggering bias is there for all to see. Most recently, look at the week of outrage about Trump calling himself a nationalist. Then look at the reporting about the Synagogue murders. They actually blamed Trump for that. Why not? They blamed him for everything else. The problem is, this heinous act was done by a man who hated Jews, hating Trump because of his alliance with Israel and support of the Jewish people. Wrap your mind around that. The media used this anti-Trumper as an example of Trump's anti-Semitism. That's how crazy they are. A man who has a Jewish son-in-law, daughter and grandchildren. One who has been supportive of Jews for a long time. No lie is too big, no slander is too big to keep the climate of hatred going. They need their 'experts' to slam Trump, truth be damned. IT'S Despicable.[98]  Trump Admin Eyes Big Tech Antitrust Violations[99] Including commerce giant Amazon President Donald Trump said his administration is looking into antitrust violations by Amazon, Facebook and Google parent Alphabet. In a video interview with Axios' Jonathan Swan and Jim VandeHei that aired on Sunday, Trump said he's 'not looking to hurt' the U.S. tech giants but is considering action. 'We are looking at [antitrust] very seriously,' Trump said. 'Look, that doesn't mean we're doing it, but we're certainly looking and I think most people surmise that, I would imagine.'[100]  U.S. Officially the World's Largest Crude Oil Producer[101] In an interview with CNNMoney in June, Pioneer Natural Resources Chairman Scott Sheffield said he expected U.S. crude oil production to surpass 11 million barrels a day by this fall, making the United States the world's top oil producer. Right on schedule the Energy Information Administration announced on Thursday that the U.S. oil industry produced 11.3 million barrels of crude oil a day during August, an increase of 416,000 barrels from the previous month and topping production from Saudi Arabia and Russia. That level of crude oil production is more than 2 million barrels a day ahead of August 2017, the largest increase over any 12-month period in U.S. history.[102]  University Lecturer Caught Stealing GOP Yard Signs in New York[103] A lecturer at the State University of New York at New Paltz was caught on video stealing Republican yard signs in New York.

John Faso (R., N.Y.) for Congress and Marc Molinaro, the GOP gubernatorial candidate in New York. Video shows Ebert pulling up to a woman's front yard, getting out, and putting the political signs in her pickup truck.[104]  Want a Communist USA? Vote Democrat on Tuesday[105] (Daily Headlines) Today's Democrat is not really a Democrat. As far back as the 1930s, the Soviet Union targeted the Democrat Party for infiltration. They were wildly successful during that time, especially in planting Soviet agents throughout the FDR administration. Those Soviet agents helped direct our war effort to save the USSR from the Nazis, wrote the founding document that formed the UN, created the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, and saw to it that Mao's Communists would take over China. It only got better. Immediately following our victory in WW II, Soviet agents working in the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the precursor to the CIA, saw to it that the American military was directed to Communist and pro-Communist Germans in the reconstruction of Germany, while anti-Communist Germans were discredited. They also sought to ensure only pro-Mao OSS agents advanced in the Chinese theater of operations. In the critical time before Mao's Communists defeated Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists, Soviet agents in the Truman administration successfully prevented critical support from reaching Chiang. Senator Joseph McCarthy, who correctly identified Communists working in the U.S. government, was successfully discredited by a vigorous, Communist inspired campaign, aided by McCarthy's political and bureaucratic opponents.[106]  Woman Cons Generous Trump Supporters Out of $150,000, Is Hailed as a Social Justice Hero[107] Thief 'owns the racists' by proving Trump supporters aren't racist A black woman conned generous Trump supporters out of $150,000 to 'own the racists' and was hailed as a social justice hero, despite inadvertently proving that Trump supporters are not racist. The woman, who changed her name to 'reformed republican' on Twitter, tweeted, 'I will not hide any longer,, the left has made us feel as if us black republicans should hide!! but not anymore!! #BlacksForTrump #WalkAway #maga.' She then amped up the scam by claiming her parents had disowned her for supporting Trump before posting a GoFundMe link for people to donate. After conning Trump supporters out of around $150,000, she justified it by asserting, 'stealing from republicans isn't bad because republicans arent ppl.' The woman's goal was apparently not just to make money, but to highlight the racism of Trump supporters (the same ones who'd just generously donated $150,000 to an African-American woman). 'Trump is a racist, homophobic, transphobic, bigot AND YOU THINK MY BLACK ASS WOULD SUPPORT THAT ROTTING CARROT?? ridiculous,' she tweeted. Numerous left-wing websites subsequently celebrated the scam, with Pink News noting how the woman was 'praised' as a 'hero' for the stunt. In reality, all she proved was that Trump supporters are generous towards black people (ie not racist) and she is a liar and thief who has most likely committed a criminal offense.[108]  Boris: May's 'Stinker' Brexit Deal Will Leave Brits as 'Non-Voting Members of the EU'[109] Boris Johnson has weighed in on Theresa May's reportedly imminent Brexit deal with the European Union, which is expected to keep the United Kingdom inside the bloc's Customs Union.

Gianni Arcudi, director of Pathology at Rome's Tor Vergata University, said examination of the bones would start Monday afternoon. 'At first sight they do not seem too degraded, even though they were buried in a damp patch of earth, but we'll only know for certain once we have cleaned the bones'. The sex of the bones will be revealed early this week, perhaps as early as Monday, sources have said. The date of death and possible DNA identification will take several more days after that, they said. A molar has been examined and is probably a wisdom tooth, sources said. A breakthrough in the case of Emanuela Orlandi, the daughter of a Vatican employee, may have arrived after the Vatican said the human bones were found in a basement area linked to its nunciature to Italy in Rome's Via Po next to the Italian capital's famous Villa Borghese museum. The Vatican said it had called in the Italian authorities after the remains were found during renovation work. Another possibility is that the bones belong to Mirella Gregori, another 15-year-old girl who went missing in Rome in 1983, within weeks of Orlandi. Rome prosecutors have opened a murder probe. Investigators are comparing the cranium and teeth with the DNA of Orlandi and Gregori. It will take 'from seven to 10 days' to examine the DNA, sources told ANSA. A preliminary examination of pelvic bones found at the nunciature has confirmed that they belong to a woman's body, ANSA sources said. Four workers discovered the bones, judicial sources said Wednesday. They reportedly told prosecutors 'we were digging, we had removed the pavement, then we saw the bones and we immediately raised the alarm', judicial sources said. Emanuela Orlandi's brother Pietro said 'the news should fill us with joy but if the bones turned out to be Emanuela's it's as if she died today'. He said 'if this is the truth it's important for it to come out. I want to know why Emanuela was in that place and who brought her there'. A lawyer representing Orland's family demanded more details after the discovery of the remains in the nunciature. 'We will ask the Rome prosecutors' office and the Holy See how the bones were found and why the find has been related to the disappearance of Emanuela Orlandi and Mirella Gregori,' said the lawyer, Laura Sgr\u00f2. 'The statement released yesterday by the Holy See does not provide much information,' Sgr\u00f2 said. The bones may well belong to two people, well-informed sources said later Wednesday. The sources said that workers employed in renovation work at the site found nearly a whole skeleton and, in another point, bone fragments. Manuela Orlandi's father Pietro met with prosecutors later, Sgr\u00f2 said. 'There is a preliminary investigation in course and we hope to have more detailed information in the next few days,' the lawyer said. Gregori's sister Maria Antonietta told ANSA: 'I don't want to delude myself, I want to stay with my feet on the ground but in my heart I hope that those bones belong to Mirella, so we can put an end to this affair and I would have a place to go to mourn and take a flower to my sister'. She said 'the investigators have our DNA, they took it when some bones were found in the basilica of Sant'Apollinare (Saint Apollinaire)'. The Orlandi case has spawned several theories over the years, including that she was murdered to gain traction to have pope John Paul II's Turkish shooter Mehmet Ali Agca freed, or that organised crime was involved. Ali Agca was questioned in the case. In 2016 investigations into the case were shelved. Six people including a priest were implicated in the investigations on suspicion of complicity in abduction and murder. All but one had links with the Banda della Magliana, a now-defunct crime gang based in Rome. In September last year the Vatican described as 'false and ridiculous' reports that the Vatican had spend large amounts of money on the case. In an article published by La Repubblica, Italian investigative reporter Emiliano Fittipaldi wrote about a leaked document that allegedly showed the Vatican spent over 483 million lira, around 250,000 euros, on the case between 1983 and 1997. In the piece, Fittipaldi reported money went to a pensioner in London and medical expenses in the British capital. Fittipaldi has written books in the past with revelations linked to the two VatiLeaks scandals featuring embarrassing leaks of confidential documents. In 2016 Italian film director Roberto Faenza said his latest movie 'The Truth is in the Sky' was aimed at encouraging authorities to reopen the Orlandi case. The film, inspired by Vito Bruschini's 'The Truth on the Orlandi Case' book, tells the story of an English TV station which sends a journalist to Rome to investigate the origins of the Mafia Capitale scandal involving city authorities' links to criminal organisations. 'The Truth is in the Sky' is a phrase that Pope Francis said when he met Orlandi's family in the Vatican, Faenza said, adding that in fact he believes the truth is on earth and his film is aimed at encouraging investigators to keep pursuing it.[118]  Italy: 12 Storm Deaths in Sicily With Illegal Building Blamed[119] Orange alert Monday in Veneto, Piedmont, Emilia Romagna, Lazio (ANSA) \u2014 Palermo, November 12 \u2014 Thunderstorms caused 12 more storm deaths in Sicily at the weekend bringing to 32 the Italy death toll since the extreme weather started battering the country 10 days ago. Nine people from two families including two small children died in a deluge of water and mud when a river broke its banks at Casteldaccia in Sicily, local sources said. They were living in a building that had been built illegally, the sources said. Another three people were killed across the southern Italian island at the weekend. There is an orange weather alert Monday in Veneto, Piedmont, Emilia Romagna and Lazio. Premier Giuseppe Conte announced one billion euros in funding to fix 'hydrogeological instability' across the length and breadth of Italy. Interior Minister and League leader Matteo Salvini asked for 40 billion. Meanwhile the centre-left Democratic Party blamed many of the deaths on amnesties on illegal buildings over the years, some of them voted for by the League. Salvini retorted that 'salon environmentalism' was to blame, preventing trees from being cut down and water courses altered to stave off risk. On Monday Premier Conte said before leaving for Algiers: 'I will speak with the Algerian prime minister about Sicily, where I went yesterday after the violent wave of bad weather, which caused many, too many deaths'. It was also announced that the nine killed at Casteldaccia will be buried in Palermo Cathedral on Tuesday. Meanwhile the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) of Palermo said the villa that housed the victims should have been demolished. Economy Undersecretary Massimo Garavaglia said funds to remedy hydrogeological instability would be included in the 2019 budget bill. Environment Minister Sergio Costa said 'we need a fast norm to demolish illegal and dangerous buildings.' 'A special group will study the problem,' he said. 'Illegal building has a very old history in Italy,' he said. Costa also said the government's ministers were working hard to try to allocate EU funds to tackle the emergency. Far north in Veneto, over one billion euros of damage has been done and whole forests have been flattened by high winds. Veneto Governor Luca Zaia has asked for a state of calamity to be declared, as has Liguria Governor Giovanni Toti on the other side of Italy. The European Commission is in close contact with Italy's civil defence department over the deadly storms that have hit Italy killing over 30 people, EC Spokesperson Margaritis Schinas said Monday. 'Our thoughts go out to our Italian friends after the heavy rains and flooding, we voice our condolences to the victims' families,' he said after the latest 12 deaths in Sicily. 'We hail the tireless work of the rescue teams, our emergency response coordination centre is in close and permanent contact with the Italian civil protection department and is watching over the situation'. European Aid Commissioner Christos Stylianides will meet Civil Protection Director-General Agostino Miozzo on Monday to discuss Italy's storm deaths and damage and 'determine the next steps', Schinas said. Schinas said the Copernicus satellite system had been activated at Italy's request to map the areas hit by the storms, in Sicily and Veneto.[120]  Italy: Ferrari Deliveries 10.6% Up, Adjusted Ebitda Up 4.7% Q3[121] 'Towards another great year' (ANSA) \u2014 Turin, November 5 \u2014 Ferrari ended the third quarter 'with results in line with 2018 targets, towards another great year,' the carmaker said Monday.

They treat such a man as if he were a criminal. We know about their reluctance to investigate burglaries, not surprising when this crime is now out of control.  When New Labour came into power in 1997, MI5's huge files on Left-wing subversion were destroyed, a decision which greatly suited the many covert ex-Marxists in the Blair hierarchy. This was quickly followed by a politically correct inquisition which transformed the Security Service into a nest of fashionable liberalism. It was supposed to concentrate on way-out Islamists. But now we learn that it is to 'take the lead in combating Right-wing terrorism'.

On one occasion, she said she told Irfan Ahmed (also known as 'Finny', pictured above, left) on the telephone: 'I've reported you to the police for child sexual exploitation.' To which, she said Ahmed replied: 'Bring it on, they won't touch me, they don't like us P***s.' 'I would speak to them and then they'd threaten me,' she explained, and went on to describe how pleas to the police were ignored. 'We were passing all this information on and all they would say is 'we're building up intelligence' and this went on for years,' she said, and added that 'I believe that we were told that they weren't going to do anything about it.'[144]  UK: Parliament Square, Whitehall Locked Down by London Police Following 'Suspicious Package' Alert[145] The Parliament Square and Whitehall \u2014 the streets at the heart of British government were shut down by London police Monday evening due to an 'incident' surrounding a suspicious package.

The Christian mother of five from Pakistan was forced to spend eight years in prison, much of the time on death row, ostensibly for 'blasphemy,' before the Supreme Court cleared her of any offense. 'I can't believe what I am hearing, will I go out now? Will they let me out, really?', Asia Bibi said by phone after the historic sentence, according to AFP news agency.

Many of these people were influenced by regimes in which anti-Semitism is part of the rationale of the state and the Jewish state is denied the right to existence,' Mr. Lehrer said. He believes that once new immigrants are settled in their jobs and housing, Islamic anti-Semitism will have a greater bearing and people will express their opinions openly against Germany's Jewish population.

Yet should Trump issue an executive order and lose in the Supreme Court, the controversy could raise public consciousness and force Congress to enact legislation to clarify what the 14th Amendment precisely means. Only Canada and the United States, among advanced nations, have birthright citizenship. No European country does. And the Conservative Party in Canada is moving to end it. Does it make sense to grant all the honor, privileges and rights of lifetime U.S. citizenship to anyone who can fly to the U.S. or evade the Border Patrol and have a baby? Nor is this a small matter. The Pew Hispanic Center estimates that 6 percent of U.S. births (250,000 per year) are to undocumented immigrants. Yet that 250,000 is a drop in the bucket compared to the total number of immigrants now coming. In 2016, President Obama's last full year, 1.75 million legal and illegal immigrants arrived, a record.[183]  Media-Approved Election Meddling: 'Immigrants Who Can't Vote Work to Influence Midterm Elections'[184] This is blatant election meddling on behalf of foreign powers seeking to open our borders Foreigners meddling in our elections is A-OK as long as they're working for Democrats! \u2014 From the Miami Herald, 'These immigrants can't vote. So they're working hard to influence those who can':[185]  Report: 20,000 Migrants 'Almost All Armed With Knives' To Cross Europe's External Border[186] A breakthrough of more than 20,000 migrants preparing to cross the Bosnia-Croatia border and on to European Union (EU) nations is imminent, according to Austrian intelligence, which warns many are 'armed'. Migrant attempts to break into the EU have grown increasingly bold and forceful, with police and illegal immigrants injured in several clashes since the middle of October, when hundreds began camping at the border \u2014 reportedly after having been given misinformation that Croatia was set to open its frontiers. According to Italian news agency ANSA, local media reports the groups send numbers of young people and children towards the police line to chant 'open border, open border', while clashes see mobs of young men charge at police, and throw stones and other projectiles.[187]  Socialist Dream Gone Wrong: Sweden Sees Problematic Unemployment Levels Among Migrants[188] Sweden's goal to reach the lowest unemployment rate in Europe is becoming more and more unrealistic. In the EU's unemployment ranking the country has fallen from 12th place 18th place in four years. This is a trend that is the opposite of the government's goal to reach the EU's lowest unemployment rate by 2020.[189]  Spain Says 13 Migrants Killed, 80 Rescued at Sea[190] MADRID, Nov 6 \u2014 Thirteen sub-Saharan African migrants died and another 80 were rescued at sea after they tried to reach Spain in two boats from the North African coast, Spanish authorities said yesterday.[191]  UK: Furious Parents Remove Children From School Over Claims 'Intimidating' 30-Year-Old Asylum Seeker 'Father-of-Two' Was Posing as 15-Year-Old Pupil Due to Take His Mock Maths GCSE Today[192] A growing number of angry parents are withdrawing their children from a school over claims that one of its pupils is really a man aged up to 30 years old. Parents are said to be furious that they have had no undertaking to confirm that the 6ft 1in tall pupil will not be returning to Stoke High School in Ipswich, Suffolk. The Year 11 pupil who claims to be aged 15 but looks far older had been due to take his mock GCSE maths exam today, but he has not been seen at the school since Thursday morning. The school which is run by the Ormiston Academies Trust wrote to parents about the boy for the first time today to confirm that the Home Office was investigating his status. The pupil who is believed to be Iranian is thought to have arrived in the UK via Germany as an asylum seeker and told immigration authorities that he was aged 15. But his classmates quickly became suspicious that he was much older and found his apparent Facebook page showing old pictures of him with a full beard, a hairy chest and swigging a beer.[193]  Facebook Apologizes, Then Deletes More 'Graphic' Pro-Life Ads[194] Even though 56 percent of America is pro-life, Facebook still deems pro-life ads as unacceptable for its platform. The pro-life Susan B. Anthony List has had ads deleted from its Facebook page a total of six times, according to the Daily Caller. On November 1, Facebook apologized for deleting one ad, saying that it was a 'mistake,' but then turned around and deleted another ad running in Montana.[195]  Gay Sauna Under Fire for Booting Transgender[196] A gay sauna has found itself in an equality row after asking a transgender man without a penis to leave their nude bath house. Staff at Sailors Sauna, in east London, told a male patron, who is female by birth, that he could not use their facilities because they did not want to breach their licence, which categorized the hot house as a ' male space.' The 26-year-old, whose identity is unknown, attempted to use the sauna with a friend on Monday night before another customer informed staff that 'a woman was using the venue'.[197]  In France, Spate of Homophobic Attacks on Record is Just 'The Tip of the Iceberg'[198] An increasing number of victims of anti-LGBT violence in France have spoken out over recent weeks, as rights groups have warned of a spike in attacks and the government has confirmed a 15 percent increase since the start of 2018. In a photo taken two days after his assault in France's northern cathedral city of Rouen on October 24, Romain* still bears the marks of the attack. He was ambushed while leaving a nightclub and forced into the back of a car, where 'they hit me in the face, all over the body, everywhere \u2014 at one point, my head hit the rear window like a bullet [] I thought I was going to die', this 30-year-old gay man told the site Gayviking.[199]  Male Teacher Disciplined for Refusing to Watch Teen Girl Shower[200] A male middle-school teacher in Florida is being punished for refusing to watch a female student shower naked after physical-education class, sparking an outcry among parents and advocates for sanity everywhere. The outrageous controversy has also garnered the attention of Liberty Counsel, a Christian public-interest legal organization that is fighting to protect the teacher and the boys who wish to shower and get dressed without a girl present. According to a report by WND, the scandal at Chasco Middle School in Land O' Lakes, Florida, surrounds an 'unwritten' transgender policy. Basically, under the scheme, boys who claim to be girls, and girls who claim to be boys, must be allowed to use the bathroom and locker room of their choice. The school's two P.E. teachers objected, but were ordered to keep silent. In fact, they were even prohibited from warning the children so they could take cover, with the school claiming that would be 'discriminatory.' When the girl walked in unannounced and caught the boys literally with their pants down, the male students suffered embarrassment and mental anguish. Some of the boys rushed to find the teachers so the adults in the room could sort out the situation. Unfortunately, though, the teachers had been gagged by school administrators, and so they could not even answer questions about what was going on, according to Liberty Counsel. As a result of the male teacher's refusal to go in the locker room while a girl was naked, he was accused by school officials of not doing his supposed 'job,' which includes periodically walking through the locker rooms and showers to check on the boys. He said he could not and would not knowingly place himself in a position where he would 'observe a minor female in the nude or otherwise in a state of undress.' And so, he was told by school administrators that he would be transferred to another school as a disciplinary measure.[201]  Queer Group 'GAG' Claims Victory as FedEx Ends NRA Discount Program[202] Since its inception, Gays Against Guns \u2014 which counts several alumni of storied AIDS activist group ACT UP! among its members \u2014 set its sights on a big target: the National Rifle Association. The group even coined a campy catchphrase for the mission: 'NRA, Sashay Away!' GAG's long-term strategy to take down the NRA started with a decision to 'follow the money,' in particular, the gun lobby's corporate partners, like Wyndham, Hertz and FedEx.[203] [ 1]: <url

Yesterday, WSJ broke a story about a deal between Alphabet and Ascension Health System, a Catholic non-profit that operates hospitals and nursing homes in 21 states and Washington DC. Ascension has more than 2,600 facilities, but its data \u2014 including critical patient data \u2014 is presently spread across 40 data centers in more than a dozen states. But thanks to a deal between the two organizations that spawned Google's 'Project Nightingale', all of that data are being moved into Google's cloud, and Google engineers are working on a system that they say could revolutionize how doctors use patient health data to make diagnoses. The only problem, is some regulators have expressed concerns that the patient data aren't being properly protected, or that Google might illegally use the data to hone its ad micro-targeting. The sensitive health data of millions of Americans would be quite a score. And there's reason to be suspicious: Without notifying patients or doctors, Ascension recently started sharing personally identifiable information on millions of patients with Google. The data include: patients' names and dates of birth; lab tests; doctor diagnoses; medication and hospitalization history; and some billing claims and other clinical records. Now, the Office for Civil Rights in the Department of Health and Human Services is investigating the arrangement to see if 'this mass collection of individuals' medical records to ensure that HIPAA protections were fully implemented.'[51]  Google Fires an Employee for Leaking Documents to the Media and Puts 2 Others on Leave (Goog, Googl)[52] Google has fired one employee and put another two on leave, a Google representative told Business Insider, confirming a Bloomberg report on Tuesdaythat detailed tensions at the company.

But for his latest discovery, he didn't need to go any farther than his own backyard. In August 2018, just after dark, Longino caught a glimpse of four ants in his garden that really looked out of place. The next day he dug deeper and found more specimens. They reminded him of species he knew from the tropics or from the deciduous forests of the eastern U.S. But the surprises didn't stop there. Longino originally thought the ants had been introduced to the area, possibly through the commercial potting soil, and would be some known species from elsewhere. But a close look in the lab revealed that it was a distinct new species, almost certainly native to the region, with similarities to related species in Arizona. Longino surmised that the ant, which likes warm, moist habitats, has been living underground in Utah's typically dry climate. More than 150 years of irrigation and introduced forest, however, may have given the ant courage to once again come to the surface. For that reason, he named the new ant Strumigenys ananeotes (Stroom-i-jen-knees ana-knee-oat-tees). The species name ananeotes means 'newly emerged.'[57]  Judge Alexandra Smoots-Thomas Suspended Following Federal Indictment[58] A Harris County District Court judge has been suspended following a federal indictment unsealed last week.

The authors examined Democrat-to-Republican (D\u2014R) ratios across five disciplines, including journalism, at 40 leading universities, including some of the most prestigious institutions in the country. Although unlikely to produce an 'a-ha!' moment, their findings still have the capacity to shock. For instance, Democrats outnumber Republicans across the board by a ratio of 11.5-to-1, leading the authors to remark that 'in most humanities/social-science fields a Republican is a rare bird.' Furthermore, 'in 42 percent of the departments, Republican registrants were as scarce as or scarcer than left minor-party registrants.' Which is to say that for most departments, a Republican has the status of a museum piece.  Thus, when Jim Acosta is relieved of his White House press credentials for habitual boorishness, along with the practice of asking questions that follow the 'have you stopped beating your wife' template; when April Ryan shouts the question, 'Are you a racist?' to the president; and when both are unapologetically defended by their media colleagues, one may safely assume America's Ministry of Truth is functioning in ways not entirely unexpected by its commissars. And as a reminder, there's that pesky 92 percent negative reporting thing going on. This suggests that even the term 'group-think' fails to describe the process; 'lock-step' does more heavy lifting, more fully conveys Minitrue's approach\u2014especially when it comes to deciding what is news and how it should be reported. This is the next topic in our review of America's Ministry of Truth.[66]  America's 'Ministry of Truth, ' Part III: What is News?[67] [] Hanson argues that the real problem conservatives face has little to do with trying to scoop up this or that part of the electorate before 2020. For those terrified by progressive statism, the situation is much worse than that: 'Conservatives have lost entirely the culture and establishment wars,' Hanson states. 'The result is that they are besieged by a circle of hostile progressive, but quite establishment institutions that are relentless.' How relentless? From the continuous avalanche of progressive propaganda that floods airwaves and print media every day, often smothering scattered islands of independent thought, only a few examples will be selected: one from a few years ago and another dealing with the horrific mass murder that took place in Pittsburgh in October 2018.  In Attkisson's fascinating treatment of her time with CBS, superbly entitled, 'Stonewalled: My Fight for Truth Against the Forces of Obstruction, Intimidation, and Harassment in Obama's Washington,' she stated: 'When left-wingers praised my work, it didn't seem to ruffle any feathers among my colleagues at CBS. But when conservatives expressed support for my stories, some insiders viewed me as the enemy. She's not one of us. Or else she wouldn't be pursuing stories like that. 'So, the theory apparently goes something like this: I was a fair reporter when I examined the Bush-era controversies. But when I started digging into Obama administration problems, I was suddenly a fanatic bent on destroying the president and all good things liberal.'  And woe to those who believe otherwise, who stray from The Narrative to see with eyes unjaundiced by The Narrative's constraints\u2014just ask Attkisson and the many others, especially public figures not as favorably situated or sufficiently savvy to grasp how America's Ministry of Truth operates. The consequences for Minitrue apostasy will be covered in our next treatment: crime and punishment.

First, the Democrats will do anything to win an election, legal or not, and not care how open they are about it. And second, they will do anything to undo the 2016 presidential election. I remember very well when Hillary Clinton stated that if a person didn't accept the results of an election in America that it would be 'direct threat to our democracy' if he didn't accept the results of the 2016 election. The reason she said that was because she was assured that she would win. George Soros even said that Trump may win the popular vote, but Clinton would win the Electoral College. It was 'a done deal'. If it was a 'done deal', then the election had to be rigged. But that is just how bad of a candidate Hillary was, she couldn't even win an election that was massively rigged in her favor. Let me quote our Founders on the type of person that we need to have in office. Thomas Jefferson stated, 'The great principles of right and wrong are legible to every reader; to pursue them requires not the aid of many counselors. The whole art of government consists in the art of being honest. Only aim to do your duty, and mankind will give you credit where you fail.' You see that he brings up a point that the Democrats are not capable of achieving, honesty. Jefferson was very big on government that kept to its constitutional role. He didn't like the judiciary very much because he saw that they could, and probably would, become an oligarchy that would become more powerful that the other two branches combined. They have achieved that objective. When Justice Sotomayor was going through the conformation process a video of her, which has somehow disappeared from the internet, claiming that even though they are not supposed to make law, they do it all the time. She did say this in a 2005 Duke University panel discussion; 'All of the legal defense funds out there, they're looking for people with Court of Appeals experience. Because it is \u2014 Court of Appeals is where policy is made. And I know, and I know, that this is on tape, and I should never say that. Because we don't 'make law,' I know. [Laughter from audience] Okay, I know. I know. I'm not promoting it, and I'm not advocating it. I'm, you know. [More laughter] Having said that, the Court of Appeals is where, before the Supreme Court makes the final decision, the law is percolating. Its interpretation, its application. Jefferson warned on wanton interpretation of our Constitution by jurists who hold strong party ideals. 'Our peculiar security is in possession of a written Constitution. Let us not make it a blank paper by construction. If it is, then we have no Constitution. [T]o consider the judges as the ultimate arbiters of all constitutional questions would place us under the despotism of an oligarchy. In questions of power, then, let no more be heard of confidence in man, but bind him down from mischief by the chains of the Constitution.'[70]  Exclusive: Trump Set to Indict Hillary Clinton ...her Deep Staters in Coming Months[71] The desperate Swamp is aware that their end is near and is trying to discredit AG Whitaker. President Trump is keen on indicting Hillary Clinton, as he promised he would do during his presidential campaign. Alex Jones breaks down how the Deep State is hell-bent on preventing Trump from restoring law and order in the Justice Department.[72]  Canada Francophones Gear Up for Fight Over Education, Rights[73] OTTAWA (AFP) \u2014 A French-language university cancelled by Ontario's government this month has kindled the passions of Canada's francophone minority, who are set to replay their historical rights struggle. In addition to nixing the proposed university that was to open in Toronto in 2020, the province with the largest francophone minority in the country \u2014 outside of Quebec \u2014 also cut funding for francophone theater troupes. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, the brother of Toronto's late crack-smoking mayor, responded to a barrage of criticism, saying the move 'has nothing to do with personal (grudges or other) against any Franco-Ontarians.' [74]  Canada Prime Minister Justin Trudeau Buying the Media in Time for 2019 Election[75] As he eyes his reelection, Justin Trudeau, who plays for keeps, is coming on like a Banana Republic dictator. Buying the media is buying the Election. This is what Trudeau was doing before blowing more than half a billion dollars for the domestic media: It was only weeks ago when dictatorial Trudeau publicly defended a decision by Statistics Canada to compel banks and financial institutions to release the personal transaction data of 500,000 people without their consent. 'Conservative House Leader Candice Bergen grilled Trudeau during question period Monday following a report by Global News that revealed Statistics Canada is asking the country's nine largest banks for the transaction data of 500,000 randomly chosen Canadians, including everything from bill payments to cash withdrawals from ATMs to credit card payments and even account balances.[76]  Canadian Companies Warned About Espionage if They Use Technology From Foreign State-Owned Firms[77] Canadian companies should watch out when they use technology supplied by state-owned companies from countries that want to steal corporate secrets, the country's security agencies have warned them. The RCMP organized two workshops last March \u2014 one in Calgary, the other in Toronto \u2014 to raise awareness about threats to critical systems, including espionage and foreign interference, cyberattacks, terrorism and sabotage, newly disclosed documents show.[78]  A Sharia Victory in the Netherlands[79] The Islamist mob is training many societies, and most particularly non-Muslims within them, to behave the way it wants them to behave. This November was meant to be the month for MP Geert Wilders' second 'Draw Muhammad' contest, but Islamic law won a de facto victory over Dutch law mere weeks ago as Wilders announced the contest's cancellation. When \u2014 among many other threats similar attacks \u2014 a 19-year-old Afghan stabbed two American tourists in Amsterdam, citing the planned contest as motive, Wilders canceled the event out of concern about further violence. The Islamists had made their point: 'Having the law on your side makes no difference. Do what we want, or somebody is going to get hurt.' Such antics by Islamist Muslims are not new to Wilders and other speech and conscience advocates. In retribution for his firm and outspoken stance on this subject, he has 'spent 15 years living in safe houses and escorted by a security detail due to constant death threats.' These are the tactics, of course, of any common mafia. In securing Wilders' retreat, the terrorists established Sharia's authority for now in the Netherlands on the issue of speech.[80]  Brexit Deal Critics Gather in Belfast on Eve of EU Summit[81] BELFAST (AFP) \u2014 Opposition to a draft Brexit deal due to be approved by EU leaders will dominate a conference on Saturday of the Democratic Unionist Party, the Northern Irish party whose support is vital to Prime Minister Theresa May's government and Brexit plans. Britain's former foreign minister Boris Johnson, a staunch critic of the deal, will be attending \u2014 along with Fabian Picardo, Chief Minister of Gibraltar, which is at the heart of a row that could also undermine Sunday's EU summit. The DUP has propped up Prime Minister Theresa May's government ever since an election in 2017 in which her Conservatives lost their majority and were forced to turn to the right-wingers for help. [82]  Eight in Ten French Support 'Yellow Jacket' Protesters to Shut Down Paris[83] A new poll has shown a surge of support for the 'gilets jaunes' or Yellow Vest protestors, who vowed to shut down the French capital on Saturday to protest higher fuel taxes and the government of President Emmanuel Macron. The poll, conducted by polling firm Odoxa, found that 77 percent, or eight in ten, French surveyed thought the proposed shutting down of the French capital by the protestors was a legitimate action Le Figaro reports.[84]  EU WarnsItaly: Change Budget or Face the Consequences[85] European Parliament President Antonio Tajani has warned Italy that its citizens will 'suffer' the price of a 'bad budget' unless its government makes significant changes to its plans. 'We'll see if Italy wants to change the budget,' said Tajani, 'it is a matter of substance.' 'Changing manners is good, but the content is more important.[86]  Fishermen Betrayed: Macron Gloats UK Will be Forced Into 'Backstop' Unless British Waters Are Surrendered[87] EU leaders have wasted little time in gloating over 'the worst deal in history' negotiated by Theresa May, with French president Emmanuel Macron gloating he can blackmail Britain into surrendering its fishing waters or force it into the humiliating 'backstop'.[88]  France: What Riots? ABC Ignores Paris Burning Amid Protests Against Gas Tax Hike[89] As Americans begun celebrating the holiday season, almost 300,000 French people took to the streets to protest a massive fuel tax hike proposed by President Emmanuel Macron to fight climate change. The protests turned violent Saturday as the now-rioters began digging up the streets of Paris and trying to construct barricades as police fought back with tear gas and water cannons. Despite this ongoing battle, ABC News had not reported one word about it on air. Not even on Saturday's World News Tonight.[90]  France: Le Pen Denies Inciting Yellow Vest Violence on Champs Elyses[91] France's Far-right leader Marine Le Pen says she had 'never called for any violence', after clashes in Paris between police and Yellow Vest protesters, as she ridiculed Interior Minister Christophe Castaner's accusation that she had called them onto the Champs-Elyses.[92]  French Tax Rebels to Try to Block Paris in Fight With Macron[93] PARIS (AFP) \u2014 Demonstrators who have blocked French roads over the past week dressed in high-visibility jackets, are set to cause another day of disruption on Saturday amid calls to bring Paris to a standstill. Security forces are on high alert again, but face difficulties in predicting where crowds will gather to support what is still a largely spontaneous movement led by angry voters in rural and small-town France. Nearly 300,000 people blocked motorways, roundabouts, businesses, and fuel depots last Saturday and smaller protests have continued this week, with an estimated 5,000 people still taking part on Friday. [94]  French Farmer Stabbed by Man on Terror Watchlist Protests Attack Not Labelled Terrorism[95] A French farmer who was attacked by a knife-wielding man yelling 'Allahu Ackbar' has complained that the prosecution in the case has not treated the crime as terrorism despite the attacker also being on France's terror watch list.[96]  German Robot Maker Kuka's CEO to be Replaced by Chinese Owners[97] Nearly two years after a hostile Chinese takeover, Kuka's Chief Executive Till Reuter is to be replaced. The industrial robot maker recently revised down its 2018 revenue prediction and its share price has plummeted. German industrial robot maker Kuka on Saturday said it was planning to replace its CEO Till Reuter. In a statement, the DAX listed company said the head of the supervisory board and Reuter 'are discussing the premature termination of Mr. Reuter's Executive Board activities.' It said the supervisory board had not yet discussed the changes. No further details were given. Reuter's departure comes nearly two years after Kuka was the subject of a hostile takeoverby China's largest home appliances manufacturer Midea, which now holds almost 95 percent of the German firm's shares. [98]  Hungary: Orban Blames Soros for Gruevski's Case[99] Referring to bank cards and visa for migrants, Prime Minister Viktor Orban said in a public radio interview on Friday that pro-migration forces consider European institutions as a 'transport agency', because they believe migration is in Europe's interest. Orban said this was to Hungary's detriment. Only after the European parliamentary election will the situation change, he added. He said that whereas the European Union justified repressive measures against European citizens by citing the fight against money laundering, the European Commission 'is giving anonymous bank cards to people we don't know and many of them become terrorists and criminals.' 'The rightful question is, why is this happening and where does the money come from,'he said. Fidesz MEPs, he added are investigating the matter, he added.[100]  Italy: Ready for EU Budget Talks Till Bitter End \u2014 Di Maio[101] Govt wants to explain virtues of the package says deputy premier (ANSA) \u2014 Milan, November 23 \u2014 Deputy Premier and Labour and Industry Minister Luigi Di Maio said Friday that the government was ready to take talks to 'the bitter end' to find an agreement after the European Commission this week rejected its budget plan for 2019. The Commission says the package, which sees Italy running a deficit of 2.4% of GDP next year, breaches the EU's budget rules. The government has refused to make major changes, saying an expansive budget is needed to finance key pledges and boost sluggish growth. 'We must try to have dialogue till the bitter end with all the European Commissioner, with the Commission, to explain the virtues of these measures and, above all, to explain how the budget can improve, especially in terms of cutting waste,' the 5-Star Movement (M5S) leader said. Di Maio said the government's key pledges will kick off as planned in 2019. These are a pension reform to effectively bring down the retirement age by making it possible to start claiming a State pension when a person's age plus their years of social-security contributions add up to 100 and a 'citizenship wage' basic income for job seekers. Italy has also come under pressure on the financial markers over the budget. 'When the budget is definitively approved by the end of the year, you'll see that the everyone will understand the new measures,' Di Maio said.[102]  Major UK City Slashes FGM Measures, 95 Percent Crash in Referrals[103] Bristol Council has deliberately rolled back attempts to tackle Female Genital Mutilation (FGM), leading to a 95 percent crash in the number of referrals, after claims they were 'over-policing' the Somali community. An FGM safeguarding group for the city \u2014 England's tenth-largest \u2014 which works with the council and police altered guidelines for referring girls suspected of being at risk of the grim practice this summer, Bristol Live reports.[104]  May's Betrayal Agreement Signed: Britain on the Road to Brexit in Name Only[105] EU leaders have signed off on the Brexit agreement negotiated with Theresa May, described as 'the worst deal in history' by Leavers. The Remain-voting Prime Minister's deal with the European Union \u2014 if ratified by the British Parliament and European Parliament \u2014 could condemn the United Kingdom to 'perpetual purgatory' or even no Brexit at all, as Britain's departure would be followed by a lengthy 'transition' period in which it would remain subject to all the rules and regulations of an EU member-state, but without representation in the EU's institutions. European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier, Theresa May herself, and EU leaders including Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte are all claiming the agreement is 'the only deal possible' \u2014 a coded and likely co-ordinated warning to Brexiteer MPs in the House of Commons who have said they will vote it down and argued for a rapid renegotiation.[106]  No OK to EU Budget if Farm Cuts \u2014 Salvini[107] Farm contributions an issue dear to me, personal battle (ANSA) \u2014 Cagliari, November 23 \u2014 Itay will not say yes to the European Union budget if there are cuts to the farm budget, Deputy Premier and Interior Minister Matteo Salvini said Friday. 'This government vows to not approve any European budget if it cuts even a single cent from Italian and Sardinian agriculture,' he said on a visit to the Italian island. 'The issue of Euroepan contributions to agriculture has been dear to me ever since I became an MEP, it is a personal battle of mine'.[108]  Orban: It's a Black Sunday[109] Prime Minister Viktor Orban bemoaned the endorsement on Sunday by EU leaders in Brussels of the Brexit withdrawal agreement, calling the day 'a real Black Sunday' and 'a sad day for the European Union'. Speaking in Brussels, Orban told public television news channel M1 that Hungary had tried to convince the UK to remain in the EU, even intervening in the Brits' campaign, but to no avail. 'Now we have no other choice but to acknowledge the decision that has been taken,' he said.[110]  President Macron Admits That France is in a 'Moral Crisis' And Calls it 'Unfair'[111] Twenty-Eighteen just hasn't been his year. The beleaguered and most unpopular of French Presidents in recent times, Emmanuel Macron, admitted on Saturday that France is in a 'moral crisis'. Macron implicitly refers to the 'Yellow Vest' or 'Hi Viz' protestors across the country who are protesting in the streets against rising fuel taxes and calling for Macron to resign.[112]  'Shame on' Anti-Government Protesters, Says Macron as France Revolts Over Green Fuel Tax[113] French president Emmanuel Macron has painted swathes of anti-tax-hike protesters as violent amid calls for his resignation over his 'progressive' policies. President Macron said Saturday: 'Shame on those who attacked [police and emergency services]. Shame on those who have abused other citizens and journalists. Shame on those who tried to intimidate the elect. [There is] no place for this violence in the Republic.'[114]  Swedish Train Driver Who Warned Against Pickpockets Reported for Racism[115] 'Unusual announcements' have been called out in the subway during the past week. Several people attest that the announcer, on various occasions, has pointed out a certain group as pickpockets. The group seems to be beggars. Josefin Meissner is one of those who has reported the announcements to SL (Stockholm Public Transport).[116]  Swiss Vote No in Sovereignty Referendum[117] Swiss voters have rejected a proposal to give Swiss law precedence over international law and treaties, according to results coming in from a national referendum. Figures based on partial results give 67% against and 33% in favour, national broadcaster SRF said.[118]  Trump Ups Pressure on Macron as Weighs in on French Demos[119] WASHINGTON (AFP) \u2014 Donald Trump piled pressure on Emmanuel Macron Sunday, pushing for resolutions to disputes on trade and defense spending, as he weighed in on the mass protests against his French counterpart's government. Writing on Twitter, Trump showed he had been keeping an eye on Saturday's demonstrations across France and refrained from showing sympathy for the beleaguered Macron, whose once cozy ties with the US president have chilled. 'The large and violent French protests don't take into account how badly the United States has been treated on Trade by the European Union or on fair and reasonable payments for our GREAT military protection,' said Trump. [120]  UK: Community Kitchen Backed by Meghan Markle is Housed Inside Mosque Linked to 19 Extremists[121] Another Markle Debacle: Community kitchen supported by Meghan's cookbook is inside mosque 'which has links to 19 terror suspects including Jihadi John'. The Al Manaar Muslim Cultural Heritage Centre was chosen by Ms. Markle for the cookbook in which she participated to raise money for the victims of the Grenfell Tower fire.[122]  UK: Facebook Documents Seized by MPs Investigating Privacy Breach[123] A cache of Facebook documents has been seized by MPs investigating the Cambridge Analytica data scandal. Rarely used parliamentary powers were used to demand that the boss of a US software firm hand over the details. The Observer, which first reported the story, said the documents included data about Facebook's privacy controls.[124]  UK: MI6 Scrambling to Stop Trump From Releasing Classified Docs in Russia Probe[125] The UK's Secret Intelligence Service, otherwise known as MI6, has been scrambling to prevent President Trump from publishing classified materials linked to the Russian election meddling investigation, according to The Telegraph, stating that any disclosure would 'undermine intelligence gathering if he releases pages of an FBI application to wiretap one of his former campaign advisers.' Trump's allies, however, are fighting back \u2014 demanding transparency and suggesting that the UK wouldn't want the documents withheld unless it had something to hide Perhaps the Brits are also concerned since much of the espionage performed on the Trump campaign was conducted on UK soil throughout 2016. [Comment: Likely UK intelligence were involved in the fake story of Trump and Russia.][126]  UK: Theresa May Writes 'Letter to the Nation' Begging Support for 'Worst Deal in History'[127] Theresa May has written a 'letter to the nation' begging the public to support her Brexit deal, which has been signed off by EU leaders but could be voted down in Parliament by Tory Brexiteers and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).[128]  Where Were the Brexit 'No-Deal' Warnings During the Scottish Independence Debate?[129] What about the threatened biblical plagues that will supposedly be visited on us if we leave without a deal? Why were these blood-curdling threats not made in the Scottish referendum? Quite rightly, no one would have believed such stories. No one would ever have imagined that the rest of the UK would have blockaded Scotland; and Brussels knew that if it had ordered Britain to institute a blockade that order would have been ignored, creating an immediate crisis for the whole EU edifice. So why do Brussels and the civil service now make fearful threats about no deal? Where Brussels, Berlin and Paris are concerned, the answer is obvious. In the Scottish case, they reasoned on the principle that 'my enemy's [England's] enemy [Scotland, as they saw it, ignoring three hundred years of shared history] is my friend.' In the Brexit case, there is just an enemy \u2014 Britain \u2014 which must be impoverished, subjugated and humiliated. As for the domestic branch of the nomenklatura, one shudders to think what might be shaping its attitude. The economic and, importantly, financial-system cost (and, even more, the security and defence cost) to the EU as a whole \u2014 and particularly to some individual EU countries, such as Ireland, and sectors, such as the German auto industry \u2014 of a no-deal Brexit and no FTA will be substantial. May's deal, in contrast, would be very beneficial to the EU, allowing it to impose additional regulatory burdens on British firms and gain access to British markets on terms unfavourable to Britain, as bait in FTAs with other countries. So one can understand why the EU prefers May's capitulation deal, even without taking into consideration the dreadful dilemma for the EU about the Irish border question it will have created for itself if there is no deal.[130]  Will the Yellow Vest Protests Push France Further to the Right?[131] France's so-called yellow vest protests are a vehicle for those who feel left behind by politicians in the capital. The demonstrations could boost support for far-right parties. Lisa Louis reports from Paris. Demonstrations are nothing out of the ordinary in France. But the yellow vest protests are different. The grassroots movement that sprung up on social networks mostly includes working-class people who had never before taken to the streets. They are outraged by new fuel taxes, which will make it even more difficult for them to make ends meet. That adds to their feeling of being left behind by the politicians in Paris. Around 300,000 people demonstrated last week across France. Tens of thousands have continued to block roads, shopping centers and government buildings over the past few days. On Saturday, another large gathering is planned in Paris. Christophe Chalencon has been blocking roads in the southern Vaucluse department. The blacksmith in his 50s voted for the centrist Emmanuel Macron in last year's presidential election, but now feels betrayed by him. [132]  Will Britain's Parliament Join in May's Betrayal?[133] With claims of it being the 'best and only deal possible', EU leaders have approved an agreement on the UK's withdrawal and future relations. Though Leave voters will disagree with that statement as we are not leaving the EU with Mrs. May's 'checkered deal', in fact, Jacob Rees-Mogg has said that there is nothing even resembling Article 50 for a way out of the EU, the UK will be locked in, so it's living up to it's #BrexitNotBrexit nickname.[134]  Bahrain Heads to Polls Amid Boycott Calls[135] DUBAI (AFP) \u2014 Bahrainis headed to the polls Saturday amid calls to boycott the parliamentary election in which dissolved opposition groups have been banned from taking part. The country's two main opposition groups, the Shiite Al-Wefaq and secular Waad, were barred from fielding candidates, prompting renewed calls for a boycott.

The ancient masterpiece was described by Arthur Brand, the Dutch investigator who located it, as 'one of the last and most beautiful examples of art from the early Byzantine era.' Many other cultural Cypriot relics, from churches and other sites, were stolen from Cyprus by Turkish invaders and smuggled abroad. Some were recovered and returned in the past. In 1989, mosaics stolen from the Church of Panagia Kanakaria, discovered in the United States, were returned to Cyprus.[140]  Pope Francis Prays Soviet Starvation Massacre of Ukrainians Never be Repeated[141] Pope Francis recalled Sunday the manmade, Stalin-era famine that killed millions of Ukrainians in the early 20th century, praying that such a massacre never be repeated.[142]  Ukraine Considers Declaring Martial Law After Apparent Defeat in Russia Naval Skirmishes[143] The Ukrainian president will ask his parliament to consider enacting martial law after three Ukrainian navy ships were fired upon and captured in the Black Sea on Sunday.

[146]  InfoWars Predicted it: China Social Credit Score to Go Nationwide by 2020[147] Authoritarian system being implemented globally as world breaks from 'Mark of the Beast' technology As Infowars predicted, China is poised to judge all 1.3 billion of its citizens by 2021 based on their behavior with a credit program that personalizes ratings for each one, according to reports. According to the Bejing government's website, the capital city will be rewarding and punishing its 22 million citizens by the end of 2020, and those who score poorly will be unable to participate in everyday life. The social credit program will use a combination of facial recognition technology, mobile phone numbers, government IDs, and immersive surveillance systems to determine which citizen is exhibiting 'pro-social' behavior. 'The Beijing project will improve blacklist systems so that those deemed untrustworthy will be 'unable to move even a single step,'' Bloomberg reported Wednesday. 'Those with better so-called social credit will get 'green channel' benefits while those who violate laws will find life more difficult.' Infowars has been warning of this authoritarian program for years. In 2014, we reported that Big Tech giants like Facebook were cooperating with China's Communist government to begin building the system. And in 2015, we reported that the so-called 'Sesame Credit' social score program is operated by Chinese companies Alibaba and Tencent, who control the country's social media.[148]  New Stone Tools Analysis Challenges Theories of Human Evolution in East Asia[149] A new study of stone tools from a cave site in China shows that sophisticated 'Levallois' tool-making techniques were present in East Asia at a much earlier date than previously thought.

The list of countries withdrawing and refusing to sign it is growing by the day. It has been presented by the UN as a 'non-binding' agreement that every country should sign it, however, one lawyer has already pointed out that ' while the UN migration pact is 'non-binding' on countries, it does set up a 'framework' which he says could be used by lawyers to interpret the meaning of laws'[164]  Huffpost Refugee Blogger Turns Out to be a 'Notorious Sex Criminal' And Had to be Put Into All Male Class in Germany[165] Aras Bacho, a Syrian refugee and blogger for the Huffpost, is accused of six cases of groping and sexually molesting girls and women.

Britain's ruling Conservative Party made pledges to reduce immigration 'from the hundreds of thousands to the tens of thousands' in the 2010, 2015, and 2017 general elections, a promise they have not yet made significant progress in keeping. Indeed, net migration to Britain still runs at over 270,000 a year, and former Tory chancellor George Osborne has suggested the party's leadership never intended to honour the pledge.[170]  Mexico to Deport Hundreds of Migrants Who 'Violently' Rushed US Border[171] Update: Mexico will deport approximately 500 migrants who 'violently' tried to cross into the United States, according to Reuters.[172]  Obama's 'Welcoming America': Disturbing Program That Weaponized Migrants and Refugees for a 'New America'[Video][173] 'The first consideration in immigration is the welfare of the receiving nation. In a new government based on principles unfamiliar to the rest of the world and resting on the sentiments of the people themselves, the influx of a large number of new immigrants unaccustomed to the government of a free society could be detrimental to that society. Immigration, therefore, must be approached carefully and cautiously.' \u2014 Thomas Jefferson Journalist and radio host Sue Payne reveals to Mark Levin what we've been saying about what's happening to small towns all across America. Ms. Payne was lucky enough to be privy to a plan for building a 'country within a country' using illegals and refugees. This is terrible for America and is a serious blow to our economy, jobs and way of life. Please listen to Sue Payne and read the bullet points below. Google 'Welcoming America' and check to see if they're in your town, then you'll know if your town is a target. Yes, this is the fundamental transformation Obama was talking about. Sue Payne was privy to listening-in on multiple conference calls between Barack Obama and 16 members of his cabinet. What she uncovered was shocking and disturbing. The administration's weaponization of illegal aliens and refugees may be far more sinister than even the most ardent opponents have yet imagined. On one of these calls, Obama conducted a meeting with his new 'Task Force On New Americans,' chaired by radical Cecilia Munoz, former vice president of the radical, Hispanic race-supremacy group La Raza ('The Race').

The Swedish government confirmed their support for the migration pact in a press release aimed at giving more information about the agreement to Swedes on Thursday. Their statement claims the agreement will not be legally binding \u2014 which is disputed by its detractors \u2014 and asserts that the framework of the pact will have benefits for Sweden as well as migrants, saying: 'There is a shortage of labour in several sectors in the Swedish labour market. Labour migration helps to meet this demand. 'Furthermore, migrants' remittances can contribute to important income for families in poor countries as well as investments in health, education, and housing,' they add. [Comment: Forked tongue.

Leaked Cabinet papers from the Home Office outline plans that will launch 11-month visas for unskilled workers, reports The Telegraph. The newspaper reports that the visa would put migrant workers under 'restricted entitlements and rights' while they live in Britain, and the proposals are expected to be announced in the Government's White Paper on migration set to be released in the week beginning December 3rd. The proposals are alleged to prove Prime Minister Theresa May has fulfilled promises to cut immigration and halt free movement from the EU, and have been heralded by The Sun as a 'Brexit crackdown' on immigration. However, Mrs May has been accused of attempting to fudge immigration statistics through the duration of the worker's visa. Immigration statistics are based on the International Passenger Survey (IPS) \u2014 which collects information about a small number of passengers entering and leaving the UK on a voluntary basis \u2014 where anyone who declares they are staying for 12 months or longer is counted as an 'immigrant' and all those staying for less than 12 months are logged as 'short term.' This effort to create an appearance of cutting immigration, which puts strain on public services like schools and hospitals as well as housing, has been called 'massaging' by an economics professor at King's College, London.[180]  UK: Theresa May Blocked Asylum Application of Asia Bibi as 'She is Afraid to Stoke Tensions Among British Muslims'[181] Home Secretary Sajid Javid has argued passionately the case for granting Asia Bibi, a Pakistani Christian who's conviction for blasphemy was recently pushed after eight years in solitary confinement, asylum in the UK. An investigation by the daily mail revealed that on the day Asia was seized, she was accused of blasphemy, paraded through her village with her neck bound by a leather noose, beaten with sticks, and told by a makeshift sharia court that her life would only be spare if she converted to Islam.[182]  What Women and Children?

But those wedding plans are on hold after conservative groups won a referendum battle over equal marriage which couples fear could water down their newly won rights. The original landmark court decision in May 2017 made Taiwan the first place in Asia to legalise same-sex marriage -? it ruled the change must be implemented within two years and sparked a wave of optimism in the LGBT community. [190]  Give Thanks That We No Longer Live on the Precipice[191] Fossil fuels helped humanity improve our health, living standards and longevity in just 200 years by Paul Driessen Thanksgiving is a good time to express our sincere gratitude that we no longer 'enjoy' the 'simpler life of yesteryear.' As my grandmother said, 'The only good thing about the good old days is that they're gone.'  Safe water and wastewater treatment \u2014 also made possible by fossil fuels, electricity and the infrastructure they support \u2014 supported still healthier societies that created still more prosperity, by eliminating the bacteria, parasites and other waterborne pathogens that made people too sick to work and killed millions, especially children. They all but eradicated cholera, one of history's greatest killers. Insecticides and other chemicals control disease-carrying and crop-destroying insects and pathogens. Ammonia-based fertilizers arrived in 1910; tractors and combines became common in the 1920s. Today, modern mechanized agriculture, fertilizers, hybrid and biotech seeds, drip irrigation and other advances combine to produce bumper crops that feed billions, using less land, water and insecticides.  So, this holiday season, give thanks for all these blessings \u2014 while praying and doing everything you can to help bring the same blessings to billions of people worldwide who still do not enjoy them.[192] [ 1]: #335604 [ 2]: #335606 [ 3]: #335573 [ 4]: #335579 [ 5]: #335564 [ 6]: #335571 [ 7]: #335673 [ 8]: #335575 [ 9]: #335563 [ 10]: #335659 [ 11]: #335635 [ 12]: #335657 [ 13]: #335641 [

Mann's case against the magazine stems from his creation of the infamous 'hockey stick graph' and a central role in the 'Climategate' scandal \u2014 in which his employer, Penn StateUniversity, eventually cleared him of wrongdoing.[50]  Andy Ngo: 'Data Shows That American Left-Wing White People Are the Only Group Who View Their Own Race Negatively'[51] This didn't surprise me, but I wanted to know the source. It turns out that it's from America's White Saviors | White liberals are leading a 'woke' revolution that is transforming American politics and making Democrats increasingly uneasy with Jewish political power, by Zach Goldberg, TabletMag, June 5, 2019.[52]  Breaking: Twitter Suspends Journalist Andy Ngo[53] Prominent journalist Andy Ngo, who is the Editor-at-large at The Post Millennial, has been temporarily suspended from Twitter following a response tweet to human rights campaigner, Clinton Foundation operator, and political heir Chelsea Clinton regarding trans murder rates. The tweet by Clinton highlights the deaths of more than 150 trans people who 'have been murdered in the U.S.' since 2013, 'the majority black transgender women.'[54]  CNN Contributor Says Trump's Praise for ISIS-Killing Conan the Dog Was 'Terrifying'[55] A CNN contributor reacted to Conan the dog, the canine who helped kill ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, being presented to the media by President Trump by claiming that the whole experience was 'terrifying.' Yes, really. 'This is terrifying. Trump and Melania exude coldness to Conan the hero dog. Melania, whose coat is slightly macabre (to me, but others may find it lovely), moves away from Conan multiple times,' tweeted CNN political contributor Joan Walsh, who is also the author of a book called What's the Matter With White People?[56]  CNN: Trump is Leader of 'Destructive Cult'; Using 'Mind Control' On Americans[57] Stelter and guest say Trump supporters need 'deprogramming' CNN's resident lunatic Brian Stelter went above and beyond his regular whackery Sunday, wheeling out a 'cult expert' on his 'Reliable Sources' show, who claimed that President Trump is a 'destructive cult' leader, a la Jim Jones, and that he is using 'mind control' to direct supporters. Stelter introduced Steven Hassan, author of a book titled The Cult of Trump, claiming that many prominent figures (read 'CNN talking heads') have been suggesting recently that Trump's America first movement is 'cultish'.[58]  Deep State is Already Attempting to Minimize Corrupt Actions of Second Set of FBI Lovers From Mueller Team Who Texted 'Viva Le Resistance' To Take Out Trump[59] The Washington Post reported over the weekend that a former FBI attorney altered information that supported a FISA warrant that was used to spy on candidate and President Trump. Now Deep State actors are trying to minimize the actions of the the Mueller gang lovers who attempted a coup on President Trump's Administration. The WaPo reported this weekend and it was quickly uncovered that former Mueller gang members Kevin Clinesmith and his reported lover, Sally Moyer, were involved in altering documents used to obtain a FISA warrant to legitimize spying on candidate and President Trump. The WaPo claims that this will be coming out in the upcoming IG report in December. Now the Deep State is attempting to downplay the actions that Clinesmith and Moyer took to end the Trump Administration \u2014[60]  Dem-Controlled School District Adopts SJW-Backed Busing Plan Despite Widespread Opposition[61] This is what happens when voters allow unaccountable Democrats to run wild with radical policies focused at building 'equity' and attacking 'privilege'. In deep-blue Howard County, Maryland, a local school board voted last week to impose a massive, 1970s-style busing and redistricting plan on the affluent suburban county, despite the fact that the plan is vehemently opposed by an overwhelming majority of residents. According to the Daily Caller's Luke Rosiak, after the first vote for the plan failed, members of the county school board retreated into their back room. When they came out, the one Democratic member who had voted 'No' was visibly upset. When the board held another vote a few minutes later, she acquiesced. Here's more from the DC: Board member Kirsten Coombs voted 'no' after board member Jennifer Mallo motioned to move a swath of children out of their schools to try to balance poverty rates. It failed 4-3, and people clapped. 'I move that we go into recess to consider the impact of the failure of that last motion,' Mallo said. Coombs appeared to be crying when they came out of the back room and said the board should vote again 'because otherwise the entire plan falls apart.' Across suburban America \u2014 and especially along the eastern seaboard \u2014 there are few local policy experiments as reviled as 'busing', as the Washington Post reminds us. Of the community members who oppose the plan \u2014 dozens showed up at the Thursday-night school board meeting to protest the vote \u2014 several individuals hailing from the former Soviet Union and mainland China said in a Facebook group that the board members' bullying tactics reminded them of the totalitarian regimes from which they fled. What's more, the board received nearly 7,000 pieces of mail opposing the policy, and just 150 in support of it. The police will dislodge thousands of children from their schools to try and balance out poverty rates in an attempt to equalize performance, drop-out rates and other metrics that measure 'equality'. Tellingly, many residents in the communities that this plan is supposed to help also oppose it, since it could involve sending their children to schools far from home. Adding insult to injury, after the vote passed, Jennifer Mallo, the board member who helped convince Coombs to change her vote, had the temerity to lecture her audience about the importance of equality, and neglected to mention the fact that nobody asked for this policy \u2014 and few support it, even among those the policy is purportedly designed to 'help'. Mallo also lamented the open-government laws that allowed her audience to be present, and even complained about the low pay received by board members. Unfortunately, this issue isn't isolated to Howard County: A loose alliance of activist groups (many of the groups are backed by billionaire investor George Soros) are pushing 'equity' plans that rely on what some economists have called 'junk science'. [Comment: Soros again.][62]  Diana West on #ImpeachTrump: Doomsdays of the Endgame, Part 1[63] by Diana West This week, the towering anti-communist dissident Vladimir Bukovsky was laid to rest in a London cemetery. In Washington, American democracy threw dirt on itself. Impervious to the irony, the Democrats of the House of Representatives staged another fake impeachment 'show trial' in its coup like no other to thwart the anti-communist will of the American electorate that sent Donald Trump to the White House. The battle is not drawn in such terms; they have been taken from us. But to understand the desperate, unceasing efforts to unseat President Trump requires a longer lens on recents events, one that can focus on over a century of what Whittaker Chambers described as 'the forces of that great socialist revolution, which, in the name of liberalism, spasmodically, incompletely, somewhat formlessly, but always in the same direction, has been inching its ice cap over the nation.' Chambers was writing in the 1950s, when the socialist 'New Deal' was only two decades old. In 2016, six decades past Chambers, as the socialist ice cap had all but completely smothered our democratic republic, Donald Trump won the presidency. With his agenda to save America by restoring the nation-state, President Trump became a one-man counter-revolutionary army. The revolutionaries within \u2014 leading figures in what is known as 'the Swamp' \u2014 responded as true Marxists do: by any means necessary. And why not? Their ideological roots in varieties of Marxism are documented in my short book, The Red Thread. The dangers they pose in these end-stages of our democratic republic cannot be overstated. That makes Election 2020 our D-Day for re-taking our Swamp-occupied continent. Maybe the second time around, a wiser, battle-tested counter-revolutionary Trump will call in reserves who actually support him. This is precisely what our deeply embedded and powerful communistic enemies, confronting this unexpected American 'insurgency,' fear more than anything.[64]  Epstein's Ex Ghislaine Maxwell Coming Out of Hiding Soon: Report[65] Jeffrey Epstein's alleged madam, Ghislaine Maxwell, is finally set to come out of hiding and possibly talk to the FBI, according to a report Monday. The British socialite is expected to emerge within days and defend her close friend Prince Andrew in the wake of his disastrous interview over his ties to the dead pedophile, a source close to Maxwell's lawyers told the Sun.[66]  FBI 'Know Where Ghislaine Maxwell is' And Are 'Building Case Against' Her'[67] SHE'S been living undercover between the UK and the US since the Prince Andrew sex abuse storm erupted in August \u2014 but now cops know exactly where 'pimp' Ghislaine Maxwell is, an expert claims. Spencer Kuvin, who represents three of the dead paedophile's accusers, told Sun Online he believes that the FBI are building a strong case against the Brit socialite before they arrest her \u2014 and that they are following her every move.[68]  First Look at Jeffrey Epstein Inside His 'Pedophile Island' Lair[69] Here is the first look at the monster in his lair. Newly surfaced photos obtained by The Post reveal for the first time how Jeffrey Epstein \u2014 and a horde of girls \u2014 spent time at his now-notorious Caribbean hideaway, nicknamed 'Pedophile Island'' by locals.[70]  I Just Have One Simple Question for @AdamSchiff[71] The Media-Democrats are willing to destroy the Executive Branch with an unprecedented abuse of subpoenas, filibusters, Bills of Attainder and endless investigations in search of crimes. As Attorney General William Barr describes it, 'the resistance' \u2014 a term normally used to describe violent internal conflicts \u2014 is doing vast and untold damage to the Constitution. The actions of Pelosi and Schiff are disgraceful and their names will be forever stains on American history. Irrespective of criminal, civil or political inquiries, never in all of American history has a 'defendent' been: Prohibited from mounting a defense Prevented from calling witnesses Prevented from cross-examining witnesses Prohibited from even attending the depositions and hearings Subjected to an inquiry where the prosecutor is witness-tampering (e.g., alleged 'whistleblower' Eric Ciamarella colluding with Adam Schiff prior to his filing any 'whistleblower' complaint) Prevented from asking questions that relate directly to the complaint (e.g., Joe and Hunter Biden's various lies about their knowledge of Burisma, corruption, etc.) Subjected to endless leaks by career bureaucrats and politicians who have somehow made millions as 'public servants'Anyone who defends this process is just as disgraceful as the leadership of the Democrat Party, which has become a river of swamp filth.[72]  Jane Fonda Goes After Climate Criminal Trump, Centrist Obama in CNN Rant[73] Actress-turned full-time climate change activist Jane Fonda appeared on CNN on Saturday and accused President Donald Trump of committing criminal actions against the world. 'I don't hate him. I feel sad for him,' Fonda said on CNN's The Van Jones Show. 'And what he's doing to the world is just criminal. It's just criminal. It's terrible. But there's more of us, and we can make a difference.'[74]  Navy Secretary Fired Over Seal Controversy[75] Firing sparked over poor handling of Eddie Gallagher case.[76]  New Amazon Show Features White People Wearing Red MAGA-Style Hats Being Hunted as 'Nazis'[77] A new Amazon Prime show starring Al Pacino features a group of 'diverse' vigilantes who hunt down and kill 'Nazis,' some of whom are depicted wearing red MAGA-style hats. Called Hunters, the trailer for the show, which is set in New York in 1977, is dominated by Pacino's character, a Nazi-hunting Jewish ringleader named Meyer Offerman who justifies the killings by asserting, 'This is not murder, This is mitzvah.'[78]  Supreme Court Temporarily Blocks Subpoena Seeking Trump's Financial Records[79] The Supreme Court on Monday temporarily blocked enforcement of a congressional subpoena seeking President Trump's financial records from an accounting firm, a brief victory for Trump, who has contended that a president cannot be investigated or prosecuted for a crime while in office.[80]  The Fishy Death of Jeffrey Epstein[81] Wood comments that Epstein was definitely NOT like 'the typical member' of the Trilateral Commission (TC) or Council on Foreign Relations (CFR). 'He had no compelling outward qualifications as far as I can tell, but if you think about the TC and CFR as being potentially useful for nefarious purposes, then Epstein was the blackmailer and his secret and real profession was sex trafficking and pedophilia,' Wood adds, 'It has been alleged that every room in his mansions had hidden cameras that filmed everything and everyone and that the videos taken were stored offsite in a still-undisclosed location. These will never be released because they implicate so many of the global elite.' These are serious concerns, and there is no guilt by association. But Epstein's mysterious death, at this juncture in history, is extremely significant. Attorney General William Barr tells AP that Epstein's 'suicide' was the result of 'a perfect storm of screw-ups.' But in the same way that then-candidate Donald J. Trump had brought up the case of the mysterious death of former Clinton aide Vincent Foster, calling it 'fishy,' there are too many outstanding questions about the Epstein death. Like Foster, he is a man who knew too much. Blaming two federal prison guards for his 'suicide' cannot be accepted at face value.[82]  The Smallest Vol: Tiny Snail Species Named After University of Tennessee[83] KNOXVILLE, Tenn. \u2014 A new Vol for Life is coming out of its shell. A team of researchers \u2014 many of whom are UT alumni \u2014 found the 2-millimeter cave snail lurking not far from Knoxville. The species' official new name is Antrorbis tennesseensis![84]  Calgary Academic Apologizes, Pays Up After Falsely Calling a Rebel Reporter a 'Neo-Nazi'[85] Are you one of the more than 3 million people who have viewed this response on Twitter from our reporter Sheila Gunn Reid? David Barrett, the 'Aquatic Ecology Lab Coordinator' at the University of Calgary has been required by a court of law to post this apology on his own Twitter account, and keep it pinned in the top spot for the next 30 days. His tweet reads: 'I apologize to Ms. Sheila Gunn Reid for my tweet on June 12, 2019 using the term 'Neo-Nazi'. I retract the allegation without reservation and regret any harm I may have caused to Ms. Gunn Reid or her family. I had no basis for making the allegation against her in particular and acknowledge that it is false in regards to her.'[86]  European Parliament Told: There is No Climate Emergency[87] (h/t R\u00fanar) At a press conference on Wednesday (20th November), the European Parliament was told: 'there is no climate emergency'. One MEP became emotional and accused the organizers of 'collective manslaughter' on future generations. The press conference was hosted by the European Conservatives and Reformists Group in the European Parliament, who formally received the climate declaration from Professor Guus Berkhout. Professor Berkhout represents the Climate Intelligence Foundation (Clintel), a Dutch group that has collected signatures from over 700 prominent scientists and professionals in support of the basic statement: there is no climate emergency. Signatories include Nobel laureate, Professor Ivar Giaever, who made important experimental discoveries regarding superconductors, and the influential mathematician and physicist Professor Freeman Dyson.[88]  France Says EU Could Agree 'Unique' Trade Deal If UK 'Plays Fair'[89] The French trade minister has said that the European Union is ready to offer a 'unique' trade deal, but only if the United Kingdom abides by Brussels' environmental regulations, state aid policies, and labour market laws. Speaking to the Financial Times, Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne said that the deal to be struck by the end of the transition period would not 'resemble any other bilateral agreement, any other trade agreement' that the EU has signed.[90]  Hungary Shines Spotlight on Christian Persecution in Budapest Conference[91] Hungary is holding its 2nd International Conference on Christian Persecution 2019 in Budapest this week to keep a bright light shining on the plight of Christians around the world. Conference participants started filing into Budapest Monday, even though the speeches and events do not officially begin until Tuesday morning, and the patriarch of Antioch and All the East, His Holiness Ignatius Aphrem II, led the prayer before lunch in Aramaic.[92]  Julian Assange's Health is So Poor He Could Die in Prison, According to a Letter to UK Government From 60 Doctors[93] Julian Assange is in such poor health he could die in prison, a consortium of 60 doctors said in a joint letter to the UK government. Assange has been detained inside the UK's Belmarsh Prison since May. The 48-year-old was in April sentenced to 50 weeks in prisonfor breaching the Bail Act when he spent years hiding from police in Ecuador's London embassy. The letter says: 'We write this open letter, as medical doctors, to express our serious concerns about the physical and mental health of Julian Assange.' It is addressed to Priti Patel, the UK's Home Secretary.[94]  Tony Blair: Chances of Labour Government 'Negligible'[95] Fanatic Remainer Tony Blair has admitted there is only a 'negligible' chance of Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party gaining a majority in the December 12th election. Speaking at a Reuters Newsmaker event on Monday, the former Labour prime minister said: 'I think if the polls are right, there is a negligible chance of a Labour majority.' Blair also claimed that the Labour Party had been taken over by 'left-wing populism'. Later during the event, he said that 'if you had a moderate centre-left leader of the Labour Party right now we wouldn't be in this position' where Conservatives promising to deliver Brexit had a 19-point lead over a party run by a socialist.[96]  UK: TV Network Bans Word 'Uppity' As Racist After a Single Complaint[97] A TV network in the UK has banned the word 'uppity' after a single viewer complained that the term was racist when used to describe Meghan Markle. The farce began after ITV host Eamonn Holmes criticized the Duchess of Sussex's attitude when she refused to pose for photographs with fans during her visit to the Wimbledon tennis tournament in July.[98]  Iran Tortures Protesters, World Yawns[99] The hundreds of anti-regime protesters and civil rights activists who have been arrested by Iranian security forces since the eruption of mass demonstrations on November 15 \u2014 after the government raised the price of gasoline \u2014 are in dangerof torture, forced confessions and even death sentences. According to the organization Iran Human Rights (IHR): 'The detainees are held in unknown places, and their families are not informed about their whereabouts. Moreover, there has been a total internet blackout imposed by the authorities making information flow very difficult. ''Most of the detainees could not call their families. Their relatives have tried to find out where they are held. They even do not know their beloved ones are dead or alive,' a well-informed source told IHR.'[100]  Thousands in Georgia Protest to Demand Electoral Reform[101] TBILISI (Reuters) \u2014 Thousands of protesters blocked entrances to parliament in Georgia's capital on Monday to press for proportional representation and reform to an electoral system they say unfairly favors the ruling party. Blowing vuvuzuela horns and holding placards, the demonstrators stood in front of entrances, sat on pavements and erected tents outside the parliament building which was guarded by hundreds of police officers.[102]  Furious Pakistan Summons Norway's Ambassador After Public Quran Burning ...awl[103] Over the weekend Pakistan announced it has summoned Norway's ambassador to convey the Muslim country's outrage over a televised Quran burning incident in the southern Norwegian city of Kristiansand. Similar to the controversial Florida-based pastor Terry Jones attempting to hold a Quran burning rally in 2010, this latest rally put on last week by the Stop Islamization of Norway (SIAN) had attracted a local and international media frenzy in the run-up to the event. Local reports further described that some 500 counter-demonstrators showed up, sending tensions soaring. The head of the anti-Muslim group, Lars Thorsen, stood in front of a considerable crowd and torched the Islamic holy book, and that's when chaos ensued, with at least two Muslim men rushing Thorsen after they jumped a police barrier \u2014 all of which was captured on film and went viral.[104]  Hong Kong's New Politicians Plead With Police at Polyu: Mercy for Last 20 Students[105] Hong Kong Polytechnic University (#PolyU) is the scene of a pro-democracy demonstration which started last week and may end tomorrow morning if newly elected District Councillors can convince the riot police outside the building to grant mercy to the last 20 students still barricaded inside.

Horacio Corbacho and Nicola Corradi, as well as a gardener, were found guilty of rape and abuse at the school in Mendoza province from 2004 to 2016. Several victims were in court to see sentence passed on Monday. The case has shocked Argentina, Pope Francis' homeland, with many accusing the Church of acting too slowly.[110]  Essex Lorry Deaths: Lorry Driver Pleads Guilty to Assisting Illegal Immigration[111] A LORRY driver accused over the deaths of 39 migrants has pleaded guilty to plotting to assist illegal immigration. Maurice Robinson, 25, is charged with the manslaughter of a group of men, women and children found dead in a refrigerated trailer.

The abuse is said to have occurred during April of 2018 when the five-year-old girl and her mother were staying at an apartment shared with three other migrants, two Afghans and a Sudanese national, in the commune of Avranches in Normandy, French newspaper La Manche Libre reports. The mother of the child, who usually slept on the floor of the apartment with her daughter, was woken up at about 4 am when she heard the voice of her Afghan flatmate and realized that her 5-year-old daughter was in the same bed as him. The 5-year-old girl then told her mother that the man had tried to make her touch his genitals. The mother then relayed news of the incident to neighbors who then contacted the police. Shortly after, the perpetrator was arrested. When the police interviewed the victim, she told them that the Afghan mad had put his hand down her underwear before asking her to touch his 'hard sausage'. The defendant has denied the claims, insisting that the 5-year-old girl had been the one to initiate sexual contact with him.[114]  France: Paris: Feminists Attack Other Protesters for Highlighting Study Showing 52% of Male Rapists Are Migrants[115] A group of young women highlighting a government study which showed 52 per cent of Parisian rape suspects were foreign nationals were attacked and labeled 'fascists' by feminists during a protest in Paris. Two of the young women's signs read, '52% of the rapists are foreigners' and 'Cologne, Rotherham soon Panam (French slang for Paris).' The feminists assaulted the women, stole their signs, ripped them up and then chanted, 'Feminists, not fascists' and 'fascists out,' as the young women were physically intimidated and forced to leave.[116]  'Open Arms' To Refugees, Pope Says in Japan[117] Francis says seeking success at any cost leads to unhappiness (ANSA) \u2014 Tokyo, November 25 \u2014 Pope Francis met with young people at St. Mary's Cathedral in Tokyo on Monday, where he called on the country to 'open your arms and welcome those who come, often after great suffering, to seek refuge in your country', said Caritas Japan. It said that due to the country's restrictive laws, only 42 people obtained refugee status in 2018. During his homily at Mass on Monday afternoon at the Tokyo Dome stadium, Pope Francis warned the faithful 'not to become trapped or isolated in the pursuit of success at any cost, including the cost of our very lives'. 'Worldly attitudes that look only to one's profit or gain in this world, and a selfishness that pursues only individual happiness, in reality leave us profoundly unhappy and enslaved, and hinder the authentic development of a truly harmonious and humane society,' Pope Francis said. After that Mass, Francis met Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.[118]  Sanctuary County: Freed Illegal Alien Accused of Murdering 19-Year-Old Girl[119] A suspect charged with murdering his 19-year-old girlfriend in September is an illegal alien living in the United States who was previously freed by the sanctuary county of Durham County, North Carolina, Breitbart News has learned.[120]  UK: Motorhome Used to Smuggle Albanian Immigrants[121] Three men used a rented motorhome to smuggle Albanian nationals into the UK for profit, a court has heard.

All three deny the charges and are on trial at Canterbury Crown Court.[122]  UK: Police Catch Van Full of Illegal Migrants in Windsor as 13 More Are Picked Up Suffering Hypothermia Trying to Cross the Channel From Calais[123] French officials intercepted the boat three miles west of Calais at 6.35am Comes after another 13 made it to Folkestone, Kent, on a boat yesterday Also on Sunday, 11 migrants were found getting into difficulty near Boulogne Around 1,600 migrants have made it into Britain this year by crossing Channel[124]  Nonbinary Berkeley Activist Pablo 'They' Gomez Found Not Guilty of Murder by Reason of Insanity, Gets 39+ Years Anyway[125] Back in January 2017, I headlined about a stabby Chicanx studies major at Berkeley who randomly murdered schoolteacher Emilie Inman: Fugitive Latinx / Chicanx Studies Major Who Is Wanted in Berkeley Stabbing Murder Answers Only to Pronoun 'They' This horrible case is, hopefully, finally over.[126]  Tired of Hollywood's Woke, And Failing, Actioners? Try Vox Day's New Comic Book Series[127] Given woke Hollywood's fare these days, the fate of Director Elizabeth Banks's ultra-feminist reboot of Charlie's Angels, like that Terminator Dark Fate, was as predictable as Banks's hissyfit when it bombed on opening weekend. It earned a paltry $8 million against a $50 million budget. (This weekend was worse, barely over $3 million). Banks griped that American men who didn't plunk down $9.25 for a ticketand $7 for popcorn were 'reinforce[ing] a stereotype in Hollywood that men don't go see women do action movies' [Elizabeth Banks suggests her 'Charlie's Angels' box office bomb is because men 'don't go see' female-led action films, by Joseph Wulfsohn, Fox News, November 18, 2019]. She's right\u2014men don't! My advice: if you want a good actioner, forget pozzed Hollywood and the New York publishing houses. Instead, try Vox Day's Alt-Hero comic book series\u2014an effective antidote to the modern entertainment industry's anti-white, anti-male egalitarian poison.[128]  'Woke' American Music Awards Sets Record Low Viewership in Key Demo[129] Despite being rammed with 'woke' themes like gender politics and climate change, the American Music Awards hit a record low in viewership for the key demographic of 18-49 year-olds. Reality TV star Big Freedia, who identifies as 'gender-nonconforming,' gave a speech before his performance in front of a rainbow church set telling the audience, 'Welcome to our Sunday Service,' which was an obvious dig at Kanye West's Christian-themed gospel-filled church services.[130]  It Can't Happen Here? Muslim Organization Wants International Law Criminalizing Criticism of Islam[131] The Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), which is made up of 56 nations plus the Palestinian Authority, met Thursday in Jeddah and called for the adoption of an international law criminalizing criticism of Islam. But that kind of law could never be adopted in the United States, could it? Think again. The OIC's secretary-general, Dr. Yousef al-Othaimeen, called upon the nations of the world, both Muslim and non-Muslim, to crack down on speech that was 'insulting religions or prophets.'

But he is not an alarmist. Because of that, he is one of the few worth taking seriously. And while I'm sure he would prefer to spend more time convincing skeptics like myself that Climate Change is real, because of all the climate hysteria out there, most of his time is spent debunking myths, fake news, and bad science. After the release the government's latest climate assessment report last week, and as we have come to expect, almost all of the establishment media used it to fire hose us with fake news. In response, Lomborg published a must-read piece at the New York Post debunking the misleading coverage. Here are the 7 ways the media misled you about the report:[73]  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Wants Seat on Powerful House Finance Committee[74] Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), a Democratic Socialist who won election to Congress in the 2018 midterm election, said on Thursday that she would like a seat on the House Financial Services Committee \u2014 a powerful committee that oversees the country's financial sector. 'I think with our district, we can be ambitious, so we're kind of swinging for the fences on committees,' Ocasio-Cortez told HillTV. 'We might as well ask for something big.' [Comment: This nutty bolshevik on that committeethat would be really bad][75]  Break Up Big Tech, Say Steve Bannon and Robert Reich[76] Like canaries in a mine, two iconic figures of the right and the left sing in unison about the dangers of big tech and the importance of breaking them up. Something strange is happening. Steve Bannon, the former chief strategist of President Donald Trump, and Robert Reich, the Berkeley professor who served President Bill Clinton, are singing from the same hymn sheet.[77]  Business Card Led to Catholic Store Shooting Suspect Arrest[78] ST. LOUIS (AP) \u2014 A discarded business card led police to the man accused of killing a woman and assaulting two others at a Catholic Supply store in suburban St. Louis. St. Louis County police Sgt. McGuire told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that a woman at a neighboring business told police after the Nov. 19 attack in Ballwin that a man fitting the suspect's description had given her a business card. That card, found in the trash, helped break the case. McGuire also praised the courage of the victims, who provided detailed descriptions. Fifty-three-year-old Thomas Bruce is charged with first-degree murder, multiple counts of sodomy and other crimes in the attack. He's accused of ordering three women to perform sex acts at the store. Investigators say 53-year-old Jamie Schmidt was killed when she refused.[79]  Chris Farrell: How the State Dept. Outsources Your Tax Dollars to George Soros Front Groups[80] JW Director of Investigations and Research Chris Farrell appeared on 'No Spin News' on billoreilly.com to discuss the caravan and its potential source of funding.[81]  Former President George H.W. Bush Dies at Age 94[82] George Herbert Walker Bush, whose lone term as the 41st president of the United States ushered in the final days of the Cold War and perpetuated a family political dynasty that influenced American politics at both the national and state levels for decades, died Friday evening in Houston. He was 94. Bush was the last president to have served in the military during World War II. His experience in international diplomacy served him well as he dealt with the unraveling of the Soviet Union as an oppressive superpower, and later the rise of China as a commercial behemoth and potential partner. His wife of 73 years, Barbara Pierce Bush, died April 17, 2018, at the age of 92.[83]  George H.W. Bush, 41st President, Dies at 94[84] George Herbert Walker Bush, the 41st president of the United States, whose long life in the public sphere was defined by service to his country, has died. He was 94. His wife of 73 years, Barbara Bush, died in April and Mr. Bush was hospitalizedthe day after the funeral to be treated for an infection in his bloodstream. He suffered a number of health issues in his later years, including vascular parkinsonism, a condition similar to Parkinson's disease, and used a wheelchair to get around.[85]  Gun Sales So Low at Dick's They May Yank All Hunting Gear[86] Dick's Sporting Goods took a firm, anti-gun stance. Oh, it'll still sell guns, but it'll only sell 'approved' guns, the kind that anti-gunners generally pretend are fine. At least until they get around to demanding those be banned too. When Dick's made its announcement that it would not sell AR-15s at any of its stores going forward and that it would discriminate against legal adults looking to buy long guns, gun rights advocates called for a boycott. It was answered. So much so that the company has been reeling from the lost revenues.[87]  Hollywood is a Sex-Grooming Gang[88] If you're tempted to turn away from the torrent of squalid news that continues to flow out of Hollywood, resist the temptation. The more of these revolting exposes you read, the more clearly you will see the underlying monstrosity in Hollywood, as clearly as the hero of John Carpenter's They Live sees aliens disguised as everyday people when he puts on the sunglasses.[89]  Is Dick's Sporting Goods Removing All Hunting Gear From Stores?[90] Is the latest self-inflicted wound by Dick's Sporting Goods and effort to be politically correct or just a marketing move? Dick's Sporting Goods reported a third-quarter net sales decline of just under $2 billion after stopping the sales of 'assault-style' weapons earlier this year. They also raised the minimum purchase age for guns to 21. Even with the big loss, they may ditch hunting gear in all of their stores. Dick's Sporting Goods CEO Edward Stack told CBS News in a conference call that the company may remove hunting gear from all 732 of its stores: 'Though it's too early to discuss performance, we're optimistic these changes will better serve the athletes in these communities. Stack said they're 'looking at a number of stores where the hunt category significantly under-performs.' Hunting gear would be replaced with baseball and soccer gear.[91]  Is Kid Rock Out as Grand Marshall in the Nashville Christmas Parade for His Comment About Joy Behar? [Video][92] Why is it that Joy Behar can trash President Trump all the time but the minute she gets pushback, all heck breaks loose? Kid Rock made an appearance on Fox and Friends at his new restaurant in Nashville and made a joke that's been blown totally out of proportion (see video below). He's now been kicked out of being the grand marshall for the Nashville Christmas Parade! Everyone freaked out when on live TV Kid Rock bashed Joy Behar (see below). The anchors on Fox and Friends apologized like crazy. The mayor of Nashville even pitched a hissy fit and said he wouldn't go to the Christmas Parade if Kid Rock was the grand marshall The trouble started when Kid Rock called Joy Behar a 'b*tch' on Fox and Friends: 'People need to calm down, get a little less politically correct and I would say, you know, love everybody. Except, screw that Joy Behar b*tch.'[93]  Landlord Tells Harvard Student to Move Out Over Legally Owned Guns[94] Roommates searched room for guns after finding MAGA hat A Massachusetts landlord told a Harvard University graduate student that he wanted her to move out of her apartment because her legally owned firearms made some of her roommates uncomfortable. 'Since it's clear that Leyla wants to keep her firearms, it would be best for all parties if she finds another place to live,' Dave Lewis, president of Avid Management, said in an email to the household obtained by the Washington Free Beacon.[95]  Leaked Google Emails Reveal Internal Discussion on Burying Articles From Conservative Outlets[96] Google \u2014 which was exposed trying to help Hillary Clinton win the 2016 election, and who were beside themselves after she lost \u2014 discussed whether to bury conservative media outlets in the company's search function after Donald Trump became president, according to the Daily Caller News Foundation's Peter Hasson. Internal communications obtained by the Caller reveal that The Daily Caller and Breitbart were specifically singled out for potential censorship. Not all Google employees agreed with the notion of censoring conservative outlets; engineer Uri Dekel \u2014 a self-described Clinton supporter, argued that manipulating search results was the wrong approach. 'Thinking that Breitbart, Drudge, etc. are not 'legitimate news sources' is contrary to the beliefs of a major portion of our user base is partially what got us to this mess. MSNBC is not more legit than Drudge just because Rachel Maddow may be more educated / less deplorable / closer to our views, than, say Sean Hannity,' Dekel wrote Byer in a reply, adding 'I follow a lot of right wing folks on social networks you could tell something was brewing. We laughed off Drudge's Instant Polls and all that stuff, but in the end, people go to those sources because they believe that the media doesn't do it's job. I'm a Hillary supporter and let's admit it, the media avoided dealing with the hard questions and issues, which didn't pay off. By ranking 'legitimacy' you'll just introduce more conspiracy theories' Another engineer, Mike Brauwerman, suggested that the company could avoid 'accusations of conspiracy or bias' by using technology to 'trace information to its source, to link to critiques of these sources, and let people decide what sources they believe.' 'Give people a comprehensive but effectively summarized view of the information, not context-free rage-inducing sound-byte,' added Brauwerman. Other Google employees also advocated for providing context to sources in order to 'help' users consume information. Unfortunately, the search giant's solution was to employ fact-checking organizations with a liberal bias that 'target conservative outlets almost exclusively,' according to the Caller. Google eventually pulled their fact-checkers in January, crediting an investigation by the Daily Caller in their decision. Google claims that the email conversation did not lead to the manipulation of search results for political purposes. Right \u2014 then why does a Google search for 'Idiot' return pictures of the Trump family, while the same search in DuckDuckGo is completely different: [Comment: Check out the comparison pics of image search for 'idiot' in google vs duckduckgo. Better to use <url normalizedValue=\"https://duckduckgo.com\">https://duckduckgo.com</url>/ or       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.startpage.com/\">https://www.startpage.com/</url>. Better privacy, but even these use google as a source so their results are still 'infected' with google bias.][97]  NPR Tells Huge Lie About Donald Trump Jr.'s Congressional Testimony Trump Jr. Fights Back After Prominent Dem Lawmakers Spread Lie[98] If Mueller's witch hunt can't get find any wrongdoing, then the media will just have to make it up. NPR published a story today that falsely claimed that Donald Trump Jr. gave conflicting testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee in September 2017. Six hours later, after several major news outlets and hundreds of liberals retweeted the lie, the government funded NPR finally made a correction to their false story. The fake news NPR story about Don Jr. was discredited by many in the media by mid-afternoon. That didn't stop Eric Swalwell, a US Congressman from California, from mocking President Trump's son on Twitter over a FAKE NEWS story, tweeting: A good lesson for all kids (and for anyone in the White House): the truth always comes out. (Swalwell included a link to NPR's fake news story that wrongfully smeared Donald Trump Jr.) Donald Trump Jr., who, much like his father, doesn't shy away when it comes to defending the truth called out US Rep. Eric Swalwell on his tweet. You were saying Eric? Maybe you should read the correction issued rather than chasing yet another shiny object. After 2 years of fails it just makes you look stupid (a fitting look for you). Obviously the truth isn't convenient for your objective so I imagine you'll stay quiet! How fake news works: 1. Original source reports something false 2. Other news orgs spread false report 3. After report has saturated the news, original source adds 'correction' 4. News orgs that reported original report give corrected version minimal coverage 5. Damage done.[99]  Rush Limbaugh Predicts Republicans to Join Democrats in Opposing Trump[100] As Democrats and Trump-opposing Republicans stand poised to engage in actions against Trump in hopes of a 'win', the only winners will be establishment, charlatan, political shills while the losers will once again be the American people. Rush Limbaugh noted on a recent broadcast that Trey Gowdy made it clear that Republicans would assist Democrats in their plan to take out Trump. 'And because of statements made by Trey Gowdy over the weekend, I now think that the Democrats and all of these investigations are gonna be joined by a whole bunch of Republicans who want Donald Trump gone. Yeah, I know everybody said, 'Boy, Rush, if the Democrats win the House they're gonna do nothing but investigate Trump.' Well, we know that. But I'm just telling you, I don't think you have any idea what's coming. I may not either. I mean, it's gonna be all that they're gonna do,' Limbaugh stated. The top rated conservative talk show host was referring to comments Gowdy had recently made on CBS's Face the Nation. [Comment: Too many RINOs in the Republican party.][101]  Stanford Tells College Republicans They Can't Use Donor to Pay $19,000 Security Fee for D'souza Event[102] University 'looking into alternative arrangements' for event to go forward Stanford University is refusing to let Dinesh D'Souza speak on campus because the security fee would be paid by a donor, according to the student group that invited the conservative author and filmmaker. The student government did not answer multiple email and phone queries from The College Fix to explain why it demanded $19,000 for security \u2014 more than fivefold greater than the College Republicans suggested \u2014 or confirm it required at least half the fee to come from campus sources.[103]  Trump Signs NAFTA Replacement Deal Ahead of the G20 Summit[104] US President Donald Trump and his Canadian and Mexican counterparts signed a replacement NAFTA deal on Friday during a ceremony on the sidelines of the G20 summit. The ceremonial signing does not mean the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement \u2014 the USMCA, as it has been rebranded \u2014 will now go into effect. The deal still needs to win congressional approval in Washington, where key members of both political parties have already expressed significant concerns. [Comment: Only the title has changed. The core is worse than NAFTA in terms of loss of sovereignity.][105]  'We've Never Really Seen Anything Like This': US Suicide Rates Hit 50-Year Peak[106] All told, the US recorded 2.8 million deaths in 2017, with middle-aged deaths making the biggest impact on life expectancy. 'These sobering statistics are a wake-up call that we are losing too many Americans, too early and too often, to conditions that are preventable,' Dr. Robert Redfield, the CDC's director, said. The suicide rate in 2017 was the highest in 50 years reaching roughly 47,000 cases (up from just below 45,000 the previous year). 'We've never really seen anything like this,' said Robert Anderson, who oversees CDC death statistics. Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death in the US for the tenth year in a row. Increases have been prominent among the female population despite the fact that most people who die by suicide are still male. The female suicide rate rose by 53 percent between 1999 and 2017, with a 26 percent increase for men during the same period. 'I really do believe that people are increasingly hopeless, and that that leads to drug use, it leads potentially to suicide,' said Dr. William Dietz, a disease prevention expert at George Washington University.[107]  Taxpayers Federation Stands With Ontario as it Challenges Ottawa's Carbon Tax in Court[108] CTF will seek intervenor status in the newly announced Ontario court action against the federal carbon tax The Canadian Taxpayers Federation (CTF) is standing with the Ontario government as it challenges the federal government's proposed carbon tax at the Court of Appeal. 'Premier Doug Ford is standing up for Ontario taxpayers by taking Ottawa to court to block a federally imposed carbon tax,' said Christine Van Geyn, the CTF's Ontario Director. 'Prime Minister Justin Trudeau won't provide evidence to show a carbon tax will help the environment. But we do know that this new tax will give the government more power to suck money out of the wallets of Ontario families and businesses, and this is a tax that will keep going up over time. . 'Telling Ontario taxpayers that the carbon tax is a tax that will save them money is like telling someone you'll make them rich by spending all their money.' While there's always a range of possible outcomes in court, University of Saskatchewan constitutional law expert Dwight Newman told the Financial Post that provinces opposing a carbon tax have 'more of a case than a lot of people are giving them credit for.'[109]  'Islam is Not a Religion of Peace, Dialogue is Useless Unless the Quran Changes' \u2014 Catholic Priest[110] Roman Catholic priest Fr. Mario Alexis Portella has spoken openly about the threat of Islamic jihad in an interview with Marcello Mancini, which was printed in Italian newspaper La Verti on 22 November. Speaking on the true nature of Islam, Father Portella said: 'Only one has to look at the original Islamic texts that speak the truth; those texts, however, are ignored by scholars and activists who maintain that they are being misinterpreted by those who terrorism and the Islamization of the world. It is simply not true.'[111]  Belgium Faces 'Wave of Jihadism' As Radical Islam Spreads in Prison Population[112] Belgium faces a 'wave of jihadism' as radical Islam spreads through its prison population, according to a national security report. The West European country, split between Flemish-speaking Flanders and French-speaking Wallonia and home to the European Union's main capital of Brussels, is contending with a 'never before seen population of detainees jailed for terrorism', according to the report quoted by the Daily Mail.[113]  EU Leaders Plot to Extend Article 50 Negotiations to Stop Clean Brexit, Tusk Threatens 'No Brexit'[114] European Union leaders are plotting to offer an extension to the Article 50 Brexit divorce negotiations, to stop Britain making a clean 'no deal' break from the bloc if the Prime Minister's deal fails in Parliament.[115]  Europe is on the Brink of a Working Class Revolution Against Globalist Governments[116] It's surprising how easily the fuel tax protests from France could spread to Belgium and the Netherlands. The demonstrations of people in yellow vests signal a large dissatisfaction of the people over their governments. France's fuel protests have partly turned into anti-Macron protests as well. Under his leadership taxes are increased, but he forgets to protect the French people and their culture.[117]  France's Meltdown, Macron's Disdain[118] 'The French say, 'Mr. President, we cannot make ends meet,' and the President replies, 'we shall create a High Council [for the climate]'. Can you imagine the disconnect?' \u2014 Laurence Saillet, spokesman for the center-right party, The Republicans, November 27, 2018 The 'yellow jackets' [protestors] now have the support of 77% of the French population. They are demanding Macron's resignation and an immediate change of government. The movement is now a revolt of millions of people who feel asphyxiated by 'confiscatory' taxation, and who do not want to 'pay indefinitely' for a government that seems 'unable to limit spending'. \u2014 Jean-Yves Camus, political scientist. European elections are to be held this Spring, 2019. Polls show that the National Gathering will be in the lead, far ahead of La Rpublique En Marche! [The Republic on the Move!], the party created by Macron.[119]  France: Paris Relegated to Warzone for Third Consecutive Weekend Amid Fresh Yellow Vest Rallies[120] Once again, French police have clashed with protester's in France's capital city amid rising anti-government sentiment fuelled by tax increases and fuel price hikes. The December 1 rallies are being held with the slogan, 'on the way to Macron's resignation'. The police have resorted to using tear gas as stand-offs between law enforcement and the 'gilets jaunes' (yellow vests) continue around the iconic Arc de Triumph.[121]  France: Hundreds Arrested as Police Clash With 'Yellow Vest' Protesters in Paris[122] Protesters angry about rising taxes clashed with French police for a third straight weekend and scores were arrested after demonstrators built barricades in central Paris, lit fires and threw rocks at officers Saturday. According to figures released by French interior ministry, around 75,000 demonstrators took to the streets today in the anti-Macron protests.[123]  France: Macron is a Disaster: Approval Rating Drops to New Low of 23%[124] President Emanuel Macron seems to be taking the lead balloon approach to popularity. His approval rating has been in free-fall and has dropped another (-3) to a shockingly new low of 23 per cent in Viavoice's 29 November poll.[125]  German Residents Treated to Special Christmas 'Art Project' Featuring Ear-Piercing Muslim Call to Prayer From Local Church Five Times Per Day [Video][126] What better way for Germans to celebrate the Christmas season than to live or work nearby an 'art display' that features an ear-piercing Muslim call to prayer five times per day, while the streets are lined with Muslims praying in the streets outside of a prominent church? Breitbart reports \u2014 At certain times each day between December 2nd and 23rd, people strolling through the centre of Linz will be treated to 'a special kind of audiovisual experience,' when recordings of muezzin calls, which were taped in Algeria, Mozambique, Istanbul, and Singapore, are played from the chapel of the Upper Austrian Cultural Quarter's Ursuline Church. The organisers behind 'ADHINA' say the installation 'succeeds in linking the aesthetics of different realms of reality,' when visitors hear 'the muezzin call as an Islamic ritual' melding together with 'the everyday sounds of a secular-urban world,', as they walk past the 'Christian sacral architecture' at the site, where the baroque buildings were founded as a monastery.[127]  Germany's Former Vice Chancellor Calls U.S. 'Rogue Superpower, ' Says Trump Sees World as 'Battleground'[128] The former socialist vice chancellor of Germany, Sigmar Gabriel, has described the United States as a 'rogue superpower', saying President Donald Trump sees the world as a 'battleground'.[129]  Hungary: Ader Sends Condolences Over Bush's Death[130] President Janos Ader has sent condolences over the death of former US President George H.W.

The specimen was one of four species of the fish found in Loch Laidon, suggesting biodiversity in freshwater habitats is greater than first thought. The new species differs from the common form in having lighter skin, and a larger mouth and eyes.[143]  UK: BBC Criticised for 'Misleading' Viewers in 'Vicargate' Row[144] Viewers of the BBC's Newsnight program who turned in on Monday would have seen Lynn Hayter sporting a dog collar and telling them to 'have faith in the government that we elected.' Not an unusual thing for a vicar to say you would imagine. However, she is an actress and the BBC has faced a massive online backlash.[145]  UK: Don't Talk to Strangers\u2014or Listen to Leftists![146] 'Don't talk to strange men!' is one of the most sensible pieces of advice you can give to a child. If a stranger approaches a little boy who is playing alone and starts chatting to him, the stranger will at best be slightly mad and there's any number of much worse things he might be.

Citing a French official, Reuters reports the pair discussed the Yemeni Civil War and killing of Washington Post contributor Jamal Khashoggi during a brief intermission in the high-stakes talks. In a video shared to Twitter via the Saudi Gazette, an irritated Macron is seen grumbling to the Crown Prince: 'You never listen to me.'[157]  Turkey Says No Blocks to Erdogan-Bin Salman Meeting[158] Cavusoglu, Saudi forensic expert enjoyed dismembering ISTANBUL \u2014 Turkish Foreign Minister Cavusoglu told German daily Suddeutsche Zeitung that there is currently 'no reason' that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan couldn't meet with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman on the sidelines of the G20 conference this weekend in Argentina. Cavusolgu said, however, that the final decision is up to Erdogan. He said that he had heard the audio recording of the assassination of Saudi dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Riyadh consulate in Istanbul. 'In the recording you can hear the forensic expert giving instructions,' Cavusoglu said. 'You can hear him saying that the others should listen to music while he dismembers the body. You can tell he likes it. He likes dismembering people. It's disgusting,' Cavusoglu said. He said the Turkish government maintains that the assassins did not 'act alone' but at the moment there is no definitive proof on who ordered the killing.[159]  Merkel Ally Suggests Blockading Russian Ships From All EU and US Ports[160] A close senior political ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel told Reuters on Friday that the European Union and the United States should consider banning all Russian ships that originate from the Sea of Azov from entering EU and US ports until last Sunday's Kerch Strait crisis is resolved.

Pooh suddenly became problematic because his likeness has been used in viral memes considered insulting to China's authoritarian leader. The Chinese government regards Pooh with the same disdain as a hive of honeybees because someone thought a photo of portly Xi strolling alongside former U.S. President Barack Obama in 2013 resembled Pooh strolling alongside his pal Tigger. Viral mockery struck a fever pitch the following year when Xi shook hands with a dour Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan and the scene was compared to Pooh shaking hands with downbeat donkey Eeyore.

According to the green publication Clean Technica, in an article headlined 'G20 Nations Reportedly Set to Kowtow to Trump on Climate Change': It helps, of course, that President Donald Trump now has a major ally in the G20. President-elect Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil is not attending the summit, but the very fact of his election means that, for the first time, there are two avowedly climate-skeptical nations in the G20. Bolsonaro, who sees himself as South America's answer to Trump, recently appointed a foreign minister \u2014 Ernesto Ara\u00fajo \u2014 who believes that 'climate change' is a plot by 'cultural Marxists' to stifle the economies of the West and promote the growth of China. Brazil was supposed to be hosting the COP25 climate talks next year, but since Bolsonaro's election, it has announced that it is no longer interested 'due to the transition in government and budget restrictions.'[171]  Canada's Prime Minister Leading the Charge to Steal U.S. Sovereignty[172] Heads up to President Donald Trump, it's not just southward and at the D.C. swamp that you should be looking for saboteurs, but northward to the world's longest undefended border Guess who's leading the Brave New World's 'Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration'? Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who is driving the UN caravan. Media-touted as a heart-throb since his 2015 election as Liberal prime minister, written up ad nauseam when pictures showed one of his eyebrow askew, having his entire family show up in traditional Indian dress when he toured India in 2018, guess they missed his saboteur side. 'The UN's global compact on refugees could be a game-changer\u2014and Canada is well-placed to help make it a reality, say two cabinet ministers and a UN official.' (Macleans, Sept. 24, 2018) Canada's leading role in the Migration pact with Trudeau in the driver's seat should come as no surprise. For decades the UN has been peopled by Canadians from the late former Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations, Canadian Maurice Strong, all the way to his protege Louise Arbour, currently UN Envoy for International Migration who shepherded the UN Migration pact. Yesterday the Voice of Europe is sounding the alarm bells that the UN's Refugee Pac is even worse than its Migration Pact\u2014and that both\u2014will be signed in December. 'In this document, the EU has also calculated the maximum absorption capacity of each country and concluded that, for example, Germany is estimated to have a capacity of 274 million people and Sweden of 440 million (Table 12).

Bergen admitted that her hate for President Trump inspired her to do a reboot of the show. Since the debut of the show, Bergen has used the 'comedy' to trash President Trump, his administration and his supporters. Last Thursday, CBS aired a Thanksgiving episode of the rebooted Murphy Brown show. During the episode, Murphy Brown and friends got a visit from ICE agents. The agents claimed they saw a taco truck outside that was registered to an undocumented immigrant and they were there to deport the owners. 'Thanksgiving and Taking' caught the attention of Fox ...iends, which blasted the storyline as 'grossly offensive.' The Fox ...iends Weekend hosts discussed the Murphy Brown episode at length, saying that CBS shouldn't be pushing 'a Hollywood narrative' or airing an 'anti-law-and-order, anti-law-enforcement advertisement.' Karma comes in many forms, and it looks like in the case of Candice Bergen, karma has arrived in the form of a cancellation of the reboot of her show. Apparently, bashing President Trump isn't as popular in the rest of America as it is in the intolerant Hollywood bubble.[175]  Chain Migration: 60 Percent of 'Retired' Migrants in Italy Have Never Worked[176] According to figures on non-EU citizens in Italy, around 60 percent of 'retired' migrants have never worked. Approximately 96,000 non-EU migrants currently receive a pension from the Istituto Nazionale della Previdenza Sociale (INPS), Italy's social security agency. Of those, an estimated 60,000 do not have their pensions covered by prior contributions because they had not worked and paid taxes, Il Giornale reports.[177]  Denmark to Send Criminal Migrants to Deserted Island as They Cause 'Many Problems'[178] Criminals who are to be expelled from Denmark will in the future be placed on an uninhabited island south of Copenhagen, where there will also be staff from the Prison Service.

There will be ferry services to the island, but the ferry will not run during the day and they must be at the deportation center at night', says Denmark's Finance Minister Kristian Jensen.[179]  In Europe 'Criticism of Migration' Set to Become a Criminal Offense[180] Europeans concerned about borders, language and culture may soon find themselves in the hot seat after Dutch politician and European Parliament member Marcel de Graaff issued a dire warning over the 'definition of hate speech' which will criminalize speech opposing mass migration, as first reported by Joe Schaeffer of LibertyNation. Meanwhile, the UN Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner posted a transcript of a November 20 speech from Andrew Gilmour, Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights, entitled: 'Words Matter: Role and Responsibility of the media in shaping public perceptions about migrants and refugees and promoting inclusive societies.' Gilmour calls 'hate crimes against migrants' an 'especially unpleasant manifestation of what I see as an almost global backlash against human rights.'

They are being used as pawns by communist groups to achieve the goal of open borders. Groups like People Without Borders and others are pushing for a policy of open borders at all costs.

The Mexican press is reporting that other caravans are forming which could mean an additional 20,000 people in Tijuana in a matter of weeks. Did thousands of migrants, mixed in with criminals, get together and decide to walk 1,700 miles to the United States without enough food, water or support? Who is behind this border crisis? What is their goal? Honduran President Juan Hernandez informed Vice President Pence that the caravan was organized by American leftist organizations like the American Immigration Council, the Refugee and Immigration Center for Education, the American Immigration Lawyers Association, and CARA Family Detention Pro Bono Project. At least three of these organizations are funded by George Soros' Open Society Foundation. It should be no surprise to anyone that George Soros is a globalist that wants to see the end of American sovereignty. 'We shall have world government whether or not you like it, by conquest or consent.'\u2014Statement by Council on Foreign Relations member James Warburg to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, 2/17/1950 'Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing me and my family as internationalists and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure \u2014 one world, if you will.

They come from organizations like the UN, IMF, World Bank, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Bilderberg Group, the Royal Institute of International Affairs and hundreds of other non-governmental organizations like Soros' Open Society Foundation. Their intention is to form a socialist one-world government, devoid of freedom and liberty, placing everyone under their control. They have been planning this for decades. Before they can achieve their aims they first must destroy any powerful nations that can tell the UN, the IMF or any other globalist organization to get lost. So, how do you destroy a nation, especially a powerful one that could thwart any plan of a one world government? You do it by pitting groups against each other, rich vs. poor, black vs. white, men vs. women, gay vs. straight, divide, divide. That is why open immigration is so important to the Left. The more people think of themselves as Hispanic, white, black, gay or Muslim, rather than American, the easier it will be to destroy the nation's sovereignty and identity.[189]  Toddler Bitten 15 Times by 'Somalians' At Play Centre[190] Find out how the fake news media and the lying press altered this story \u2014 hiding key facts from the public and eventually burying it in order to keep the public in the dark.[191]  UC-Berkeley Student Govt Unanimously Approves Resolution to Fund Migrant Caravan[192] The University of California Berkeley student government has resolved to financially support the Honduran migrant caravan after a four-hour meeting Wednesday evening, during which senators were told that voting against the funding would be 'violent.'

M\u00fcller on abuse crisis and its link to homosexuality in priesthood November 21, 2018 (LifeSiteNews) \u2014 Cardinal Gerhard M\u00fcller, the former Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (2012-2017), has granted LifeSiteNews an interview in which he discusses in depth the problems of the current clerical sex abuse crisis. In this discussion about the abuse crisis, M\u00fcller does not shy away from pointing out that the Church needs to address the problem of practiced homosexuality in the ranks of the clergy, saying that 'homosexual conduct of clergymen can in no case be tolerated.' He states, however, that leaders in the Catholic Church still underestimate this problem. The prelate states: 'That McCarrick, together with his clan and a homosexual network, was able to wreak havoc in a mafia-like manner in the Church is connected with the underestimation of the moral depravity of homosexual acts among adults.' Cardinal M\u00fcller also challenges the Vatican for its lack of earnest investigations \u2014 early on \u2014 into the rumors concerning McCarrick, saying that a public apology is needed. He writes that 'there should very clearly come out a public explanation about these events and the personal connections, as well as the question as to how much the involved Church authorities knew at each step; such an explanation could very well include an admission of a wrong assessment of persons and situations.' Cardinal M\u00fcller criticizes as a 'disastrous error' the changes in Canon Law that have been made in the 1983 Code of Canon Law which, when dealing with priestly offenses against the Sixth Commandment, does not even mention homosexuality as an offense anymore, and which contains a less rigorous set of penalties against any abuser priests. Returning to the matter of the abuse crisis, the German prelate explains that in the Church, 'it is part of the crisis that one does not wish to see the true causes and covers them up with the help of propaganda phrases of the homosexual lobby. Fornication with teenagers and adults is a mortal sin which no power on earth can declare to be morally neutral.' He calls the 'LGBT' ideology within the Church 'atheistic,' and adds, in light of the recent Youth Synod in Rome, that the 'LGBT' term 'has no place in Church documents.' Moreover, Cardinal M\u00fcller, in light of his stricter handling of sex abuse cases at the CDF, wonders whether there was a homosexual lobby in the Vatican which was glad to see him being dismissed: 'But it could be so that it has pleased them that I am no longer tasked in the Congregation for the Doctrine to deal with sexual crimes especially also against male teenagers.' Discussing possible reasons for his sudden dismissal from the CDF \u2014 for which Pope Francis never gave him any reasons \u2014 Cardinal M\u00fcller comes back to his defense of Catholic doctrine on marriage with regard to Pope Francis' post-synodal exhortation Amoris Laetitia. He says: 'Amoris Laetitia has to be absolutely in accordance with Revelation, and it is not we who have to be in accord with Amoris Laetitia, at least not in the interpretation which contradicts, in a heretical manner, the Word of God. And it would be an abuse of power to discipline those who insist upon an orthodox interpretation of this encyclical and of all the papal magisterial documents.' The German cardinal recalls the correct role of the Pope as the guardian of the Faith when he says: 'The Magisterium of the bishops and of the Pope stand under the Word of God in Holy Scripture and Tradition and serves Him. It is not at all Catholic to say that the Pope as an individual person receives directly from the Holy Spirit the Revelation and that he may now interpret it according to his own whims while all the rest are to follow him blindly and mutely.'[201]  Fairy Tales Predicted Drag Queen Story Hour's Demonic Grooming Plan for Children[202] To fully understand the globalist threat, study ancient stories Using popular fairy tales and story archetypes, Alex Jones breaks down how adults have always warned children about abusive adults who want to corrupt their youthful innocence.[203]  France: PETA is at it Again: Rename 'Sausage Street'![204] There is a quaint little village in France, the town of Issigeac in Dordogne, that has been sent an official request from the animal rights group 'People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals' or PETA.

Why then do many who could help us \u2014 such as academics, intellectuals, even artists \u2014 frequently encumber their messages with nonsense? Wonderland may have been a mind-expanding experience for Alice but when she returned from her adventures she didn't start calling a spade a club. Analysts, journalists, artists and other professionals, who don't look at things as they are but pursue a 'message' that isn't there, are apt to invent curious substitutes for reality and engage in curious symbols and interpretations that in fact interfere with communication.[207] [ 1]: #336520 [ 2]: #336419 [ 3]: #336415 [ 4]: #336502 [ 5]: #336385 [ 6]: #336425 [ 7]: #336409 [ 8]: #336444 [

The authorities are treating the attack as an act of terrorism. The suspect, whose name is Chekatt Cherif, escaped from the scene, reportedly in a taxi. He is a born-and-bred Strasbourgian (Strasbourgeois?)</p><p>, and his motive is not known. In other news, President Donald Trump promised to shut down the government if Congress does not fund the wall on the southern border.

The no confidence letter count stood at 46 as recently as Tuesday morning. However, a few frustrated remainers joined with their Brexiteer peers to push the total over the top. What's worse, the gesture of contempt comes as May is out of the country on a 'whistlestop' our of European capitals in a desperate bid to achieve 'assurances' on the Irish backstop that multiple EU leaders have said they wouldn't be willing to give.[65]  Enviros Are Starting to Realize a Carbon Tax Won't Ever Happen[66] Carbon fees were once considered an obvious next step in the country's multifaceted effort to reduce CO2 emissions. Congresswoman-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a rising star on the left, believes a carbon tax can be one part of her sweeping 'Green New Deal.' Some conservatives have signed on to the idea, believing it to be a market-based approach to eliminating pollution. Even a number of major energy companies have come forward in support of charging businesses for the amount of carbon they release into the atmosphere. However, carbon tax proposals have proven unsuccessful time and time again. [One of them] was put to the test in Washington state during the 2018 midterm elections. Despite the state's Democratic lean and the governor's public backing, the measure was soundly rejected in November. It was the second time voters in the state had rejected a carbon fee. Events across the Atlantic have only worsened prospects for carbon tax supporters. In the face of unprecedented protests, the French government has decided to suspend a planned gas tax. President Emmanuel Macron had originally proposed a slew of new carbon taxes intended to wean consumers off fossil fuels and transition to electric vehicles. The price hikes, however, triggered a wave of intense riots. The protests, which have lasted for weeks, have even become deadly. One man was caught on video over the weekend losing his hand to a grenade explosion[67]  Graham on Uranium One, Unverified Dossier: Special Counsel Should Probe 'All Things' Clinton[68] Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) \u2014 who is the likely choice to become chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said on Monday that a special counsel should have been established to look into 'all things Clinton,' in response to a question by Fox News's Sean Hannity about the Uranium One deal \u2014 and that he will investigate the unverified Dossier which was used in a FISA spy warrant application.[69]  Illinois Women's Studies Dept: Abolish ICE and Police[70] An Illinois Gender ...men's Studies department endorsed a call for the abolition of both ICE and the police. The University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign's (UIUC) Gender ...men's Studies department sharedthis demand from a nine-point platform created by the National Trans Youth Council's nine-point platform, prefacing the Facebook post with 'something to believe in.'[71]  Man Whose House Was Blown up and Shot by Police Seeks $120 Million in Damages[72] The man who police shot after blowing up his Dixmont house is seeking $120 million from the law enforcement agencies and officers involved in the 20-hour June standoff that preceded the explosion and shooting. In a notice of claim sent Monday to the Maine State Police and other law enforcement agencies, attorneys for 62-year-old Michael Grendell requested $20 million in compensatory damages for the loss of his house and injuries, and $100 million in punitive damages. The June 29 incident on Fox Lane in Dixmont was the first time police in Maine detonated explosives using a robot to end a standoff. Grendell was in the midst of a mental health crisis June 28 when a neighbor called police to report that Grendell had shot at him the previous day. The neighbor, Lee Bell, told police he waited to notify them because he was worried about Grendell's safety. Col. John Cote, chief of the Maine State Police, said that officers shot Grendell after the 20-hour standoff when they drew him out of the house by detonating an explosive and Grendell continued walking toward them with a firearm[73]  Mark Levin: A Time for Truth Regarding President Trump, Campaign Finance Laws and Indictment Hysteria[74] 1. A sitting president cannot be indicted. That's official DOJ policy since 1973. Neither the Special Counsel nor the Southern District of New York (SDNY) nor Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein can defy that 45-year-old policy. 2. The SDNY is not expert in campaign finance violations and neither is the Clinton-appointed district judge. They rarely handle campaign finance cases. The left-wing media and politicians are regurgitating what the prosecutors have merely filed in their own self-serving brief. The media and others intentionally refuse to look at the actual rules and context. They refuse to even question what these prosecutors have thrown together. 3. The actual campaign rules and context do not include Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) or an infinite variety of other contracts, payments, arrangements, acts of a private nature, etc. as campaign contributions. These represent normal human behavior and were never intended to be regulated or reported. SDNY is dead wrong. And these private payments can be made in any manner or any amount. Again, they're private payments involving private matters. To underscore, there is no reporting requirement because they're not campaign payments made with or without campaign funds. 4. SDNY inclusion of these charges in the Cohen plea deal was a sleazy political and PR attack against the president by an office coordinating with Mueller and aligned with Comey. SDNY knew Cohen would plead. It therefore knew its absurd allegations would not be tested in any courtroom \u2014 district, circuit or Supreme Court. If they were tested, SDNY would be hammered like a nail. But it knew the left-wing media and politicians would use the mere over-the-top allegations from its office, with absolutely nothing more, to claim the president committed campaign felonies. No due process. No assumption of innocence.[] [NOTE: Read it all. A succinct summary of kangaroo-court-tactics by tyrants][75]  Ohio Man's ISIS-Inspired Jihad to Kill Rabbi, Target Synagogue Foiled, Feds Say[76] He flirted with martyrdom from the safe confines behind a computer screen, claiming he was on a mission to complete a 'virtual jihad.' Then the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting happened. Damon Joseph, 21, of Holland, Ohio, was arrested on Friday by members of the Joint Terrorism Task after allegedly planning to commit jihad by targeting a Toledo, Ohio, synagogue and slay a rabbi and potentially others with AR-15 style rifles, authorities said. If convicted, Joseph could face up to 20 years in prison for attempting to provide material support to ISIS. The bust of the alleged ISIS-inspired terrorist dovetailed with the arrest and charging of Toledo woman Elizabeth Lecron, 23, who was hit with bomb-making charges for her desire to attack a farm 'that raises pigs or cows.'[77]  Plot to Blow up Aventura Synagogue Ends With Man's Arrest[78] A Hollywood man accused of trying to blow up an Aventura synagogue stood in Miami federal court on Monday and gave the judge two names \u2014 one real, the other an alias. 'My name is James Medina, also known as 'James Muhammad,' ' Medina told Magistrate Judge William Turnoff. James G. Medina, 40, was arrested by federal agents on a charge of attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction against the Aventura Turnberry Jewish Center, 20400 NE 30th Ave., during services on Friday. The actual bomb \u2014 sold to him in Hallandale Beach by an FBI undercover operative just before the planned terror attack \u2014 was a dummy, authorities said.[79][80]  Stormy Daniels Ordered to Pay Trump $293,000 in Legal Fees and Sanctions[81] Finally some good news for the president on the legal front. Stephanie Clifford, the porn star better known as Stormy Daniels, was ordered to pay $293,000 in attorney fees and sanctions to Donald Trump, also known as David Dennison, after she unsuccessfully sued the president for defamation.[82]  Sundar Pichai Lies to Congress About Google Tracking Location of Users[83] Google CEO Sundar Pichai lied to Congress during testimony today when he claimed that users could opt out of Google's location tracking services, a claim that the Associated Press previously found to be false. During his appearance in front of the the House Judiciary committee for a hearing entitled: Transparency ...countability: Examining Google and its Data Collection, Use and Filtering Practices, Pichai claimed that users had control of what information Google stored about them.[84]  Jordan Peterson: The Gender Scandal \u2014 in Scandinavia and Canada[85] In this occasional series, Jordan Peterson writes from his international speaking tour for his book, 12 Rules for Life, where he's speaking to sold out crowds throughout North America, Europe and Australia.[86]  4 Dead, 12 Wounded in Strasbourg 'Terrorist Attack'; Shooter Reportedly Fled Scene in Taxi[87] Update 4: Things are only getting stranger as the suspect in Tuesday's shooting at a Christmas market in Strasbourg remains at large. FranceInfo is reporting that the injured suspect made his getaway in a taxi that he robbed, which could explain why police have had such a hard time finding him. Offering the first official confirmation in hours, Strasbourg's mayor has confirmed that four were killed and 12 wounded in Tuesday's attack.[88]  Bureaucrat Nominated to be Next EU Chief: Uniting Europe With Africa 'Matter of Destiny'[89] Named as the centre-left's candidate for the next EU Commission President, Frans Timmermans announced he would crush conservative governments in Europe, insisting that the continent uniting with Africa is 'a matter of destiny'. Timmermans, who currently sits as the Commission's first vice-president, was nominatedto lead the Party of European Socialists (PES) in next May's elections by delegates at the EU Parliament grouping's annual congress in Lisbon on Saturday.[90]  EU Budget Rules Should Apply to France Too \u2014 Says Di Maio[91] Deputy premier says Macron's new measures will raise deficit (ANSA) \u2014 Rome, December 11 \u2014 Deputy Premier and Labour and Industry Minister Luigi Di Maio suggested on Tuesday that the European Commission should worry about France's budget plans not just Italy's. He was commenting after French President Emmanuel Macron announced a series of measures to alleviate hardship following the recent wave of violent protests. 'According to our calculations, the measures do not comply with the deficit-to-GDP ratio that has been given,' 5-Star Movement (M5S) leader Di Maio said after a meeting with business representatives. 'So it will have to increase the deficit and a case about France will open up too, if the rules are valid for everyone. 'We are not hopeful,' he added. Di Maio reiterated that the M5S's key election pledge, the 'citizenship wage' basic income for job seekers, will start 'at the end of March at the latest'. He said the 'quota 100' pension reform to effectively bring down the retirement age will come into force in February or March.[92]  EU Intensifies Preparation for Clean Brexit After Rejecting Renegotiations, Commons Vote Delay[93] Brussels bureaucrats have rejected suggestions that the withdrawal agreement with the UK can be renegotiated, while the European Union ramps up preparation for a clean Brexit. Prime Minister Theresa May is due to meet with European leaders and EU officials Tuesday to seek 'further reassurances' over the controversial Irish backstop after she postponed the House of Commons vote on the withdrawal agreement in face of certain defeat.[94]  European Court of Human Rights Blasphemy Laws: Where a Word Out of Place Can Cost Your Life[95] There are, of course, social settings where it pays to watch your words. Saying you fancy the looks of a mafioso's new girlfriend could well prove fatal. Spending time with a bunch of Hamas terrorists while expressing your love for Israel might not lead to your premature demise. In London today, young men who make remarks or play music to other youths on the street can wind up stabbed to death. A recent comment on The Independent website claims, 'In this country [the UK], some views, regardless of how valid and logical, can result in anything from public rebuke to loss of a job to violence.' For the most part, we learn how to avoid words or actions that may offend someone or some group, especially if it is known to be prone to violence. Yet these misfortunes are rare and we live our lives on the assumption that in democratic countries, we can speak freely within the norms of civil society. We recognize that in many countries, racist, homophobic, antisemitic, or 'Islamophobic' hate speech can be reported to the police and lead to the arrest and eventual trial of the speaker. The United States' First Amendment to its Constitution protects its citizens from prosecution for free speech, except where there is a credible threat of 'Imminent lawless action.'[96]  France: Who's Not Protesting Against Macron? Clashes at Hundreds of Schools During Student Protests[97] The protests to Macron's government continue with, according to figures gathered by Reuters, 450 schools in France holding demonstrations on 'Black Tuesday'. The education minister has stated that 60 high schools had to be completely shut down.[98]  Hungary Wants That Christmas Remains Christmas With a Nativity Scene and a Christmas Tree \u2014 Foreign Minister[99] Hungary wants to preserve an EU where Christmas remains Christmas, with a nativity scene and a Christmas tree, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said on Monday. According to Szijjarto, Europe must insist on its traditions and heritage and resist all attempts to irrevocably change the ethnic mix of the European Union.[100]  Italy's Giuseppe Conte: We Are 'Proud to Call Ourselves Populists'[101] 'If populism means giving sovereignty back to the people, we are proud to call ourselves populists,' Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said in an address to the Italian Parliament Tuesday. The prime minister's words came in preparation for a meeting of the Council of the European Union (E.U.) and the Euro Summit, which will take place in Brussels later this week to discuss the E.U. budget and the migration question, among other things.[102]  Leftist TV Channel Can't Deal With Rise of the Right and Starts Hunting Down VOX Voters in Spain[103] The right-wing VOX Party, which just last week had a historic election result in Spain's most socialist region, Andalusia, is considering whether to press charges against leftist TV Channel La Sexta, which was created in 2005 under socialist President Zapatero. The problem started when during a regular program a La Sexta channel reporter was sent to search out who were the 44 VOX voters in a small and famously far left small town near Seville called Marinaleda, whose mayor, Jos Manuel Sanchez Gordillo, has been caught stealing from supermarkets to 'distribute to the poor'.[104]  Media Cover Up: Middle Eastern Men Groom and Rape Girls as Young as 10 in Finland[105] Earlier Voice of Europe reported on the rape of a young girl by several migrant men. Unfortunately this is not an isolated case, as more young girls are groomed and abused by asylum seekers from the Middle East and Africa.[106]  More Britons in Work, Wages Grow at Highest Rate for a Decade[107] More Britons are in paid work and wages have grown at their highest rate in a decade, according to government figures. The Officer for National Statistics (ONS) December labour market report released Tuesday shows that 32.48 million Britons are in paid work for the period of August to October 2018, 79,000 more than the previous quarter (May to July) and 396,000 more than a year earlier.[108]  Paris Saw More Damage in Latest Protests Than Previous Weeks[109] The property damage in Paris was even greater during 'Act IV' of the Gilets Jaunes (Yellow Vests) protests, despite there being fewer injuries and more arrests than the previous week. The 'Act IV' Yellow Vest protests saw the largest mobilisation of French police in years and saw well over one thousand arrested.

According to witnesses the shots began around 8pm near the Christmas market.[114]  Strasbourg Christmas Market Shooting: Three Dead, 12 Injured[115] Three were killed and 12 injured in a shooting in the vicinity of the Christmas Market in the historic French city of Strasbourg Tuesday evening. A 'major public safety event' was underway Tuesday evening, according to the French ministry of the interior, after shots were fired in Strasbourg, the French city which serves as one of the two homes of the European Parliament. The ministry instructed local residents to stay in their homes. France's interior minister Christophe Castaner says a gunman 'sowed terror' in three parts of the eastern city of Strasbourg with a shooting spree that killed three people and left six others with serious injuries, according to the Associated Press. Earlier police union officials had said four people were killed. Officials did not explain the reason for the conflicting death tolls. Castaner said early Wednesday that some 350 security officers and two helicopters are involved in the search for the assailant after the Tuesday night attack.

The 45-year-old burglar broke into a flat in Malm\u00f6. He was confronted by the family who lives there, whereupon he grabbed one of the children, a 7-year-old. He then allegedly put his gun in the boy's mouth.[118]  The Guardian, Tommy Robinson, And Me[119] by Bruce Bawer Britain's top rag uncovers a nonexisent 'global network' On Friday, Britain's most important, or rather self-important, newspaper ran a piece headlined 'Revealed: the hidden global network behind Tommy Robinson.' Move over, Pentagon Papers. Obviously, the Guardian reporters in question \u2014 Josh Halliday, Lois Beckett, and Caelainn Barr \u2014 have stumbled upon that obscure and highly sophisticated research tool known as Google. And through Google, they've uncovered the sensational, previously unnoticed fact that two 'US thinktankshave published a succession of articles in support of Robinson,' while a third U.S. think tank has \u2014 gasp! \u2014 helped pay for Tommy's legal fees. These three think tanks, the Guardian scribes assert, 'have been repeatedly accused of stoking anti-Islam sentiment in the west and spreading false information about Muslim refugees in Europe.' (Among the institutions that have been in the forefront of making these baseless accusations, unsurprisingly, is the Guardian itself.) The Guardian writers further contend that Tommy's support from these 'prominent and well-financed groups undermines Robinson's self-styled image of a far-right populist underdog whose anti-Islam agenda is being silenced by the British establishment.' Hold on a second and take a look at that last sentence. Has Tommy really sought to style an image for himself as a 'far-right' activist? Who on earth would do that? Or has he constantly denied, quite correctly, that there's anything 'far-right' about him? This is journalism at its shabbiest. As for his being 'silenced by the British establishment' \u2014 no, he hasn't exactly been silenced. This Guardian article itself is a perfect illustration of the fact that he has, rather, been smeared, maligned, defamed, vilified, calumniated, misquoted, misinterpreted, and misrepresented by that establishment. Consistently.

I've benefited from MEF's principled largesse myself more than once, when my outspokenness about Islam has landed me in legal or financial quandaries. As an American, I'm extremely proud that the MEF, based in Philadelphia and run by the estimable Daniel Pipes, has stepped in to cover Tommy's expenses. As a lifelong Anglophile, I find it depressing that in the entire U.K., no individual or organization seems to have been willing to do the same.[] [Read it all!

[130]  Iran Arrests More Than 100 Christians in Growing Crackdown on Minority[131] Iran has arrested more than 100 Christians in the last week, charities report, amid a growing crackdown by the Islamic Republic. Many of the 114 detained were converts to Christianity from a Muslim background, accused of 'proselytising'. They had to report the history of their Christian activities and were told to cut contact with any Christian groups, according to Open Doors UK, a charity which speaks out on persecution against Christians. While Christianity has existed in Persia since Christ's death, many believers fled after the Shah was deposed in a coup and Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini was installed in the Islamic revolution of 1979. There are no official records, but there are estimated to be some 350,000 remaining in Iran \u2014 some one per cent of Iran's population, with a rising trend toward converting to Christianity[132]  Neo-Feudalism Reconsidered: The Political Economy of a Zombie Nation[133] by Vladislav Inozemtsev [] From the outside, what is going on within Russia's political economy is describable as kleptocracy, and insofar as Russia shows its face to the West, that label is apt enough. But it falls vastly short of capturing the reality of the situation, which manifests itself in ways that, for most Westerners, are simply incomprehensible. As Russia continues its process of de-modernization\u2014or perhaps its escape from modernity\u2014two trends are equally important for understanding the country's future. One is the ongoing stratification of current Russian society into those who are considered gosudarevy lyudi (Czar's men) and those who are counted as kholopy. This is not the kind of income inequality that has been intensively analyzed as the crucial problem endangering the stability of Russian society; rather, it is a status inequality, with not bourgeois but distinctly feudal roots. Contemporary Russian society has become a complicated system where legal norms are not so much neglected as entirely irrelevant if the parties to any dispute belong to different social strata. [] This stratification has also become the fundamental pillar of a new system of social management, which nurtures not so much totalitarian attitudes on the upper level but omnipresent servility attitudes on the 'lower' one, making Russian society hopelessly un-modern. [] The second trend is a rather new phenomenon: the institutionalization of massive property under the control of local bureaucrats, which is distinctly different from the construction of nationwide 'oligarchic' empires in the 1990s. Property in Russia is now divided into that of 'national' importance (which, even if formally private, can be nationalized at any given moment) and 'regionalized' property, which in large part belongs to the regional administrators who constitute the new feudal class. This situation doesn't resemble the feudal disunity of Europe in the early Middle Ages, bit is much more akin to the 17th and 18th-century versions of feudalism, with the provincial aristocracy perfectly controlled from the top, the local lords exercising authority vested in them by the supreme leader. Therefore, the system is solid and durable, able to withstand both outside pressure and deep isolationism\u2014so long as the goal remains control and not development. How long can the new Russian feudalism survive? It will likely take decades to exhaust itself. Like any other classic feudal country, 19th-century Russia was a productive society that may not have been competitive with its neighbors, but had no alternative to encouraging population growth, implementing new production techniques, and establishing balances between different social classes. By contrast, contemporary Russia is a rentier economy with about two-thirds of its exports consisting of energy and commodities produced by less than 3 percent of its active population. In such conditions the ruling elite will never experience enough pressure from below to force significant changes to the system. The best the Western world can do is to await the exodus of those who feel themselves people of the 21st rather than the 16th century. Exodus from Russia will eventually ruin the system: Unlike the omnipresent feudalism of old, after all, the new version is contained only within one particular country [RTWT.

After all, public institutions are legally bound by the First Amendment, and the vast majority of private colleges and universities promise their students commensurate free speech rights. In spite of this legal landscape, far too many colleges across the country fail to live up to their free speech obligations in policy and in practice. Often, this occurs through the implementation of speech codes: university policies that restrict expression that is protected under First Amendment standards. For this report, FIRE surveyed the written policies of 466 colleges and universities, evaluating their compliance with First Amendment standards. Overall, 28.5% of surveyed colleges maintain at least one severely restrictive policy that earns FIRE's worst, 'red light' rating, meaning that it both clearly and substantially restricts protected speech. This is the eleventh year in a row that the percentage of schools earning a red light has gone down; last year, 32.3% of schools earned a red light rating.[176]  Students Demand Comedian Sign 'Safe Space' Contract Ahead of Charity Event[177] A student club at the University of London is requiring that all comedians sign a 'behavioral agreement' as a condition of performing at a January comedy night.

Hundreds of police officers and soldiers are searching for Mr. Chekatt in France and Germany. The gunman is alleged by eyewitnesses to have shouted 'Allahu Akhbar' during his murderous spree. He had been arrested 27 times in the past for crimes in France, Switzerland, and other countries. The motive for his rampage is still unknown. </p><p>In other news, a 17-year-old Afghan culture-enricher was arrested while trying to flee Austria after he allegedly murdered a 16-year-old Austrian girl.

Senators agreed to begin debate on the measure despite only 11 of the chamber's 51 Republicans joining with all Democrats to support it. The legislation would require Trump to withdraw any troops in or 'affecting' Yemen within 30 days; the president has threatened to veto the bill if it reaches his desk.[40]  New App Posing Huge Threat to Twitter Sees Thousands Looking for Free Speech Haven to Sign up Almost Overnight[41] Twitter users seem to be fed up with the consistent threat of being suspended or worse for stepping out of line against the wrong person while the right people get a complete pass. Migrations have already begun to various platforms, but it would appear one is standing out. According to the Daily Caller, an App called 'Parler News' has seen a surge in users in such a short amount of time, the majority of them looking for free speech alternatives to the oppressive Twitter trust and safety nightmare: While the platform itself has existed for three months, buzz about the app on Twitter earlier this week prompted thousands of conservatives to download the previously little-known app overnight. These new users include figures like Turning Point USA Communications Director Candace Owens, whose Twitter account was suspended and then reinstated in August after she sent out tweets meant to showcase the anti-white racism of New York Times editorial board member Sarah Jeong, and conservative activist Laura Loomer, who late last month chained herself to Twitter's front door to protest her own permanent ban from the site. Continuing growth throughout the week has bumped the app to the seventh most popular news app in the iOS App Store, ahead of The New York Times, Google News, ABC, CNBC, NPR, and The Wall Street Journal apps. Android users can find Parler in the Google Play Store as well. Those who prefer a web-based desktop version can expect one soon, says Matze. This less than good news for Twitter, whom many thought was too big to fail. According to Parler News CEO John Matze, however, Twitter's hubris will be its downfall. 'Alternative platforms will rise and those who are bold will switch,' said Matze in a post. 'Big tech is not too big to topple, in fact, they are blinded by their size/power and are hurting themselves by ideologically targeting groups.' Many names have already made their way there, including TPUSA's Candace Owens, the NRA, Paul Joseph Watson, and Laura Loomer. Whether the migration trend will continue to make Twitter shake in its boots is yet to be seen. Parler is still not as integrated into the very internet like Twitter is, and it's not a household name. However, Twitter is only pushing more and more people off its platform, and Parler is going to catch them. Perhaps it will happen enough to the point where Twitter starts to get worried.[42]  The Administrative State May be Facing an Effective Death Sentence[43] One of the great tragedies inflicted upon this nation by its first Socialist president, Franklin Roosevelt, was the creation of the apparatus of the administrative state. Under his administration, executive agencies were not only allowed to decide how to enforce laws passed by the Congress, they actually got into the lawmaking business via the creation of a web of federal regulations that governs most facets of our lives. This graph shows the explosion of federal regulations since the Federal Register was first published in 1938. Shortly the Supreme Court will hear a case called Kisor v. Wilkie which may bring this travesty to an end. This synopsis from Wikipedia shows how the administrative state works: James Kisor is a veteran Marine from the Vietnam War, and had been a participant in Operation Harvest Moon. In 1982, stating that he had developed posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) from his service, Kisor sought disability benefits from the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). On review, the VA disagreed he has PTSD, and denied him disability benefits. Kisor appealed that decision in 2006, this time with additional documentation that was not available in 1982, including his service record. The VA granted benefits with this information, but with a start date of 2006 rather than 1982. [] [] Why did the VA act this way? Well, because they knew they could. And because they had no institutional interest in paying Mr. Kisor back-benefits for the nearly quarter century that he'd been requesting them. And, because, we can probably be sure that by this time Kisor had became a boil on the collective derriere of a lot of VA officials and they had decided '[to heck with] this guy, we make the rules.' There are major federal rules created by the rule-making process and there are internal agency rules on how to implement rules they have created. This leads to an interesting process in which agencies create rules, rules that can deprive you of liberty and property, without any public input and the courts are required to let agencies interpret those rules as the damned well please so long as they don't go against the actual text of a rule. The fact that the Supreme Court is probably going to rule in Kisor's favor and overturn two precedents, Auer and Seminole Rock, has caused a lot of concern among the cheerleaders of the regulatory state. If Kisor prevails, the process of agencies writing regulations regulating regulations will be dead. In order to administer regulations, agencies will have to engage in the rule-making process which will discourage a lot of nonsense. Then the fight can focus on making federal regulations no more deserving of deference than federal law.

He says in the aftermath of that 'sinister' killing, 'we reaffirmed our solemn duty to confront anti-Semitism everywhere. Trump added that we 'must stamp out this vile hatred from the world.'[][46]  Footprints in History Aren't Made Sitting Down[47] We are proud to share with you this speech by Valerie Price, our National Director for ACT for Canada. ACT for America has helped start sister organizations in 16 countries around the world, including Canada. She spoke to over one thousand people standing outside Parliament Hill in -17 degree weather! It was so cold her hands were too cold to even turn the pages of her speech. Valerie's speech was in opposition to the globalist UN Global Compact. This is dedication and patriotism in action and should serve as an inspiration to all freedom loving patriots to stand up and take action. Please take a couple of minutes to watch this short video of her speech[48]  Anyone Celebrating France's Terror Attack Will be Immediately Arrested \u2014 Italian Minister[49] Italian Deputy Prime Minister, and as many have seen defender of all things Italian, Matteo Salvini issues a strong warning to any who have considered 'rejoicing' at the Strasbourg attack. Promising arrest of any who would consider celebrating the deaths of innocent people attending the Christmas market in France. 'Our postal police [service] is at the cutting edge and it is sifting the Web to find the heinous people who are celebrating someone else's death,' ANSA quotes Salvini, he vows 'immediate arrest for anyone who has been rejoicing online over the last few hours.'[50]  Czech Politicians Want to Ban Islam Completely as it 'Colonises Society'[51] Political leaders in Czech Republic have previously condemned Islam in strong terms. Now, politicians in the Czech Parliament are discussing the complete ban of the religion. If someone calls for the killing of infidels and Jews, then it is not a religion of peace, saysMP Jiri Kobza.[52]  France: A Revolt Against Europe's Elites?[53] For years, those of us who write and worry about the rise of Islam in Western Europe have known that eventually, if the governments of these countries did not change course dramatically, something had to give. So far, the natives had, for the most part, been remarkably tame. They had swallowed a lot. Their leaders had filled their countries with huge numbers of immigrants from the Middle East and North Africa, a disproportionate number of whom were making it clear that they had no intention of fully joining or contributing to their host societies but, rather, were content to take, to harm, to damage, and to destroy, and were determined, in the long run, to conquer and rule.[54]  German Father Not Allowed to Swim With His Daughter Because of Muslim Women[55] Tim F. enjoys taking part in activities with his daughter and he has been welcomed everywhere but not in the swimming pool during swimming lessons.

The article is mocked on social media because Christmas time usually means warnings about forgotten Advent candles.[60]  Majority of French Reject Macron's Offers, Want More Yellow Vest Protests[61] A poll has revealed the majority of French do not think the new policies unveiled by French President Emmanuel Macron this week are enough and say they want the Gilets Jaunes (Yellow Vests) protests to continue. The data, released by polling firm Odoxa, shows that 59 per cent of French are not convinced by the measures to quell the Yellow Vest protests announced by President Macron earlier this week which included a 100 euro raise in the minimum wage and several tax breaks, Le Figaro reports.[62]  'Still at Large' \u2014 Strasbourg Shooting Suspect Convicted 27 Times Before, Yelled 'Allahu Akbar'[63] French police have detained five people in connection with Tuesday's deadly attack on a popular Christmas Market in the French city of Strasbourg \u2014 which unfolded only a few blocks away from the European Parliament. However, the shooter, who was reportedly wounded in the attack before commandeering a taxi to make his escape, remains at large, and French authorities worry that he may have fled to neighboring Germany, according to the Financial Times.[64]  Strasbourg: Italian Victim in Coma, Can't be Operated on[65] Bullet position makes surgery impossible says girlfriend's dad (ANSA) \u2014 Rome, December 12 \u2014 Antonio Megalizzi, the Italian who is among the people shot in Tuesday's terrorist attack in Strasbourg, is in a coma and cannot undergo surgery, the father of the young reporter's girlfriend said on Wednesday.

He said he had this information from the family, who are already at the hospital.[66]  Strasbourg Shooting: Police Appeal to Find Chrif Chekatt[67] French police have issued a call for help to find the man suspected of opening fire near a Christmas market in Strasbourg.

The gunman shouted 'Allahu Akbar' ('God is greatest') as he opened fire.[68]  UK: Muslim Council Leader Upset at Media for Accurately Reporting on Islamic Terror Attack[69] A spokesperson for the Muslim Council of Britain expressed his 'disappointment' at the media today for accurately reporting that the Islamic terrorist who killed 3 people and injured a dozen more in Strasbourg shouted 'Allahu Akbar' during the attack. 'Disappointing to see BBC and Sky News lead with 'Allahu Akbar' in their headline on the awful shooting in #Strasbourg vs. ITV and Al Jazeera who are being far more responsible,' tweeted Miqdaad Versi, adding, 'This matters and it's wrong.'[70]  UK: Theresa May Survives Confidence Vote of Tory MPs[71] Prime Minister Theresa May has won a vote of confidence in her leadership of the Conservative Party by 200 to 117. After securing 63% of the total vote, she is now immune from a leadership challenge for a year.[72]  U.S. Bishops Applaud 'Iraq and Syria Genocide Relief and Accountability Act'[73] The United States Bishops have praised new legislation that will direct humanitarian relief to genocide victims in Iraq and Syria and hold Islamic State militants accountable for their crimes. 'Today is a signal of hope for the critically vulnerable of this region,' said Archbishop Timothy P. Broglio, Chairman of the U.S. Bishops' Committee on International Justice and Peace, who also thanked the bill's sponsors Reps. Chris Smith (R-NJ) and Anna Eshoo (D-CA), as well as President Donald Trump who signed the bill into law Tuesday.[74]  China Involved in 90 Percent of Espionage and Industrial Secrets Theft, Department of Justice Reveals[75] China was involved in 90 percent of all economic espionage cases handled by the Department of Justice over the last seven years, according to a report submitted Wednesday to the Senate Intelligence Committee.

After more than three days of deliberations, the court handed down a guilty verdictTuesday by a unanimous consent of the jury. If the verdict is confirmed, it will be the highest-ranking condemnation of a Church official for a crime of sexual abuse.[80]  'I Swear by Allah's Name We Will Die Today': Engineer Who Was Jailed for Bashing His First Wife Admits to Hitting His Second Wife With a Metal Object After Her Centrelink Payments Were Refused[81] A Muslim engineer with a shocking history of violence against his first wife has admitted to choking his second bride with an electrical cord.[82]  The Photo That Brought Down a Feared Drug Cartel: How a Google Maps Image Helped Police Jail a Meth Queen and Her Deadly Hitman Over Two Grisly Murders[83] Police informants told detectives Thi Kim Lien Do and her boyfriend Son Hanh Nguyen had been brutally murdered inside a rented home in Canley Vale. The tip-off led to a remarkable discovery.[84]  Milton Friedman's Brazil Moment: Band of Disciples Takes Charge[85] Paulo Guedes, the man tasked with fixing Brazil's economy, likes to remind everyone that he's a University of Chicago man. In interviews, he gushes at every opportunity about his days studying there under Milton Friedman. 'Nobody had better training than me,' he proclaimed earlier this year. And if the message weren't clear enough, Brazil's incoming economy minister is now proceeding to hand out one key post in his team after another to fellow Chicago grads: Joaquim Levy to run one state-run bank, Rubem Novaes to head another and Roberto Castello Branco to manage oil giant Petrobras. Two more alums, he said, will be made special envoys to key trading partners. [Comment: Brazil will improve.][86]  Religious Freedom Commission Slams Draft of New Cuban Constitution[87] The U.S. Commission on International Freedom (USCIRF) has sharply criticized a proposed draft for Cuba's new constitution for its removal of key references to religious liberty and freedom of conscience. This February, Cubans will vote on the new constitution through a public referendum and the Constitutional Commission is currently reviewing proposals for changes and is expected to submit a revised draft constitution to the National Assembly for approval in January.[88]  'Spying ...reats': Assange Complains of 'More Subtle' Silencing Than Khashoggi[89] Julian Assange has accused his Ecuadorean hosts of spying and feeding information to US authorities, and slammed attempts to block his journalistic work as a more subtle way of silencing than the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. Suggesting there were 'facts of espionage' inside the embassy, the WikiLeaks co-founder expressed concern during a hearing in Quito on Wednesday that Ecuadorean intelligence is not only spying on him, but sharing the data it has harvested with the FBI. Ecuadorean intelligence clearly spent a sizable amount of money equipping the embassy for surveillance, Assange added.[90]  Afghan Migrant Arrested After Trying to Flee Country Following Murder of Austrian Teen[91] A 17-year-old Afghan migrant has been arrested in connection to the murder of a 16-year-old Austrian girl after he attempted to buy a forged passport and flee the country.

These fears are now used by opponents of the pact to disseminate false information.'[94]  Australia: 'We Don't Want to be Pulling Bodies Out of the Water Again': Border Chief's Chilling Warning After Labor MPs Push to Give Permanent Residency to 10,000 Illegal Asylum Seekers[95] People smugglers will be closely watching Australia's political debate over border protection for cues to restart the trade, the outgoing head of Operation Sovereign Borders has warned.[96]  Australia: Family of Iranian Refugees is Handed $100,000 Because They Were 'Mistreated in Detention'[97] A family of refugees have been awarded $100,000 of taxpayers money after a court ruled they were 'mistreated'.[98]  Father of Swedish Terror Victim Attacked by Migrant Who Vandalised Her Grave \u2014 Police Do Nothing[99] The illegal migrant who almost daily violates 11-year-old Ebba kerlund's grave attacked Ebba's father, Stefan, last night. 'When I called the police no one came,' the father writes on Facebook: 'This gets sicker and sicker. When I visited my beloved daughter's grave tonight he was there, and he was extremely threatening. He looked even more terrifying with one eye missing. Given that he has previously pulled a knife on the verger, I suspect he's capable of anything.'[100]  Migrant Transport NGO Announces Plans for New Vessel to Resume Operations in 2019[101] Only days after ending migrant transport operations, NGO SOS Mditerrane has announced they will be replacing their current vessel with a new one to resume operations in the New Year.

Austria notably does not deport people facing a death sentence in another country. The 17-year-old suspect, who, according to local media, was brought into the Western country in the spring of 2016 by human traffickers, handed himself over to Vienna police yesterday after reportedly escaping through the window from his girlfriend Michelle's bedroom, where she was found lying lifeless, having sustained two deadly stabs in the back, an autopsy revealed.[104]  UK Commitment to UN Migration Pact 'All But Violates' Govt Immigration Pledge: Think Tank[105] A leading immigration think tank has said that the United Kingdom's adoption of the UN's migration pact 'all but violates' the government's pledge to cut immigration. On Monday, the UK and 163 other nations committed themselves to the United Nations' Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration \u2014 the first attempt at the 'global governance' and institutionalisation of migration.[106]  UN Migrant Conference Delegate: Previous Immigrants 'Brought Pizza' To Sweden\u2014 So Migration Isn't All 'Negative'[107] The United Nations are meeting in Marrakech, Morocco sign the Global Compact for Migration and we're here to speak with delegates and cover the facts on the ground. That is, we're covering the facts from the outside because the United Nations is so threatened by The Rebel that my camera guy and I have been kicked from the compound. But we don't give up easily, and I was able to get some on-camera interviews with delegates to the convention from both Macedonia and Sweden to get their opinion on whether migration is a human right, and why a country would want to sign this agreement at all.[108]  Where's Democracy? Brussels Bars Large Demonstration Against UN Migration Pact[109] A planned march against the UN Migration Pact in Brussels has been barred by the city's mayor and the region's Prime Minister, Belgian newspaper HLN reports. 'We cannot allow a 'brown march' in Brussels,' mayor Phillippe Close and regional Prime Minister Rudi Vervoort say.[110]  Catholic World Youth Day to Focus on Immigration, Environment, Women[111] In keeping with the priorities of Pope Francis, World Youth Day 2019 will focus on immigration, the environment, and the role of women in the Church, according to event organizers.

And that's saying something. Right off the bat, in a preface titled 'An Insidious Abuse of Power,' Jarrett launches on the beginning of a very detailed, decidedly specific recounting of the cunning game played by powerful government elites determined to stop the election of Donald Trump \u2014 and when that failed, to undermine his presidency with the goal of abruptly ending it. The story is chilling. Among other things Jarrett writes lines like these: * 'This is what abuse of power looks like.' * 'Armed with immense power, Comey and other top officials at the FBI became the law unto themselves. The end would justify the means' * For 'reporters and anchorstheir bias against Trump was so impassioned and pervasive that it became impervious to the facts.' * Fired FBI Director James Comey 'admitted pilfering government memorandums for the sole purpose of triggering a special counsel who just happened to be his longtime friend and ally, Robert Mueller.' * 'the FBI, as well as the Department of Justice, had become cesspools of corruption that played a direct hand in attempting to influence the election and subvert the democratic process.' [] The very first sentence of the first chapter is short and directly to the point: 'This is a story of corruption.' Indeed it is, and what a stunning story it is. As Jarrett says, this is a 'cautionary annal of the damage wrought when those who serve in government seek to undermine it.' And but of course the story begins with shocker I know Hillary Clinton. The Clinton part of this tale is told in pointed detail. Gregg Jarrett is, among other things, a lawyer. Thus his recounting of what the new Secretary of State did in terms of playing a game with her infamous emails is matched with the exact cit[ations] of which federal laws were being so brazenly violated. He points out, for example, that when 'a government official creates or obtains a record during the course and scope of his or her employment, the Federal Records Act and the Foreign Affairs Manual require that it be captured and preserved by the agency.' [] Of course, while Hillary Clinton's corruption was the starting point for all of this, it is far from alone in being a driving factor in The Russia Hoax. Considering all the 'deep doo-doo' Hillary was in (to borrow a favorite phrase of the late President George H.W. Bush), she needed serious bureaucratic help. And that help was forthcoming \u2014 from FBI Director James Comey. Jarrett, again in precise detail, tells the tale of Comey's infamous July 5, 2016 press conference that had the FBI Director clearing Clinton. If anything, Jarrett understates when he describes this jewel of Establishment Insider backscratching as 'one of the most bizarre, bewildering, and incomprehensible explanations of a legal case in modern American history.' Even I, a humble non-lawyer, watched that event unfold, listening to Comey read what Jarrett describes correctly as 'a lengthy statement that presented a compelling case of how Clinton repeatedly violated the law.' And after doing so, I listened, astonished, as Comey suddenly said [she didn't intend to break the law] [] After zeroing in on Clinton and her dealings with the Uranium One 'gravy train' \u2014 another adventure in detail \u2014 Jarrett gets to what is effectively Part Two of this prospective coup: 'The Fraudulent Case Against Donald Trump.' [] Which is to say, this part of the tale is the reason for the first part. There was such antipathy to Donald Trump from the entire (bipartisan) Washington 'Swamp' and the Old Order that runs it \u2014 not to mention from Hillary Clinton herself \u2014 that all the players involved had one goal in mind. To borrow the line from the Clint Eastwood Secret Service thriller In the Line of Fire, that line is: 'Take the subject out.' And thus the no-holds barred and decidedly 'fraudulent' case against Donald Trump.' Designed to take first the Trump candidacy, and then when that failed, the Trump presidency out.

Benedict Arnold, who turned on the Colonies in the Revolutionary War, comes to mind. Judas turned on Jesus. A 'quisling' has become a commonplace term used for people who betray a cause or a country. Most people do not know Quisling was actually a Norwegian traitor during World War II. Never-Trumpers are not exactly up on the traitor standards of these three collaborators, but their actions border that. After the Kavanaugh hearings, many people who had previously questioned President Trump came home to the Republican Party. They saw the savagery of the Dems against the former member of the Bush administration, Bush appointee to the Appeals Court, and perceived mainstream Republican. Recently, I spoke with a prominent Bushie asking whether the appointment of Kavanaugh and now William Barr to be Attorney General, after having the same position under President George H. W. Bush has caused Bush supporters to support Trump. The answer was 'No, it is because of the policies that Trump has put in place.' That has not paused some people in the unrelenting attacks on Trump which gave fodder to the liberals and helped Democrats win in this most recent election cycle. One of those people is Bret Stephens who now works for the NYT. When he left the Wall Street Journal, I questioned if he would be influencing his new colleagues or they him. It is apparent which way that has gone. Stephens recently wrote 'This week's elections were, at most, a very modest rebuke of a president reviled by many of his opponents, this columnist included, as an unprecedented danger to the health of liberal democracy at home and abroad.' Mr. Stephens, how exactly is he an 'unprecedented danger to democracy'? His column was written concurrent with a crowd of people gathering outside the residence of a journalist, Tucker Carlson, threatening his family and his home. This kind of behavior has gone on regularly \u2014 whether it is formally members of Antifa or whether it is just people prodded by MoveOn.org or A.N.S.W.E.R. Coalition. Where has your newspaper been in calling for the end of such belligerent and sometimes illegal behavior? Where was the NYT editorial calling for this behavior to end? Where was Stephens' op-ed attacking these groups? [] Any action against Trump is OK in these people's minds because he is a 'clear and present danger.' Though they cannot point to exactly what he has done that is so dangerous. They just echo chamber the opposition and then it becomes the truth to them even though it cannot be substantiated with actual examples. The latest proof of Trump being a 'danger to all free people' was his recent run-in with CNN's Jim Acosta at a press conference after the mid-terms. Never-Trumpers used this as proof that Trump is on the road to dictatorship and suppression of our free press. The reason Acosta had his WH press credentials taken away was for his ensuing rude and selfish behavior. He insisted on keeping the microphone, trying to either ask another question or further lecture the president. Other members of the press were waiting their turn to address the issue they were concerned with at the time. Acosta does this regularly with Press Secretary Sanders.

FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe and FBI chief legal counsel James Baker selected most of the special counsel investigators; those two then recommended to Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein that he hire Robert Mueller as special counsel lead. Comey was fired. The remaining 'at-risk' corrupt FBI leadership (McCabe and Baker), positioning to defend their own interests, selected the 'small group'; then Mueller was selected and brought on his additional team members. The entire purpose of the special counsel operation was to cover-up the DOJ/FBI activity.[] [Be sure to look at his inimitable charts and illustrations][54]  Afghan Grins in Mugshot After Beating up Swedish Elderly Woman and Calls Her 'A Racist'[55] The criminal Afghan has previously been convicted of attempted murder, among other offences, but has avoided expulsion each time. This time as well. The 74-year-old Ingrid's glasses broke in half when the criminal Afghan Walid struck her in her face. Walid then accused the elderly woman of being racist \u2014 and got off with only a few weeks' imprisonment.[56]  British Yellow Vests Back Brexit and Call for 'No Deal Now' As Protests Continue[57] Across London, protestors wearing the iconic yellow vests took to the streets demanding that the referendum result of June 23rd 2016 be respected and we get the Brexit that we voted. In London, one protestor told Twitter user @Zehenya that they were protesting because they want us to be able to 'reclaim control of our country' and that they are saying a distinct no to a 'European superstate'.[58]  Christmas in Poland is How Christmas in Europe Should be[59] It becomes a familiar recipe in Europe: If you want to see a traditional Christmas, head East.

Prince Harry will reportedly skip the royals' Boxing Day pheasant shoot to avoid upsetting his hunt-hating better half in what is seen as another blow to his relations with his brother, Prince William.[72]  NYT: 'Unclear' What Motivated Gunman Who Yelled 'Allahu Akbar' Before Attack[73] The New York Times claimed Wednesday that it is 'unclear' what motivated the gunman who shouted 'Allahu Akbar' before opening fire on a Christmas market in France. A public prosecutor in France claimed this week that the suspect in the shooting at Strasbourg Christmas market was an Islamic extremist who shouted 'Allahu Akbar' shortly before the attack. Two people died and nine were injured in the incident.[74]  Petition for 'No Deal' Brexit Overtakes Petition for Second Referendum[75] The official petition for a 'No Deal' Brexit has surged ahead of the petition for a so-called 'People's Vote' to reverse Brexit. The petition, which calls on the Government to abandon Theresa May's 'worst deal in history' with the EU, stop 'wasting Billions of pounds of taxpayers money trying to negotiate in a short space of time [sic]', and leave the bloc cleanly on World Trade Organization (WTO) terms, racked up tens of thousands of signatures in a matter of hours, and is still growing.[76]  Report: Theresa May's Closest Allies Plot Second Referendum[77] Two of Prime Minister Theresa May's most senior allies are plotting a second referendum, according to reports by the Daily Mail.

'In 2017 per capita GDP was 35,400 euros in the North-West area, 34,300 euros in the North-East and 30,700 euros in the Centre,' the national statistics agency said. 'In the South and Islands area, per capita GDP was 18,500 euros, 45% lower than in the Centre-North area'.[80]  U.S. Ambassador: U.S., UK 'Working Hard' To Prepare Post-Brexit Relationship[81] U.S. President Donald Trump's ambassador to the United Kingdom has said that the U.S. and UK are 'working hard' to build strong post-Brexit relations.[82]  Baby Dies in Palestinian Drive-by Jihad Attack on Civilians That Injured Seven People[83] A Canadian citizen, Amichai Ish-Ran, originally from Montreal, was shot five times when a Palestinian jihadist opened fire on Israeli civilians in a drive-by. He is still recovering in a hospital, and his wife 'Shira who was 30 weeks pregnant, was also shot, in the abdomen.' Shira and Amichai's baby was delivered by emergency caesarian section, but he didn't make it. The baby was murdered by a Palestinian jihadist.[84]  Caroline Glick: What is the U.S. Policy Towards Lebanon?[85] According to the Israeli media, during his meeting with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Brussels last Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu asked for the U.S. to impose an economic embargo on Lebanon. Pompeo reportedly rejected Netanyahu's request. The meeting between the two men took place on the eve of Israel's initiation of Operation Northern Shield last Tuesday. The operation is a military effort geared towards sealing Hezbollah's offensive subterranean attack tunnels. It follows Israel's stunning revelation that it had discovered the locations of Hezbollah's attack tunnels, perhaps Hezbollah's most secret undertaking. According to Netanyahu, Hezbollah launched its offensive tunnel project in 2014. The existence of the tunnel program was known to almost no one in the organization. Hezbollah's tunnels traverse the border between Lebanon and Israel. Hezbollah reportedly intended to have the tunnels serve as a means to invade Israeli territory rapidly and undetected. It is the declared goal of Hezbollah to conquer northern Israel in its next war against the Jewish state. The Trump administration's rejection of Israel's request to impose economic sanctions on Lebanon signals that it supports Israel's efforts to neutralize the threat that Hezbollah poses, with its powerful army and massive arsenal of short and long range missiles. But \u2014 like the Bush and Obama administrations before it \u2014 it rejects Israel's interpretation of the relations between Hezbollah and the Lebanese government and armed forces. The disparity between the U.S. and Israeli positions on the nature of Hezbollah's relationship with the Lebanese government and Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) emerged during the Second Lebanon War in 2006[86][87]  Feature: Holiday Spirit Prevails in Syria's Damascus With Return of Peace[88] DAMASCUS, Dec. 12 (Xinhua) \u2014 For seven years, the festive mood of the holiday season in Syria's capital Damascus largely disappeared, and the celebrations were confined to prayers for the country to regain its old renowned peace. In the past years of war, Christmas decorations were missed as the streets of Bab Touma and Qassa neighborhoods in Damascus were a target of daily mortar shells by the rebels in the nearby Eastern Ghouta countryside. For those who would celebrate, the holiday was an occasion to remember the neighbors and the loved ones who had gone in the spiraling war in the country and the rain of mortar shells. This year, however, people were celebrating their hearts out and the festive mood of the Christmas, and the New Year atmosphere is felt even before the actual occasion comes, which would be the first holiday season to come to Damascus in seven years after the last rebel left Eastern Ghouta in May.[89]  Son-in-Law of Iran President Faces Nepotism Claims[90] The appointment of President Hassan Rouhani's son-in-law as head of Iran's geological survey has renewed accusations of nepotism and led on Sunday to the resignation of a senior official, according to conservative media. The appointment of Kambiz Mehdizadeh, in his early thirties and reportedly married to Rouhani's daughter in a low-key wedding this August, was widely criticised by Iranians on social media. [91]  More Than 40 People Injured in Restaurant Explosion in Sapporo, Japan[92] More than 40 people have been injured, one seriously, after a blast tore through a restaurant in northern Japan. The explosion occurred in Sapporo, the capital city of Japan's northern main island of Hokkaido, and caused nearby apartment buildings and houses to shake. Police said 42 people were injured, most of them mildly, though one was in serious condition. They were rushed to nearby hospitals for treatment. The cause of the explosion, which occurred at a two-storey restaurant in Sapporo's Toyohira district, is under investigation, police said, adding that they had no further details. TV footage from Japanese public broadcaster NHK showed the restaurant in flames, with debris scattered on the ground. The footage later showed gray smoke billowing from the restaurant as dozens of firefighters poured water onto the building, which was charred and nearly collapsing. Windows on an apartment building next door were broken, and cars parked outside were partially covered with debris that had fallen on them[93]  New Species Named After ASEAN Biodiversity Expert[94] MEDINILLA theresae, a new edaphic-endemic species in Dinagat and Mindanao islands, was named after Dr. Theresa Mundita S.

One in three applicants arriving in Germany via other EU nations could be affected. The newspaper Welt am Sonntag disclosed Sunday that ministers decided at their most recent twice-yearly conference in the eastern city of Magdeburg to press Germany's federal government to trim handouts via legislative amendment. The EU's'Dublin' policy \u2014 now in its third version since a 2003 bid to create common standards within Europe's internal open borders \u2014 requires the country where a seeker first enters Europe to process his or her application for shelter.

As far as I can determine, the state legislature can't outlaw firearms training by an officially-raised militia \u2014 the 10th Amendment reserves that right to the localities. So the Democrats' proposed law won't be able to stop the local militia from organizing training operations. Perhaps Governor Coonman will call up the National Guard to deal with these upstart patriots in Tazewell County. </p><p>In other news, strikes continued in France in protest of President Emmanuel Macron's proposed pension reforms, shutting down the Eiffel Tower, airports, and railway stations.

Qatari officials pledged the money in 2011 to mark the 65th birthday of Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton's husband, and sought to meet the former U.S. president in person the following year to present him the check, according to an email from a foundation official to Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign chairman, John Podesta. The email, among thousands hacked from Podesta's account, was published last month by WikiLeaks[65][66]  Democrats Rushing Impeachment to Obstruct Bombshell Investigations of Billions in Money Laundering and Kickbacks Run by Obama Officials[67] The real story behind the Dems' rush for impeachment has finally emerged. Thanks to investigatory work by Rudy Giuliani, we now know that prominent Democrats ran billions of dollars in money laundering, extortion and kickbacks through Ukraine, funneling cash to their own pockets through an elaborate network of shell companies and corporate fronts. (Source) In essence, Rudy Giuliani, a former federal prosecutor, just uncovered the 'Panama Papers' of the Democrat party. As reported by The National Sentinel, here's what he found: Ukrainian officials offered up six criminal cases involving Joe and Hunter Biden, including 'money laundering;' One Ukrainian official produced official communiques and documents he says proves that Obama's U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine and 'impeachment witness' Maria Yovanovich perjured herself during her hearing; Another, Victor Shokin, the former Ukrainian prosecutor general, described how then-President Petro Poroshenko came into his office and told him he'd better stop investigating Hunter Biden or the country would lose a billion dollars in aid, as Joe Biden threatened (Shokin was fired); There are dozens of inquiries open into possible misallocation of U.S. funds in Ukraine, with the U.S. Embassy's involvement.As The Gateway Pundit adds: Rudy revealed a huge money laundering operation involving the Bidens and Burisma Holdings. Money was flowing through Latvia and Cyprus disguised as loans to various tech companies then paid out as 'board fees' to Hunter Biden. 'That is a straight out violation of a money laundering statute,' Giuliani said. Giuliani revealed that there is documents showing Schiff's star witness, fired US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch perjured herself at least twice during her impeachment testimony. Documents prove Yovanovitch was personally involved in the Ukrainian prosecutor general's investigations and denied visas to witnesses who could prove Biden, Dem corruption, Giuliani said. The Democrats launched a sham impeachment inquiry against President Trump because he was doing his duty to get to the bottom of Ukrainian corruption involving Obama-era officials and other Democrats. The Obama administration and Democrats were using Ukraine as a conduit to launder millions, if not billions of dollars of US money back into their pockets.[68]  Deranged De Niro Declares He Would 'Disown' His Children if They Were Like Trump's Kids[69] Says President is worse than psychopath killers he has played in films Hollywood uber leftist Robert De Niro declared Monday that he would disown his children if they were anything like President Trump's family, and called the President a 'a low life' who is worse than a murdering mobster.

The 'ground zero mosque' (originally named Cordoba House) was envisioned as a 13-story Islamic community center and mosque in Lower Manhattan. It would have replaced a building that was damaged during the 9/11 attacks by plane parts and accommodated a 'prayer space' for up to 2,000 Muslims. Following widespread controversy and opposition from 9/11 families, the project was abandoned, but an Islamic cultural museum with a Muslim 'prayer space' was subsequently built and recently completed.

'Everyone, you included, knows what is really happening,' Trump said, just a day before House Democrats were expected to vote to impeach him. 'Your chosen candidate lost the election in 2016, in an Electoral College landslide (306-227), and you and your party have never recovered from this defeat.

It was the first day the state began issuing driver's licenses that don't require applicants to prove they are in the US legally. The new law, commonly known as the Green Light Law, was passed by legislators in June this year, before going into effect on December 16. It allows all of those aged 16 and older living in New York to apply for a license 'regardless of their citizenship or lawful status' in the US.[152]  Illegal Aliens Pack New York Dmvs After State Allows Driver's Licenses for All[153] 'This is all a power grab for the ballot box in New York, trying to give illegals the right to vote,' says NY clerk.[154]  Migrant Arrivals From Turkey to EU Increase in 2019[155] The number of migrants crossing from Turkey to Europe grew by almost half in 2019 compared to 2018, according to an EU report published by German newspaper Die Welt.

The clip shows the boy being laughed at, insulted and beaten as the mob discusses taking money off him. 'Let me piss on him,' states one of the migrants before ordering the boy to open his mouth and urinating in his mouth.[158]  Barbara Kay: Ontario Mother Takes on School's Trans Ideology With Human Rights Claim[159] On last night's episode of The Ezra Levant Show, National Post columnist Barbara Kay joins me to discuss the Ontario mother starting a new project at GenderReport.ca to fight radical trans ideology. The project \u2014 and the Human Rights complaint lodged by the Buffone family against the Ottawa-Carleton District School Board \u2014 were inspired by the confusion and anxiety experienced by the young Buffone daughter after gender fluidity was introduced as a classroom lesson.[160]  Big Green, Inc: The Heinz Endowments Assault on a Prosperous Pennsylvania[161] The Heinz Endowments, a grantmaking organization in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, has long been viewed in the region as a community pillar. But while the Heinz Endowments purports to fund needed, worthwhile enhancements to the wellbeing of western Pennsylvania, many of the organization's grants do just the opposite, working to stoke baseless public fear and paint some of the region's most vital industries as villains. In the period from 2008 to 2016 the Heinz Endowments contributed over $120 million in environmental grants, as documented by Big Green, Inc., a project of the Institute for Energy Research. While some of the recipients are working toward meaningful environmental progress, such as in local air quality, tens of millions of dollars went to organizations more intent upon stymying economic development than furthering any justifiable conception of environmental quality.[162]  Destruction of the Family: The U.S. Has the Highest Rate of Children Living With a Single Parent in the Entire World[163] The family unit is one of the fundamental pillars of any society, and so the weaker our family units become the weaker our entire nation is going to become. For decades, the traditional family unit has been under assault in America, and the consequences have been absolutely catastrophic. Today, the marriage rate has dropped to levels that we have never seen before, we continue to have one of the highest divorce rates in the entire world, and more couples than ever are choosing not to get married at all. As a result, the number of single parents has been steadily rising, and at this point the United States actually has the highest rate of children living with a single parent of any country on the entire planet. The following comes from Pew Research For decades, the share of U.S. children living with a single parent has been rising, accompanied by a decline in marriage rates and a rise in births outside of marriage. A new Pew Research Center study of 130 countries and territories shows that the U.S. has the world's highest rate of children living in single-parent households. Almost a quarter of U.S. children under the age of 18 live with one parent and no other adults (23%), more than three times the share of children around the world who do so (7%). You would think that with how rapidly modern notions of 'morality' are spreading around the globe that someone out there would be worse than us, but sadly we are dead last on the list.[164]  Exclusive Video: Free Speech Expert Says Millions of US College Students Denied Free Speech[165] About 6.4 million students are denied free speech on college campuses, according to an annual report by the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education.

The statement refers to A Children's Book of Demons, a book targeting children aged 5-10 by Aaron Leighton, an illustrator and 'fan' of occult practices. The book invites children to summon demons as a way of dealing with unpleasant problems such as chores, homework, and getting rid of bullies.[168]  Hallmark Says it Will 'Reinstate' TV Ads Featuring Same-Sex Couple After Outcry[169] The Hallmark Channel on Sunday moved to reinstate ads featuring a same-sex couple that had been removed from the cable network.

The event was for the Obama Foundation, their stated mission is to inspire, empower, and connect people to change their world.[172]  SBC Chooses Gay-Affirming Pastor as 2020 Conference President[173] The Southern Baptist Convention chose David Uth, pastor of First Baptist Church in Orlando, as the president of the Pastor's Conference for the next year's annual meeting. Many should be reminded about who Uth is, and ask the question whether or not SBC leadership will be making strides for LGBTQ inclusion along with the rest of their latest compromises. David Uth hosted a gay-affirming LGBTQ event in the wake of the Orlando gay night club shooting at his church, FBC Orlando. In case you have forgotten, #LoveOrlando was a gay-straight hug fest that happened at the church in the shooting's aftermath. Taking the stage at that event was pastor Larry G. Mills, who said the following: In the wake of widespread criticism of this abominable, gay-affirming event (the church then asked homosexuals to come forward to be anointed and have hands laid upon them), David Uth prayed that God would strike discerning Christians dead if they criticized him.[174]  Why the Left Doesn't Like Christmas[175] I want to try to explain why this has happened. The 'inclusive' argument is so absurd \u2014 I am a religious Jew and cannot even fathom being offended or feeling 'not included' by an invitation to a Christmas party \u2014 that there have to be other, or at least additional, reasons for the left's neutering of Christmas. There are. One is that the left sees in Christianity its primary ideological and political enemy. And it is right to do so. The only large-scale organized opposition to the left comes from the traditional Christian community \u2014 evangelical Protestants, traditional Catholics and faithful Mormons \u2014 and Orthodox Jews. Leftism is a secular religion, and it deems all other religions immoral and false. From Karl Marx to Vladimir Lenin to George Soros, the left has regarded religion in general and Christianity in particular as the 'opiate of the masses' \u2014 a drug that dulls the masses into accepting their oppressed condition and, thereby, keeps them from engaging in revolution. The left understands that the more people believe in Christianity (and Judaism), the less chance the left has to gain power. The left doesn't concern itself with Islam, because it perceives Islam as an ally in its war against Western civilization, and because leftists do not have the courage to confront Islam. They know that confronting religious Muslims can be fatal, whereas confronting religious Christians entails no risks. Second, the left regards Christianity in America as an intrinsic part of American national identity \u2014 an identity it wishes to erode in favor of a 'world citizen' identity.[176] [ 1]: <url

Then it depends on your politics.Conservative commentator Benji Irby, who has defended President Donald Trump and conservatisim to his own gay and black communities was recently censored[1] after posting a video on YouTube[2].[3]After this, he had not only lost his followers, but Twitter made it look as if he deliberately blocked them, in what appeared to be an attempt to alienate him from his supporters. 'Twitter suspended my account indefinitely for no apparent reason on Monday, July 22, 2019 after posting an innocuous video reaching out to black Democrats.' </p><p>In the video he explained that the Democrats were pushing for both legal and illegal migration as a weapon so they can demographically turn red states blue. This he argued, hurts the black community.NewsBusters TechWatch interviewed Irby over the phone shortly after the incident.When asked about why the left thinks he is dangerous, he replied that is because he has been 'showing black people that the Democratic Party has strategically put illegals before them.' He said the Democratic party depends upon a racial narrative of black oppression by conservatives in order to continue exploiting them for support.He blasted the Democratic party for appealing to the black struggle against historical oppression while pursuing policies that actively are bad for black communities today. 'Our struggle is being used to push illegal immigration but nothing is really happening for us,' he said.He stressed that as long as Democrats push a 'racial narrative' demonizing people like Trump, that black Americans 'will sit idly by' while the Democratic party pushes for illegal immigration at the expense of black workers. He claimed that Big Tech companies lie about being open forums for debate while acting as publishers that can select who has a right to express their opinions. He said they should be regulated like news networksHe described how 'in a perfect world' there would be no real restriction on what ideas people want to express 'outside of yelling fire in a theatre.' He said that people should be allowed to say 'whatever the hell they wanna say.''Twitter and Facebook ought to be open to all' he said. He implore that it should be up to regular people 'to figure out whether something is fake or real,' not suspicious 'fact checkers,' companies, or algorithms.'Irbi said that Bg Tech platforms should either let everyone speak and choose what they wish to see or not want to see, or platforms should be regulated like news networks.'We can't let this kind of censorship go on.

Then it depends on your politics.Conservative commentator Benji Irby, who has defended President Donald Trump and conservatisim to his own gay and black communities was recently censored[1] after posting a video on YouTube[2].[3]After this, he had not only lost his followers, but Twitter made it look as if he deliberately blocked them, in what appeared to be an attempt to alienate him from his supporters. 'Twitter suspended my account indefinitely for no apparent reason on Monday, July 22, 2019 after posting an innocuous video reaching out to black Democrats.' </p><p>In the video he explained that the Democrats were pushing for both legal and illegal migration as a weapon so they can demographically turn red states blue. This he argued, hurts the black community.NewsBusters TechWatch interviewed Irby over the phone shortly after the incident.When asked about why the left thinks he is dangerous, he replied that is because he has been 'showing black people that the Democratic Party has strategically put illegals before them.' He said the Democratic party depends upon a racial narrative of black oppression by conservatives in order to continue exploiting them for support.He blasted the Democratic party for appealing to the black struggle against historical oppression while pursuing policies that actively are bad for black communities today. 'Our struggle is being used to push illegal immigration but nothing is really happening for us,' he said.He stressed that as long as Democrats push a 'racial narrative' demonizing people like Trump, that black Americans 'will sit idly by' while the Democratic party pushes for illegal immigration at the expense of black workers. He claimed that Big Tech companies lie about being open forums for debate while acting as publishers that can select who has a right to express their opinions. He said they should be regulated like news networksHe described how 'in a perfect world' there would be no real restriction on what ideas people want to express 'outside of yelling fire in a theatre.' He said that people should be allowed to say 'whatever the hell they wanna say.''Twitter and Facebook ought to be open to all' he said. He implore that it should be up to regular people 'to figure out whether something is fake or real,' not suspicious 'fact checkers,' companies, or algorithms.'Irbi said that Bg Tech platforms should either let everyone speak and choose what they wish to see or not want to see, or platforms should be regulated like news networks.'We can't let this kind of censorship go on. It's totally unfair,' he said, 'something must be done on the government level at this point.'For whatever reason, his account was restored as of August 12 and is back in action.

The biggest have been in the UK, which said last year it intended to fine British Airways \u00a3183m and Marriott, the hotel chain, \u00a399m for failing to keep customer data safe from hackers. </p><p>\u201cIf the GDPR is at risk of failing, the fault lies with national governments, not with the data protection authorities,\u201d said Johnny Ryan, chief policy officer at Brave, which has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e3e1697e-ce57-11e9-99a4-b5ded7a7fe3f\"> previously</url> tussled with Google over its data practices.</p><p>He said the number of technical specialists on the staff of regulators across Europe varied significantly. In the lead was Germany, which had 101 specialists at its data regulators, about 13 per cent of the total headcount.</p><p>Half of Europe\u2019s data regulators have only five technical experts or fewer, leaving them without the expertise to investigate potential breaches of the GDPR effectively or to examine how personal and sensitive data are being used.</p><p>The UK\u2019s Information Commissioner\u2019s Office ranked fourth in terms of specialists with 22 such roles \u2014 slightly more than 3 per cent of its total staffing. Spain and France both had more specialists, despite their regulators being less than a third the size of the UK\u2019s by number of staff. </p><p>Funding was equally varied across the bloc. While the UK\u2019s ICO has a budget of \u20ac61m for this year, the majority of regulators across the EU have budgets of less than \u20ac10m, and 14 have less than \u20ac5m. </p><p>In some cases, funding has fallen since the GDPR came into force: Portugal reduced its budget by \u20ac203,000 between 2018 and 2020.</p><p>The Irish Data Protection Commission has the heaviest enforcement workload, since several Big Tech groups including Facebook and Google are based in Dublin. </p><p>The Irish DPA is the lead authority for 127 cases, and has 21 specialist tech investigators, ranking fifth. But Brave said that, despite dealing with high-profile companies, increases in the Irish DPA\u2019s budget and staff count are slowing. </p><p>\u201cThe Data Protection Commission\u2019s budget and staff numbers have grown in recent years to 140 staff at present. This year we will recruit an additional 30 staff, bringing staff numbers to 170 by the end of 2020. This growth in staff must continue over the next few years,\u201d said the Irish DPA.</p><p>The UK\u2019s ICO said: \u201cThe ICO recognises the vitally important role of technical specialists in addressing data protection and privacy concerns, and this is reflected in our priorities and technology strategy. And while we are not yet at the level of capacity and capability we are planning for, we will continue to invest significantly in this area.\u201d </p><p>The European Commission did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-a915ae62034e4b13b7874b0ac2aaff7e</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YS9-5M61-JB77-K08T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"578\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 27, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002N04</classCode><className>BRITISH AIRWAYS PLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS481111 SCHEDULED PASSENGER AIR TRANSPORTATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>SIC4512 AIR TRANSPORTATION, SCHEDULED</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Commonly referred as the , this is now the standard which has forced most tech companies to rethink not only data collection practices but also how data is collected or they risk high fines. Where the US lacks a similar regulation to protect privacy of Internet users, many characterize Europe's GDPR as hurting privacy[1] instead of protecting it while others accuse the EU of policing[2] across its own borders. The Washington Post announced last week that France has fined Google almost $57 million for the first major violation of the GDPR and tech companies in Silicon Valley and beyond are paying close attention. </p><p>Accused of failing to disclose the collection and use of personal information to users, Google also failed to obtain permission from these users to do things such as to expose them to personalized advertisements. To most North Americans, such regulation are almost joke-worthy, but that is because most internet users are completely unaware as to how Google harvests the information it uses, which does involve accessing private data. Yet, there is cause for concern when Android users set up a new mobile phone and followed Android's setup process. Two nonprofit organizations, None Of Your Business (noyb[3]) and La Quadrature du Net[4] originally filed a complaint[5] back in May 2018 but noybfiled its complaintagainst Google and Facebook. Under the GDPR regulations, complaints must first be transferred to local data protection watchdogs so France's top data-privacy agency, CNIL[6] (Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Liberts), took the case in hand and started its investigation 1 June, 2018. Concluding that Google did not comply with the consent and transparent aspects of the privacy law, it pointed to specific areas of non-compliance such as how information is not easily accessible and that information is not clear or comprehensive. Of particular note is how data is processed: Users are not able to fully understand the extent of the processing operations carried out by GOOGLE. But the processing operations are particularly massive and intrusive because of the number of services offered (about twenty), the amount and the nature of the data processed and combined. The restricted committee observes in particular that the purposes of processing are described in a too generic and vague manner, and so are the categories of data processed for these various purposes. Similarly, the information communicated is not clear enough so that the user can understand that the legal basis of processing operations for the ads personalization is the consent, and not the legitimate interest of the company. Finally, the restricted committee notices that the information about the retention period is not provided for some data. So what is the information that can be accessed by Google and other tech companies? Take browser cookies[7], for instance. While 'cookies' sounds like a cute word, these small files store a lot of private data: where you have browsed, information you have filled in online forms, even information you have entered into highly personal online financial sites, free website builders[8], and basically everything[9] you have done on your browser, everywhere you have browsed. Tracking cookies[10] are used for advertising purposes,specifically involving what is called retargeting, a tactic that depends upon tracking cookies to show ads to people who have previously visited a specific site or shown interest in a particular product. If you've ever looked up something on Google or on Amazon and then saw it or a similar item on a popup advertisement while browsing, this is no coincidence. You've simply been retargeted. The information cookies contain is set and accessed by the servers of the websites that you visit and cookies allow servers to identify you and remember things about you. So, while a cookie might be considered to be no big deal by some people, imagine that any website having access to your cookies would potentially have access to anything you have typed into your web browser. Silktidefounder, Oliver Emberton[11] explains cookies like this: 'The problem is that those same cookies can also be used to track people, and do things that many people don't like, like deliver targeted ads. And this has got a lot of people understandably concerned.' The GDPR means that usersare to be asked for consent before cookies can be accessed. You can read the CNIL summary of their report here[12]. Google is now fined for violating France's General Data Protection Regulations to the tune of US$57 million. When the GDPR was first announced, many claimed that this would be bad for business. But on the other side of the argument, privacy groups have firmly stood behind the necessary privacy measures to be observed by all companies to include tech giants like Facebook and Google which have come under scrutiny in recent months. And earlier this week, Poland, the UK and Ireland[13] were implicated in not safeguarding users with regard to 'how ad auction companies, including Google, unlawfully profile Internet users' religious beliefs, ethnicities, diseases, disabilities, and sexual orientation.' Ultimately, there is a clear contradiction between what's good for big business and what is good for privacy protections of individual. The real question is what will give in first-our human right to privacy or big business' desire for profit?

This is also known as \"Subject Access Request\" (SAR) arising from article 15 (right of access by data subject) and article 20 (right to data portability) of the GDPR. Under the new data protection law, companies are obliged to provide the individual with personal information kept on record within one month of request.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It transpires that 35% of EU-based companies meet SARs within the legal time frame when compared to the 50% of companies outside Europe. This research-based exercise was conducted on 103 companies across a myriad of industries including retail, media, technology, public sector, finance and travel. It was also concluded that although many of those surveyed understood the importance of GDPR, many others were not taking any action when it came to personal data in terms of technology and processes.</p><p>As Talend rightly pointed out, this matter was a concern given that SARs are not something new that came into force under GDPR, but rather were already present in the previous Directive. Findings showed that the average response time was 21 days, while 65% responded within 10 days, only to be surpassed by mobile banking and tech companies which generally responded within one day. On the other hand, businesses which started offline increasingly struggled with legacy systems and were significantly slower to respond.</p><p>Talend's senior director of data governance products, Mr. Jean-Michel Franco stated that \"GDPR presents an opportunity to engage with customers and build loyalty. It's vital for businesses in the digital era to have a 360-degree view of customers.\" Moreover, \"businesses must ensure that data is consolidated and stored in a transparent and shareable way.\"</p><p>One certainly looks forward to comparing results with a similar survey conducted on the first anniversary since the implementation of GDPR to see if there have been any significant positive changes.</p><p>Was the impact too soft?</p><p>Those who have a keen interest in this topic of law, or have been somehow impacted through involvement in their profession, surely agree that GDPR was both an ambitious and probably the toughest piece of legislation in the sphere of privacy and security to date. Legislators were committed to improved safeguards that guaranteed users better control over their personal data.</p><p>While people might associate GDPR with never-ending requests for consent through pop-ups and e-mails, especially before the 25th of May 2018, the EU had better reasons to give people more control over their personal data. All EU citizens and residents who use computers and other electronic devices have a say over those companies who handle their personal data. This means that people are only \"lending\" their personal data and it also means that it remains theirs. EU citizens and residents have a right to:</p><p>information on how their data is processed;<br/>access of their personal data;<br/>have their data corrected;<br/>have their data erased (e.g. unlawfully used);<br/>object if their data is used for marketing purposes;<br/>restrict the use of their data for specific purposes;<br/>request to have decisions involving personal data made by automated processing to be made by natural persons not only computers.</p><p>GDPR provides for enforcement in case of violation of the regulation by allowing authorities to impose hefty fines of up to 4%of global revenue or 20 million euros, whichever the higher. Therefore, GDPR places a lot of responsibility on companies that process personal data, especially in those circumstances where data is collected without authorisation or reason.</p><p>Another requirement imposed on companies is that of having appropriate data security, transparent processing and the responsibility of notifying the persons affected by a breach within 72 hours. Unfortunately, this obligation has not been followed by big tech companies like Facebook who have been reported of notifying their customers about their data breach two months later.</p><p>Despite GDPR entering into force more than nine months ago, to some experts in the field it has been somewhat of a mixed bag. Companies may have updated their privacy policies and tools to provide users with more control, and adopted ways of deleting data on request. However, many others have engaged a more lenient approach and may still be in default especially when it comes to consent and control. This is disappointing when one considers that the regulation was a forward-looking law promoting 'privacy by design' (privacy at the initial stages of the developing process of the product). Moreover, since the media focused on data breaches by big tech companies and the staggering fines imposed, the perception might have been that GDPR only concerns big companies like Facebook and Google.</p><p>Raegan MacDonald, the Head of EU Public Policy at Mozilla said that, \"2018 was the year of implementation, while 2019 will be the year of enforcement.\" Rightly so if one had to follow the continuous growth of the Irish Data Protection Commissioner office where the above-mentioned big tech data have their EU headquarters.</p><p>On the other hand, one cannot discount the fact that according to Brussels (Reuters), European data protection regulators received over 95,000 complaints about possible data breaches within the first eight months after the adoption of GDPR. Clearly, it can be said that GDPR had a positive impact on people as it has made them more aware of the issues regarding personal data.</p><p>If one had to sum up the impact of GDPR in 2018, one can agree that there has been an increase in awareness in handling of personal data that has encouraged companies to change their approach.

GDPR enforcers must be able to properly investigate 'big tech', and act without fear of vexatious appeals. But the national governments of European countries have not given them the resources to do so. The European Commission must intervene,\" he added.</p><p>According to the company, half of Europe's data protection authorities have an annual budget under EUR 5 million. </p><p>In addition, just five national regulators currently employ more than 10 investigators, while seven data protection authorities only have two tech specialists or fewer. </p><h>Issued fines Data protection authorities in Europe issued fines worth over EUR 400 million to organisations last year for violations but none originated in the Republic of Ireland, despite it being home to many of the world's biggest technology companies.</h><p>The Irish data protection commission is the lead EU regulator for companies including Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Twitter under the \"one-stop-shop\" mechanism, which was introduced with GDPR. It has a budget of EUR 16.9 million - the sixth highest among EU states - and more than 20 investigations ongoing into big tech companies but is yet to issue any fines. </p><p>Delays have been blamed on complications that arise from pursuing companies which operate cross-border.</p><p>Last year, the commission received less than one-third of the EUR 5.9 million in additional funding it sought in Budget 2020 to cope with the increased workload it now has due to GDPR. Its last annual report shows a 71 per cent rise in reported data security breaches in 2019 versus the preceding year.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-1.4239578</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YSD-3VM1-JC8Y-837W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"473\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 28, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

nitf:lede=\"true\">As the GDPR approaches its second anniversary, European member states have been accused of leaving the data protection rules \"at risk of failing\" due to lack of technical and financial resources.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Brave, which makes a privacy-oriented browser, urged the European Commission to launch an infringement procedure against the governments of member states, which it accused of leaving data protection offices without the \"human and financial resources necessary to perform their tasks\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Brave said that half of Europe's data protection regulators have only five technical experts, leaving them incapable of evaluating GDPR complaints, while 14 countries' regulators have budgets of less than 5 million euros (\u00a34.3m).</p><p>\"If the GDPR is at risk of failing, the fault lies with national governments, not with the data protection authorities,\" said Brave chief policy officer Johnny Ryan.</p><h>Resources</h><p>Germany leads in the number of technical specialists, employing 101 at its data regulators, about 13 percent of total headcount, followed by Spain, France and the UK.</p><p>Brave noted that Spain and France both employ more specialists than the UK, in spite of the fact that their regulators have a total staff less than one third that of the UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO).</p><p>The ICO's 22 technical specialists comprise about 3 percent of its total staff.</p><p>The ICO has a budget of 61m euros for this year, but most EU data regulators have budgets of less than 10m euros, and Portugal actually cut funding by 203,000 euros from 2018 to 2020.</p><p>The Irish data protection authority (DPA) has the heaviest caseload, being lead

budget and staff are slowing.</p><p>\"GDPR enforcers must be able to properly investigate 'big tech', and act without fear of vexatious appeals,\" Brave's Ryan said. \"But the national governments of European countries have not given them the resources to do so.\"</p><h>Corrective powers</h><p>The Irish DPA, the Data Protection Commission, said its staff have grown to 140 with more increases planned to bring the total to 170 by the end of this year.</p><p>\"This growth in staff must continue over the next few years,\" the Data Protection Commission said.</p><p>The UK's ICO acknowledge the role of technical specialists was \"vitally important\".</p><p>\"While we are not yet at the level of capacity and capability we are planning for, we will continue to invest significantly in this area,\" the ICO said.</p><p>The European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) and the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) referred to their<url

to November 30, 2019, 22 DPAs made use of various corrective powers under the GDPR, including a total of 785 fines, although 110 of the financial penalties relate to pre-GDPR

Still. After nearly two years of existence, it hasn't done much to improve the privacy[2] of the millions of Europeans it affects. But it has made big tech companies even more dominant[3] and generated a hell of a lot of collateral damage. </p><p>The privacy law was created by regulators bursting with short-sightedness and good intentions. And, if we're honest, a lot of unmitigated hate towards powerful US tech companies. (Hate, let's continue being honest, many of these companies did little to mitigate[4].) Transferring the power of privacy back to the people sounds good on paper, but in practice, it results in things like EU regulators violating their own law[5] and, um, trash cans being temporarily removed[6] from post offices because of the personal data they \"collected\" without permission. The unintended consequences of the broadly-written law have been discussed here at Techdirt with alarming regularity[7]. Clerical mix-ups have resulted in people accessing other people's personal data[8]. The law has reached across the pond to screw with US court dockets[9] and vanish posts[10] from American search engines. GDPR has even made Christmas[11] more of a logistical nightmare than it usually is. Now there's this: in the middle of a pandemic, GDPR is preventing food from being delivered to at-risk Europeans[12] self-isolating to prevent exposure to the deadly coronavirus. (Paywall-free link here[13].)Supermarkets have been unable to get the names of 1.5 million vulnerable people being shielded from coronavirus[14] to deliver food boxes because of EU data protection rules. Grocers are waiting for a list of those self isolating for 12 weeks due to underlying health conditions so they can be prioritised for deliveries. The details were expected to be handed over at the weekend, but insiders said they have been held up because of the European Union's general data protection regulation, which prevents mass sharing of information such as people's names, addresses or emails.Awesome. They can either eat or have their privacy protected. But not both. And they don't get to choose which option they get. The GDPR has already decided they don't get to eat until the government straightens this out. Multiple major grocers confirmed they had no access to lists of vulnerable residents in need of food assistance. Fortunately for everyone involved -- especially those considered to be at-risk -- this has been sorted out. One day after the original reporting, supermarkets stated they had finally received the lists previously blocked by the GDPR[15]. While this is a surprisingly speedy turnaround, the fact is the blocking of at-risk residents' info never should have happened in the first place. While GDPR's goals are (mostly) good, the side effects of mandating broad restrictions on data-gathering and sharing screws with the interoperability of the private and public sectors. In the GDPR's case, it also screws with the interoperability of multiple public entities, making it a nightmare for everyone involved. Good intentions only get you so far. And those good intentions don't mean much when they're undermining the public's health and well-being.Permalink[16] | Comments[17] | Email This Story[18] [ 1]: <url

He said proposals to expand it and the California Consumer Privacy Act, which is taking effect now, indicate weaknesses in the ability of those laws to address privacy issues. He said congressional work on federal privacy legislation needs to focus first on what problems need addressing and then on details such as whether there should be state law preemption or a private right of action. However, much of the Capitol Hill debate seems to be focusing on those details first, he said. Phillips confirmed his agency is doing an antitrust investigation into Facebook but didn't elaborate, and he didn't comment when asked about any possible TikTok investigation. He said he intends to serve out the remaining three years of his term regardless of how the November election goes. He said there's no chilling effect on FTC commissioners by FCC Commissioner Mike O'Rielly's renomination being pulled by the White House seemingly for his stance on social media regulation. \"We operate as a bipartisan agency,\" Phillips said. NTIA said Friday the FCC has the legal authority to regulate social media, and the First Amendment backs it doing so (see 2009180054).</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMDLY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMDLY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60X6-MH71-JC8G-817Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6944</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"239\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Communications Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 21, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

We'll tell you what's in store for next week.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus, President Bush is prepared to compromise on the tax cut. But some experts are saying it could be some time before you see any relief.  And we'll tell you why two of our guests say a couple of storage companies are the place to be if you're looking to buy.</p><p>ANNOUNCER: This is the MONEYLINE WEEKEND EDITION with Terry Keenan.</p><p>KEENAN: Hello, everyone, and welcome.</p><p>Once again, it was a busy week on Wall Street.  Joining us this week for our roundtable, David Jones, the chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston, Rick Schottenfeld, a partner with Schottenfeld Associates, and Dennis McKechnie, portfolio manager at Pimco.</p><p>But first, the market showing signs of resilience and shrugging off the latest earnings news.  Corning adding its name to the growing list of companies slashing their forecasts for 2001.  Telecom and chip stocks putting pressure on the tech sector.</p><p>But analysts say the most positive thing about the week is nothing really bad happened.  But the question remains, is this the bottom?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RICHARD MCCABE, MERRILL LYNCH: Virtually every major decline in a market or a sector over history has been followed by an initial shock rally, as we may be in now with the strain from Nasdaq and technology stocks.  But then there's virtually always some kind of retest back toward if not to the initial lows when that first big rally is over.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEENAN: Well, there you see the rally that Dick McCabe was talking about, the Nasdaq up more than 25 percent from its low on April 4, and the Dow also posting an impressive rally, getting a little boost from stronger than expected GDP numbers on Friday. Those numbers suggest that the economy may be better off than we thought.  It led to speculation about the Fed's next move.</p><p>And so that brings me to you, David Jones.  Does this mean the Fed is going to stay quiet come May 15?</p><p>DAVID JONES, CHIEF ECONOMIST, AUBREY G. LANSTON: I don't think so.  But I will bet you that they move only in their normal size, 25- basis-point cuts.  I think we may get one in May.  We won't get another one in June.  They'll moderate that trend.  We've had four double-size, 50-basis-point cuts, of course, earlier.</p><p>KEENAN: Do you believe the GDP numbers? Because sometimes they're revised down into a recession at the start of a recession when we look back in history.</p><p>JONES: They were certainly stronger than I thought.  I was looking for something around one percent.  But we have to be careful. They could be revised down.</p><p>And furthermore, we still have this moment.  It's an unusual picture.  The business sector is leading the downturn with an inventory correction and a capital spending boom/bust.  Consumers and housing are holding up well.</p><p>The question is when the consumers hear about these layoffs, will confidence and spending follow?  So the risks are really on the downside.</p><p>But I would say one thing.  There's no sign of a recession here, just a period of perhaps slow growth in the first three quarters.</p><p>KEENAN: Yeah, Rick, do you agree?  And is the market now looking out to recovery later this year?</p><p>RICK SCHOTTENFELD, PARTNER, SCHOTTENFELD ASSOCIATES: Well, I think that the market is hopeful of a recovery.  Obviously, the action of the last couple of weeks shows you that.</p><p>I've become concerned when the companies I speak to tell me how bad business is.  I probably hang out with too many technology companies.  That's probably a problem, is the company I keep.</p><p>But what I have a hard time deciding is whether or not the logic of things have gone down so much and thins have been so bad that they must get better.  I don't know why the logic follows that they must get better.  They could just stay kind of flat or weak for a while.</p><p>And some of the valuations and some of the equities are still too high to justify owning them, if that's the case.  And so we do need a recovery to justify higher stock prices, particularly in technology for the most part.  And so I'm still a little concerned.</p><p>KEENAN: Yeah, Dennis, it's the theme you hear from everyone, particularly economists that are out there talking to companies and CEOs.  They're much more negative than the strategists on the street. DENNIS MCKECHNIE, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, PIMCO: Sure.  Business is awful.  And I think what we are in the midst of is phase one.  Phase one is confessing that you've got lots of inventory and starting to deal with it.</p><p>So I think the market has paid for phase one.  And we won't necessarily pay for phase two, which is the uplift, until the economy starts taking off.</p><p>I still believe the economy doesn't really find the inflection point until about Thanksgiving.  When you go to growth and you start pulling through, right now you've just cleaned an inventory mess.</p><p>KEENAN: Yeah, David, signs again this week that the consumer is out there buying at least new homes.  And retail numbers aren't so bad.  A lot depends on the consumer going forward to hold onto this economy.</p><p>JONES: Yeah.  And, Terry, one of the big questions is how high does that unemployment rate go?  You want to watch something closely about the consumer, it could be at five percent by September, up from 4.3 percent now.  So those layoffs are going to come into the job numbers.</p><p>And it's like a tug-of-war here.  Can the consumer and the housing sector hold it together long enough for the business sector to make its adjustment?</p><p>And, by the way, I completely agree here.  It's a longer period of flat growth than people think.  And then I think it's going to be a very halting recovery, a U-shaped, maybe a lazy U-shaped kind of picture instead of that quick bounce-back that people have been hoping for.</p><p>KEENAN: Why do you think the consumer has been so sanguine here when everything else looks so negative?</p><p>JONES: Well, I think one thing is most of them have doubts. Sure, 4.3 percent is higher than the low for unemployment at 3.9, the three-decade low.  But it's still a low unemployment rate.</p><p>And I think people also have property prices moving up.  So the wealth effect that was so negative because of the stock market was offset at least a little bit by the fact that the real estate market has indeed held up.  So people are OK.</p><p>And, finally, we did the Fed -- I think it was behind the curve in its first three rate cuts this year.  But the fourth one, the biggest surprise in April, brought it even with the curve.  And I think that's something we can't forget.</p><p>KEENAN: And all the positive press that comes with it.</p><p>JONES: Exactly.</p><p>KEENAN: OK, we are going to take a quick break.  But when we return, a closer look at the tech stocks.  We'll tell you about two big names that have been bucking the downward trend.  And a bit later, the tax cut and why you might be waiting longer than Washington would have you believe.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>KEENAN: Well, the home of the dot-com IPO is putting itself up for sale.  The Nasdaq aims for a debut as soon as next year, saying the move will better position it for international competition.</p><p>Some of the biggest names to call the Nasdaq home are also home of the biggest movers in 2001.  There's a wide margin between the winners and the losers.  Names such as Cisco and Oracle and Sun all down sharply on the year, while other tech bellwethers help have managed to make significant gains, believe it or not, since January 1. Microsoft, classic dog of the Dow, up almost 60 percent in 2001.  Dell also showing some strong gains on the year.</p><p>And, Rick Schottenfeld, when the Nasdaq finally does go public, where do you think the Nasdaq composite will be?</p><p>SCHOTTENFELD: Oh, I have no idea.  Hopefully higher than we are now.</p><p>I think it's interesting that they're still pushing ahead with this.  I thought the Nasdaq itself going public was sort of a sign of the heady days we had a year ago.  And it's interesting that they're still forging ahead even though times have kind of changed.  But let's see how it does.</p><p>KEENAN: Yeah, a lot of people said that the Times Square center for Nasdaq and the opening of that early last year really signaled the top.</p><p>But, Dennis, as we've been saying, the Nasdaq up 25 percent this month.  Do you think it's a rally in a bear market, or the start of a\u2026</p><p>MCKECHNIE: No, I think that the bottom has been formed.  I think the backstop of the Fed took is halfway there.  We've only discounted these inventory corrections.  And we need the economy to help out.</p><p>I would guess we're in a trading range to about June, July with the Nasdaq.  And then we get on firm footing and start to lift in the fall.</p><p>The Fed rate cuts helping, seasonality helping.  And all this inventory will be through.  So I would say June, July will be the absolute bottom, and then a lift.</p><p>KEENAN: David, a lot of debate whether Fed rate cuts can really help what seems to be not only an inventory problem, but as the Fed acknowledged, a demand problem.  What are your thoughts on that?</p><p>JONES: Well, it can't do everything.  And he biggest question mark is what can it do for the business investment cycles when you have all this excess capacity, when we have profits recession at least two consecutive quarters of declines looking at the earnings of the S&amp;P in the first and second quarters of this year.</p><p>And so I think it will take a while.  And the bottom line is we need a tax cut someday.  And I think we need doses of both major government policies, Fed rate cuts, government tax cuts.  But there is a question about exactly when we're going to get those tax cuts.</p><p>KEENAN: And we've got, as we noted, some big tech movers to the upside, believe it or not.  Microsoft among them.</p><p>Are there any stocks that you see here that haven't made the run in April that you still like?</p><p>SCHOTTENFELD: Well, I think the interesting issue is that technology is really a product-driven kind of business.  And I think the thing that I'm finding troublesome at the moment is that what really drove technology's growth over the last year is the idea that you had to build this infrastructure for the Internet to make it ubiquitous.</p><p>You also at the same time had this cellular infrastructure, this wireless infrastructure, being built at the same time.  And as I look forward, it's hard for me to find the same kind of products that are out there that we're going to need to drive the technology market.</p><p>And so I'm a little concerned about that.  At the same time, I do think that like wireless 3G could be compelling as it gets rolled out, all that keeps slipping.  And I think software, I think the place where people are going to spend their money now is in software.</p><p>I think that ultimately you have this infrastructure in place. You've built this sort of Internet infrastructure.  And now what you want are software applications that let you take advantage of it.  And I think that areas like storage, which you mentioned earlier in the show, are going to be interesting too, you know, Legato -- I guess I'm supposed to talk about that later.</p><p>But\u2026</p><p>KEENAN: OK\u2026</p><p>SCHOTTENFELD: \u2026 it is a software company that's sort of under- performed.  It's very cheap here.  And it's focused at an end-market that I think is sort of interesting.  So that's kind of where my focus is right now.</p><p>KEENAN: OK, well, we're going to turn our focus for a minute to Washington.  Up next, President Bush at the end of his honeymoon period.  We'll take a look back at the first 100 days in office.</p><p>And the tax cut.  Are we approaching a compromise?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>KEENAN: Turning now to Washington.  President Bush is about to round out his first 100 days in office.  And the tax cut remains at the center of debate as the House and Senate battle over the final version of the plan.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH: In the first 100 days, we got one bill out of the House at $1.6 trillion and one out of the Senate at $1.2 trillion.  So at least the parameters have been defined.  I think we're going to get meaningful tax relief.  My answer is, let's get as much as possible for the American people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEENAN: Well, so far, the American people seem fairly pleased with Bush and his handling of the economy, the budget, and taxes. Overall, the latest polls show Bush holding a comfortable 62 percent approval rating.</p><p>And joining us now from Washington is political economist Greg Valliere of the Charles Schwab Washington Research Group.</p><p>And, Greg, welcome back.  Good to have you with us, as always.</p><p>GREG VALLIERE, CHARLES SCHWAB WASHINGTON RESEARCH GROUP: Great to see you, Terry.</p><p>KEENAN: If you had to grade this president's first 100 days, what grade would you give him?</p><p>VALLIERE: Pretty good.  B-plus, A-minus.  I really see only one major flaw in 100 days of some successes, that flaw being on the issue of the environment.  He really has been boxed into a corner.  And the Democrats, who have been desperately looking for an issue, may have one in that area.  But, otherwise, I think he's done a very good job.</p><p>KEENAN: Dennis?</p><p>MCKECHNIE: Greg, with regard to the tax cuts that are being proposed, do you see the lower end taking it or the high end?  If not, if tax rates don't get cut this year, will they get cut next year?</p><p>VALLIERE: Well, a couple of points I'd make quickly.  Number one, I think Bush knows he's got to make two big concessions because the final bill will be smaller than he wanted.</p><p>Number one, I think at the high end, 39.6 percent.  We're not going maybe even to 36.  It may wind up being 37 when all is said and done.</p><p>At the low end, yeah.  I think that 15 percent bracket could go all the way down to 10 over a three- or four-year period, maybe 12 right away.</p><p>And, quickly, the second big concession he has to make is on estate taxes.  He will not get abolition of the estate tax. JONES: Greg, Dave Jones here.  How much front-loading are we going to get in this tax cut?  Obviously, the concept originally was that President Bush was going to give some money back to the people so it couldn't be spent in Washington.  But, obviously, with the weak economy, now we need some stimulus.  Are they going to move a lot of it into this year or next year to give us some front-loading?</p><p>VALLIERE: You would think so.  But I think increasingly it looks as if we're not going to get this bill passed until July, and maybe not until just before the August break.  So I think that you won't get money in people's pockets probably until Labor Day.  And with the strong or surprisingly good first-quarter GDP report we got, I think that the sense of urgency has been diminished.</p><p>SCHOTTENFELD: Greg, once the president finishes with the tax cut plan, where do you think he shifts his focus in terms of driving the economy?  The Clinton administration had a very strong technology focus.  And that's how they drove their agenda.  What do you think is going to happen now?</p><p>VALLIERE: Well, a couple of things.  I think their regulatory policy will stay very business-friendly.  We've seen the beginnings of that.  I think that will continue.</p><p>And just to follow up on the other question, I think once we get this tax cut done this year, they'll move on another one next year. An awful lot is going to be left out this year, whether it's the reform of the alternative minimum tax, whether perhaps it's some reduction in the capital gains rate, I think some of that stuff will be in next year's tax bill.</p><p>KEENAN: And, Greg, how is this White House relationship with the Fed and Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan?</p><p>VALLIERE: It's been pretty good.  Obviously, Treasury Secretary O'Neill got off to a rocky start.  I think in the last month or so, he's found solid footing.</p><p>I think Larry Lindsey has been smart enough not to say anything about the Fed in public.  And I think some of the earlier fears that things could get rocky like they were with Bush's father, those fears have not materialized.</p><p>KEENAN: Yeah, they've stopped talking down the economy, it seems.</p><p>VALLIERE: And I think that's important.  I think they don't want that to become a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p><p>KEENAN: OK, thanks, Greg, as always.</p><p>VALLIERE: You bet.</p><p>KEENAN: Have a great weekend.</p><p>VALLIERE: You too. KEENAN: Greg Valliere.</p><p>Coming up next, time for \"Stock Picks\" from our team of experts. Don't go away.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>KEENAN: Time now for \"Stock Picks.\" And we will start with Dennis McKechnie.</p><p>Dennis, what do you like in tech?</p><p>MCKECHNIE: I believe that some of the commodity tech has really come back quite strong.  And some of the tech was short-term over- bought.</p><p>What I'm gravitating to is actually the Internet at this point. AOL would be a buy here.</p><p>KEENAN: It's had already an incredible run-up.</p><p>MCKECHNIE: It's had a good run.  But I think in this context it hasn't made much headway over the past 18 months.  So now growing into its multiples, trading about 30 times 2002.  And it grows at about 30 percent.</p><p>It proved with the quarter that the ad revenue can and will hold up.  I think it's a solid plan, I think terribly aggressive.</p><p>Also Veritas.  I agree that software will be a great place to be. People are still storing their data.  Veritas sells software that coordinates all the data throughout an enterprise.</p><p>And I think there's lots of data being deployed that has not been networked just yet.  And that will be pulled together.  Veritas will do quite well.</p><p>KEENAN: OK.  Two ideas.  Rick, what do you like?</p><p>SCHOTTENFELD: Oh, I already gave mine.  I jumped the gun a little bit.  But just to follow up because he like Veritas, Legato is just -- there used to be a time about a year ago when Legato and Veritas were considered neck-and-neck in terms of where they were. And Legato sort of blew it for a while.  And I think that they're poised to turn around.</p><p>In the valuation gap between the two I think affords a lot of safety.  So that's why we're playing the same theme, just on different valuation models.</p><p>KEENAN: And since you're so cautious on tech, are you buying some other things outside of tech?</p><p>SCHOTTENFELD: Well, I mean, I'm a guy who emphasizes technology. We're buying some other things outside technology.  But I also think that there are opportunities.  I'm buying a small communications IC company called Celeritek because it's fallen so far that it's trading just slightly above its cash.  It's trading around probably 11-and-a- half or 12 today.  And they have $9.00 a share in cash.  They have cab (ph) assets that are probably worth another $6.00 or $7.00.</p><p>And they're taking market share.  They have one business that's growing.  Their IC market for handsets has a book (ph) of one.  And so that's very unusual right now.  So I think that if I can buy some things cheap like that, at least I'm protected on the downside.</p><p>KEENAN: And it's blowing up already.</p><p>SCHOTTENFELD: Yeah, it's already blowing up.</p><p>KEENAN: OK, when we return, we will wrap it up with \"Predictions.\" And we will be joined by CNN's own Myron Kandel. Don't go away.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>KEENAN: Time now for \"Predictions.\" And for that, we are joined as always by our financial editor, Myron Kandel.  And, Myron, what recession?</p><p>MYRON KANDEL, CNN FINANCIAL EDITOR: That's right.  Exactly, Terry.</p><p>You know, I said on March 22 inter-day down at 9,106 for the Dow, that we'd hit bottom.  And now we're 1,600-plus points ahead of there. I said there wasn't going to be a recession. And certainly, the GDP figures that came out on Friday illustrated that.</p><p>My only concern now -- I'm still bullish.  My only concern is that the higher inflation figure that we saw on Friday plus the stronger economy doesn't make it a given that the Fed will cut on May 15.  I still think the Fed will.  I think we'll know better on Friday when the employment figures for April come out.  But still, considerably bullish.</p><p>KEENAN: OK.  Rick?</p><p>SCHOTTENFELD: I think there is still going to be some concern. I think we're still going to see some negative numbers come out of a few companies.  I'm not really going to -- I don't think we're out of the woods yet.</p><p>I'd like to think that maybe we put it a bottom.  But I don't think we're going to run away from this bottom.  And I think that probably stocks hang around these levels, at least for a little while, maybe back a little bit, while we sort of stretch out and get a better lay of the land.</p><p>KEENAN: OK.  David, your prediction?</p><p>JONES: Interestingly, short-term rates came down when we had our surprise mid-April rate cut.  But long-term rates actually went up a bit on the theory we will get some recovery and maybe some inflation. So it's very difficult for the Fed to bring the entire rate structure much lower.  It may be OK because as steep curve is usually a way to predict a rebound someday.  But my theory is it's a while in the distance before we see that pickup.</p><p>KEENAN: Yeah, and those long rates are higher now than they were when the Fed starting cutting at the beginning of the year.  Does that concern the Fed?</p><p>JONES: Well, look at mortgage rates, down to 6.89 in terms of fixed rates, back up to 7.12.  I think it does -- it's a surprise for the Fed.  And the question is how can they move the entire structure lower?</p><p>I think we will get that cut.  But, as I said earlier, only 25 basis points on May 15, maybe even another one.  But it's going to be difficult to move that long-term rate structure down.</p><p>KEENAN: Dennis?</p><p>MCKECHNIE: I see Nasdaq trading at a not-so-tight range of 1,600 to 2,200 between now and July.  I think ironically, and perhaps the big surprise, that the best days for Nasdaq will be the most quiet days in contrast to the typical tech pattern where the quiet news has techs sell off into the summer.  Our quietest days are going to be our best days.</p><p>KEENAN: OK, that's going to be our last word.  Thanks so much, Dennis.</p><p>Thanks, gentlemen.  That's going to do it for this edition of MONEYLINE WEEKEND.  See you next week.</p><p>TO ORDER A VIDEO OF THIS TRANSCRIPT, PLEASE CALL 800-CNN-NEWS OR USE OUR SECURE ONLINE ORDER FORM LOCATED AT <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.fdch.com\">www.fdch.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:42XK-TB30-009B-G55M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3671\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2001 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"04\" year=\"2001\"><dateText>April 28, 2001;

An Indian call center handling customer services for companies that sell products in Europe or a US website tracking browsing histories of Europeans will be impacted.</p><p>The last few days were marked by a huge scramble among businesses big and small to get their new data privacy policies in shape. </p><p>Many have not managed that and are now facing fines of up to (EURO)20 million or 4% of their global annual sales, whichever is bigger. </p><p>Research from consulting firm Capgemini showed 85% of firms said they were not ready for the new law to come into effect, and one in four said they won't be ready until the end of the year.</p><p>European data regulators have signaled they will take compliance seriously. \"Companies that have been making money from our data, have more responsibilities,\" Vera Jourova, Europe's top justice official, said Thursday.</p><p>Privacy advocates have already prepared lawsuits against Facebook, Whatsapp, Instagram, and Google, alleging they are breaking the new rules.</p><p>Businesses can still serve their customers, send them emails, and collect and store their data.

EU has slapped a (EURO)2.4 billion ($2.7 billion) antitrust fine on Google, and fined Facebook (EURO)110 million ($122 million) for misleading officials about its takeover of WhatsApp.</p><p>Experts say that companies that have taken privacy seriously should find the new rules easy to comply with.</p><p>\"If you are generally good with data protection, you are probably going to be alright with GDPR ... my concern is the companies that have never even thought about this and now are scrambling,\" said Richard Merrygold, data protection expert. </p><p>But for some companies, the expense of making sure they comply with the new rules was simply too much. Several have announced they are retreating from Europe or cutting down on services they offer their European customers compared to the rest of the world. </p><p>\"The substantial potential fines and enormous effort involved in becoming and continuing to be compliant will clearly act as a deterrent [to investing in Europe]. Ultimately, they may simply decide it's just not worth it,\" said Chris L. Allyn, a partner at Moye White, a law firm. </p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

GDPR - the EU law designed to give people more control over their personal data in the internet age - celebrates its first birthday today. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The arrival of the General Data Protection Regulation was heralded with a high-profile public awareness campaign that informed people of their new rights around their personal information and warned businesses of their responsibility about how they used this information.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The acronym has had greater significance in Ireland as it shone a spotlight on the State's regulator, the Data Protection Commission (DPC). </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It gave the Irish watchdog the power under the law to supervise some of the world's wealthiest companies given that internet giants such as Facebook and Google run their EU businesses out of Ireland. </p><p>A Dublin-based address brought them an Irish regulator. </p><p>If the fines under the law initially made Silicon Valley executives sweat - and so they should given the commission's ability to impose penalties of up to 4 per cent of turnover - they may have breathed a little easier in the past year as the Irish regulator has not yet imposed a fine under GDPR.</p><p>However, that might be about to change. Helen Dixon, head of the DPC, expects the first draft decision on enforcement action to go to the European Data Protection Board, the independent umbrella body for national data protection authorities, in July on whether a big tech company should be fined under GDPR. </p><p>Big tech companies have become \"combative\" in correspondence with the commission with \"constant querying\" and \"lots of flags being raised at every turn in terms of how we are proceeding\", she says. </p><p>The size of the multinationals' teams they meet has increased with new personnel being introduced pointing to irrefutable evidence that the multinationals are \"lawyering up\" in anticipation of fines, says Dixon.</p><p>She is focused on reaching a first set of draft decisions over the coming months on some of the 19 statutory inquiries into big tech companies out of 54 investigations that her office is conducting. For her, the process has to be methodical and must take time given the precedent-setting value of enforcement and the potential for litigation challenging her decisions.</p><p>\"Ultimately, what I can tell you I am about and what this office is about is not meeting artificial deadlines of anniversaries. It is not about getting out there to get a headline that I issued the first fine and then to have it appealed the next day and my decision not to stand up,\" she says. </p><p>Other European regulators have imposed fines. According to the Brussels-based board, there were 11 imposed under GDPR as of the end of March totalling EUR 55 million in penalties. </p><p>The biggest was against Google which was slapped with a EUR 50 million fine by the French regulator CNIL, a day before supervision of the Californian company moved to the Irish regulator. </p><p>This week, the DPC opened an investigation into Google Ireland, its first against the internet behemoth, in relation to the same area that caused the French regulator concerns - the sharing of personal data through internet advertising. </p><p>Google makes billions of euro year each year from real-time ad auctions where companies bid to place ads in front of users based on their web browsing. What is at issue is how Google processes and retains personal information on the internet histories and habits of users, what it tells users about that process, and how it keeps information about their activities to a minimum as it sells ads targeting them. </p><p> Dixon sees the investigative intent of the commission's office in opening 19 inquiries into suspected data infringements by big tech firms such as Facebook, Apple and Twitter as a better gauge of how seriously the commission is taking its responsibilities under GDPR rather than the absence of fines.</p><h>'Finite resources'</h><p> \"In opening and deploying what are finite resources to any of these investigations we have opened, we have to be operating on the suspicion or preliminary evidence that there may be infringements of the GDPR at play,\" Dixon says, sitting in a boardroom of her Georgian offices on Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin.</p><p>\"On the basis of statistics of previous investigations we have opened, it would be very unusual if none of them ultimately yielded evidence of wrongdoing under GDPR.\"</p><p>To stress the importance of policing alleged wrongdoing, Dixon says that more than 80 of the commission's 137 staff are \"on the front line of enforcing GDPR\", handling complaints and investigations.</p><p>Unlike other State regulators with a specific focus on a sector or profession, the commission has one of the widest ranges of supervision for an Irish watchdog. Where the Central Bank monitors banks and financial institutions, the commission regulates the handling of personal information across a broad remit, from Facebook to the Catholic Church to your local corner shop to households with expansive CCTV systems. </p><p>Dixon says that the \"over-zealous\" interpretation of GDPR requirements in some instances has shown that, even with the lack of fines, people are paying attention to and taking the new rules seriously. </p><p>She cites An Post's removal of public bins in the GPO in Dublin as an example of a company going too far. An Post thought that rubbish containing personal details in their bins could fall foul of the new law.</p><p>\"It is very hard to fathom that one but there was an absence of common sense there,\" Dixon says. </p><p>The number of complaints received is another indication of the public's awareness of the one-year-old rules. The commission is receiving an average of about 633 complaints a month and has received 6,624 in total. It receives in the region of 20,000 emails and calls a year. </p><p>They can range from queries as basic as not being able to contact a data protection officer in a company to complaints about ending an online subscription and the over-reaching demands for verifying ID that might come with that.</p><p>Complaints this year have included a gravestone company who wrote to a family suffering a bereavement offering a cheap headstone for the dead relative. Another involved a multinational using a customer's mobile number taken to verify her account to later ask her out on a date. </p><p>There are more egregious examples. A mobile phone user complained that her ex-partner masqueraded as her to gain control of her telephone number, giving him access to future texts and calls - all because the phone company's customer service agent failed to carry out a verification process properly. </p><p>Dixon says the commission's broad range of responses under the new privacy law would ultimately show \"a much richer picture to measure across the board what the effects of GDPR are\". </p><p>She took exception to a long, online article published on Politico Europe last month that criticised the commission's failure to take enforcement action against a big tech firm and questioned the State's commitment to regulate GDPR when it had \"wooed top Silicon Valley firms\" to create jobs in Ireland.</p><p>Asked if there was a connection between the two, Dixon replied: \"Absolutely none.\"</p><p>The independence of data protection authorities from governments is \"poorly understood,\" she says, noting that the commission's role in fact includes the regulation of Government departments and State agencies. </p><h>Biometric data</h><p> One of its investigations was into the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection relating to the collection of people's biometric data for the public services card. Another was into CCTV schemes across the State and the use of video technology by An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and local authorities. </p><p>She notes the \"ramping up\" of the State's investment in the commission since she was appointed in 2014 was an example of the Government's commitment to EU-wide regulation out of Dublin. </p><p> The regulator's budget has risen from EUR 1.9 million to EUR 15.2 million within that timeframe. Dixon plans to recruit another 30 staff this year and wants another budget increase from Government for 2020.</p><p>\"We're the most rapidly growing data protection authority in the EU,\" she said.</p><p>In spite of this, some feel that the regulator is not hiring at the right level though. Simon McGarr, director of Data Compliance Europe, said the commission needs to pay higher salaries if it wants to recruit the best staff. Paying a senior lawyer a starting salary of EUR 66,000 to regulate the richest companies in the world is not enough, he argues. </p><p>McGarr has suggested that staff at the commission should be paid outside civil service pay rates like at the National Treasury Management Agency. Long-term retention of staff would be critical to its capacity to investigate and enforce data protection laws, he says. </p><p>\"The DPC should be considered a specialist case with very highly skilled but also highly paid people outside the civil service wage structure. It is such a critical office for the State,\" he said.</p><p>TJ McIntyre, a law lecturer at UCD and chairman of Digital Rights Ireland, says the commission's staff levels need to be increased to a minimum of 200 to become an effective regulator.</p><p>On the lack of fines under GDPR, he agreed that the Irish legal environment makes regulators \"gun shy\" when it comes to enforcement, while the \"institutional knowledge\" built up from aggressive action over time \"is not there\". The new law's fining powers is putting the regulator into new territory.</p><p>\"They are being understandably cautious about dotting the 'i's and crossing the 't's to avoid the possibility of these decisions being successfully appealed or judicially reviewed,\" he said.</p><p>Dixon sees lots of unfinished business and a commission in transition. She wants to extend her role into a second five-year term when her current one ends in September \"to continue out the work that we have started\".</p><p>Given the anticipated enforcement actions, year two of GDPR looks set to bring a whole new level of dread to Irish-based big tech firms.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-1.3904340</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W64-0KM1-JC8Y-82M5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1657\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 25, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Designed to give people more control over their data, GDPR represents a challenge to organisations, who must bring their data protection policies into line with the new regulations or face substantial penalties. GDPR compels organisations to secure clearer consent for using people's information, and introduces tougher fines for failing to protect people's data. This hub collates all the latest GDPR news as it happens, but please follow these links for more information onwhat the GDPR is[1], andhow to prepare for it[2]. Separate facts from the hype about GDPR with our article puncturing marketing hyperbole[3].29/10/18: Portuguese hospital hit with \u20ac400,000 fine for two GDPR violationsThe Portuguese data watchdog applied a \u20ac400,000 fine on a Portuguese hospital in July for two violations of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The Portuguese Data Protection Authority (CNPD) found the Barreiro Hospital had granted nine social workers access to patients' clinical data, while 985 users were registered for doctor-level access despite only 296 physicians working at the hospital. The hospital is appealing the fine, issued on 17 July but not publicly announced at the time, and may even launch a judicial challenge, according to Portuguese publication Publico[4]. Two separate penalties were imposed after the data watchdog inspected the hospital in early July, with a \u20ac300,000 fine applied for failing to respect patient confidentiality, and limiting inappropriate access to patient data. </p><p>The second fine of \u20ac100,000 was imposed for the hospital's inability to ensure the integrity of data security in their system. \"The Centro Hospitalar Barreiro Montijo (CHBM) does not follow the assumptions and understanding of the National Data Protection Commission (CNPD) on this matter,\" the hospital's board of directors said. \"We are currently preparing a judicial challenge.\" The regulator explained that an audit showed a test profile on the hospital's system granted \"unrestricted\" access to clinical data for patients. According to the CNPD the hospital acknowledged the existence of unused profiles on the system, but said they were \"temporary profiles\" for doctors working on a contractual basis. The fine represents one of the first publicly-announced GDPR fines issued since the regulations came into force on 25 May this year. The figure is small against the \u20ac20 million (or 4% of global annual turnover) maximum that can be levied against an organisation, but indicates regulators may take a measured approach to enforcing GDPR.24/09/2018: AggregateIQ hit with ICO's first GDPRenforcement noticeAggregateIQ(AIQ) is the first company facing a potential fine by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) for GDPR non-compliance. An enforcement notice sent in July said the firm must stop processing the personal data of UK or EU citizens obtained from political groups, or face a heavy financial penalty. AIQhas chosen to appeal this notice. According to Cambridge Analytica whistle-blower Chris Whylie, AIQ used data obtained by Cambridge Analytica to build an app that targeted Republican voters in the 2016 US election. It ran a similar campaign during the Brexit Referendum where it was paid 2.7m by the Vote Leave and BeLeave campaigns and reportedly was involved in political actions in Northern Ireland. Although all of these relate to pre-GDPR activity, the ICO said the company doesn't seem to have changed its practices since GDPR came into force in May and so it's now investigating how the company is collecting and processing data. The company is denying any involvement with Cambridge Analytica and Facebook, saying its processes of collecting data are completely transparent. \"AggregateIQ has never been and is not a part of Cambridge Analytica or SCL. Aggregate IQ has never entered into a contract with Cambridge Analytica. Chris Wylie has never been employed by AggregateIQ,' the company said in a statement. \"AggregateIQ has never managed, nor did we ever have access to, any Facebook data or database allegedly obtained improperly by Cambridge Analytica.\" Although the enforcement notice was issued two months ago[5], it only emerged publicly in the last few days. The Canadian company was given 30 days to audit its processes before the ICO fined the firm up to 17 million, or 4% of the company's annual global turnover, whichever is higher. But this timetable is suspended pending an appeal being heard. 14/09/2018:Just a third of companies are complying with subject access requests The majority of companies around the world are failing to fulfill subject access requests (SARs)[6] in time - contravening one of the most important provisions boosted under GDPR. Under Articles 15 and 20 of the new data protection laws organisations must return the information they hold on a user or customer on request within one month. But research shows just 35% of EU-based companies are fulfilling SARs within the legal timeframe, which is also true for 50% of companies based outside of Europe.The findings by cloud and data firm Talend are especially concerning given SARs are not a fresh provision under GDPR, rather the new regulations, which came into force on 25 May, simply reduced the window from 40 calendar days to 30. \"GDPR requires insight into company data and its governance,\" said research director at 451 Research Penny Jones. \"Recent research, including that done by Talend and separate reports by 451 Research, has found that while many organizations understand the importance of GDPR, many are still not taking their data seriously in terms of the technologies and processes they have in place. \"As a result, many businesses are falling short of their GDPR obligations. They can lack the proper methods for storing, organizing or retrieving data in line with the regulation's requirements.\" Talend conducted market research between June and September with 103 companies operating in Europe, of which 70% were EU-based and the remainder based elsewhere. Retailers performed the worst, with 76% failing to return information within the 30-day limit, while financial services firms, which performed the best, still only managed a 50% success rate. Of companies complying with the provision, 65% responded within ten days, while the average response time was 21 days. The company also found businesses which began life offline, and thus have to contend with legacy systems, were more sluggish to respond. Meanwhile streaming services, mobile banking and tech companies generally responded within one day, suggesting \"digital services companies are more agile\" when it comes to compliance. \"GDPR presents an opportunity to engage with customers and build loyalty. It's vital for businesses in the digital era to have a 360-degree view of customers,\" said Talend's senior director of data governance products Jean-Michel Franco. \"Businesses must ensure that data is consolidated and stored in a transparent and shareable way. \"What's more, GDPR's one-month time limit should be viewed as an absolute deadline rather than a target.\" IT Pro asked the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO)[7] for its view on the findings, and the recourse available when SARs are not fulfilled by organisations in time, but the ICO has yet to respond. 10/09/2018: Shareholder sues own company over preparation claims A US-based firm, its CEO and CFO are being sued for damages by a shareholder over claims they issued misleading statements about the company's GDPR-readiness. Shareholder Arun Bhattacharya has alleged the information and data measurement firm Nielsen Holdings misled shareholders, and the wider public, about the potential impact of GDPR on revenue streams - as well as its own preparation activities. As reported by Strategic Legal[8], the company relies on consumer data provided by third party data aggregators such as Facebook to generate consumer metrics for its clients according to a Complaint filed in New York.Filing the suit, Bhattacharya accused the company of playing down the impact of GDPR on revenue, and issuing false statements about how the new data protection legislation would affect the business. Between February and July, the Complaint says, Nielsen \"repeatedly assured investors that its measurement and analytics services provided to customers were continuously viable and strong\", and that large data sets provided by partners like Facebook would not be limited. But on 26 July the company published financial results for the second quarter of 2018, showing it had missed revenue targets, and publicly-stated that GDPR had in fact had a much bigger impact on business performance than initially presumed. The class action lawsuit, filed on behalf of everybody who purchased a share in the company between 8 February and 25 July, alleges a breach of the 1934 Securities Exchange Act - with Bhattacharya accusing the company of lying to shareholders. Despite being devised by the European Union, companies in the US must still adhere to the new data protection laws, which came into force on 25 May, if they process data involving citizens of European Union or associated countries. This has actually led many American-based companies, including the LA Times, from implementing filters that prohibit online access to European users. \"Any company outside of the EU that was in any doubt about whether GDPR applied to them should be taking heed and acknowledging that if you process or store EU citizen data, GDPR is a business risk that needs to be managed,\" said RSA Security's Field CTO EMEA Rashmi Knowles. \"As such, it's a final warning to all organisations that securing personal data is no longer just the responsibility of the IT team, but a board level issue that impacts every aspect of a company from profitability to shareholder confidence.\" 05/09/2018: 'Human error' to blame for most data incidents Data security incidents reported to the Information Commissioner's Office[9] (ICO) have risen by 75% in the last two years, according to new analysis, with the vast majority pinned on 'human error'. While 2,214 incidents reported last year could be attributed to incompetence or error, only 292 were seen as being related with malicious activity, a Freedom of Information (FOI) request[10] submitted by Kroll, a corporate investigations and consultancy firm, revealed. Among the most common incidents were 447 instances of confidential data being emailed to the incorrect recipient, 438 instances of loss or theft of paperwork, and 164 instances of data left in an insecure location. With GDPR now requiring organisations of all sizes to report all potential data breaches to the ICO within 72 hours, the number of recorded incidents is only set to rise in the coming months and years. \"Reporting data breaches wasn't mandatory for most organisations before the GDPR came into force, so while the data is revealing, it only gives a snapshot into the true picture of breaches suffered by organisations in the UK,\" said managing director and EMEA leader for Kroll's cyber risk practice Andrew Beckett to CBR Online[11]. \"The recent rise in the number of reports is probably due to organisations' gearing up for the GDPR as much as an increase in incidents.Now that the regulation is in force, we would expect to see a significant surge in the number of incidents reported as the GDPR imposes a duty on all organisations to report certain types of personal data breach.\" Kroll's analysis echoes similar findings by law firm EMW, whose FOI request revealed the number of complaints filed to the UK data watchdog had doubled since GDPR came into force on 25 May. According to EMW the number of complaints between 25 May and 3 July climbed from 2,417 in 2017 to 6.281 this year as organisations succumbed to mandatory reporting for data incidents. 28/08/2018: Data complaints to ICO double after GDPR GDPR is having an impact: the number of complaints filed to the UK's data protection watchdog has doubled since the General Data Protection Regulation came into force at the end of May. That's according to figures obtained via a freedom of information act request[12] filed by law firm EMW, which reveal the number of complaints to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) between 25 May and 3 July this year climbed to 6,281 versus just 2,417 during the same period last year. The law firm pinned the increase on individuals having more awareness of their data rights, as well as companies being forced to report their own data breaches. \"A huge increase in complaints is very worrying for many businesses, considering the scale of the fines that can now be imposed,\" EMW principal James Geary said in a statement. Fines have increased from a maximum 500,000 \u2014 doled out to Facebook earlier this year \u2014 to \u20ac20 million or 4% of global turnover. \"We have seen that many businesses are currently struggling to manage the burden created by the GDPR, whether or not that relates to the implementation of the GDPR or reportable data security breach incidents,\" Geary added. The data watchdog is one such organisation feeling the heat from GDPR, though it told the Financial Times[13] it's ready for the increased work and already hiring staff to meet the increased demand, with EMW's data request revealing the watchdog's staff would increase from 530 full-time employees to 720. 22/08/2018: Many organisations would fail GDPR audit It's been months since the GDPR's 25 May deadline and yet nearly a third of organisations are still unprepared for the EU's data regulations. This is according to a survey compiled by Imperva, the cybersecurity authority, that suggests many of these organisations are still unsure they comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The survey was conducted at the Infosecurity Europe 2018 trade show, the largest security focused conference in Europe, and is based on responses from 185 attendees that included IT professionals, managers and executives. The results of which revealed that 28% of organisations do not feel completely compliant with the EU's data regulations.\"The deadline has now come and gone, yet the study shows that many organisations aren't sure they have achieved GDPR compliance,\" said Terry Ray, CTO of Imperva. \"Any company that put GDPR off until the last minute now realises compliance cannot be achieved overnight. It does not surprise me that many organisations feel unsure about the idea of a GDPR audit. The truth is many would fail.\" This lack of confidence with GDPR compliance was highlighted in the survey with less than one-fifth of respondents said they were not confident of passing their first GDPR audit and less than half said they were. Assessing personal data rights the survey also asked if the respondents knew where all users personal data resided on their respective systems, worryingly, while only a third said they knew the location, more than half said they would need an extra three months to get their data storage in order. There was more confidence when dealing with individual data requests, with 90% claiming they could easily respond to anyone wanting to obtain personal information held by the organisation. In fact, 57% said that their organisation had already received such a request. 21/08/2018: Huge spike in patient safety incidents pinned on mandatory reporting The National Pharmacy Association (NPA) has pinpointed GDPR as one of the main factors behind the substantial rise in the number of patient safety incidents reported in the second quarter of 2018. The number of incidents reported increased by 64% in April to June, against the first three months of 2018, according to the NPA's latest Medication Safety Officer (MSO) quarterly report, while the submission of reports in June doubled. The report attributing this spike to mandatory reporting of certain incidents and breaches as stipulated by the new data protection laws, which came into effect on 25 May. \"It is important to reiterate that pharmacy teams are required to have robust procedures in place for investigating and reporting data breaches,\" said the NPA's director of pharmacy Leyla Hannbeck. \"Under GDPR, some data breaches require pharmacy contractors to notify the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). \"I also recommend every pharmacy maintains a log of all data breaches, including when the data breach occurred and action taken, as required under GDPR.\" Hannbeck said medication dispensing errors, which involved a breach of patient confidentiality, comprised eight percent of all incidents reported to the NPA. Common errors included giving medication to the wrong patient due to a similar sounding name, bagging up medication and attaching a repeat prescription slip in another patient's bag, delivering medication to the incorrect recipient, and printing incorrect address labels. More generally, the most common incidents identified between April and June were drugs labelled with an incorrect, or unclear, required dosage, as well as patients being given the wrong drug or medication. The majority of incidents led to no harm being caused to the patient, 57%, while 29% of incidents resulted in near misses. The remainder caused either low to patients (10%) or moderate harm (four percent). 06/08/2018: Facebook data debacle pushes Brits to use GDPR British consumers are a fan of GDPR, especially after revelations surrounding political data firmCambridge Analytica's use of Facebook user data[14]. That's according to research on the General Data Protection Regulation from SAS, which shows that people are \"activating\" their personal data rights faster than expected. Here's what that means: last year, SAS surveyed Brits asking what they thought about GDPR, and when they exercise privacy protections such as the right to access data held about them, as well as query and erase it. In 2017, 42% said they expected to make use of such rights within a year, but the latest SAS survey shows that 31% already have two months on from the formal arrival of GDPR. Plus, we're on track to hit 55% within the first year. What's sparked the change? SAS suggested it could be down to recent data scandals, notably the debacle surrounding Facebook and Cambridge Analytica. The survey found that 88% of those asked were aware of the major scandal, and of those who knew about the incident, 72% said they'd changed data permissions with companies they use, or will share less data in the future. A third say they have removed their data from social media or retailers that misuse it for marketing, or plan to do so in the future. 'Businesses that fail to respect their customers or their data risk losing both, sacrificing their competitive advantage and hurting the bottom line,\" said David Smith, Head of GDPR technology at SAS UK and Ireland. \"Transparent data management and analytics are crucial, not only to achieve compliance but to provide personalised customer experiences that make consumers more willing to share their data.' Half of those surveyed said they would \"activate their data rights\" after one privacy mistake from a company, though that's not necessarily shown in reality - there's not exactly very many high-profile companies knocked out of business through data misuse, Cambridge Analytica aside. 31/07/2018:ICO reveals fivefold rise in self-reported data breaches post-GDPR The number of self-reported data breaches have soared since GDPR came into force in May, according to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). The first full month of GDPR enforcement, June 2018, saw 1,792 instances of self-reported breaches - approximately five times more than the 367 that occured in April 2018, the UK data protection watchdog has revealed. Under GDPR, data controllers must report any breaches of personal data at their organisation to the ICO within 72 hours of being made aware of the breach. The ICO's head of personal data breach reporting team, Laura Middleton,revealed that figures for April were consistent with those for the previous month, 398, while self-reported breaches doubled in May, with 657 reports received. She attributed the increase between April and May to a few days of GDPR enforcement, and the fact organisations had been preparing their internal self-reporting mechanisms for the 25 May deadline for GDPR compliance. She said many were self-reporting early based on breaches under the previous Data Protection Act 1998. \"We expected to receive a significant increase in the number of breaches compared to before 25 May,\" Middleton said, identifying health, education, general business, solicitors and local government as the main sectors that had suffered data leaks. She continued to outline a few tips for data controllers whose organisations may have suffered a breach, including that it's better to report over the phone line introduced last November[15], and that the ICO does not differentiate between 'formal' and 'informal' reports. \"As I hope we have emphasised today, not every personal data breach needs to be reported,\" she continued. \"So controllers should assess the likelihood and severity of risk to individuals before making that decision to report. \"You can call us for advice, but we're not going to make that decision for you to report.\" Elsewhere during the webinar, Middleton revealed that every case the ICO receives is ideally looked at either on the same day, or shortly afterwards, before adding \"we are looking to act on very serious data breaches reported as soon as possible\". 17/07/2018:Just 20% of UK companies are now compliant with GDPR Only 21% of UK organisations consider themselves to be GDPR-ready, despite the data protection law having come into force on 25 May. Meanwhile, EU-based organisations, excluding the UK, are twice as likely to consider themselves compliant than US firms are, at 27% versus 12%, according to new research[16]. Another 27% haven't actually reached the implementation phase of their compliance strategy, according to security firm TrustArc's survey of 600 IT and legal professionals with a role in data protection policy in the UK, US and EU, conducted in the middle of June and published this week. Moreover, whilethe majority of UK organisations expect to be fully compliant by the end of 2018, 25% anticipate not being compliant until 2019 or beyond. \"While the amount of effort was immense for the deadline of 25 May, there is substantive work yet to complete to achieve initial compliance as well as monitor and maintain compliance on a repeatable and efficient ongoing basis,\" said TrustArc's CEO, Chris Babel. The lack of preparedness across the UK, EU and US should be of concern given the new set of data protection laws carry with them a maximum fine of up to \u20ac20 million, or 4% of global annual turnover, whichever is higher, for breaches. But fines haven't played as prominent a role as the press coverage has warranted, according to the researchers, with only 38% of UK organisations saying financial penalties comprised one of the key motivators for investing in compliance. Rather, the biggest motivators included meeting customer expectations, true for 58% of UK companies, while supporting company values, 47%, and meeting partner or third-party expectations, 41%, comprised the other main drivers. More than two-thirds of companies have spent above $100,000 to date on compliance, and 67% expect to continue spending this amount through to the end of the year, investing in internal and external personnel, training, consulting, legal advice, technology and new tools. Most respondents saw thenew data protection laws as having a positive impact on business, compared to 15% claiming GDPR will affect them negatively. Medium-sized companies were most likely to see GDPR as a benefit, with 71% receiving the data protection laws positively, while the same was only true for little over half of large businesses, 51%. \"There is a lot work yet to be done in order for all companies to achieve full GDPR compliance, as well as for them to monitor, maintain and demonstrate ongoing compliance in a repeatable and efficient manner,\" Babel added. \"The good news is that companies realise that the effort and expense will have a positive effect on their businesses and is well worth the investment.\" 05/07/2018:AI searches for GDPR compliance in tech firms T... Tech firms do not 'fully comply' with GDPR according to researchers who are training artificial intelligence to sift through the T... of 14 biggest technology companies. A team from the European Institute in Florence analysed the privacy policies of 14 popular online companies, including Facebook, Google and Amazon, taking the requirement's of the GDPR as a basis. Based on their analysis the team are now training an artificial intelligence tool called \"Claudette\" to sift through the terms and conditions of each companies privacy policy to check for illegal irregularities. The project is supported by the BEUC, a pan-European consumer group, is called \"Claudette Meets GDPR\"[17]. It suggested that the privacy policies of the 14 firms analysed did not fully meet the requirements of the GDPR. In total, all the policies analysed amounted to 3,659 sentences and 401 of those sentences were marked as containing unclear language. A further 1,240 contained clauses the researchers deemed \"potentially problematic\" or clauses that were providing \"insufficient\" information. \"A little over a month after the GDPR became applicable, many privacy policies may not meet the standard of the law. This is very concerning. It is key that enforcement authorities take a close look at this,\" said Monique Goyens, BEUC's director general. \"This innovative research demonstrates that just as Artificial Intelligence and automated decision-making will be the future for companies from all kinds of sectors, AI can also be used to keep companies in check and ensure people's rights are respected.\" The use of AI as an asset for consumer groups to monitor the market and ensure infringements do not go unnoticed could potentially be an ironic twist in the continuing debate about the tech industry's use of data, where technology is turned around as a tool used to govern its itself. \"We expect companies to respect consumers' privacy and the new data protection rights. In the future, Artificial Intelligence will help identify infringements quickly and on a massive scale, making it easier to start legal actions as a result.\" Goyens added. The way in which big tech firms have set out T... has come under heavy scrutiny since the GDPR came into force. Recently, a Norwegian Consumer Council accused Microsoft, Google and Facebook[18] of deliberately pushing users away from selecting privacy-centric options within their services. 26/06/2018: Gov launches review of exemptions to data handling fees The UK government has said it will review the provisions that exempt some businesses and organisations from paying fees to handle user data, in an ongoing effort to ensure data protection enforcement is adequately funded. Every business and sole trader that handles personal user data is legally required to pay a fee to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), the UK's data protection watchdog, used to fund day to day work and legal action against malpractice. Under the Data Protection Act 1998, organisations were required to register with the ICO and pay a two-tier annual fee of either 35 or 500, based on turnover and size. Following a change to the fee structure[19] with the introduction of the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) in May, businesses now adhere to a three-tier system of payments of either 40, 60 or 2,900 depending on the size and turnover of the company. Most businesses now pay either 40, if they're a micro business of fewer than 10 employees or have a turnover less than 632,000, or 60 if they're a small business of fewer than 250 employees or have less than 36 million. Currently, only public authorities are exempt from paying fees, although charities and small occupational pension schemes are only required to pay the tier 1 fee (40), regardless of their size or turnover. While the review will seek feedback on these exemptions, attention is largely being focused on more detailed exemptions, specifically those for people or organisations that process personal data for only 'core business purposes'. These include staff administration such as payroll, advertising and public relations related to a business' own activities, and processing for the purpose of keeping accounts and records. The government review is assessing whether these exemptions are still appropriate given the fee change, which it says could lead to either new exemptions being created, or current rules being restricted. \"Given that most of the exemptions date back many years, and to a time when digital processing of personal data was not undertaken on anything near the scale it is today, the Government considers that there is merit in reviewing the exemptions to ensure that they are still appropriate to the current time, and fit for the digital age,\" the consultation explains. \"We have invited respondents to detail any other data controllers or processing that they consider appropriate for an exemption.\" Another exemption under review is the processing of personal data for the purposes of maintaining a public register, which is based on the 1984 Data Protection Act. Initially intended to cover those responsible for m The exemption from processing personal data for the purposes of maintaining a public register is also under review, as it was first introduced under the 1984 Data Protection Act. The government has suggested that elected officials, which it says act like data controllers when conducting casework for constituents, should be exempt from paying annual fees as their work is regarded as a public function. Public feedback is being welcomed until the 1 August 2018, which can be submitted through an online form available here[20]. 01/06/2018:European Data Protection Board backs ban on 'cookie walls' 'Cookie walls' should be banned under new ePrivacy rules as they are not compatible with GDPR, according to the European Data Protection Board (EDPB). In a statement on the anticipated revision to the EU's ePrivacy Directive, the EDPB, the official body tasked with overseeing the consistent application of the new data protection laws, called for a strengthening in how user consent is obtained[21]and bolstering privacy in electronic communications. Cookie walls, which are deployed by websites on the condition users consent to storing cookies on their device, was referenced directly alongside tracking technologies in general, as the EDPB said GDPR's requirement for organisations to obtain \"a freely-given consent\" should \"prevent service providers from including cookie walls for their users\". \"In order for consent to be freely given as required by the GDPR,\" the statement continued, \"access to services and functionalities must not be made conditional on the consent of a user to the processing of personal data or the processing of information related to or processed by the terminal equipment of end-users, meaning that cookie walls should be explicitly prohibited.\" The text for the new ePrivacy Regulation is yet to be finalised by the EU parliament despite being first proposed by the European Commission in early 2017. These are tailored specifically to cover electronic communications, where GDPR covers personal data, but delays in its drafting mean the exact form it will take has yet to be established. Drafted in a bid to replace the existing Cookie Law[22], these new regulations will bring service providers within the scope of the EU's ePrivacy rules for the first time. A submission from the UK data regulator the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) to the EU's consultation on the Regulation said the revision should \"achieve a proportionate balance\" between privacy rights and \"legitimate interests of information society services\". The EDPB, set up on 25 May to coincide with GDPR coming into force, is an EU body tasked with applying and regulating the new set of data protection laws consistently across member states; comprising the head of each nation's regulator, among others. The UK, however, was recently informed by the EU's chief negotiator in Brexit talks, Michel Barnier, that it will be relegated to \"third country\" status[23], and that the ICO will no longer have a decision-making seat on the body. 30/05/2018: GDPR risks helping hackers hide from police says Whois The EU has gifted cyber criminals with data protection, according to the owners of Whois, a service used by the police to check the legitimacy of websites. Whois is owned by Icann, which is a nonprofit organisation for internet namespaces, and its lawyers Brian E. Finch and Steven P. Farmer wrote a letter to the Wall Street Journal[24] entitled '\"The EU's gift to Cybercriminals\" in which the pair claim hackers will be harder to catch under the new legislation. \"Police will be deprived of quick access to vital data that severely hinders efforts to identify and stop illicit activity. The EU regulatory box will make it harder than ever to catch hackers,\" they wrote. Whois has been forced to remove most of the information on its sites, such as the display names, email addresses and phone numbers of some websites, to comply with GDPR legislation. Icann had asked for a delay to comply with GDPR, but the request was turned down. Speaking to the BBC, Mr Farmer said that the lack of guidance given by the EU could potentially make companies extremely cautious about the regulation, because \"the consequences of getting it wrong are so serious\", and that companies are being \"extremely conservative in interpreting the law\". \"It's regrettable we didn't have guidance on the key principles,\" he said. Whois is not just used by law enforcement but is also a popular service for cybersecurity companies. Nik Whitfield, who is the chief executive of cyber-security company Panaseer, said he had used Whois to help companies spot dodgy emails. \"The service is valuable for protection as it helps provide context around whether an external website is legitimate or potentially unsafe,\" he told the BBC. 29/05/2018:GPs 'lack awareness' of GDPR despite NHS drive to share patient data GPs' awareness of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which came into force last Friday, is low despite an NHS drive to use patients' personal data to improve healthcare. New findings show that awareness of the new rules governing data protection, which can see organisations fined up to 4% of their global annual turnover or\u20ac20 millionfor infringements, is low among doctors serving as the first port of call for many patients. Nearly one in six GPs and one in 10 GP principals had never heard of the term, while a quarter of GPs had heard of it, \"but not much more than that\", while a further 14% had only heard of GDPR in the media. The new findings, based on a survey of 1,018 GPs across England by healthcare research firm medeConnect, come as NHS England has launched a six-week drive across commercial radio, national, and web advertising, to raise public awareness of data-sharing in light of GDPR, as well as promote itsnational opt-out tool launched last week[25]. The new tool, which is expected to be enforced by all healthcare providers by 2020, will allow patients across England to opt out of sharing their confidential patient information with NHS organisations for research and planning purposes. As part of the 'Your Data Matters' campaign, run by the NHS and Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) - the health service will initially focus on GDPR before promoting its opt-out tool from early June. The opt-out tool was based on recommendations by the National Data Guardian Dame Fiona Caldicott in a review published in 2016. \"Sharing information between health and care professionals can be lifesaving by quickly providing staff with the details they need, from patient histories to previous test results and care plans,\" said Dr Simon Eccles, the NHS's chief clinical information officer (CCIO). \"This campaign will highlight to the public how the health and care system uses their data, safely and securely, to improve the care they receive, plan services and research new treatments and to tell the public 'their data matters to the NHS'.\" Dame Caldicott, meanwhile, said: \"I welcome the progress we are seeing to help people understand how health and care data may be used and what choices they have. These are important steps to build the vital foundation of public trust for the use of such data, which holds benefits for all of us - from researchers making breakthroughs in life-saving treatments, to better planning of services, to regulators seeing things going wrong promptly.\" But medeConnect's findings raise concerns as to how aware practitioners are themselves about the tougher regulations they must now adhere to. Due to the structure of the NHS, most GPs - approximately 75% - are considered self-employed independent contractors, with each practice acting as an independent business. The survey found that fewer than half of GPs had discussed GDPR within their practices or primary care organisation, with the same being true for 62% of GP principals. Of the GPs who had discussed it, 65% said the practice manager would be responsible for GDPR compliance, while 28% said the burden would fall on either themselves or another GP working in the practice. The main implications of GDPR, according to 26% of GPs, would be more work or bureaucracy, followed by 17% citing an extra financial burden or loss of earnings, while only 1% believed GDPR would be a positive development. GPs were targeted as part of awider awareness campaign by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS)[26], supported by the Department for Health (DfH) and the ICO. This included a toolkit that was shared with a number of organisations, including the Royal College for General Practitioners (RCGP), according to NHS Digital. A greater onus is being placed on awareness among the public, as well as within the health service, in light of an array of digital tools the NHS is building as it increasingly embraces technology. For instance, NHS Digital last month presented plans to roll out a digital citizen ID for patients across the UK - with'video selfies' touted as a potential verification tool[27]. Meanwhile, prime minister Theresa May has pledged to fundmore use of AI in public healthcare, drawing on the NHS's huge volume of data[28]to better predict cancer and plan treatment for patients. However, such endeavours rely on GDPR-compliant data-sharing, as well as protecting that data against hackers or misuse.All 200 NHS trusts failed cyber security standards earlier this year[29], and the government hopes to mitigate cyber security issues witha mass upgrade to Windows 10 in the next two years[30]. NHS England, DCMS, DfH, the ICO and RCGP were approached for comment.

The regulations prescribe a utopian data future where consumers can refuse companies access to their personally identifiable information (PII). Although the enforcement deadline has passed, the technical infrastructure and manpower needed to meet these requirements still do not exist in most companies today. Coincidentally, the barriers to GDPR compliance are also bottlenecks of widespread AI adoption. Despite the hype, enterprise AI is still nascent: Companies may own petabytes of data that can be used for AI, but fully digitizing that data, knowing what the data tables actually contain and understanding who, where and how to access that data remains a herculean coordination effort for even the most empowered internal champion. It\u2019s no wonder that many scrappy AI startups find themselves bogged down by customer data cleanup and custom integrations. </p><p>As multinationals and Big Tech overhaul their data management processes and tech stack to comply with GDPR, here\u2019s how AI and data innovation counterintuitively also stand to benefit. How GDPR impacts AI GDPR covers the collection, processing and movement of data that can be used to identify a person, such as a name, email address, bank account information, social media posts, health information and more, all of which are currently used to power the AI algorithms ranging from targeting ads to identifying terrorist cells. The penalty for noncompliance is 4 percent of global revenue, or \u20ac20 million, whichever is higher. To put that in perspective: 4 percent of Amazon\u2019s 2017 revenue is $7.2 billion, Google\u2019s is $4.4 billion and Facebook\u2019s is $1.6 billion. These regulations apply to any citizen of the EU, no matter their current residence, as well as vendors upstream and downstream of the companies that collect PII. Article 22 of the GDPR, titled \u201cAutomated Individual Decision-making, including Profiling,\u201d prescribes that AI cannot be used as the sole decision-maker in choices that have legal or similarly significant effects on users. In practice, this means an AI model cannot be the only step for deciding whether a borrower can receive a loan; the customer must be able to request that a human review the application. One way to avoid the cost of compliance, which includes hiring a data protection officer and building access controls, is to stop collecting data on EU residents altogether. This would bring PII-dependent AI innovation in the EU to a grinding halt. With the EU representing about 16 percent of global GDP, 11 percent of global online advertising spend and 9 percent of the global population in 2017, however, Big Tech will more likely invest heavily in solutions that will allow them to continue operating in this market. Transparency mandates force better data accessibility GDPR mandates that companies collecting consumer data must enable individuals to know what data is being collected about them, understand how it is being used, revoke permission to use specific data, correct or update data and obtain proof that the data has been erased if the customer requests it. To meet these potential requests, companies must shift from indiscriminately collecting data in a piecemeal and decentralized manner to establishing an organized process with a clear chain of control. Any data that companies collect must be immediately classified as either PII or de-identified and assigned the correct level of protection. Its location in the company\u2019s databases must be traceable with an auditable trail: GDPR mandates that organizations handling PII must be able to find all copies of regulated data, regardless of how and where it is stored. These organizations will need to assign someone to manage their data infrastructure and fulfill these user privacy requests.  Unproven upside alone has always been insufficient to motivate cross-functional modernization. Having these data infrastructure and management processes in place will greatly lower the company\u2019s barriers to deploying AI. By fully understanding their data assets, the company can plan strategically about where they can deploy AI in the near-term using their existing data assets. Moreover, once they build an AI road map, the company can determine where they need to obtain additional data to build more complex and valuable AI algorithms. With the data streams simplified, storage mapped out and a chain of ownership established, the company can more effectively engage with AI vendors to deploy their solutions enterprise-wide. More importantly, GDPR will force many companies dragging their feet on digitization to finally bite the bullet. The mandates require that data be portable: Companies must provide a way for users to download all of the data collected about them in a standard format. Currently, only 10 percent of all data is collected in a format for easing analysis and sharing, and more than 80 percent of enterprise data today is unstructured, according to Gartner estimates. Much of this structuring and information extraction will initially have to be done manually, but Big Tech companies and many startups are developing tools to accelerate this process. According to PWC, the sectors most behind on digitization are healthcare, government and hospitality, all of which handle large amounts of unstructured data containing PII \u2014 we could expect to see a flood of AI innovation in these categories as the data become easier to access and use. Consumer opt-outs require more granular AI model management Under GDPR guidelines, companies must let users prevent the company from storing certain information about them. If the user requests that the company permanently and completely delete all the data about them, the company must comply and show proof of deletion. How this mandate might apply to an AI algorithm trained on data that a user wants to delete is not specifically prescribed and awaits its first test case. Today, data is pooled together to train an AI algorithm. It is unclear how an AI engineer would attribute the impact of a particular data point to the overall performance of the algorithm. If the enforcers of GDPR decide that the company must erase the effect of a unit of data on the AI model in addition to deleting the data, companies using AI must find ways to granularly explain how a model works and fine tune the model to \u201cforget\u201d that data in question. Many AI models are black boxes today, and leading AI researchers are working to enable model explainability and tunability. The GDPR deletion mandate could accelerate progress in these areas.  In this post-GDPR future, companies no longer have to infer intent from expensive schemes to sneakily capture customer information. In the nearer term, these GDPR mandates could shape best practices for UX and AI model design. Today, GDPR-compliant companies offer users the binary choice of allowing full, effectively unrestricted use of their data or no access at all. In the future, product designers may want to build more granular data access permissions. For example, before choosing to delete Facebook altogether, a user can refuse companies access to specific sets of information, such as their network of friends or their location data. AI engineers anticipating the need to trace the effect of specific data on a model may choose to build a series of simple models optimizing on single dimensions, instead of one monolithic and very complex model. This approach may have performance trade-offs, but would make model management more tractable. Building trust for more data tomorrow The new regulations require companies to protect PII with a level of security previously limited to patient health and consumer finance data. Nearly half of all companies recently surveyed by Experian about GDPR are adopting technology to detect and report data breaches as soon as they occur. As companies adopt more sophisticated data infrastructure, they will be able to determine who has and should have access to each data stream and manage permissions accordingly. Moreover, the company may also choose to build tools that immediately notify users if their information was accessed by an unauthorized party; Facebook offers a similar service to its employees, called a \u201cSauron alert.\u201d Although the restrictions may appear to reduce tech companies\u2019 ability to access data in the short-term, 61 percent of companies see additional benefits of GDPR-readiness beyond penalty avoidance, according to a recent Deloitte report. Taking these precautions to earn customer trust may eventually lower the cost of acquiring high-quality, highly dimensional data. In this post-GDPR future, companies no longer have to infer intent from expensive schemes to sneakily capture customer information. Improved data infrastructure will have enabled early AI applications to demonstrate their value, encouraging more customers to voluntarily share even more information about themselves to trustworthy companies. Unproven upside alone has always been insufficient to motivate cross-functional modernization, but the threat of a multi-billion-dollar penalty may finally spur these companies to action. More importantly, GDPR is but the first of much more data privacy regulation to come, and many countries across the world look to it as a model for their own upcoming policies. As companies worldwide lay the groundwork for compliance and transparency, they\u2019re also paving the way to an even more vibrant AI future to come. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RVMPCU-RLPMN874203620180608</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RVMPCU2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SH9-PHG1-DXCW-D317-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">424987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1610\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Plus Company Updates(PCU)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"45923\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"06\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>June 8, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

All going well it will nudge us out of the digital middle ages and towards the Renaissance.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Of course, Brussels being Brussels, this ground-breaking law has been hidden behind an obscure name. The General Data Protection Regulation - GDPR to its friends and many enemies - is a 99-chapter whopper that returns to people control of a valuable asset of the modern age: their personal data.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the right hands the digital information you generate - when you use your smartphone or a loyalty card - is a veritable gold mine. Though this is your information to give and yours to revoke, in the worldwide web Wild West nobody cared too much about legal niceties like that - until now.</p><p>Instead, digital equivalents of factory fish trawlers sailed around sucking up our data, processing and selling it for profit without our knowledge or explicit consent - and they made fortunes along the way.</p><p>From next week the tables are turned on \"free\" online services and even good old-fashioned spam: if someone wants to offer a service in exchange for data or send you commercial emails you have to opt-in.</p><p>That's why you may have noticed - ironically enough - even more spam of late from companies, rushing to meet that May 25th deadline, asking for your permission. From blog owners to social media giants, the new rules affect everyone. </p><h>Scare story </h><p>That's why an army of advisers, some of themchancers, have fanned out in recent months, anxious to make GDPR the most profitable cash cow/scare story since the millennium bug. \"It's absurd the panic being created over GDPR compliance by people with only a vague idea of data protection [who are] charging big money for lectures,\" said Albrecht.  </p><p>Now just 35, Mr Albrecht will soon leave the European Parliament after almost a decade specialising in civil rights, data protection and democracy. He was appointed rapporteur or parliamentary point man for the new data protection rules, a Sisyphean task at the heart of the stylish documentary <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Democracy</emphasis> (available on Netflix).</p><p>As soon as the draft GDPR legislation was on the table in Brussels, it was buried under some 4,000 parliamentary amendments - from concerned MEPs and well-paid lobbyists with clients anxious to kill it off.</p><p>\"We'll never finish with it,\" sighs a despairing Albrecht in the film in early 2013. But finish they did, aided along the way by revelations of the dangers of unchecked data dragnets by whistleblowers like Edward Snowden.</p><p>The other key player in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Democracy</emphasis> is Reding, former EU commissioner for justice, fundamental rights and citizenship. Six years on, she remembers the reaction to her first legal draft of what became GDPR.</p><p>\"Lobbyists and national governments tried to stop it,\" she told the European Parliament recently. \"Today they agree it is an indispensable piece of legislation.\" </p><h>Smash-and-grab </h><p>Among the things concentrating their minds was Cambridge Analytica's smash-and-grab of 87 million Facebook users' information, allegedly used to push Donald Trump into the White House.  </p><p>The US social media giant's benevolent apathy towards European privacy norms has sparked a series of lawsuits in the EU. As early as next week, Facebook's billionaire founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has agreed to testify on the matter at what is likely to be an interesting - if, ironically, a behind closed doors - European parliament session.</p><p>Before the US congress Zuckerberg praised new EU data rules, and promised to extend similar safeguards to all Facebook users worldwide. </p><p>Yet MEPs are likely to ask Zuckerberg about a subsequent U-turn in Facebook's Dublin headquarters which reportedly stripped EU levels of legal protection from all but European users of the social network.</p><p>Albrecht says the move smacks of desperation, and is, paradoxically, a vote of confidence in GDPR.</p><p>\"It shows they have a real fear of sanctions, but I can't see it lasting long,\" he said. \"Eventually users outside Europe will want to know why Facebook - for legal, not technical reasons - is offering them lower data protection standards.\"</p><p>Whatever happens outside the EU, GDPR is likely to bring a a \"flood of lawsuits\" for Facebook, according to a recent Deutsche Bank investor note. And, as in the recent past, Dublin's concentration of tech giants means many legal battles to test Europe's new privacy rules are likely to play out in the Irish courts.</p><p>Albrecht, as a key figure in the birth of the EU's new privacy rules, is complimentary of the role played by Ireland in getting GDPR over the line - from Irish MEPs in Brussels to Dublin's support during its 2013 EU presidency of the European Council.</p><p>\"Ireland made a big effort then, all the more reason to prove now it can do much better in data protection,\" said Albrecht, a none-too-subtle warning to Helen Dixon, Ireland's data protection commissioner (DPC). </p><h>Responsibility </h><p>GDPR boosts Dixon's already considerable responsibility for regulating big tech companies with EU headquarters based in Ireland: Google, Facebook, Twitter and many more. This week she warned these companies, via the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">New York Times</emphasis>, that they would \"suffer consequences\" if they flout the new regulation.  </p><p>Even after recent boosts in resources, Dixon conceded her office \"should be far more highly resourced\". The <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">New York Times </emphasis>estimates that her budget is just one 40th that of Ireland's financial services regulator.</p><p>None of her European data protection colleagues would begrudge her more money and staff. Indeed, many cannot wait for next Friday to assist her office's work. </p><p>This is possible thanks to a new GDPR provision which will allow citizens with privacy concerns about Facebook, for instance, to file a complaint in their home country and let their national regulator liaise with, and if necessary intervene in, the DPC's investigation in Dublin.</p><p>It remains to be seen how this new co-operation works over a sensitive cultural norm like privacy, shaped by national historical experiences. Despite vastly different schools of thought across the continent, from liberal to stringent, EU officials are optimistic GDPR will develop a \"European culture of protection of privacy\".</p><p>\"I think within two years we will see where the spirit lies,\" says Vera Jourov\u00e1, successor to Reding in the EU justice commissioner role. She is confident the new rules have struck a healthy balance between citizens' fundamental right to privacy and legitimate business interests to collect and process data without an excessive legal or financial burden.</p><p>Despite a long transition period, she concedes many small- and medium-sized businesses without large legal departments are still in the dark about what the new rules mean for them. There is a need for GDPR compliance from next Friday, she insists, but no need for panic. </p><h>Sanctioning machines </h><p>\"National data protection regulators don't see their role as being sanctioning machines from day one. They are ready to consult and help in the first year when we expect the system to settle down.\"  </p><p>However, it's clear she expects swifter and more robust rulings from national regulators in the wake of the Facebook/Cambridge Analytica scandal. \"We want to see action and corrective measures. [So] if there are breaches, companies must be the object of sanctioning,\" she told journalists this week in Berlin.</p><p>Though anxious not to directly criticise the Irish data regulator, an independent Irish body beyond her remit, Jourov\u00e1 says GDPR will only work \"if everyone does his or her task\".</p><p>Six years in the making, the new EU privacy laws that come into effect on Friday may provide an interesting epilogue to another major event that day: Ireland's abortion referendum. Regardless of the squabbles over banning online referendum ads, Albrecht says anyone using personal data of dubious origin in the Irish campaign may face a rude - and expensive - awakening after polls close (see panel).</p><p>\"Anyone processing data up to May 25th for the Irish referendum will come under the new privacy rules,\" confirms the German MEP. \"And I'm very interested to see how that turns out.\"</p><h>GDPR Explained </h><p>nGDPR is a new EU regulation that updates and harmonises how data is gathered, processed, stored and used across the bloc.</p><p>nIt gives citizens power to control what data is held by others on them.</p><p>nIt requires everyone who collects data - companies, public bodies, clubs, medical practitioners and more - to obtain explicit user consent for collecting and processing that data</p><p>nData collected must be accurate, up to date, be held for minimum time necessary and safe from hackers</p><p>nCitizens may withdraw consent for someone to hold both their personal data (name, phone number, location data) as well as sensitive data (ethnicity, sexuality, religion, medical conditions)</p><p>nWith no minimum fines, entities in breach of GDPR could face a financial penalty as high as EUR 20 million or 4 per cent of group turnover, whichever is higher.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-1.3501388</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SC0-TJP1-JC8Y-80PS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1510\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"05\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>May 19, 2018 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>NFLX (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Yet the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has been dogged by criticism of a failure of enforcement related to major cross-border complaints - lending weight to critics who claim the legislation has created a moat for dominant multinationals, at the expense of smaller entities.</p><p><br/>Today the European Commission responded to that criticism as it gave a long scheduled assessment of how the regulation is functioning, in its first review two years in.<br/>While EU lawmakers' top-line message is the clear claim: 'GDPR is working' - with commissioners lauding what they couched as the many positives of this \"modern and horizontal piece of legislation\"; which they also said has become a \"global reference point\" - they conceded there is a \"very serious to-do list\", calling for uniformly \"vigorous\" enforcement of the regulation across the bloc.<br/>So, in other words, GDPR decisions need to flow more smoothly than they have so far.<br/>Speaking at a Commission briefing today, Vera Jourov\u00e1, Commission VP for values and transparency, said: \"The European Data Protection Board and the data protection authorities have to step up their work to create a truly common European culture - providing more coherent and more practical guidance, and work on vigorous but uniform enforcement.<br/>\"We have to work together, as the Board and the Member States, to address concerns - in particular those of the small and medium enterprises.\"<br/>Justice commissioner, Didier Reynders, also speaking at the briefing, added: \"We have to ensure that [GDPR] is applied harmoniously - or at least with the same vigour across the European territory. There may be some nuanced differences but it has to be applied with the same vigour.<br/>\"In order for that to happen data protection authorities have to be sufficiently equipped - they have to have the relevant number of staff, the relevant budgets, and there is a clear will to move in that direction.\"<br/>Front and center for GDPR enforcement is the issue of resourcing for national data protection authorities (DPAs), who are tasked with providing oversight and issuing enforcement decisions.<br/>Jourov\u00e1 noted today that EU DPAs - taken as a whole - have increased headcount by 42% and budget by 49% between 2016 and 2019.<br/>However that's an aggregate which conceals major differences in resourcing. A recent report by pro-privacy browser Brave found that half of all national DPAs receive just (EURO)5M or less in annual budget from their governments, for example. Brave also found budget increases peaked for the application of the GDPR - saying, two years in, governments are now slowing the increase.<br/>It's also true that DPA case load isn't uniform across the bloc, with certain Member States (notably Ireland and Luxembourg) handling many more and/or more complex complaints than others as a result of how many multinationals locate their regional HQs there.<br/>One key issue for GDPR thus relates to how the regulation handles cross border cases.<br/>A one-stop-shop mechanism was supposed to simplify this process - by having a single regulator (typically in the country where the business has its main establishment) taking a lead on complaints that affect users in multiple Member States, and other interested DPAs not dealing directly with the data processor. But they do remain involved - and, once there's a draft decision, play an important role as they can raise objections to whatever the lead regulator has decided.<br/>However a lot of friction seems to be creeping in via current processes, via technical issues related to sharing data between DPAs - and also via the opportunity for additional legal delays.<br/>In the case of big tech, GDPR's one-stop-shop has resulted in a major backlog around enforcement, with multiple complaints being re-routed via Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC) - which is yet to issue a single decision on a cross border case. And has more than 20 such investigations ongoing.<br/>Last month Ireland's DPC trailed looming decisions on Twitter and Facebook - saying it had submitted a draft decision on the Twitter case to fellow DPAs and expressed hope that case could be finalized in July.<br/>Its data protection commissioner, Helen Dixon, had previously suggested the first cross border decisions would be coming in \"early\" 2020. In the event, we're past half way through the year still with no enforcement on show.<br/>This looks especially problematic as there is a counter example elsewhere in the EU: France's CNIL managed to issue a decision in a major GDPR case against Google all the way back in January 2019. Last week the country's top court for administrative law cemented the regulator's findings - dismissing Google's appeal. Its $57M fine against Google remains the largest yet levied against big tech under GDPR.<br/>Asked directly whether the Commission believes Ireland's DPC is sufficiently resourced - with the questioner noting it has multiple ongoing investigations into Facebook, in particular, with still no decisions taken on the company - Jourov\u00e1 emphasized DPAs are \"fully independent\", before adding: \"The Commission has no tools to push them to speed up but the cases you mention, especially the cases that relate to big tech, are always complex and they require thorough investigation - and it simply requires more time.\"<br/>However CNIL's example shows effective enforcement against major tech platforms is possible - at least, where there's a will to take on corporate power. Though France's relative agility may also have something to do with not having to deal simultaneously with such a massive load of complex cross-border cases.<br/>At the same time, critics point to Ireland's cosy political relationship with the corporate giants it attracts via low tax rates - which in turn raises plenty of questions when set against the oversized role its DPA has in overseeing most of big tech. The stench of forum shopping is unmistakable.<br/>Criticism of national regulators extends beyond Ireland, too, though. In the UK, privacy experts have slammed the ICO's repeated failure to enforce the law against the adtech industry - despite its own assessments finding systemic flouting of the law. The country remains an EU Member State until the end of the year - and the ICO is the best resourced DPA in the bloc, in terms of budget and headcount (and likely tech expertise too). Which hardly reflects well on the functional state of the regulation.<br/>Despite all this, the Commission continues to present GDPR as a major geopolitical success, claiming - as it did again today - that it's ahead of the digital regulatory curve globally at a time when lawmakers almost everywhere are considering putting harder limits on Internet players.<br/>But there's only so long it can sell a success on paper. Without consistently \"vigorous\" enforcement, the whole framework crumbles - so the EU's executive has serious skin in the game when it comes to GDPR actually doing what it says on the tin.<br/>Pressure is coming from commercial quarters too - not only privacy and consumer rights groups.<br/>Earlier this year, Brave lodged a complaint with the Commission against 27 EU Member States - accusing them of under resourcing their national data protection watchdogs. It called on the EU executive to launch an infringement procedure against national governments, and refer them to the bloc's top court if necessary. So startups are banging the drum for enforcement too.<br/>If decision wheels don't turn on their own, courts may eventually be needed to force Europe's DPAs to get a move on - albeit, the Commission is still hoping it won't have to come to that.<br/>\"We saw a considerable increase of capacities both in Ireland and Luxembourg,\" said Jourov\u00e1, discussing the DPA resourcing issue. \"We saw a sufficient increase in at least half of other Member States DPAs so we have to let them do very responsible and good work - and of course wait for the results.\"<br/>Reynders suggested that while there has been an increase in resource for DPAs the Commission may need to conduct a \"deeper\" analysis - to see if more resource is needed in some Member States, \"due to the size of the companies at work in the jurisdiction of such a national authority\".<br/>\"We have huge differences between the Member States about the need to react to the requests from the companies. And of course we need to reinforce the cooperation and the co-ordination on cross border issues. We need to be sure that it's possible for all the national authorities to work together. And in the network of national authorities it's the case - and with the Board [EDPB] it's possible to organize that. So we'll continue to work on it,\" he said.<br/>\"So it's not only a question to have the same kind of approach in all the Member States. It's to be fit to all the demands coming in your jurisdiction and it's true that in some jurisdictions we have more multinationals and more members of high tech companies than in others.\"<br/>\"The best answer will be a decision from the Irish data protection authority about important cases,\" he added.<br/>We've reached out to the Irish DPC and the EDPB for comment on the Commission's GDPR assessment. The former put out a report yesterday summarizing its regulatory activity over the past two years - in which it notes that since May 2018, when GDPR begun being applied, it's opened 24 cross-border inquiries and 53 national inquiries. It further notes: \"Through Supervision action, the DPC has brought about the postponement or revision of six planned big tech projects with implications for the rights and freedoms of individuals.\"<br/>Update: The DPC's deputy commissioner, Graham Doyle, told us: \"The Irish DPC has grown considerably in terms of staffing in recent years, from 30 staff in 2014 to 140 staff today. This growth will continue in 2020 and we expect to have 175 staff by year end. However, we must continue to increase these resources beyond 2020, including further expansion of specialist resources, e.g. technologists and legal specialists, to ensure that we can continue to fulfil the important role that we have.\"<br/>Asked whether the Commission has a list of Member States that it might instigate infringement proceedings against related to the terms of GDPR - which, for example, require governments to provide adequate resourcing to their national DPA in order that they can properly oversee the regulation - Reynders said it doesn't currently have such a list.<br/>\"We have a list of countries where we try to see if it's possible to reinforce the possibilities for the national authorities to have enough resources - human resources, financial resources, to organize better cross border activities - if at the end we see there's a real problem about the enforcement of the GDPR in one Member State we will propose to go maybe to the court with an infringement proceeding - but we don't have, for the moment, a list of countries to organize such a kind of process,\" he said.<br/>The commissioners were a lot more comfortable talking up the positives of GDPR, with Jourov\u00e1 noting, with a sphinx-like smile, how three years ago there was \"literal panic\" and an army of lobbyists warning of a \"doomsday\" for business and innovation should the legislation pass. \"I have good news today - no dooms day was here,\" she said.<br/>\"Our approach to the GDPR was the right one,\" she went on. \"It created the more harmonized rules across the Single Market and more and more companies are using GDPR concepts, such as privacy by design and by default, as a competitive differentiation.<br/>\"I can say that the philosophy of one continent, one law is very advantageous for European small and medium enterprises who want to operate on the European Single Market.<br/>\"In general GDPR has become a truly European trade mark,\" she added. \"It puts people and their rights at the center. It does not leave everything to the market like in the US. And it does not see data as a means for state supervision, as in China. Our truly European approach to data is the first answer to difficult questions we face as a society.\"<br/>She also noted that the regulation served as inspiration for the current Commission's tech-focused policy priorities - including a planned \"human centric approach to AI\".<br/>\"It makes us pause before facial recognition technology, for instance, will be fully developed or implemented. And I dare to say that it makes Europe fit for the digital age. On the international side the GDPR has become a reference point - with a truly global convergence movement. In this context we are happy to support trade and safe digital data flows and work against digital protectionism.\"<br/>Another success the commissioners credited to the GDPR framework is the region's relatively swift digital response to the coronavirus - with the regulation helping DPAs to more quickly assess the privacy implications of COVID-19 contacts tracing apps and tools.<br/>Reynders lauded \"a certain degree of flexibility in the GDPR\" which he said had been able to come into play during the crisis, feeding into discussions around tracing apps - on \"how to ensure protection of personal data in the context of such tracing apps linked to public and individual health\".<br/>Under its to-do list, other areas of work the Commission cited today included ensuring DPAs provide more such support related to the application of the regulation by coming out with guidelines related to other new technologies. \"In various new areas we will have to be able to provide guidance quickly, just as we did on the tracing apps recently,\" noted Reynders.<br/>Further increasing public awareness of GDPR and the rights it affords is another Commission focus - though it said more than two-third of EU citizens above the age of 16 have at least heard of the GDPR. But it wants citizens to be able to make what Reynders called \"best use\" of their rights, perhaps via new applications.<br/>\"So the GDPR provides support to innovation in this respect,\" he said. \"And there's a lot of work that still needs to be done in order to strengthen innovation.\"<br/>\"We also have to convince those who may still be reticent about the GDPR. Certain companies, for instance, who have complained about how difficult it is to implement it.

Do not let anybody fool you. This is good news for consumers and for the digital economy. But to a great extent it will depend on two \"ifs\": first, the GDPR is a promise which will only materialise if industry changes its mindset about data protection and, second, if it is supported by a strong compliance and enforcement culture.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The GDPR has been one of the most lobbied and talked about pieces of EU legislation in recent history. It has been in the making for over 4 years and another two have passed for it to enter into application. It comes with countless myths and widespread fearmongering: \"<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">It will kill digital innovation</emphasis>\", \"<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">It will only benefit big tech giants</emphasis>\", \"<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Consumers do not care about privacy</emphasis>\", \"<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">It will create consent fatigue\"</emphasis> and a long \"etc.\"</p><h/><p>The GDPR, which recently came into force, imposes such tight restrictions on the use of personal data that the EU will be unable to keep up with the rest of the world using AI to streamline their economies, writes Nick Wallace.</p><p>It is time to put all these myths aside and focus on what really matters now. The GDPR must be a game changer which will help stir the digital economy into a new direction. One which is more respectful of our fundamental rights and values. One where consumers are not simply guinea pigs in a data mining farm. One where privacy is not a luxury that only a few can afford. We have high hopes this is where the GDPR will ultimately lead us.</p><p>But getting there is going to take time and effort. First of all, many companies will need to change their mindset. Privacy protection must be integrated as one of the core elements of the products and services that they provide to consumers. Those who rely on the commercial exploitation of people's personal data must adapt their business model.</p><p>The 'take-it or leave-it' culture - only when consumers give up their privacy they can use the service - must cease to exist. Consumers should no longer have to choose between using a service and giving up their privacy. Widespread commercial surveillance is not only decimating our privacy but is also having disturbing effects on our freedom and our democracies. The Facebook/Cambridge Analytica scandal and all its ramifications are (yet another) wake-up call.</p><h/><p>Dozens of industry associations have made a last-ditch effort to water down the draft ePrivacy legislation before national telecoms ministers gather to discuss the file next week in Luxembourg.</p><p>Secondly, we need to develop a strong enforcement culture. We can have the best law in the world, but if it is not complied with and is not enforced effectively, it is worth nothing. This has often been a weak spot in the EU until now.</p><p>Companies could afford to take a relaxed approach towards compliance since the consequences of not respecting the law could in many cases be considered negligible. We trust that data protection authorities, with their reinforced powers and new enforcement tools, will take a strong stance from now on. Our members, national consumer organisations, will also keep a close eye on the market and will not hesitate to act to defend consumers' privacy.</p><p>Last but not least, we all have to continue working to make sure people are aware of why privacy matters in the digital age and to make sure they are familiar with their rights under the GDPR. People have rights, they need to exercise them.</p><p>All the privacy challenges we see today will not be solved miraculously by the GDPR from one day to the next. Even if we have strong rights, we are still largely dependent on the goodwill of all those companies whose services we use every day. Some of them are so dominant in our lives that we do not really have a choice of not using them.</p><p>It is going to take time, public pressure, brave enforcers and some landmark court rulings until the market changes its mindset. The commercial exploitation of our privacy is not the only way to run a business in digital markets.</p><h/><p>Big American technology companies were the first to be hit with complaints for how they handle users' personal information under the new EU data protection regulation known as GDPR.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-1243577</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SGF-C541-JCF9-43YM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"708\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Acteurs d'Europe All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>EurActiv.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33808\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"06\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>June 4, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

over-ambitious targets from the outset, and the government has continued tobackthe service,with the Government Transformation Strategy pledgingto have25 million users signed up to Verify by 2020. </p><p>HMRC confirms it will use alternative to flagship GOV.UK Verify identify service </p><p>HMRC seeks to clarify stance on GOV.UK Verify </p><p>Government turns to big tech firms to help deliver long-awaited Digital Strategy </p><p>But, withjust 1.3 million user accounts at the moment, GDS is making efforts to boostadoption of Verify -director general Kevin Cunnington said on taking up the role last year that\"sorting out Verify to get it to scale\" would be a main priority, while GDShas launched local government Verify pilotsand various exercises to hire more Verify staff. </p><p>Earlier this week, GDS posted an opportunity notice on the Digital Marketplace that asks for a team of developers to work on European identities, improving the way government services connect to the service and on the document checking service. </p><p>\"We require additional development capability for a large number of projects on a flexible basis,\" the notice said.  </p><p>\"The aim is to drive the adoption of Verify through delivering on the technical projects described and thereby making the project work better for citizens.\" </p><p>The work must start by 3 July and is expected to run for six months, with a budget between \u00a3550,000 and \u00a3650,000 for a team of five or six senior or lead developers. </p><p>It will include the design, installation, testing and maintenance of software systems and working in pair and mop programming, and the notice sets out four main areas of work, including frontend testing and continuous development on the document checking service. </p><p>The notice also indicates an interest in Europe, with another area of work being related to the European electronic identification services regulation eIDAS - which Verify is already aligned with. </p><p>This, it says, will be \"working to consume identities from Europe, and potentially allow re-use of Verify identities in Europe\". </p><p>The final work strand will be on improving how government services onboard to use Verify - despite initial predictions that 100 services would be signed up by 2016, there are currently just 12 central government services signed up, and nine of these offer alternatives to Verify. </p><p>GDS is also working on reducing the level of assurance needed for people to register on the service - the existing, high level of assurance is necessary for some services, for instance ensuring benefits are paid to the right person, but is onerous when it comes to services like buying a parking permit. </p><p>Another issue that has faced the Verify team is the number of users that fail to complete the process - the completion rate currently stands at just over 50% - and among the milestones set out in the 8 May notice is that there should be a 5-10% improvement per quarter. </p><p>GDS has previously said it is trying to tackle drop-off by assessing error logs to identify problem areas and allowing users to pause the process and come back later. </p><p>The push for more developers comes a week after PublicTechnology revealed that more than half of the councils originally signed up to the local government pilot of Verify had dropped out, which commentators suggested was because of unrealistic expectations of the work involved in the project. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Unlike in Britain, where the requirement for major banks to share data with third-party financial services providers was a --pro-competition initiative, the approach here has been to focus squarely on the customer.</p><p>That's why open banking will be implemented as part of a wider consumer data right - a more general right to data that will be created across the economy.</p><p>For example, a mobile phone user with a clean payment record might be able to use that data to get around existing roadblocks and secure a loan.</p><p>It would be overstating things to say there's a groundswell of -opposition in Britain since open banking was introduced on January 13, but a report called \"Fintech - beware of geeks bearing gifts?\" by London-based NGO The -Financial Inclusion Centre has -ignited a debate that's spread to our shores. The report's argument is that rather than promoting -financial inclusion, the involvement of fintech companies in data sharing could result in exclusion. This would occur through greater customer profiling and segmentation, leading to more risk-based pricing of financial products.</p><p>There's also the longstanding concern about data security. The FIC says there are two main types of scams and fraud - unauthorised/illegal financial transactions, and data breaches.</p><p>While the types of scams might not change, the proliferation of -intermediaries in the value chain, more points of entry, and the greater complexity and confusion for scammers to exploit, would mean more opportunities for fraudsters to target consumers.</p><p>Consumers would also be primed for -approaches from -intermediaries. A further scenario is that big tech - Apple, Google and Facebook - would enter the -market in a big way, exacerbating concerns they already exercise too much control over our lives.</p><p>\"Fintech will create more, not less, complexity, as well as -fragmentation, opacity and -spurious choices - always the enemy of real competition in -financial services,\" the FIC says.</p><p>\"The interjection of more fintech intermediaries into the supply chain could extract further value from consumers' limited -finances. Consumers may be either charged fees for services, which offer no value (or cost more than the value created), pay commission to intermediaries, or pay for -it indirectly by having their data sold on.\"</p><p>Silky substitution Melbourne commercial barrister Albert Dinelli is understood to be the substitute for Michael Borsky QC at the financial services royal commission.</p><p>Borsky is attending to a -personal matter and did not -appear at the commission's inaugural public hearing on February 12. His future participation is unlikely, with fellow counsel assisting -Rowena Orr QC taking up the cudgels and -delivering the opening statement to royal commissioner and former High Court judge Ken Hayne.</p><p>Dinelli, a senior barrister who has not yet taken silk and specialises in commercial and administrative law, is a former Mallesons Stephen Jaques solicitor.</p><p>He and Orr are preparing for the commission's March 13-March 23 public hearings on -consumer lending, which will focus on the $1.6 trillion mortgage market, as well as credit card and motor -vehicle debt.</p><p>Banks and non-banks have -received an avalanche of notices from the commission in recent weeks ahead of the hearings.</p><p>Kell security Have the planets aligned for ASIC deputy chairman Peter Kell to move seamlessly into a new role as the inaugural head of the Australian Financial Complaints Authority, or \"super-FOS\"?</p><p>Apparently not.</p><p>Those who think the 52-year-old regulator is super-FOS bound are mistaken. According to well-placed -Canberra sources, the timing might be perfect but Kell is not throwing his hat in the ring.</p><p>The AFCA job happens to be in Melbourne and Kell has family commitments in Sydney.</p><p>Also, ASIC chairman James Shipton only started on February 1, so there's a strong argument for continuity in the deputy's role. Shipton went out of his way to compliment Kell in his first -appearance before a parliamentary committee on February 16.</p><p>He said Kell had done an \"outstanding job\" as the acting ASIC chief between ex-chairman Greg Medcraft's departure and Shipton's arrival.</p><p>It's a view that's shared in Canberra, in contrast to the official position on Medcraft, who like Kell was a Labor appointee but was seen as more of a political player.

Unlike in Britain, where the requirement for major banks to share data with third-party financial services providers was a --pro-competition initiative, the approach here has been to focus squarely on the customer.</p><p>That's why open banking will be implemented as part of a wider consumer data right - a more general right to data that will be created across the economy.</p><p>For example, a mobile phone user with a clean payment record might be able to use that data to get around existing roadblocks and secure a loan.</p><p>It would be overstating things to say there's a groundswell of -opposition in Britain since open banking was introduced on January 13, but a report called \"Fintech - beware of geeks bearing gifts?\" by London-based NGO The -Financial Inclusion Centre has -ignited a debate that's spread to our shores. The report's argument is that rather than promoting -financial inclusion, the involvement of fintech companies in data sharing could result in exclusion. This would occur through greater customer profiling and segmentation, leading to more risk-based pricing of financial products.</p><p>There's also the longstanding concern about data security. The FIC says there are two main types of scams and fraud - unauthorised/illegal financial transactions, and data breaches.</p><p>While the types of scams might not change, the proliferation of -intermediaries in the value chain, more points of entry, and the greater complexity and confusion for scammers to exploit, would mean more opportunities for fraudsters to target consumers.</p><p>Consumers would also be primed for -approaches from -intermediaries. A further scenario is that big tech - Apple, Google and Facebook - would enter the -market in a big way, exacerbating concerns they already exercise too much control over our lives.</p><p>\"Fintech will create more, not less, complexity, as well as -fragmentation, opacity and -spurious choices - always the enemy of real competition in -financial services,\" the FIC says.</p><p>\"The interjection of more fintech intermediaries into the supply chain could extract further value from consumers' limited -finances. Consumers may be either charged fees for services, which offer no value (or cost more than the value created), pay commission to intermediaries, or pay for -it indirectly by having their data sold on.\"</p><p>Silky substitution Melbourne commercial barrister Albert Dinelli is understood to be the substitute for Michael Borsky QC at the financial services royal commission.</p><p>Borsky is attending to a -personal matter and did not -appear at the commission's inaugural public hearing on February 12. His future participation is unlikely, with fellow counsel assisting -Rowena Orr QC taking up the cudgels and -delivering the opening statement to royal commissioner and former High Court judge Ken Hayne.</p><p>Dinelli, a senior barrister who has not yet taken silk and specialises in commercial and administrative law, is a former Mallesons Stephen Jaques solicitor.</p><p>He and Orr are preparing for the commission's March 13-March 23 public hearings on -consumer lending, which will focus on the $1.6 trillion mortgage market, as well as credit card and motor -vehicle debt.</p><p>Banks and non-banks have -received an avalanche of notices from the commission in recent weeks ahead of the hearings.</p><p>Kell security Have the planets aligned for ASIC deputy chairman Peter Kell to move seamlessly into a new role as the inaugural head of the Australian Financial Complaints Authority, or \"super-FOS\"?</p><p>Apparently not.</p><p>Those who think the 52-year-old regulator is super-FOS bound are mistaken. According to well-placed -Canberra sources, the timing might be perfect but Kell is not throwing his hat in the ring.</p><p>The AFCA job happens to be in Melbourne and Kell has family commitments in Sydney.</p><p>Also, ASIC chairman James Shipton only started on February 1, so there's a strong argument for continuity in the deputy's role. Shipton went out of his way to compliment Kell in his first -appearance before a parliamentary committee on February 16.</p><p>He said Kell had done an \"outstanding job\" as the acting ASIC chief between ex-chairman Greg Medcraft's departure and Shipton's arrival.</p><p>It's a view that's shared in Canberra, in contrast to the official position on Medcraft, who like Kell was a Labor appointee but was seen as more of a political player. Word on the street believes it would be no surprise if Kell were to get an extra term at ASIC, which would ease the logjam of senior positions to be filled at the regulator, and at AFCA.</p><p>Commissioner John Price's term expires next month, with only Cathie Armour brandishing a long-term contract that runs until June 2022.</p><p>The AFCA position is also up in the air.</p><p>Shane Tregillis has been chief ombudsman at the Financial -Ombudsman Service - the largest of the three bodies to be merged to form AFCA - since 2011. Tregillis would have been the continuity candidate but has ruled himself out of the running.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:gluyasr@theaustralian.com.auTwitter\">gluyasr@theaustralian.com.auTwitter</email>: @Gluyasr</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-TheAustralian20180227Australian220000361139474</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RRM-G361-F0JP-W18X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"908\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian2 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"02\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>February 27, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>AAPL (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DJQC</classCode><className>CONSUMERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>STX000759</classCode><className>FRAUD &amp;

Negotiators for the Boston-based industrial conglomerate and unions who represent thousands of its US workers had reached a tentative agreement last month after 21 days of negotiations in Cincinnati. But a majority of members of IUE-CWA locals in Lynn and Schenectady, N.Y., have voted to reject that agreement. One of the big sticking points: rising health care contributions. Per the union's rules, when a majority of members at a particular site votes \"no,\" the entire membership at that location is counted as voting \"no.\" As a result, enough votes were tallied to nix the contract agreement, even though a majority of IUE-CWA members across all GE locations supported it. GE said it's working with IUE-CWA leadership to evaluate the next steps. Meanwhile, leaders at the IUE-CWA Local 201 that represents workers at the GE Aviation plant in Lynn recommended that employees report to work and prepare for a strike. \u2014 JON CHESTO</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TECHNOLOGY</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Britain's health service to use Alexa to answer medical questions from patients</p><p>Alexa will see you now. Britain's health care service is teaming up with Amazon's digital voice assistant to help answer medical queries with advice from the service's official website. The British government said Wednesday that the system can help senior citizens, blind people, and others who find it hard to access the Internet. \u00adUsing Amazon's algorithms, Alexa will \u00adanswer voice questions from users about common maladies such as the flu or chickenpox with information verified by the National Health Service. Amazon sought to reassure users that their information will be kept confidential and not shared with third parties, adding that voice recordings can be deleted. Privacy campaigners, however, said they are concerned about the partnership and its implications because Amazon has a worrying track record on handling user data. \u2014 ASSOCIATED PRESS</p><p>GENDER EQUITY</p><p>New York expands law prohibiting pay discrimination</p><p>New York state has expanded a state law prohibiting gender pay discrimination, making it illegal to pay someone less based on factors such as their race, religion, or gender identity. The new law also changes a legal standard for pay equity to make it easier for employees to prove discrimination in court. Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo signed the changes into law Wednesday in Manhattan, just before joining the US women's soccer team for a parade honoring their World Cup victory. Cuomo said he supports female players in their quest for pay equal to that of male players. \u2014 ASSOCIATED PRESS</p><p>PORNOGRAPHY</p><p>Britain wants to require sites to verify that users are adults</p><p>The global push to more tightly regulate the Internet and big tech firms is spreading to one of the Web's biggest and least visible corners: porn. The British government wants to require porn websites to verify their users are adults. The effort is being watched by other countries hoping to better regulate pornographic content but has raised concerns about privacy, censorship, and competition. It has run into multiple delays that reflect the confusion surrounding it. Under the plan, which is now expected to come into force late this year, British porn site visitors will be asked to prove they are 18 or older. Options to do so would include buying a card with an access code in a shop, where they will have to show photo ID, or going online to submit a copy of a passport or driver's license or use a credit card. \u2014 ASSOCIATED PRESS</p><p>AUTOMOTIVE</p><p>Tesla to increase production at California plant</p><p>Tesla Inc. is poised to increase production at its California car plant and is back in hiring mode, according to an internal e-mail sent days after the company wrapped up a record quarter of deliveries. The electric-car maker is \"making preparations\" to raise output at its factory in Fremont, Calif., Jerome Guillen, Tesla's automotive president, wrote Tuesday. After several rounds of job cuts announced by chief executive Elon Musk over the past year, Guillen also told employees that Tesla is hiring. \u2014 BLOOMBERG NEWS</p><p>GAMING</p><p>Nintendo to sell cheaper version of Switch console</p><p>Nintendo Co. introduced a new, cheaper, version of its portable Switch gaming console, as the Japanese company seeks to expand the potential market for games. The Switch Lite will retail for $199.99, or $100 less than the original device. The new console will be released Sept. 20 and will come in yellow, gray, and turquoise, the company said in a statement. \u2014 BLOOMBERG NEWS</p><p>RETAIL</p><p>Microsoft to move near Apple's flagship London store</p><p>Apple Inc.'s flagship central London retail store gets a new neighbor on Thursday, as Microsoft Corp. opens its inaugural European high-street presence just feet away. Microsoft has taken over three floors and 22,000 square feet of a historic building on the corner of Oxford and Regent streets \u2014 London's central shopping thoroughfare \u2014 originally designed in 1912. Technology giants' push to open flashy stores to showcase their devices and software has proven to be one of the few bright spots for the UK's ailing retail industry, which has been beset by bankruptcies, store closures, and rent cuts. \u2014 BLOOMBERG NEWS</p><p>HOTELS</p><p>Marriott hit on two fronts for online reservation issues</p><p>Marriott International was hit by legal consequences related to its online reservations for guests from both the District of Columbia and Britain on Tuesday. The District's attorney general filed a complaint accusing the Bethesda, Md.-based hotel and resort company of deceiving guests making online reservations of room prices. \"For at least the last decade, Marriott has used an unlawful trade practice called 'drip pricing' in advertising its hotel rooms whereby Marriott initially hides a portion of a hotel room's daily rate from consumers,\" the complaint read. The complaint said Marriott refers to these additional mandatory fees ranging from $9 to $95 per day, which aren't advertised as included in the room price on the company's website or other third-party sites such as Expedia and Priceline, as a \"resort fee,\" \"amenity fee\" or destination fee.\" Because of that, the complaint says, customers booking rooms online are misled into thinking the room is cheaper than it actually is. Marriott was also notified by the United Kingdom Information Commissioner's Office on Tuesday that it plans to fine the company more than 99 million pounds ($123 million), after investigating a data breach of guest reservations for Starwood hotels. \u2014 WASHINGTON POST</p><p>AUTOMOTIVE</p><p>Mazda recalling more than 262,000 cars and SUVs over stalling problem</p><p>Mazda is recalling more than 262,000 SUVs and cars in the United States to fix a software problem that could cause the engines to stall unexpectedly. The recall covers certain Mazda6 midsize sedans and CX-5 SUVs from the 2018 and 2019 model years. Also included are Mazda3 small cars from 2019. Mazda traced the problem to a software error in the computer that controls the valves as part of the vehicles' fuel-saving cylinder deactivation technology. The company said in government documents posted Wednesday that drivers won't get any warning before the engine stalls. Mazda said no crashes or injuries have been reported because of the problem. Dealers will reprogram the software at no cost to owners. The recall is expected to start before Aug. 26. \u2014 ASSOCIATED PRESS</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BGLOBE-46e5dc20-a316-11e9-8ec5-d9f4fcf3f71f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BGLOBE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJ5-T481-DYHJ-30CW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8110</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1264\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Boston Globe</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 11, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000299K</classCode><className>GENERAL ELECTRIC CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC000A0Q7</classCode><className>GE AVIATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS336412 AIRCRAFT ENGINE &amp;

Boyle has led some of the firm's most controversial investments[1] in startups working closely with the federal government[2], specifically with the Department of Defense. She told Business Insider that Silicon Valley and officials in Washington, DC, are much more comfortable working together than they were even 5 years ago, although she still helps guide founders who are apprehensive about building a business model around a single customer[3]. Although Boyle previously had check-writing power, she is eager to step up the rate of investments in her new role as more technical founders warm up to working with parts of the government.

Silicon Valley and Washington, DCare entering 2020 as frenemies. </p><p>Katherine Boyle, General Catalyst's newest partner, thinks the two could end the year as work spouses. The journalist-turned-VC was promoted to partner on Thursday, and has led some of the firm's more controversial investments over the last three years. She doesn't shy away from regulation, the r-word that has other Silicon Valley VCs apprehensive[5] in boardrooms across California. \"Regulation is really just a proxy for market size,\" Boyle told Business Insider. \"Yes, they have tech risks, but if they make it through the regulatory process they can succeed.\" It's a difficult time to advocate for more collaboration between startups and government in left-leaning Silicon Valley. Over the last six months, big tech companies like Google[6] and Microsoft have been subjected to employee-led protests[7] over secretive government contracts. Startups like Palantir have reportedly pulled out of college recruiting fairs[8] after pushback from socially conscious students over its contracts with immigration and defense officials[9]. But Boyle maintains that there's never been a better time to work with government agencies, as long as founders and CEOs are honest with employees about what they are building and who the core customer is, because that's what has gotten other tech companies in trouble. \"For any company that is working with the [Department of Defense], we think it's very important to be forthright that they are working with the DOD,\" Boyle said. \"They have to have conversations about the ethics of working with the DOD. If the team is pivoting to working with the DOD and aren't upfront about it and the projects and the ethical lines they think exist, it can be problematic.\" The fact that large companies are considering working with government officials[10], though, is progress, Boyle said. The more comfortable tech companies get working with federal and local governments, and vice versa, the more everyone benefits. \"If you had talked to Washington even five years ago, they would have laughed and the same would have been said about founders and Silicon Valley,\" Boyce told Business Insider. \"Now, that's very much shifted. These deeply technical founders are excited about working with the DOD and intelligence community, and I'm excited to work with companies that have that as the core part of their strategy.\" Perhaps trickier than managing employee's expectations, though, is building a successful startup based on a single, notoriously budget-conscious customer: the government. When she first started at General Catalyst 3 years ago, Boyle said the biggest hurdle she had to overcome was finding founders who were creative and scrappy enough to make that business model work. \"From the very beginning, and it's somewhat controversial when you talk to founders, but companies that are selling to the government or thinking about it have to fundraise very well,\" Boyle said. \"And that is based on the strength of the founder and their ability to tell a compelling story. That wasn't believed about deep tech. The pervasive view was that the tech speaks for itself and that's not the case.\" Anduril, one of Boyle's portfolio companies, is a good case in point. The startup builds virtual and augmented reality technology for military clients[11], and has faced its own set of public scrutiny for its work with US Customs and Border Contro[12]l. But its founder, Palmer Luckey, has successfully brought in more than $185 million in venture funding that catapulted its valuation north of $1 billion[13] in less than 2 years[14]. Luckey also founded virtual reality startup Oculus, which was acquired by Facebook for $2 billion in 2014. \"It takes fundraising prowess you don't see from PhDs spinning out of a lab,\" Boyle said. \"It comes down to, can a visionary founder that is deeply technical tell the story in order to survive the challenges of working in a highly regulated industry?\" Going into a highly politicized election year, Boyle's take may prove to be a contrarian one. But she's determined to help founders see it through. \"If you look at the history of tech, every major technology that stood the test of time has had a regulatory body watching it,\" Boyle said. \"There's always a market on the other side.\"NOW WATCH: How autopilot on an airplane works[15]See Also: A top Silicon Valley venture firm is doubling down on its bet that innovation won't stay in Silicon Valley.

It showed a Chinese labour camp, slightly out of focus from the air. Then the Republican turned to Google boss Sundar Pichai, who was on video. Google, Buck said, reminded him of the Communist Party in Beijing, which unscrupulously spies, censors and suppresses. He wondered, Buck said, whether Google was also in favour of \"locking Muslims in concentration camps \".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Buck's appearance was one of the most bizarre moments of the hearing in room 2141 of the American Congress. There, for five hours and 29 minutes, the politicians questioned the bosses of Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon. They accused Sundar Pichai, Tim Cook, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezo of treason, demanded the dismantling of their companies, spoke out, shouted at them. It was a spectacle that showed one thing above all: the country seems to have lost love for its internet giants. The quasi-religious transfiguration of Big Tech is probably finally history.</p><p>Room 2141 was about the question whether Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon have become too powerful. They stifle competition, thus harming consumers, was the accusation. The session was the culmination of a 13-month investigation, the showdown between the big four and the American legislature. It was the most aggressive demonstration of power against Big Tech since the US authorities tried to smash Microsoft more than 20 years ago.</p><p>For the first time, Pichai, Cook, Zuckerberg and Bezos appeared together in front of the Congress, on video because of the pandemic. They are among the richest and most powerful men in the world, they are the stars of the global tech elite, their companies together are worth about five trillion dollars. But the broadcast took away some of their authority. Pichai sat in front of a white wall, a coffee cover on the left, a stack of books on the right, all carefully arranged. Bezos, who had never testified in Congress before, took a seat in front of a cupboard with empty vases. Behind Cook were troughs with house plants. And Zuckerberg let himself be filmed from below, his head seemed unusually large.</p><p>The hearing could form the basis for a whole series of legal proceedings against the companies, initiated by various US institutions, such as the FTC antitrust authority or the Department of Justice. But most importantly, the hearing was a big show. More theatre than a substantive discussion of competition law. But that's probably how the politicians had planned it from the beginning. The four big tech stars in a single session - there can be no time for details.</p><p>It was more of a general settlement with the tech companies. \"Their dominance hampers innovation,\" said committee chairman David Cicilline, for example. \"They enrich themselves by destroying their competitors,\" the Democratic politician said, adding that the companies misused the personal information of their users. New monopolies had emerged - and America had to break them.</p><p>There is still a long way to go before then, but the Members of Parliament have already achieved one goal this afternoon. The mere fact that Pichai, Cook, Zuckerberg and Bezos were summoned before Congress at the same time makes them appear guilty. Big Tech is now in line with all the others who have endured such humiliating events: Big Pharma, Big Tobacco, Big Banks. Even if the hearing did not lead to concrete results, it could help to create a momentum for more regulation in US politics.</p><p>The accusations against the companies are very different. In the case of Apple, for example, it was about the conditions that developers must meet to get into the App Store. Providers such as Spotify criticize as unfair that they have to give 15 to 30 percent of the proceeds of sales there to Apple. Facebook has been accused of having become too dominant by buying Instagram and WhatsApp, leaving other social networks no chance. Google was accused of stealing ideas from competitors and manipulating search results. And Amazon, it was said, was using data from other merchants selling on the platform to drive them out of business.</p><p>Most of the deputies' questions were foreseeable; Pichai, Cook, Zuckerberg and Bezos had each prepared their answers well, they rarely faltered. So who finally won it, the power struggle in room 2141? More likely the managers. The politicians often cut a bad figure, as they did at previous hearings with tech bosses. One Republican asked Zuckerberg why Facebook had blocked the account of Donald Trump's son - even though it was actually Twitter. Another complained that his emails with election ads often ended up in spam folders - and suspected a conspiracy against him. For hours, the hearing had nothing to do with competition law. Rather, Trump's allies used it to complain about alleged censorship.</p><p>Politicians from both parties did not seem to have too much interest in the answers of the four witnesses. Almost all of them interrupted the business leaders after only a few seconds, did not even give them the opportunity to make their point. The members of parliament held long monologues, used the hearing for self-expression. And as soon as they had asked their questions, they left the room - you can hardly demonstrate less commitment.</p><p>When Google boss Pichai is strangled for the third time by chairman Cicilline in the middle of his first sentence, he leans back, folds his hands and smiles thinly. Pichai, it seems, has quickly understood what his role is this afternoon: to silently endure the attacks of the politicians. Bezos put up more resistance, he was the only one who in turn interrupted the MPs. The Amazon boss made a successful first appearance. He spoke clearly, got to the point quickly, was sometimes even charming in his performance.</p><p>Politicians repeatedly compared the four tech bosses with John Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie, the former oil and steel magnates. Like Bezos and Zuckerberg, Rockefeller and Carnegie had created their empires from nothing. And like them, they felt they had become too dominant. The first big monopoly trial against Rockefeller was held in 1911 in the United States.</p><p>America has a century of breakups behind it. As much as citizens adore bold entrepreneurs, most are not comfortable with the idea that someone is subjugating an entire industry. In 1911 Standard Oil and American Tobacco were dismantled, and in 1945 the US government took action against the aluminium giant Alcoa. In 1982, the telephone giant AT&amp;T was split up.

No medical institute can practice gene sequencing in clinical applications before official standards and regulations are issued. Those that have started must cease the practice, according to a circular issued by the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) on February 9. Medical instruments, reagents and other products involved in the technology can only be used after approval from the CFDA, following the regulations for each kind of product. </p><p>Those already in use but without any approval should be immediately stopped, said the circular.It claimed that to ensure the safety of gene sequencing products, authorities will organize experts to research the issue while strengthening the management of the technology.More than 200,000 pregnant women used the technology to detect whether their unborn babies have birth defects, the Legal Weekly reported in August, 2013.The report said that genetic testing services are mostly provided by two major genetic technology companies, BIG Tech and BerryGenomics, with heads of the companies once claiming publicly that their service was in a legal limbo.Gene sequencing technology is commonly seen in high-end medical check-ups in China, The Beijing News quoted a CFDA official as saying. The technology is not listed in the catalog of approved medical projects in Beijing. CFDA authorities said that many products used in genetic testing are not approved based on regulations and the technology is not certified to be clinically applied, reported The Beijing News Tuesday.As of press time, BIG Tech, a major provider of the service, did not reply to a request as to how it will respond to the circular from the Global Times.Wang Wei, a former manager from BIG Tech said that they could not find a way to register, without specifying the reason, according to the Legal Weekly. American actress Angelina Jolie announced in May 2013 that she had undergone genetic testing and discovered that she was highly susceptible to breast cancer. This led to her decision to have a double mastectomy.Steve Jobs, former CEO of Apple, spent $100,000 on whole gene sequencing to learn the DNA sequence of his genome and that of the tumors killing him.Song Ruilin, executive president of China Pharmaceutical Industry Research and Development Association, said that the CFDA is not questioning the technology, but stresses governmental approval of the clinical practice, which is a must for any new technology.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GTMCHI-34297959</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GTMCHI2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5BJF-V4D1-JDJN-64S3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">411389</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-08-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"431\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Global Times.

Welcome everyone. I'm Liz MacDonald, in for <person><nameText>Neil Cavuto. </nameText></person>The White House bashing Bain non-stop and Fox Business on top of a industry flip-flop. Venture capitalist once backing President <person><nameText>Barack Obama </nameText></person>now putting their computer chips behind <person><nameText>Mitt Romney. </nameText></person>Saying his Bain background is better for business and as big tech donors take off, it looks like the Obama campaign is backing off releasing new ads today with no mention, zero mention of Bain Capital.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul says those guys have a lot to be angry about and he joins me now. So sir, why do you think Silicon Valley is mad at the president?</p><p>SEN. RAND PAUL (R), KENTUCKY: Well, what I think is that what people don't realize about a capital investment firm is when they come in, if they do not come in at all, the business may lose all of its jobs. So let's say there is 1,000 employees and a business is struggling, and it needs an infusion of capital, maybe all 1,000 lose their jobs or maybe an investment firm comes in and 500 lose their jobs or you can say 500 people keep their jobs. So I think these people just don't understand capitalism. They don't understand private equity and really they frankly are very unfair to Romney.</p><p>MACDONALD: Angel investors basically help launch - we got the list for you, sir. Apple, Google, Facebook, Yelp, Paypal all were helped out by angel investors. Do you think they're kind of spooked that capital gains tax are going to rise next year if the president wins.</p><p>PAUL: Well, I think it's going to be such nonsense that the president will back down because I think the American people aren't that gullible to think that investors are somehow the enemy, that corporations are the enemy, that rich people are the enemy. I think the American people are going to understand is that they want the private sector to grow. Everybody, rich people, poor people, middle class, we want them all to do better. So more jobs are created. But it's not a me against you. It's not rich people against the middle class. It's not this policy of envy and divisiveness, it's really about we want all the private sector to grow. I don't think jealousy and envy are a great political device for the president.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know, it creates worse citizens when you have a bigger government, sir. I think that's your point, right?</p><p>PAUL: Exactly. And really it has to be about growing the private sector. The government sector should always be kept at a minimum because its not just very efficient. But jobs are created in the private sector, so we need to have lower taxes, less regulation. And let the economy thrive.</p><p>MACDONALD: If you tax the rich, which by the way, most small businesses are in the upper bracket, they are in the so-called rich bracket, how much - what would it do toward paying down the interest cost on the debt?</p><p>PAUL: Well, I think what it does is it destroys the people who are paying all the taxes. Right now, those two make over $200,000 a year pay 70 percent of the income tax. So if you punish them and make it harder for them to earn money, one, you create more unemployment which you also hurt the tax base because they are the tax base already. And see a lot of this is just not true. The top one percent in our country are paying nearly 40 percent of the income tax. The top one percent in our country pay more than they do in Europe. We have a more progressive tax code than they have in Europe. So really all of the president's attach are based on falsehoods and I think as this continues to play out, you will find that the American people aren't gullible enough to buy it.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes, and if you tax the rich 100 percent, not only would you demolish jobs, jobs really wouldn't go toward paying the interest cost on the debt for a couple of years, you just wipe it out. But I wanted, just turned on another subject for a second. The vice president Joe Biden has said that just because you work at Bain Capital, it no more qualifies you to become president versus being a plumber. What to make of that quote?</p><p>PAUL: Well, I think it is not a very intelligent quote. What I would say is I do want someone who has good at managing businesses that have been in failure and try to turn them around. Right now, I consider our government to be a failed business. And so I think Governor Romney would be precisely the person I would want to turn around a failing business like our government which wastes. You know, we spend $100 billion a year that we can't even account for. Our agencies are throwing that money after bad.</p><p>I think someone who has been a business man and has turned around businesses would be precisely the one you would want to turn around your country.</p><p>MACDONALD: All right. Since our president was elected, we have spent about $5 trillion. That is equal to Germany and South Korea being added to the balance sheet of the books. What did the United States get for that $5 trillion?</p><p>PAUL: Well, not a lot good. I would say that we still have 12 million people unemployed. We are still in a housing crisis, if not a depression. And really what we have done is we've added a burden of about, almost $50,000 in debt per person. We are borrowing $50,000 a second. And many of us are worried that the European crisis is a contagion that's coming to the United States next.</p><p>MACDONALD: In other words, we didn't get - little went toward building infrastructure. It seemed to have gone towards favored constituencies like the auto industry, things like training programs, right?</p><p>PAUL: Well, the thing is if you look at jobs created or say if you want to use the president's definition, it is $400,000 per job. So it is not a very efficient use of capital. Government is inherently inefficient. So you want to leave as much money you can in the wallets of consumers and Americans. And you only want to send the minimum amount to Washington because everything done by government is inherently inefficient.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes, then you get a bigger IRS to collect (INAUDIBLE) government gets. I want to turn to your father. How is your father's campaign going? I think there is some controversy about him, your father still wanting to get delegates, Mr. Ron Paul, how is his campaign going?</p><p>PAUL: Well, I would say that he has been nothing but a great asset for the Republican Party. He has brought a lot of useful enthusiasm. A lot of independents, a lot people who have become disgruntled with the Republican Party and have left the Republican Party have come back because of Ron Paul. So I think the Republican Party should be very proud of what my dad has been doing in growing the party.</p><p>MACDONALD: All right. Senator Rand Paul, so good to be with you tonight, sir. Thank you so much for your time. And good luck to your father, too.</p><p>PAUL: Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD: Next up is the Dow dropping for the 14th time in 16 days. And that has not happened in 30 years. The Dow was down nearly 200 points before a late rally. Investors are still worried about Greece. That Greece will leave the eurozone. And Gary Kaplan also says that Facebook's IPO debacle is not helping to restore confidence. He's joined by other all stars, Gary B. Smith and Penny Lee.</p><p>Gary, will the future investors be really worried about Facebook or other IPOs?</p><p>GARY KAPLAN: I just think that they're losing confidence. They're looking at a Wall Street that is just not working well. With this Facebook deal, not only was it just taken out that, but it is front and center everybody is talking about it. It's headline news. And now, they're going to get lawsuit after lawsuit after lawsuit. And you're going to be seeing investors reading this every day. And we've already seen a bunch of years where people are just taking their money out of the stock market, which may be bullish down the road, but I think this will make confidence even worse and more and more people will leave because they just don't think it's a level playing field.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know, Penny, I'm hearing from our guys on Wall Street that when it comes to Europe, it is all hands on deck. They are concerned about what is going on with Greece, the European banks have $25 trillion in assets but they got, you know, just $1 trillion in capital. They really are over leveraged those European banks, how concerned are you about that?</p><p>PENNY LEE, VENN STRATEGIES: It's very concerning. You know, essentially what happened in 2008. What we don't want to see is the collapse of one economy and have a devastating effect upon ours and the rest of the world. So it is something that we are watching very, very closely especially as it plays out under a presidential election. You know, these are the kind of things that, you know, you don't have control over, especially on a campaign side. So seeing something like that, they are very, very nervous about the repercussion that it has, not only for an election side but also on our financial market.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes, I bet the president is very worried about it. Gary B, you know, we have seen countries devalued before. So this is a scenario that Wall Street is talking about. They're saying Greece will leave the European Union and that will be a spectacular belly flop in the markets. What they are saying is what's going on now is you can't fix the problem. There is no national currency to devalue for a country to inflate their way out of the problem. (INAUDIBLE) Greece only faces austerity, meaning more job losses. We saw Argentina successfully devalued, if you can say that. Brazil, Mexico and Iceland, do you think this is a route we are headed? This is where we're going with Greece?</p><p>GARY B. SMITH, EXEMPLAR CAPITAL: Possibly but I think the bigger question, Liz, is what you just - really what you and Penny just talked about. What will be the effect here? You know, to hear Penny and Gary talk about it, I better go out and buy stock and fallout shelter companies. Because, you know, we are one day away from Armageddon. I am on the other side.</p><p>Look, let's just say Greece is thrown out of the, you know, the European Union or they devalue their country or they default on other debts. Are people going to buy less iPods? Am I going to use less Tide detergent? I bring it right back to the balance sheet and income statements of American corporations. I think we're going to actually get stronger as we become a safe haven than weaker from all these. Yes, there will be some emotional reaction, but I think the effect honestly is going to be muted especially after a month or so.</p><p>MACDONALD: All right. That is interesting. U.S. stocks as a safe haven. Really appreciate your thoughts, you guys. You're going to be back in a little bit. You're going to be back later in the show on how two nations frequently at war are showing us up. Teaming up to do something Washington cannot stop fighting over. And find out what that, that's next.</p><p>And also a big union using a big baseball bat to slam a pinata. A South Carolina Republican governor Nicki Haley. I do not see any candy coming out of the pinata by the way. No scrappy children underneath it either. But you know what instead of apologizing, the guy who thought of it, he is here to defend it.</p><p>But first the government throwing the book at Facebook, calling for hearings on its very rocky IPO. And we also have rock legend Gene Simmons. He is (INAUDIBLE), you're going to hear why from the man himself. That's next. Don't go away.</p><p>MACDONALD: Welcome back. We have more follies for Facebook. This is more and more looking like face bust. Despite today's gains, shares are down more than 15 percent since Friday's debut. This as Facebook faces a blitz over its IPO debacle. Regulators in Washington are asking questions. Senators and congressmen are demanding answers. Shareholders are demanding retribution.</p><p>And my next guest is representing some of them. He is attorney Michael Goldberg. He is representing investors suing over Facebook. He joins me on the phone. So sir, what are the grounds for your lawsuit against this situation with Facebook?</p><p>MICHAEL GOLDBERG, ATTORNEY (ON THE PHONE): Yes, first, thank you for having me on your show. The grounds for our lawsuit against Facebook on behalf of the shareholders is that there was dissemination of material information to only certain investor clients of the underwriters and not to the public as a whole.</p><p>MACDONALD: You are talking about how the underwriters meaning Morgan Stanley, JPMmorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs got information ahead of times. But you know what, Facebook earnings weren't going to be so hot, is that what it is?</p><p>GOLDBERG: That's absolutely correct. And that is a problem on several fronts. First of all, it's a huge problem for shareholders of Facebook and secondly it's a problem for shareholders in general to learn that Wall Street is playing a game where the preferred investors have specific information that the rest of the small investors are not obtaining.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know, Michael, Eliot Spitzer when he was attorney general for New York state he got a settlement with Wall Street. I covered this settlement. And basically, what you are talking about, the grounds for your suit, you know what you may not have a case because it is not illegal for these Wall Street firms to verbalize their information, to talk to Facebook and to have Facebook talk back to them. The loophole in the settlement was they could not put it in writing, they couldn't put it in a research report. They could not put it in an e-mail. Are you worried that the Spitzer settlement may blow your lawsuit to smithering?</p><p>GOLDBERG: Not at all. We feel very strongly that there is a huge problem here. (INAUDIBLE) and when earnings forecast which are material information, especially when they are prepared by analysts who have privileged assets to company management and lead underwriters on the IPO, these analysts would have much better information about the company then any one else. So the fact that these analysts suddenly cut their earnings forecast and then this information is not passed on to broader public is a huge problem.</p><p>MACDONALD: I hear what you're saying. It may be more sleazy than a legal. But we're going to be watching your lawsuit very closely, Michael Goldberg. We really appreciate you coming on, sir. Thank you so much for your time.</p><p>GOLDBERG: Thank you again, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD: Next up, we warned you about this we just didn't know it would be happening so soon. Facebook not even public for one week and already the U.S. government getting involved. Lawmakers are now calling for hearings and investigations and Tea Party Jen Stefano says you know what, Washington should stay out of this. Jen, thank you so much for coming. Why do you think DC should stay out?</p><p>JENNIFER STEFANO, TEA PARTY ACTIVIST: I will tell you, despite or because of the Facebook IPO, the free markets still operate more efficiently than the United States Congress. They need to and I don't want to get too technical on them, butt out.</p><p>MACDONALD: Butt out. You know here's the deal, we had a jobs act, in other words, a piece of legislation that the president signed that would make it easier for the little guy to go public. You know, they had a billion dollar IPO. Now we've got people in Congress saying, you know what, we're going to maybe resend that legislation because that legislation would have lowered a lot of the barriers in terms of disclosures and transparency regulation and small businesses cannot afford to pay for. They are little guys, they are not the big guys. They can't hire (INAUDIBLE) of attorneys and lawyers and accountants, what do make of that?</p><p>STEFANO: IPO (INAUDIBLE) in the jobs act. By the way, the people now calling to repeal it are the democrats, the same people who wanted the jobs act. Let's go back even further to a piece of legislation in 1934. The Securities Exchange Act was set up as SEC. The Congress has already legislated is the job of the SEC to oversee the free markets in America.</p><p>Now, if there is an issue, like Mr. Goldberg was talking about, if that turns out to be true, there are ways to handle it. A, there already is a government organization involved. B, as you can see with Mr. Goldberg, the free markets will decide. If this lawsuit turns out to be frivolous, they will have to pay for all the legal expenses, not just of themselves but of the companies as well. Free markets prevail here.</p><p>MACDONALD: We do have the supposedly the guys on the stick on Wall Street, meaning the Wall Street cops in the form of the SEC. I know they have been criticizing in the past. But when I hear people in Washington, you know, getting all upset about what they see happening in the marketplace and then they call for hearings, to my mind, I feel like we have a hearing factory, too much at work in Washington, D.C., what are we getting for our taxpayer money down there?</p><p>STEFANO: You are getting nothing. I don't even say it's a dog and pony show. But at least dog and pony shows are entertaining. These aren't even entertaining. I mean it is a bunch of blustering what Congress is doing. There are laws on the book. And here's what - Congress needs to understand, you're never going to make anything (INAUDIBLE) and that's just the way it is. Sometimes people don't do things right. And sometimes even when everything is done right which could or could not be the situation, you don't always win. Maybe people lost money because this wasn't a good investment. That is called free markets. That's called risk reward.</p><p>MACDONALD: It does feel rigged. I mean I hear what you're saying. There's no shortage of rules or legislation, it's just a shortage of enforcement but you know, it just feels sleazy that the retail guy, that Facebook and the investment got on Wall Street knew the retail crowd, the little guy is going to come piling into this and they got hosed. What do you make of that?</p><p>STEFANO: Right and that is - I am not taking Facebook's side or the banks' side or any side. My point is there are ways, rules and laws right now to have this handled. It is not the job of the United States Congress to involve themselves in this. They have already set up a regulatory body. If the little guy got hosed, rules were violated, if laws were broken, that has got to be handled.</p><p>MACDONALD: Here's one thing that Washington regulators could have asked Facebook, how do you calculate your 845 million users, that's two and half the size of the United States. How do you calculate that? There was no questioning in the media. No questioning from Washington. No questioning from Wall Street in that possibly inflated number. The number could actually be 250 million because Facebook counts user who go to other web sites and click on the like button, things like that. If that questioning happened upfront, we may not have had this debacle right now, right?</p><p>STEFANO: Look, the media is complicit in not asking the right questions in a lot of areas. I mean, let's not kid ourselves. But also there needs to be personal responsibility. I'm one of the little guys. You need to take responsibility. Investing is a risk. We in America, sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. We have to take responsibility, find out if this is a lawbreaker.</p><p>MACDONALD: All right. Tea party activist, Jen Stefano, thank you so much for joining us tonight. Always great to see you.</p><p>Next up, much more on Facebook coming up with Gene Simmons, why after what Mark Zuckerberg is doing now, well, he's saying he can kiss investors goodbye.</p><p>But first, well you know what? Do you want to check up, you need a physical exam, this is going to make you feel down if you care about your healthcare. You're going to care about this. Don't go away. We've got a hot segment coming up. Stay with us.</p><p>MACDONALD: Welcome back. You're not going to believe this. This is a video that's going viral on the internet. It is of a union leader bashing a pinata with Republican governor Nicki Haley's face on it. This is real video, folks. And in 10 minutes, we got Governor Nicki Haley's response later. That pinata - you know that pinata is going to need a doctor. But good luck finding one.</p><p>More doctors saying they cannot afford to accept Medicaid and Medicare. And in fact, we have new data out here, 36 percent are not taking any new Medicaid patients at all. We've got Dr. Leigh Vinocur saying that when the president's healthcare law kicks in, you know what, things are going to get worse. So good to be with you tonight, doctor. What do make of this? What's your point here?</p><p>DR. LEIGH VINOCUR, UNIVERSITY OF MD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE: Thanks for having me. Well, it is going to be a problem. Right now, over a quarter of private physicians don't take Medicaid and about 10 percent won't take Medicare. The reimbursement is so low. And there is this they are going to expand Medicaid. That was part of how they are going to have the affordable health care act. So there's going to be about 26 million more people going into Medicaid and then with the baby boomers aging it's predicted to have about 78 million more Medicare patients. And the problem is the reimbursement is so low that doctors are saying that they cannot afford to take it unless you are an institution. So it's going to be a big problem.</p><p>MACDONALD: So doctor, you are saying essentially that this is the flipside to universal health coverage. So even though you can get health insurance for everybody, it does not mean they're going to get healthcare, is that right?</p><p>VINOCUR: Right. And that is what a lot of physicians have been saying. Universal insurance coverage doesn't mean universal access to care. I mean right now with Medicaid patients, there are some states that are trying to limit their access to emergency care. They are picking diagnosis and they are asking patients to decide whether their indigestion is chest pain or a heart attack and that's occurring right now when there's a bigger influx of Medicaid patients, it's going to be worse. Just covering someone with insurance doesn't mean you're going to have access to care and there's going to be a shortage of doctors predicted as this is going forward.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know, doctor, what we're seeing now, in fact, I'm friends with a brain surgeon, I've got a lot of friends who are doctors, does this mean that people using the emergency room as their primary care doctor is going to get worse? Will that situation get worse?</p><p>VINOCUR: Well, you know, sometimes they do have to use it because they can't get into their doctors, but it is not because they don't have doctors. The doctors can't fit them in. They won't take them right away. And ERs are there. We see everybody no matter what. And that's the issue but there is this misconception that it is more expensive care. And it's really not. It's only two cents on every healthcare dollar for emergency services.</p><p>MACDONALD: That is a really crowded emergency room. And you know what, I am hearing to that a lot of these doctors they get sued by people. They get sued constantly (INAUDIBLE) lawsuits. Do you see that as an untold story in the media. What's going on with emergency room doctors getting sued often by people who are not legitimately here, they are illegal immigrants, do you hear that story?</p><p>VINOCUR: Well, I mean, we need some sort of liability reform. And certainly, ER doctors are in the group because they don't know these patients. They come in and they do not have a relationship. So they are in the high risk group for medical malpractice. So you're not going to have meaningful healthcare cuts and decreased healthcare dollars until you talk about reform, TORT reform and making sure that there is some kind of medical liability reform. And nobody is talking about that.</p><p>MACDONALD: All right. Dr. Vinocur, thank you so much for your time. We appreciate your input here.</p><p>VINOCUR: My pleasure</p><p>MACDONALD: All right. Next up, gentlemen, start your engines. We got a new EPA controversy revving up and that is because it is matching up with NASCAR. Yes, the EPA is hooking up with NASCAR. This one is going to drive you mad.</p><p>MACDONALD: In our \"Fox Financial Flash,\" Hewlett Packard stock rising after hours right now. HP reporting quarterly sales and profits beating expectations, but that news is overshadowed by the company announcing 27,000 job cuts.</p><p>And this spring housing is springing back to life. New home sales rising more than 3 percent last month, and prices up nearly 5 percent in the past year. Home sales up, oil prices down, crude settling below 90 bucks a barrel for the first time in seven months. And gas dropping to $3.68 a gallon. And that is down $0.18 in the past month.</p><p>Well, next up, the EPA, you know what, it is all about clean air. But now critics are saying it is full of hot air. That is because it is partnering with NASCAR to push green initiatives. That includes encouraging the tracks to recycle more, conserve water, (inaudible) sustainability. You get the picture.</p><p>Mark Modica from the National Legal and Policy Center says you know what, this proves the EPA is clueless. Sir, what did you make of this when you heard this news?</p><p>MARK MODICA, NATIONAL LEGAL AND POLICY CENTER: I just think it is ludicrous, Liz. It shows you how out of touch the administration is. I mean, NASCAR, these guys, I think the cars get about 4 miles to the gallon. And they are going to push a green energy initiative, it is like animal activists going to bull fighters for sponsorship. It just makes no sense. I do not know what they are thinking. I think they could use some recyclable cups, and that's going to make everything great and NASCAR is going to go green.</p><p>MACDONALD: We have got a statement from the chief marketing officer of NASCAR, Mark. I want you to react to it. He is saying this is a great example of NASCAR's commitment to green innovation and our role as a leader in sustainability. What do think of that?</p><p>MODICA: What I make is probably some taxpayer money going to support something in -- and some crony is making money somewhere. I just can't figure it. It makes no sense. I mean, it is like the administration thinks that mainstream America thinks like them, which they do not. People do not want to trade in their vehicles for Chevy Volts. NASCAR fans, I cannot see them trading in their pickups and beer for Chevy Volts and chardonnay. It is just -- it is a strange move.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know, here's the deal. We have got a comment from the -- basically the EPA and they are saying NASCAR can be a powerful platform to raise environmental awareness, drive the adoption of safer products by more Americans and support the growing green economy. So they are seeing, no pun intended, NASCAR as a vehicle to promote green awareness. What do you make of that?</p><p>MODICA: I think it is a vehicle to try to reach more moderate and conservative voters. I have noticed the kind of push lately, particularly with the Chevy Volt and Bob Lutz, to try to make a case that driving Chevy Volts and driving EV's is going to end terrorism because we are not going to need foreign oil anymore. And it is just a big hoax. When you look at how many EV's are going to be on the road -- we have got 250 million passenger vehicles on the road. And a goal in a few years of having a million EV's is going to do practically nothing to reduce foreign oil consumption. It is fractional.</p><p>MACDONALD: Right. We also, just in separate news, we have got the president visiting a wind company, wind manufacturer tomorrow, in Iowa. What do you make of that?</p><p>MODICA: I'd probably say General Electric is probably making the windmills, and they are making a lot of money on that, I am sure. You know, it's just -- solar, wind, electric vehicles -- there is just so much money, taxpayer money being spent on these initiatives. The market is not ready for this. The technologies are not ready to make a significant impact. It is just costing billions. They should just stop it already.</p><p>MACDONALD: All right, Mark Modica, with the National Legal and Policy Center, so good to speak with you tonight. Thank you so much for your time.</p><p>MODICA: Thanks, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD: Next up, the AFl-CIO blasting a pinata with her face on it. Now, Governor Nikki Haley is blasting back.</p><p>But first, rock legend, entrepreneur, reality TV star and one man brand, that's Gene Simmons, and he is here with us next. Don't go away.</p><p>MACDONALD: We have got a Fox Business Alert. This is a real Zucker- punch. You're not going to believe this story. SEC filings show that Mark Zuckerberg has already sold 30 million shares worth of Facebook stock. That is worth more than a billion bucks, and he is not exactly showing confidence in his own band. And my next guest is a legendary rocker who knows a thing or two about brands, bands and confidence. He is an entrepreneur. He's Gene Simmons. He joins me now. KISS co-founder and star of the reality TV show \"Gene Simmons Family Jewels.\"</p><p>Good to be with you, Gene.</p><p>GENE SIMMONS, ROCK STAR, REALITY TV PERSONALITY: Thank you very much.</p><p>MACDONALD: Gene, what did you make of this news?</p><p>SIMMONS: There is a much bigger story which I suspect allegedly and other legal terms like that, which means we are going to be protected in case someone wants to be litigious -- there is a bigger story here, that has to do with Goldman Sachs, Nasdaq. Goldman have been bad boys in the past and have had to pay the SEC and other organizations lots of money for being bad. There is a very, much bigger story here than whether or not Zuckerberg actually sold shares of his own stock. He is allowed to do that, legally, and I'm not a lawyer -- full disclosure before the fact.</p><p>However, something stinks in Denmark. And it's big time. This could be a one of a kind political event that is going to be rocking the entire, yet again, Wall Street is going to have to clean up its act. I want to find out what Goldman knew, what they did not know. Did they have full disclosure to the people who were they representing. And Nasdaq -- what the hell, just when the biggest -- well, I don't want to say -- one of the biggest IPOs was coming along, Nasdaq happened not to have been working well. It is coincidence beyond coincidence.</p><p>MACDONALD: Now, let's say you brought one of your companies public, would you sell shares in it immediately to raise money?</p><p>SIMMONS: No, I would do it differently. And I do not like going public because I don't like to answer to dentists in Iowa. Because when you go public, your entire life is on -- I mean, my entire life is clear anyway, because the United States government wants to know how much I make, do I have any offshore accounts, et cetera, ad infinitum, ad nauseum, but I don't want to sit with people who are not qualified to understand business models and ask me where's my share doing. No, I don't like the idea.</p><p>MACDONALD: They would also be complaining about your executive pay to.</p><p>SIMMONS: That is because they cannot fathom why somebody should be paid millions and millions because they don't understand it. I'm all -- if you came to me and you said I am going to double the value of the company but I want 10 percent right off the top, of course you would say that. You would say terrific, do it. If you can double the company, you should take 10 percent off the top.</p><p>MACDONALD: What do you think of Facebook? Do you like it?</p><p>SIMMONS: It is a terrific company. And I have to again say that I am not a financial analyst, I am not a lawyer, I am simply a citizen. It is a fantastically successful story. I will say in the interests of full disclosure, again, that Orzbow (ph), the company that I am a partner of, was three times as big as Facebook was in the same time period, the world's largest universal language translator. Cool Springs Life, also loans high net work individuals as much as $300 million--</p><p>MACDONALD: That's another of your companies, right?</p><p>SIMMONS: Another one of our companies. Rock &amp; Brews is a restaurant chain that I am a partner of. We hire vets, first and foremost. And \"Gene Simmons Family Jewels,\" our next season debuts on the 28th of this month. And what we are doing is making sure that people know that we hire vets.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know, Gene, it's (inaudible), because the president wants to raise your taxes. What is that going to do for the jobs you create at your companies? (inaudible) raise taxes on you.</p><p>SIMMONS: Well, I think he means well, but he is unqualified to make the assessment because he has never run a company. I think it is high time. Although I voted for the man. I think he is a well meaning man.</p><p>MACDONALD: Are you surprised at what his policies have been?</p><p>SIMMONS: No. I believe that it goes -- if you look at the resume, it's sort of makes sense, that somebody who's never run a company and never been overseas has a point of view about Israel and about business. Based on his perception--</p><p>MACDONALD: He has been overseas, though, right?</p><p>SIMMONS: Not before he was elected president.</p><p>MACDONALD: Well, he was in Kenya and Indonesia.</p><p>SIMMONS: Well, yes, that is a world view, isn't it? Kenya and Indonesia. That tells you a lot about the world. No, it does not. But the thing is that it's time and high time, I say, again and again and again, business people must start running government. Because ultimately and invariably, and other big words like gymnasium, everybody's salary and everybody's job depends on people who can create jobs and understand structure. Structure means imports and exports. Imports have to be, what, smaller than your exports. Doesn't that make sense? So you have a profit.</p><p>So the fact that we are trillions of dollars in debt means that there are people who mean well, used to be Berkeley College professors, and don't have a clue. I edited myself so you did not have to, but you can read my lips, don't have a clue how to run government.</p><p>MACDONALD: So you are frustrated?</p><p>SIMMONS: Intrinsically, a country is a business. And I wanted to get the pregnant pause in there. What do you mean by that? I mean exactly what I mean. That a country's responsibility is to make sure its population is safe and wealthy. And anybody who talks about the nature of things, what does life mean, where are we going, do I have my mother's hips, doesn't understand what government should be about. It should be about making sure you have jobs, especially our vets, first. And that we're safe. There's no other job for government. Do not tell me where to go, what to do, who to pray to, or anything else.</p><p>MACDONALD: What to eat.</p><p>SIMMONS: Or what to eat. If you want to smoke and get cancer, that's your responsibility. You should not be able to sue anybody, and that is why I am for Gene Simmons as benevolent dictator of this country.</p><p>MACDONALD: There is nobody like him. There's just no one like Gene Simmons. The one and only legend.</p><p>SIMMONS: It was a real pleasure to have me on the show.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes, it's always a pleasure to have you on the show. You are a legend.</p><p>SIMMONS: In my own mind.</p><p>MACDONALD: Never.</p><p>SIMMONS: Come see us on tour. KISS and Motley Crue starting July, very important I say that.</p><p>MACDONALD: Very hot.</p><p>SIMMONS: My mother wants another house. Please.</p><p>MACDONALD: OK. Hi to mom. Thank you, Gene Simmons, for joining us tonight. Really appreciate it.</p><p>Next up, the governor of South Carolina taking a beating from union leaders. You are not going to want to miss this one. The man behind the pinata party is not apologizing. In fact, he is proud of this, and he is with us next. Do not go away.</p><p>MACDONALD: A union beatdown takes aim at South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, and this new video is going viral. It's showing the state's union leaders savagely beating a pinata emblazoned with Republican governor's face. The governor responded via Twitter saying, wow, I wonder if the unions think this kind of thing will make people take them seriously.</p><p>And my next guest says you know what, it is serious, and it was his idea. He is South CarolinaAFL-CIO's Brett Bursey, and he was last year's labor activist of the year. And he joins me now. Sir, thank you so much for your time. We really appreciate you joining us.</p><p>I just want to give you--</p><p>BRETT BURSEY, SC PROGRESSIVE NETWORK, DIRECTOR: Well, thank you, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD: I want to give you some of the reaction to what people saw in that video that went viral. It was mean-spirited, politically dimwitted, gives life to the description of union people as thugs, and another person wrote in, \"If a small businessman had beaten a pinata of a Democratic politician, that person would have been hauled into hearings on Capitol Hill.\" What do you make of the reaction?</p><p>BURSEY: Well, I think it's much ado about nothing, but I welcome the opportunity for a rational discussion about labor's relationship with capital.</p><p>The event happened at the end of a daylong conference where we were celebrating Donna Dewitt's, the president of the AFL-CIO's long commitment to organized labor and working families in South Carolina. And if you had been with us, you have to be in South Carolina to appreciate the context of having been bashed repeatedly, overtly and openly, by the governor. The governor said in her last state of the state message, unions are not welcome in South Carolina. And she has gone out of her way to make -- do everything that she can from Department of Labor and regulations to be able to make it harder for workers in South Carolina to organize. She has promoted budget cuts that hurt working people.</p><p>South Carolina now has the lowest number of weeks that you are eligible for unemployment insurance after you lose your job. We've got higher than national average unemployment. Those are the things that we need to be talking about, not comic relief.</p><p>MACDONALD: I hear what you are saying. I want to get to the statement from the AFL-CIO itself. And this is a statement we're hearing. \"While it was meant as fun, there is absolutely no place for that kind of joke in a conversation that is extremely serious about how we need to rebuild our class and our country. There's plenty to talk about in Governor Haley's awful record. We do not believe that is an appropriate joke. Working people deserve a better conversation.\"</p><p>Do you feel like this pinata incident is basically going to turn people against what you were just saying, that people are just going to shut down and not listen to what you are saying? Are you afraid of that?</p><p>BURSEY: No, I do not think so. I think that the people that you suggest might be shut down are those that are seeing through the foolishness, the ideological rigidity of people like Governor Haley, that are against government. They are against taxes. The economy is not going to improve until we create jobs. And so I think that there are a lot of people in South Carolina and across the United States that perfectly understand.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: I think what the governor is saying is that the government cannot always be the organization that creates jobs. Taxes are basically gouging the middle-class taxpayer in your own state, and it's not doing much towards the way of jobs. You said it yourself, your state's unemployment rate is higher than the national average.</p><p>BURSEY: Liz, if people understood the truth instead of the rhetoric - - South Carolina is 50th in the nation in per-capita tax burdens. We are not overtaxed. That is more of the ideological drama that Nikki Haley and her ilk are using to be able to get working people to vote against their own interests.</p><p>MACDONALD: All right, well, right to work states, I mean, the personal income is up by (ph) 40 percent. Non right to work states only have 36 percent. I'm seeing private sector job creation in right to work states up 1.5 million jobs. Non right to work states down 1.9 million jobs. We are talking about the ways to create jobs.</p><p>I think the American people, I'm sure they would want to hear what you have to say. I think they are tired of the us against them kind of rhetoric. I am going to give you final word on one more reaction to this. \"Not every union moment\" -- this is a Twitter that went out -- \"not every union moment is a Sally Field 'Norma Rae' moment when it is about gouging taxpayers who often pay government union worker wages and also taxpayers who help fund the government in your state like South Carolina.\" I will give you the final word.</p><p>BURSEY: Well, first, let me make sure that you understand that I am not representing the AFL-CIO. I have been a union member for 31 years, but the question about the difference in disparities of up and down in right to work states -- right to work states, South Carolina's biggest industries have been toxic waste and nuclear waste. We work cheap here. And so if there is like a bump in low-wage labor, it is going to reflect in South Carolina. The governor's latest job that she recruited was a call center from India. We're now -- Nikki Haley has decided we don't have to compete with third world countries; we can be one.</p><p>MACDONALD: All right, Brett Bursey with the AFL-CIO, thank you so much for your time.</p><p>And next up we've got a really hot show remaining. We've got India and Pakistan making nice to make some dough. The pipeline war continues. You know what? America is getting smoked here. You don't want to miss this segment. Stay with us.</p><p>MACDONALD: Welcome back. Two countries, three wars behind them, agreeing on one thing that we cannot. India and Pakistan teaming up to build a pipeline through Afghanistan. The U.S. is backing that decision, and Gary Kalbaum is wondering why not back the Keystone pipeline here at home. Gary, take it.</p><p>KALBAUM: Well, it is simple. The people running the show here are dummies. You know, we don't have billions of barrels around here in the water and in the rock and everywhere else. There are trillions that would keep us running for a couple of centuries. So to watch on a daily basis nothing gets done, it is about as disheartening as can be.</p><p>MACDONALD: Penny Lee, it is pretty ironic, though, don't you think?</p><p>LEE: Absolutely. What I'm hoping for is that with the expedited process for the southern route on the Keystone pipeline that we actually are able to see that it actually does get completed and then we can expedite this process. I agree, we do need to open up the Keystone.</p><p>MACDONALD: Gary B., what do you think?</p><p>SMITH: It all boils down unfortunately to politics. It is politically wise for us to support the Pakistan-India pipeline because it moves India away from Iranian oil, but here, it's politically correct for the president to support the environmentalists at the cost of the country.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes, we have got all sorts of pipelines, Gary B., in this country, right? And also, you can see pipelines being built around to circumvent Iran and the Strait of Hormuz. I mean, I don't get this thinking. By the way, it would create infrastructure jobs in this country. Right, Gary B.?</p><p>SMITH: Yes. Absolutely, and eventually decrease oil prices. So it just makes all the sense, but you know, that all the above energy policy seems to be nothing but hot air.</p><p>MACDONALD: All right, all-stars, you've been terrific as always. Thanks so much for joining us tonight. Tomorrow, we have billionaire investor Wilbur Ross. You won't want to miss that show. Thanks for watching, America. Good night.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAVUTO-2012052301cb223</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAVUTO2012</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:55PY-0S71-DYG3-110K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">347932</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7206\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2012 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CAVUTO</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"05\" year=\"2012\"><dateText>May 23, 2012 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0001USN</classCode><className>BAIN CAPITAL LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00023HP</classCode><className>PAYPAL INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>AAPL (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Economy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D0UY</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2012</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DF5U</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009TRZ</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000629</classCode><className>ENTREPRENEURSHIP</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001822</classCode><className>WEALTHY PEOPLE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001010</classCode><className>LAYOFFS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001688</classCode><className>TAXES &amp;

This is in contrast to the older model where typically \"US invests, China produces and consumption is back in the US\", Mr Foo said.</p><p>As a result, more entrepreneurs are thinking of ways to \"decouple\" their international businesses and address local regulatory concerns and consumer appetites.</p><p>\"If Tik Tok (a Chinese-made app facing pushback from the Trump administration over national security concerns) had been able to decouple themselves earlier before all of these things happened, it might have been a different story,\" said Mr Foo during the Changemakers Conversations event organised by Singapore Management University's Institute of Innovation and Entrepreneurship.</p><p>The series of panel discussions brings together internationally-renowned scholars and business leaders to discuss and debate issues of interest to startups.</p><p>DBS chief Piyush Gupta noted the importance of understanding local nuances, pointing out that it is a \"fallacy\" to believe that all Big Tech has been able to easily expand globally.</p><p>US Big Tech has minimal presence in China and Chinese Big Tech has found it hard to scale outside of its homeground. Chinese tech giant Alibaba, for instance, has made several investments in South-east Asia but has not been uniformly successful, Mr Gupta said.</p><p>In fintech, it is even less straightforward. \"Look at the case of Libra, and the attempt by Facebook to create a global digital currency. They got pushback from regulators in almost every country including their own. It's partly... to do with the fact that countries don't want to give up control over their own monetary policy and their own money supply,\" Mr Gupta said.</p><p>That said, how localised a service needs to be depends largely on what kind of service it is, Mr Foo noted.</p><p>Ride-sharing and food delivery require very localised operations. \"Where it involves regulation and more tightness on the ground, that's where the local players can win,\" he said. But for asset-light products that are cloud-based and community-driven, global players potentially have an edge over their local peers, he added.</p><p>Businesses globally have seen their operations affected by the escalating US-China tensions under the Trump administration. With this, all eyes are on the upcoming US Presidential elections, with observers wondering whether it will change the course of geopolitics.</p><p>Oliver Tornby, chairman at McKinsey &amp; Co, believes it is not likely to do so. \"(The Democrats and the Republicans) agree on the need for a tougher stance on China. This is not going to change any time soon,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-316322</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60YK-1FS1-JCF2-8011-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"496\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Business Times Singapore</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"10\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>October 1, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hi, I'm Jamie Condliffe. Greetings from London. Here's a look at the week's tech news: </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  President Trump's latest swipe at Huawei could be the start of a deep transformation of the tech sector.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Citing national security concerns, the Commerce Department said this month that American companies would need special permission to sell some products to Huawei and other Chinese companies. This past week, things escalated.</p><p>  Companies including Google, Qualcomm and Broadcom froze some of the supply of products to the Chinese technology giant. (Google, for instance, will no longer offer Huawei the full version of its Android operating system.) The crackdown may expand, with a ban on sales to Chinese surveillance companies possible.</p><p>  Third-country suppliers also need a license to sell products to Huawei if content from the United States contributes more than 25 percent to their value, and the British semiconductor designer ARM said it would stop licensing technology to Huawei's chip unit. (Mobile carriers in Britain also stopped offering Huawei phones to some customers, over Android support concerns.)</p><p>  What now? The United States government offered a 90-day grace period for some transactions between American companies and Huawei. That ''doesn't mean much,'' <person><nameText>Ren Zhengfei, </nameText></person>Huawei's founder, said, but it could signal that the overarching ban is little more than short-lived trade posturing.</p><p>  Still, the Trump administration has spoken repeatedly about its desire to blunt China's technological development, and China threatened to retaliate. So this could be the start of a long fight -- the raising of ''a digital Iron Curtain,'' as my colleague Li Yuan put it.</p><p>  ''This is a turning point,'' said Xiaolan Fu, the director of the Technology and Management Center for Development at Oxford University. ''It is changing the direction to a more closed, protectionist approach.''</p><p>  If the freeze-out persists, the near term looks rough for Huawei's smartphone division. It has stockpiled Western chips, maintained supply from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (the world's largest contract chip maker) and developed its own phone software. But it could be crippled by an inability to source components and may struggle to find markets outside China for its devices.</p><p>  In the long term, the ban could push the world toward divided technologies.</p><p>  ''The lesson the Chinese have taken from the Trump administration's trade strategy is that the U.S. is pursuing a technology containment approach,'' said Adam Segal, the director of the digital and cyberspace policy program at the Council on Foreign Relations. The solution is independence -- something China has pushed for by encouraging domestic tech prowess, including in chip production.</p><p>  ''I think we are moving toward a bifurcated technology system,'' Mr. Segal said. China uses Chinese products, and America uses American products.</p><p>  A big question then: Which side do other countries take? The United States probably assumes the West will follow its lead. But nations like Britain and Germany aren't yielding to American pressure to block Huawei from building next-generation 5G wireless networks over national security risks.</p><p>  Poorer countries are likely to be won over by price: Huawei is one of the leading, and cheapest, developers of 5G technology. For some countries wanting to jump-start economies with fast wireless networks, siding with China may be the only option.</p><p>  Such fragmentation may affect consumers. Ms. Fu points out that in a globalized economy, manufacturing takes place in the most efficient location.</p><p>  A move to protectionism would prompt China and the United States to relocate production domestically, or at least to ally nations, which could drive up prices of devices. And the development and deployment of 5G in a fragmented environment could lack economies of scale afforded by globalism, Mr. Segal said. That could potentially delay its rollout and increase cost.</p><p>  Welcome to tech's Cold War.</p><p>Qualcomm's court loss</p><p>  Geopolitics isn't the only force of change in the smartphone industry: So is the tech industry's new obsession, antitrust.</p><p>  On Tuesday, Judge Lucy Koh of United States District Court in San Jose, Calif., ruled that Qualcomm had suppressed competition in the smartphone chip market and charged ''onerous'' fees for the use of its patents.</p><p>  ''Qualcomm's licensing practices have strangled competition,'' she wrote. It must now strike new licensing agreements and be monitored for seven years to ensure compliance.</p><p>  Phone makers, particularly Apple, had bristled at Qualcomm's royalties, which could be as high as 5 percent of a handset's wholesale price. (Apple turned the other cheek and settled its royalty case with Qualcomm last month, sacrificing $27 billion in damages and making a payment of at least $4.5 billion to use Qualcomm's 5G chips.) So the ruling could reduce costs for smartphone makers and consumers.</p><p>  It also undercuts Qualcomm's business model, which is largely based on profits from patent fees. It could also complicate efforts by the United States to assert itself in the creation of 5G networks.</p><p>  America's first A.I. rules</p><p>  The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development announced a set of principles on Wednesday to guide the development of artificial intelligence. Conspicuous by its presence on the list of nations backing the rules: the United States.</p><p>  The Trump administration long shied away from such policies. But as my colleague Steve Lohr reported in April, it was spurred into action by a wave of tech regulation -- particularly Europe's new General Data Protection Regulation. The realization: Regulations that would affect the nation's tech industry were coming, and federal officials needed to participate if they were to shape them.</p><p>  So the administration decided to collaborate with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and this is the first time that it has formally endorsed a set of international A.I. guidelines.</p><p>  The guidelines -- which suggest that A.I. should benefit people and the planet, and be designed to respect the rule of law and human rights, among other things -- aren't legally binding.</p><p>  But Jack Clark, the head of policy at OpenAI, an artificial intelligence lab in San Francisco, said it was ''quite significant'' that the United States had signed on to them. It is, he said, a sign that the administration is ''putting its weight behind'' the development of A.I.</p><p>  Some stories you shouldn't miss</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 Big Tech seized the protectionist narrative. Executives have suggested that strict regulation of their companies could hand advantages to the Chinese.</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 Cleaning up Facebook brings its A.I. whiz to tears.

It's a great tradition to be asked to be part of.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I don't know how many of you got a chance to see that terrific West End play by James Graham about the newspaper industry called Ink? It tells the story about Rupert Murdoch buying the Sun newspaper in 1969 and the revolution he brought to Fleet Street.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The person who sold it to him was the chair of the Mirror group, Hugh Cudlipp, the inventor of the modern red top tabloid - and the editor who this annual lecture honours. Cudlipp features as a character in the play. With his soft Welsh accent, he's portrayed as a champion of the working classes, who sees the press as performing a progressive public service.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In his mind, popular newspapers exist to 'better' the lives of working people - explaining to them, as no one had bothered before, everything from the virtues of classical music to the contents of the latest Budget.</p><p>(David Dyson)</p><p>The new editor of the Sun, Larry Lamb, doesn't agree. He thinks Cudlipp is patronising people, telling them 'this is good for you, this is bad, read this/ listen to that'.</p><p>Cudlipp responds with a warning from someone who feels that times are changing around him. \"Pander to and promote the most base instincts of people all you like, fine, create an appetite, but I warn you\", he says. \"You'll have to keep feeding it\".</p><p>It's a cry about the dangers of populism, in a play set half a century ago, that of course resonates with the modern audience it was written for.</p><p>But it's more subtle than that. The playwright wants us to understand that Hugh Cudlipp and Larry Lamb are both right. In politics and in , you have both to listen to the public, and you also have to lead them.</p><p>How you do that is something I wrestled with, in each one of the eight Budgets I delivered. Do you give the country what it says it wants or what you think it needs?</p><p>We wrestle with similar questions every day in the newsroom of the Evening Standard - a paper once edited by Hugh Cudlipp's brother Percy, and one I am proud to edit today.</p><p>Do you provide the reader with what they say they want, or what you think they should read? There's no point dutifully reporting on serious events if no one reads it, and so no one pays for the advertising that funds those reporters. But if all you're offering is click-bait, driving traffic through funny animal videos and snaps of Kim Kardashian shopping in Malibu, is that anything more than a platform for distracting people while they're sold things?</p><p>I believe good journalism is about informing and entertaining. Listening to your readers, yes, but also being part of the conversation that shapes their view of the world</p><p>I believe good journalism is about informing and entertaining. Listening to your readers, yes, but also being part of the conversation that shapes their view of the world. Working out how to do that at the Evening Standard, one of the oldest papers in the country with the youngest and most diverse readership, and one of the largest too - is a challenge, and one that I look forward to every morning.</p><p>Of course, I come at this task from an unusual background.</p><p>The only thing I'd edited before the Standard was my university magazine, which has, from today's point of view, the unfortunate name of ISIS. When I travel to America I always assume I am going to be stopped and asked about my time with a murderous terrorist organisation. As it is, the most subversive thing we did was to print copies of our student magazine on hemp paper made from a cannabis plant.</p><p>After university, I tried and failed to get a job as a journalist - and so I became the Chancellor of the Exchequer instead. And when I tried and failed to stop Britain voting to leave the EU, I stopped being Chancellor and became a newspaper editor instead.</p><p>I'd had enough of the fake news, the spin and fiddled expenses of politics. So I thought I'd try journalism instead.</p><p>When the move was announced, exactly two years ago this month, there were some who disapproved. I had simultaneously managed to offend two of the more self-righteous professions in Britain: journalists and politicians. Some journalists thought it was outrageous that someone who had helped run a country should presume to try to run a newspaper. Some politicians thought it was outrageous that someone who they used to work alongside would now be throwing stones at them.</p><p>As for me, I've loved every minute of it in the two years since. And I believe, a little self-righteously I confess, that our team at the Evening Standard has taken what was already a great newspaper and made into something very special: A mass market paper with a readership much larger than any broadsheet; but at the same time an influential paper, read by those in politics and business and arts because they want to know what's happening next. I am hugely grateful to Evgeny Lebedev, the paper's owner, that he took the gamble of appointing a novice to the job.</p><p>I guess it has given me an unusual perspective.</p><p>We've had plenty of journalists become MPs, but there is no precedent for someone who lived in Downing Street going on to sit in the editor's chair of a major newspaper.</p><p>So I thought I'd share my experience. I want to talk to you about the future of journalism. And I am going to end with a big new idea.</p><p>But I am going to start with this simple question: do newspapers matter?</p><p>Do they have any power anymore, in the age of Facebook and Twitter and fake news?</p><p>That would have seemed a bizarre question to ask just sevenyears ago when I took to the witness stand in the High Court to give evidence to the Leveson inquiry. While the key injustice was around phone-hacking, the real issue in the dock was the power of the press.</p><p>British politics at the time was awhirl with talk of pyjama parties at Chequers and text exchanges between editors and Prime Ministers that made you want to laugh out loud.</p><p>The serious charge was that corruption had taken place: favourable media coverage from News International had been traded for favourable decisions over media ownership. We had not. If there was a commercial collusion, it was between the rivals to News International who saw their competitor's mistakes over phone hacking as an Achilles heel with which to defeat their bid for full ownership of Sky.</p><p>When you think of the huge changes taking place in technology at the time, and the impact it would have on all the media businesses involved, it all now seems parochial.</p><p>Anyhow, the charge of political corruption was thoroughly investigated and completely rejected. But a lesser charge was more difficult to dismiss: the feeling that politicians in Britain had become too closeto the media, and the press was too powerful and too unaccountable.</p><p>Was it true? Well, we'd certainly tried to get closer to the media.</p><p>Why? For the simple reason, we wanted more favourable coverage and a better hearing for our case.</p><p>For we don't live in a small town like ancient Athens, where everyone can come along to the market square and listen to the arguments.</p><p>We live in a democracy of 65 million people where not everyone is glued to the television following the debates in the House of Commons - although recent months have shown us how, when it matters, a surprising and encouraging number do.</p><p>Most of the time, the message of the people who govern us is mediated. We watch TV news, we read papers, we get phone alerts, see our social media feed, hear from our family and friends.</p><p>After a career in politics spanning almost a quarter of a century, I never could find anyone who knew exactly how people receive their information or form their political views.</p><p>So I tried many different ways to influence them. Getting the newspapers on side was an important part of that.</p><p>These days, it's said that we largely have a Tory right-wing press. But when I became the Conservative Shadow Chancellor in 2005, it was the opposite. Almost all of Fleet Street backed the Labour Party. Really. The Sun, the Times, the Express, the News of the World, the Financial Times, the Economist and, yes, the Evening Standard. They'd all told their readers to vote Labour in the election that had just happened.</p><p>Initially, almost none of them supported David Cameron becoming leader of the opposition a short while later - indeed the few Tory newspapers at the time like the Daily Mail and Telegraph went out of their way to try to stop him.</p><p>Once we were in charge of the opposition, we set about trying to change their minds.</p><p>Did that involve lots of dinners and lunches with editors and proprietors? Yes. They had something we needed: direct access to the public.</p><p>Did that make them powerful? In a way, yes. But power in a complex, messy society likes ours doesn't rest in the hands of any one person or industry.</p><p>It's diffuse. Politicians are powerful. So too are charities, businesses, the public sector - all have a role in the decisions that affect us all. The press are powerful too, because they help curate the discussion that leads to those decisions.</p><p>Looking back, were we sometimes a bit fawning to the press? Perhaps, in the early days. We would endorse some of their campaigns, give them quotes, just to get a favourable mention.</p><p>But did we ever change the fundamental things we believed in? Emphatically not.</p><p>The first time I met Rupert Murdoch, at a lunch as Shadow Chancellor with his editors on the old Wapping site, I told him I thought his papers were wrong to be hostile to immigration. To my surprise, and the surprise of his editors, he agreed with me.</p><p>The last time I met Mr Murdoch as Chancellor, I told him I thought his papers were wrong to argue that Brexit would make Britain stronger. On that occasion, he didn't surprise me and disagreed.</p><p>Indeed, throughout the 11 years of our leadership of the Tory Party, we regularly found ourselves facing fierce opposition from the newspapers we were told were on our side - for things like embracing the green agenda and promoting gay marriage, to being tough with the public finances and ultimately arguing for Britain to stay in the EU. It didn't stop us; and we didn't stop them.</p><p>In 2010, all the newspapers I mentioned earlier switched their support to us. Five years later, in 2015, they remained supporters. It wasn't a conspiracy, as our opponents claimed in both contests. We hadn't traded coverage for favours; nor did we unquestioningly follow their agenda.</p><p>It certainly wasn't the Sun wot won it, or any other paper for that matter, much as we welcomed their support. Most of their endorsements came in the months, if not days, immediately before the election - long after the polls showed that the voters were behind us.</p><p>The newspapers mattered - but what really mattered was winning over the public, and the press was just one route to reach them.</p><p>Take the 2017 election. I think it's fair to say that Jeremy Corbyn got consistently negative coverage in most newspaper outlets. Pages of it, every day. Theresa May, by contrast, got pages of adulatory press.</p><p>But when the vote came, it was close and she lost the Tory majority. Fleet Street didn't determine the outcome. The public did.</p><p>Even with Brexit, where a consistent and negative campaign by prominent newspapers provided a barrage against those of us arguing to stay in the EU, I think the press's influence was overstated.</p><p>After all, isn't one of the key arguments made that it was 3 million marginalised and disengaged people who didn't vote in general elections who made all the difference when they showed up for the referendum?</p><p>These were not, by and large, people who read a daily newspaper. Indeed, it might have helped those on my side of the argument if they had. I am pretty certain that newspapers today don't determine the outcome of elections or referendums. But it would be a great mistake to think that, as a result, they don't matter to our politics - let alone our cultural, commercial and sporting life.</p><p>Newspapers may not decide elections; but they play a key role in leading and structuring the public conversation here</p><p>Newspapers may not decide elections; but they play a key role in leading and structuring the public conversation here- arole that these days it has become fashionable to underestimate.</p><p>In our country, the BBC, along with ITV and other broadcasters, remains a primary source of daily news for a majority of the country. Fifty-eight per centin a recent YouGov poll say they see one of these bulletins regularly.</p><p>It's why, during my time in politics, more and more effort was put into packaging up announcements for broadcast.</p><p>These days three quarters of Britons also use some online method each week to find news. That's why the political parties are spending more and more on their digital budgets. But in Britain, the terms of that daily conversation are more often than not set by Fleet Street.</p><p>In part that's because they still have big and influential readerships. Every day, close to a million copies of the Evening Standard are picked up across the capital - almost two million people read one - and our online coverage is viewed by millions more.</p><p>It's not just about numbers. More MPs, for example, now read us than any other publication. But there are other reasons why newspapers are still so influential.</p><p>The BBC is a public corporation governed by a charter that insists on impartiality. As I saw over many years, our national broadcaster is more comfortable reporting the stories broken by the written press than initiating their own. The same is true, with some honourable exceptions, of most of the digital media.</p><p>It's recent investigations by newspapers that have exposed the Windrush scandal, the misdeeds of Philip Green and, in our paper, how the profits of opioid addiction finds its way into the arts institutions of the country. These were print stories widely followed on broadcast and online.</p><p>A website of celebrity photos, or online lists of the 10 best Taylor Swift songs, might generate a lot of traffic and be a great business - but it's not having a huge influence on the direction the nation is taking.</p><p>Newspapers do. That printed press is privately owned, and I don't think we would want it any other way. We've never had state newspapers - except when Winston Churchill briefly tried to set one up during the 1926 General Strike. That was the last time a Chancellor of the Exchequer edited a newspaper.</p><p>So if you want to influence those papers you have to speak to the people who own them, edit them and write for them. And that's what I predict politicians will continue to do for a long time to come. If the ex-Chancellor in me understands why politicians try to get close to the press, the current editor in me is frankly less sympathetic about the press getting close to the politicians.</p><p>Of course, editors have a job of keeping themselves informed - and that sometimes involves private conversations behind closed doors. The editor who never leaves the building can quickly become out of touch.</p><p>Political reporters tend to do a better job when they make an effort to get to understand the people they are reporting on. There's an old-style of journalist who sees that as a sell out. They refuse, as a matter of principle, to socialise with their political prey, and adopt the HL Mencken principle that every MP should be approached with the thought 'what is this lying bastard lying to me about now.</p><p>It was great sport to watch when this aggressive approach first appeared in the 1960s with the likes of Robin Day on TV, but half a century later I wonder what good it's done other than chase both politics and journalism down to the bottom of the league table of professions the public trusts.</p><p>I did many of those interviews and few I felt provided much illumination for the audience. You don't have to treat democratic politicians as criminals to be a journalist of integrity. But nor should you regard them as messiahs.</p><p>I always found it odd when newspapers slavishly followed the agenda of a government, even the ones I helped run. Not, I confess, that I complained at the time.</p><p>I'll give you an example of what I am talking about, and that you still see every day in the newspapers. There's an unwritten rule in Westminster that in return for getting an advance copy of a speech, or hearing about a policy before anyone else, a paper will give you a fair wind, slap a positive headline on it and won't approach anyone else like the opposition to critique it.</p><p>That's why, when I was in the Treasury, we would quite regularly feed stories to papers to get a good show for them.</p><p>One day, we even gave the Evening Standard the whole Budget in advance - unfortunately they put it up online, by mistake, before I'd even spoken in the House of Commons. This kind of cut and paste job may be sensible media management in politics; but in general it's not very good journalism.</p><p>There's an even greater sin. It's boring. Just as lame is the Fleet Street habit of doing the exact opposite with any announcement that they don't get first, and extracting revenge by tearing it to shreds. I try to make sure we don't do either at the Standard - or not very often. For I think it all belongs to a bygone age, when people first learned about a piece of news when they saw the headlines on the newspaper stand and they picked up a copy of a paper.</p><p>These days that news will have already appeared as a mobile phone alert hours earlier, as the printing presses were starting to roll.</p><p>I think readers now turn to a paper, online and in print, to help them interpret the news... theydon't want a mouthpiece for the government, or the opposition</p><p>I think readers now turn to a paper, online and in print, to help them interpret the news - to get some explanation and attitude, investigation and analysis. The readers don't want a mouthpiece for the government, or the opposition.</p><p>I don't want an invitation to tea in Downing Street. I've already been. I want us to set our own agenda.</p><p>So the answer to my first question is that yes, newspapers are powerful; they help host the national conversation. But they're not the only ones who decide its outcome. Often they follow, rather than lead. And if anything, it would be better if it were more the other way round.</p><p>My second question is: are newspapers going to survive?</p><p>Here I draw again on my previous career. One of the things I failed to spot during my time in Parliament was just how dramatic the change that the internet and social media would bring to politics.</p><p>I am not saying we weren't on Twitter or that we didn't run on-line campaigns; indeed in 2015, we ran a very successful one. As a government, we did a huge amount to make government digital and attract tech jobs to Britain - I'd say, pretty successfully.</p><p>But what I didn't fully see was that social media was much more than just a new medium for communicating a political message - it enabled a new form of politics. Just as the business of books and music and retailing has been completely disrupted, so the business of politics has been disrupted - and in essentially the same way.</p><p>Old hierarchical models have collapsed as the barriers to entry they controlled have disappeared.</p><p>When I first became an MP, if you wanted to organise a big demonstration against the government in Trafalgar Square, it took you weeks. You had to have a fully-staffed union or protest group with a list of supporters, and you had to get your call-centre to phone them up one by one - and use newspapers to advertise the event beyond that group. It took time, organisation and could cost quite a lot of money.</p><p>Today, you can mobilise a big demo in the centre of London in a matter of hours - from a single mobile phone, if you have enough followers or know people who do, and it costs you nothing.</p><p>In fact, you don't even need to meet physically - you can create a virtual social media mob to harass a government, or opposition, and get them to change their policies.</p><p>US Presidential elections and primaries were the ultimate example of organisation, and money, and people. Until Donald Trump came along without much of any of that and captured the White House from his Twitter feed.</p><p>I became pretty good at the form of politics that emerged in the 1990s in response to 24 hour news channels. The scripted soundbite. The good backdrop. The ruthless message discipline.</p><p>It helped me and the team I was part of win two general elections. But by 2017, when I left Parliament, it was a style of politics that looked like it belonged to the dinosaur age. There are still plenty of politicians wandering around practising it, but they are facing extinction.</p><p>The new politicians are in a constant conversation with the public and the media. Look at how AlexandriaOcasio-Cortez has become one of the most famous politicians in the world</p><p>The new politicians are in a constant conversation with the public and the media. Look at how Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a 29 year-old who only got elected to the US Congress four months ago, has become one of the most famous politicians in the world.</p><p>Who here has seen AOC's take down of corrupt party funding? Or heard about her Green New Deal? Lots of you. Through her social media posts.</p><p>Less than a generation ago, that simply wouldn't have been possible.</p><p>British politics has already been disrupted. Just look at the stunning success Jeremy Corbyn and the far left have had in capturing the citadel of the Labour Party leadership, something that never happened its 100 year history of social democracy and moderation.</p><p>The Conservative Party, with its dwindling elderly membership based on a model of constituency associations from the Victorian age, looks vulnerable to disruption too. When other revolutions in technology have come along, they have a profound and destructive impact on the old political order.</p><p>The invention of the printing press led to the Reformation. Radio and television enabled the mass democratic parties and ideological dictatorships of the 20th century.</p><p>We don't know how social media will leave politics, but we know the revolution is under way.</p><p>A similar change has swept through the newspaper industry, shattering its economic model. Just think of how the Evening Standard made its money 20 years ago. If you lived in the capital and wanted to know the news during the day, there was no phone you could check - you had to buy a copy of our paper.</p><p>If you wanted to advertise your product to a London audience, then the pages of the paper was one of the few ways to do it. If you wanted to find a job, you turned to the classified jobs section. Rent a flat or buy a house, the property section. Find a partner? You looked through the lonely hearts.</p><p>Today you would go to Linked-In, Craig's List, Rightmove and Bumble - or sites like them.</p><p>The British media made the fateful decision in the previous decade to offer up their online content for free, in the hope that digital advertising would pay for it. But all online journalism has struggled to attract the advertising revenues that their print cousins once generated. Just look at the sad news about jobs losses at Buzzfeed and Huff Post.</p><p>Digital subscriptions work for smaller readerships of broadsheets like the FT and the Times, and I think they and others have done a good job with their products. I pay for both on my mobile phone but to be frank, the social challenge is not getting high quality journalism into the hands of a relatively small number of middle class professionals like me.</p><p>We'll always be prepared to pay for news and comment. It's the mass market where the problem lies. That's where print newspapers have seen the most precipitous declines, and where online paid-for subscriptions will never be large enough to replace lost income. Ten years ago, long before I arrived the new owners of the loss-making Evening Standard decided to get ahead of the change they saw coming - and started handing the paper out for free.</p><p>It was completely counter-intuitive - and brilliant.</p><p>The circulation quadrupled to almost a million, bringing in additional revenue from advertisers who could reach a bigger audience.</p><p>Today, our share of that advertising market continues to grow thanks to our strong commercial team - but the whole market is shrinking and other newspaper revenue streams are going. So we need new ones. We continue the push online.</p><p>In the last couple of years, the digital presence of the paper has grown exponentially-100 million page impressions and 29 million unique visitors in January alone.</p><p>But still we need to do more. Events. Sponsorship. Working with partners on projects to improve the future of London. I am unapologetic about all of this. If you want quality journalism, someone has to pay for it.</p><p>Newspapers are businesses not charities. They always have been. Pick up the front page of a 19th century copy of the Times and the whole front page was full of ads, not unlike when we wrap an ad round our paper today.</p><p>A sustainable future cannot rely on begging for contributions... we need to find long-term sources of commercial income</p><p>A sustainable future cannot rely on begging for contributions. Nor would we ever want them funded by the taxpayer, like the BBC. We need to find long-term sources of commercial income.</p><p>It has been a hugely challenging time. Sales of national and local printed papers have halved in the last 10 years; print advertising revenues are down over two thirds; the number of full-time journalists continues to fall every year.</p><p>But there is a glimmer of hope. It's called fake news. Or rather the scandal about fake news. What encourages me is that people care.</p><p>They care that Russian bots spread false information during the presidential election, and Cambridge Analytica did the same in our Brexit referendum.</p><p>They care enough that their political leaders are hauling the big social media companies before Congress and the Commons and the European Parliament and demanding action to stop it happening again.</p><p>So too are the big advertisers who generate their revenues. Reputable companies can't afford to see their products placed alongside foreign subversion and deliberate disinformation. We should keep the pressure up on their boards and shareholders.</p><p>Because the answer to all of this is to turn to an organisation that employs properly-trained journalists, thorough sub-editorsand legally-accountable editors.</p><p>In other words, you might receive your news via Facebook, but it's supplied by a newspaper or broadcaster you can trust.</p><p>When a revolution comes, it feels like all that is old is swept away and only the new has value. And then, as excesses that come with any revolution repel, and the novelty wears off, people start to remember the value of some of the things they discarded.</p><p>I think that is what is happening now. People, and the advertisers who sell to them, are alert to fake news. They want reliable information.</p><p>That's why in America, which feels a couple of years ahead of us, the likes of the Washington Post and New York Times - which were written off not long ago - are enjoying a healthy renaissance.</p><p>It's why here in Britain I believe people and businesses will more and more turn to established, reliable brands - like the 192-year-old Evening Standard. And if they do that, then there is money to be made. Money to pay for that journalism.</p><p>That brings me from the present to the future for journalism - and a big idea.</p><p>One of the jobs I've always fancied was that of the European Competition Commissioner. You can do a lot with it. It's the one area where the EU really does act as a super-state, giving the Commissioner the executive power to break apart monopolies and enforce competition.</p><p>And because the EU is the largest single market in the world, these decisions carry clout in the global economy and affect the future of even the world's biggest companies.</p><p>As it was, I kept my eye on jobs in British politics instead. In any case, I soon won't be eligible to be a Commissioner - nor will any other British citizen. As a country we've made the foolish decision to leave the EU - and, if we go ahead with it, we will follow their rules and not shape them.</p><p>But I can tell you this about the European who does become the next Competition Commissioner later this year. They will have big American tech firmly in their sights. So will the new European Commission President and Parliament.</p><p>All the incentives are there. The monopolistic practices that have seen a tiny number of companies scoop the lion's share of online advertising revenue.</p><p>The tech mergers that were allowed to happen because no one really understood these markets - and which would never have been accepted if they happened now. The concerns about the viability of journalism, fake news and election interference that I've talked about.</p><p>The decision of the big platforms to now select content, ban certain contributors and apply internal community standards to those they do allow, just as I do in the Evening Standard newsroom. It's called editing, but how much longer can they be exempt from the legal responsibility that holds me accountable as an newspaper editor?</p><p>I also detect a growing European sense that we need to create rules that defends our interests - instead of being on the receiving end of decisions taken on the other side of the world, whether in Silicon Valley or Shenzhen.</p><p>The European data protection laws were just the start. Regulation is coming in a big way to big tech.</p><p>The companies know it, and are gearing up to shape it. As long as the rules don't touch the fundamentals of their business model around the harvesting of user data, or the structure of their firms, they will shout and scream but they won't mind too much.</p><p>Indeed, there's a benefit for them. For like all regulation, new rules will have the side-effect of protecting the big incumbents from new entrants. Now they've built their new shiny castles, they've worked out that it's time to build the moats.</p><p>Here in the UK the Cairncross Review, commissioned by the government, recently published its report into a sustainable future for journalism. There are some useful recommendations about strengthening the hands of publishers against online platforms, and getting the Competition and Markets Authority to look at monopolistic practices in the online advertising market.</p><p>But the rest of the report, it feels to me, frankly only scratches at the surface.</p><p>Extending the current local democracy scheme to hire a few more local reporters is fine - we have some at the Standard doing a great job - but it isn't going to replace the shrinking incomes and newsrooms of papers.</p><p>Abolishing VAT on digital products may help a few high-end subscription apps, but the Finance Minister in me thinks it would be very difficult for it to end up not being a big tax cut for big tech.</p><p>Establishing an Institute to funnel public funds into what they call 'public interest news' feels like a Pandora's Box that no one will want to open.</p><p>It was difficult enough trying to establish the panel that Leveson recommended to recognise an independent press complaints body - and even that hasn't really worked.</p><p>Once the state - or an arm of - starts trying to make the decisions about what should be printed that is in the public interest as opposed to what interests the public, trouble is coming</p><p>Once the state - or an arm of - starts trying to make the decisions about what should be printed that is in the public interest as opposed to what interests the public, trouble is coming.</p><p>Ask yourself: could public funds have ever been used to buy stolen property, like the computer disks that had the details of MPs' expenses on them? That was one of the biggest newspaper scoops of my lifetime.</p><p>Accepting public money also smells of defeat. Using taxpayer subsidies to support what has until now been a commercial activity has never been a route to long term sustainability.</p><p>Curbing the activities of the BBC is what lots of newspapers still cling to - and it's true their website looks more and more like an online newspaper, with film reviews and cooking recipes and the like.</p><p>But fundamentally our national broadcaster is part of the solution to providing quality journalism to the British public, not part of the problem. We should be encouraging it to use its 25 million odd license-fee payers and turn itself into something like a subscription service more akin to Netflix.</p><p>That's what underpinned the agreement I negotiated with them four years ago, changing the law so that you need a license fee to view the iPlayer - and giving them control over who paid that fee.</p><p>It has set them up to navigate the future.</p><p>Selling its best programmes to other distributors around the world made the BBC money in the short-term, but it turned out to be the same mistake that other content-providers made. The global collaboration with ITV and others on a Britbox is a welcome sign on new thinking.</p><p>Cannibalising the BBC to sustain Fleet Street feels like a solution from the past. Today neither are strong enough. So it's time to think bigger than this.</p><p>We don't want to end competition in the media industry - it's ruthless competition that drove so much of the innovation we've seen, from Murdoch's relaunched Sun newspaper 50 years ago to the FT app and Standard online of today.</p><p>Nor do we want newspapers to become charities or dependents on public subsidy. What we want instead is to create fair competition, and break up the monopolies that prevent that. So I want to end with this big idea. And it's a simple one.</p><p>Let people own their data. Give power to the consumer not the producer.</p><p>Until now, there has been a contract that almost no one understands - even if we endlessly tick the box online that says we consent to it. The deal is this: we all get to use the internet for free, and do all sorts of things - from playing games to watching videos to looking up things on Wikipedia - that a previous generation would have paid for.</p><p>Great. But in return, the data on everything about us that can be gleaned from our online activities belongs to the big commercial platforms through which we access that content. Those platforms know who we are, where we live, who are friends are, what we watch and how long for, what we buy and what we search for.</p><p>It's very valuable information. Indeed the world's most expensive companies have been created on the back of it. For all that data helps them direct the right advertisers to you - and then take a big cut. And they don't share the data with the producers of the content, like newspapers, that is drawing people to their platforms. But the data is generated by you - and you're handing it over for free.</p><p>And we're providing the content, and we're not told who is using it and how.</p><p>Now say you owned the data. Say you had the right to take your accumulated data from one producer and share with another that offers you something better in return.</p><p>When I was at the Treasury that's what we forced the big banks to allow, and it laid the groundwork for all the new digital banks you see being created.</p><p>Or let's think more radically. Say social media companies had to pay you for using your data. Say it became an asset, or perhaps even a reward for your labour.</p><p>It seems strange that you should be paid for watching all those funny videos and wasting hours on those games. But people do pay to know what you've been doing with your time - they just don't pay you.</p><p>People do pay to know what you've been doing with your time - they just don't pay you</p><p>This idea of a 'data dividend' has been knocking around on the margins of Silicon Valley, but it's starting to enter the mainstream of politics in - of all places - California. Why not here?</p><p>It could be one of the solutions to the problem of too many people having too few assets; and an answer to the question: where will the incomes come from in the age of robots and artificial intelligence?</p><p>It could help businesses other than the big social media and search companies - if the consumers owned their data, rather than one or two big producers, then we could all compete for their custom, and their data would follow.</p><p>It sounds like a policy from the left. But breaking open monopolies, pricing a market externality, putting power in the hands of consumers and spreading wealth are pretty Conservative ideas.</p><p>It's not a magic bullet to the problems facing the newspaper industry. But it would create a more competitive, level playing field and dramatically change the economics of the online world.</p><p>I can tell you that if I was still in Downing Street I'd be looking at the idea very closely. Instead, as a newspaper editor, I'm doing what I think the press should do: provoke the conversation, set out the ideas and lead the conversation.</p><p>Let me end by saying this to you, the students here.</p><p>There's something very precious about a free press.</p><p>Just think of all the billions of people who don't live with one.</p><p>Think of the hundreds of journalists around the world imprisoned, tortured or murdered for doing a job we value less and less here.</p><p>When I left Downing Street, I had choices about what I could do next. I chose journalism. I chose newspapers. Not because I was sentimental about their past; but because I am optimistic about their future.</p><p>People will always want to know what's going on. We can help them find out. As the people with real ink on our hands, we can listen, but we can also lead.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ESTONL-52389256</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ESTONL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VKC-4YG1-JCJY-G1T2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">411938</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6212\"/><timeReceived>7:30 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Evening Standard Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>standard.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"27119\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 7, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper; Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009UGQ</classCode><className>THEATER</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009UM7</classCode><className>DRAMA LITERATURE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001715</classCode><className>THEATER &amp; DRAMA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>STX000305</classCode><className>CLASSICAL MUSIC</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>PE0009WIQ</classCode><className>GEORGE OSBORNE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>PE0009VH8</classCode><className>KEITH RUPERT MURDOCH</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>PE000CZWT</classCode><className>KIM KARDASHIAN</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

Bush. He is now the Texas land commissioner and he will eulogize his grandfather on Thursday before the burial in Texas.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">George, great to have you here. We're so sorry for your loss.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What is it like for your family today to, of course, watch all this play out internationally and for your own personal emotions?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GEORGE P. BUSH, GRANDSON OF PRESIDENT GEORGE H.W. BUSH: Well, it's been an emotional three days for us. But coming together, you know, we've recounted so many great stories and funny anecdotes and experiences with our grandparents. And also my grandmother. This is a time when we reflect on both of them and their incredible marriage and their incredible service to our country. So it's good that we're -- we have this chance to come together to share our grandfather with the public here in the Capitol, but in short time bring him back to Texas where he'll be buried.</p><p>JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: That's so interesting because you are, to an extent, sharing this with the entire country and the entire world, who had its own relationship with your grandfather. But it's -- still, he's the patriarch of your family. And I saw the pictures of you getting off of the plane yesterday leading the grandchildren and I just kept thinking, gosh, I wonder what that trip was like from Texas. And you just told us, you're all staying in Blair House. I mean a whole bunch of Bushs in one place. It is just a nonstop story about your -- gampy (ph), as you all called him?</p><p>BUSH: It is. It's been wonderfully playful at times. I think that helps to kind of alleviate the situation, the emotion, the raw emotion of sharing him and his life with the country because we did share him with this country for so long. He devoted his entire life to public service. But to find that balance between a private grievance and a public ceremony is -- it's tough. But if there's a family that can do it, it's ours.</p><p>But we're looking forward to getting back to Texas and sharing for stories in St. Martin's Episcopal in Houston. And then one of his dying wishes is to be transported back via train from Houston back to College Station, where he'll be buried on the grounds of his library.</p><p>CAMEROTA: We've been reporting this morning that one of your grandfather's wishes was for President Trump to be at the funeral. And that, in fact, your family reached out to the White House months ago knowing that that day may come. So can you tell us the back story about why that truce, as it's been called, was important?</p><p>BUSH: Well, you know, I think if there's anybody that spoke to bipartisanship and rising above the politics of today, that would be my grandfather. And whether it's him or his staff, I know and my grandmother, they all wanted all current occupants to be a part of this process and to take advantage of this time where we can put politics aside and focus on the greatness of our country and devotion to causes greater than ourselves. And my grandfather reflected that in his service. And I think, you know, with President Trump's devotion of time to my grandfather's legacy, I hope reflects that. And Congress did yesterday. So it's important for the country to take this time and to reflect on the commonalities that we have rather than the differences.</p><p>BERMAN: And your whole family is on board with us. Obviously your father ran against him for president in 2016 and was on the receiving end of a lot of from then candidate Trump.</p><p>BUSH: Totally. I happened to be part of that team.</p><p>BERMAN: Yes.</p><p>BUSH: And it was tough. But, you know, if my grandfather here -- were here, he'd say, during his many campaigns where he had tough campaigns against Lloyd Benson and other famous Democrats, fellow Republicans, Ronald Reagan and others have said, you know, there's a time for politics and there's a time for governing, but there's also a time for reflection. And this is a time for reflection for our country to think about the values that make our country great.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Do you forgive President Trump for those attacks on your father?</p><p>BUSH: You know, I'm not going to lie that, you know, it hurts. It stings. But, you know, my grandfather, my uncle and my dad, if they taught me anything on politics, you get back up and you fight again. And so, you know, I'm focused on my job in Texas. I know my dad is enjoying private life. But there's other ways to serve. And that's what my grandfather is all about is that, you don't have to be in elected politics to make a change. You can be in a nonprofit organization. You can serve your fellow man in a variety of other ways. You don't necessarily have to win politics office.</p><p>BERMAN: You can be a point of light, thousand points of light.</p><p>So you were the dean of the delegation. The dean of the grandchildren delegation, 17 strong. And I feel like -- and I'm not that much older than you, but we saw you grow up. You were everywhere from the beginning. And it seems like each one of you had a unique relationship or had a unique relationship with your grandfather. Just tell us about yours.</p><p>BUSH: Well, he's -- I just remember him being the most avid sportsman I know. He has such a competitive spirit, from tiddlywinks, you know, horseshoes.</p><p>CAMEROTA: (INAUDIBLE) tiddlywinks.</p><p>BUSH: Yes. To horseshoes.</p><p>BERMAN: There you are throwing out a pitch there, yes?</p><p>BUSH: There you go. We -- well, he taught me how to hit lefty and how to throw a high and inside fastball. Just an incredible and avid sportsman. You'd always catch him at an Astros game or a Rangers game. And we're going to miss that. We're going to miss him fly fishing off the rocks in Maine and taking all of his grandchildren and his friends out in Fidelity (ph) in Maine and just having a good time in the outdoors. He would always want us to get out of bed early and do something with ourselves.</p><p>[08:35:17] CAMEROTA: So how are you going to eulogize him? Can you share with us what you plan to say?</p><p>BUSH: Well, I will -- you know, so many others are going to speak about his public service and what he's given to this country. I just want to talk a little bit about the man. And, you know, many have written about his familiar penmanship. And I will leverage a few examples of that to express the kind of man that he is on a personal level. And so it's going to be emotional. It will be raw. That was -- that was the church that I was baptized. That's the church that they attended for so long and that many Bushs did in Houston. And I'll try my best to keep it together.</p><p>BERMAN: I saw your uncle, former President George W. Bush, all day yesterday really trying to keep it together. I know it's very emotional for all of you to be here and to do it on public display. So we feel for you. It's not easy to eulogize anybody. You've got a big moment on Thursday. And know that we're behind you.</p><p>You talked about your grandfather's letter and the book where he compiled all of this remarkable -- and every time we see a new letter I'm just blown away by it.</p><p>How often would he write you? And was it always good times or was it good times and bad times? Was it just because he missed you at times?</p><p>BUSH: Well, for me and the grandkids, it was always during tough time. Whether it was a tough time in school or discipline issues or, in some instances, getting in my grandmother's crosshairs, which is always a big no-no in the family. But he was -- he would -- any time I interacted with him at his office, he was always writing letters.</p><p>In fact, one story I think back to is in 1992 when he lost. And it was early afternoon in the Houston. And he asked for me to come and visit him. And it was like 3:00 in the afternoon. And he was writing letters to all of his supporters knowing that he was going to lose that night. And he told me, George P., it looks like it's not going to come together. And, to me, that spoke to the character of the man, that he was taking his time to thank all the people that supported him throughout his public life. BERMAN: When he was writing you and you were in trouble, whose side did he take? Did he take your grandmother's side or your side? Let us know.</p><p>BUSH: He was always the good cop. My grandmother was the bad cop. Let me just put it that way. She -- she'd be the -- that's why she was known as the enforcer in the family or aka the silver fox. But my grandfather would, you know, be the one that would come in the back end, take the high road and give the final advice for us to move forward.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Well, thanks so much for sharing your personal reflections with us. Obviously, our condolences and we're thinking of you.</p><p>BUSH: Thank you.</p><p>CAMEROTA: George P. Bush, thanks so much for being here.</p><p>BUSH: Thank you.</p><p>BERMAN: Thank you.</p><p>CAMEROTA: OK, he says FaceBook is like cigarettes and Silicon Valley needs to be regulated. Laurie Segall sits down with the CEO of Salesforce to find out why he does not believe big tech can manage itself.</p><p>BERMAN: But first, it is that time of year when we honor some of the best humanity has to offer. CNN Heroes. They are ten extraordinary people who are doing extraordinary things around the world. Join Anderson Cooper and Kelly Ripa as they announce the 2018 CNN Hero of the Year.

Today our Laurie Segall interview the Salesforce CEO. The influential billionaire has called out tech giants like FaceBook and Twitter. He compares them to cigarettes and he says it's time for the government to step in.</p><p>So Laurie joins us now with more.</p><p>Laurie, tell us everything.</p><p>LAURIE SEGALL, CNN SENIOR TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT: You know, Marc Benioff is really interesting. He's not exactly making friends in Silicon Valley because he is calling out other tech companies left and right and he's talking about this idea of what he's saying is the next industrial revolution, the fourth industrial revolution, where he says we're all just so connected. And he said along with that connectivity there have come a lot of ethical implications.</p><p>Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARC BENIOFF, CEO, SALESFORCE: When everyone and everything is connected, OK, you're going to have to really think about, do you trust what is happening? Do you trust these companies and these products that are in your home and in your car and what's going on?</p><p>SEGALL: I mean, I got to tell you, Marc, I don't 100 percent. Look at what's happened in the last couple years. How can we put all our faith in big tech when, in the last years, it doesn't even seem like some of these companies know the impact of their own algorithms?</p><p>BENIOFF: And I think it's kind of the metaphor of the social networks. It's great actually. When they started, they're talking about, it's nirvana, everything is wonderful, we're going to connect everybody together. Now we find out they're not uniting us, they're dividing us, you know? That they're not maintaining our data. That they're selling it. You know, that there isn't privacy. You know, that there's a -- basically a huge ecosystem of people who are harvesting the data for personal gain.</p><p>SEGALL: Do you trust this industry to self-regulate?</p><p>BENIOFF: I don't trust the industry to self-regulate. I already said, FaceBook is the new cigarettes. It's not good for you. It's addictive. You don't know who's trying to convince you to use it or misuse it. The government has to step in and regulate it. And FaceBook has proven that to us over and over and over again that they need to be regulated because they're not self-regulating.</p><p>[08:45:01] And that's true of a lot of technology companies. Look, we have those examples in every industry. Why is technology going to be the only industry that the government isn't going to step in to make sure that there's fair practice and truth and trust with consumers or businesses?</p><p>SEGALL: Do you think that we fundamentally have to reshape our view of privacy?</p><p>BENIOFF: I think we have to fundamentally reshape our view of business. The business of business is not business, but the business of business is improving the state of the world. If you start from there, then you can answer your question, which is, of course we have to go much deeper on privacy. We have to have phenomenal privacy regulations. Look at -- I'm a huge advocate and I'm supported, what just happened here in this great state of California where we have the best privacy law in the country. But why does Europe have a better privacy law with something that that have called GDPR than we do here? I've called for a national privacy law in the United States. We need a national privacy law. We can't just have it in California. Every company needs to be held to a new level of capability in privacy. This is -- we're in this new world. Why is our government not moving fast enough into that world?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEGALL: You know, I think it's also important to mention that there are real questions about the business models in Silicon Valley. Look at FaceBook. A lot of folks saying, is that business model fundamentally broken. Can they connect the world, which they've been promising to do, and, you know, and also make money? And we've seen them doing so, you know, the product is free except our data is what goes. So I think there are real questions around this at a time when the world is dividing and we have -- these tech leaders have extraordinary power when it comes to the future of work, when it comes to -- you know, when it comes to the future in general. So these are things we want them to be thinking about.</p><p>John.</p><p>BERMAN: Laurie Segall, fascinating to have that perspective. Thank you so much for all the work you're doing here. It really is a unique perspective.</p><p>So it happened again. And once again the NFL does not seem to have the answers. Why does the league have so much trouble dealing with players accused of violence against women? A former spokesman for the NFL joins us next.</p><p>[08:51:116] BERMAN: Former star Kansas City Chiefs running back Kareem Hunt is without a team today. The Chiefs cut ties with him after this video surfaced showing Hunt shoving and kicking a woman inside a Cleveland hotel earlier this year. The NFL knew about the incident for yearly a year, but didn't really do anything.</p><p>Joining us now is Joe Lockhart. He's the NFL's former executive vice president of communications and public affairs and former Clinton White House press secretary.</p><p>Joe, we're lucky to have you here to help us understand what went on here.</p><p>JOE LOCKHART, FORMER EXECUTIVE VP OF COMMUNICATIONS AND PUBLIC AFFAIRS, NFL: Sure.</p><p>BERMAN: Let me read the NFL statement about this. The NFL's investigation began immediately following the incident in February, consistent with standard investigatory practices. The NFL continues to pursue a complete understanding of the facts. The NFL's ongoing investigation will include further attempts to speak to the complainants involved in the incident and will include a review of the new information that was made public on Friday, which was not available to the NFL previously, as well as further conversations with all parties involved in the incident.</p><p>The question, though, is, this happened in February. They were told about it way back then. How come they didn't know more over the last 11 months, Joe?</p><p>LOCKHART: Well, for a couple of reasons. One is, and people have talked about, why does TMZ get this stuff and the NFL doesn't? Well, TMZ pays for it. They go in and they find someone who works at the hotel, give them $5,000, $10,000, $15,000 and they get it. The NFL, you know, as an organization, like CNN or \"The New York Times\" or ESPN, you know, doesn't -- you know, doesn't condone that kind of practice.</p><p>The second thing is, the NFL's in a unique position. They have no subpoena power. They can't compel anyone to talk. I think in this particular case, and I only know what I've read, is no one wanted to talk. The person, the victims didn't want to, none of the witnesses. So they have to rely a lot on local law enforcement. And in this particular case, local law enforcement didn't know most of the story. I think they charged him with a misdemeanor.</p><p>So it's a very awkward place. But I think what the NFL tries to do is pick up where, you know, and apply a different standard than local law enforcement where many of these people that the NFL has disciplined were not charged, but they were suspended from the NFL because it -- you know, they didn't meet the standards.</p><p>BERMAN: But in this case, he played 11 games.</p><p>LOCKHART: HHGHHHH e did.</p><p>BERMAN: He played 11 games. And it wasn't until the video surfaced that there was action taken. You know, should it have taken until you actually saw the pictures to take action, Joe?</p><p>LOCKHART: Well, the problem was the player wasn't honest with the team or with the league office. And there was -- it was very difficult for the NFL -- I think if you -- you know, you can imagine the outcry if someone was falsely accused. So, again, it's a difficult situation, but the league has taken the position that, you know, they're going to be put in this situation where people say, why didn't he move quicker? They could very easily say, we're just going to rely on local law enforcement. If the police and the district attorney doesn't charge them, then we're not going to do anything. They're not taking that position. They're saying that we're going to hold our players to a higher standard.</p><p>And if you look at what's happened since Ray Rice, which I think the NFL will admit they screwed up, you know, from beginning to end, this -- the discipline and the -- in fact, a lot of these players are out of the game now because it's just not good for the NFL for them to be there.</p><p>BERMAN: So Ray Rice is out of the game.</p><p>LOCKHART: Yes.</p><p>BERMAN: We don't know what happened to Kareem Hunt. He's a free agent. But then there's Reuben Foster --</p><p>LOCKHART: Sure.</p><p>BERMAN: Who faced accusations and he was cut by his team. He's still not allowed to play. There's an investigation going on. But he was signed by the Redskins --</p><p>LOCKHART: Yes.</p><p>BERMAN: Pending the outcome of the investigation. What message does that send, that a team signed him before all the facts are even out there?</p><p>LOCKHART: Well, you know, I think it sends out the wrong message, and I think the Redskins are wrong. And I think it's one of the reasons why you need a league-wide effort here. You've got 32 owners, each with their own standards, and there's clearly some owners who will put winning in front of ethical behavior. And I think that's the case with the Redskins.</p><p>[08:55:16] But what the league tries to do, and I think they get it right most of the time, is say there's a standard for all 32. You can't keep a team from signing a guy. The league can keep Reuben Foster from playing for quite a long time --</p><p>BERMAN: Right.</p><p>LOCKHART: Depending on what they find in the investigation.</p><p>BERMAN: Joe Lockhart, thanks for coming in. Appreciate you talking about this.</p><p>LOCKHART: Sure thing.</p><p>BERMAN: All right, Alisyn.</p><p>CAMEROTA: OK, John, you and I will be back, of course, tomorrow. And CNN's coverage for the final farewell of President George H.W. Bush continues after this quick break.</p><p>JIM SCIUTTO, CNN ANCHOR: Very good Tuesday morning to you. I'm Jim Sciutto.</p><p>POPPY HARLOW, CNN ANCHOR: And I'm Poppy Harlow. We're glad you're with us.</p><p>[08:59:40] Anytime now one of the biggest mysteries of the Mueller probe is due to be revealed. Michael Flynn, the retired Army general, Trump campaign surrogate, and briefly national security adviser, has been under wraps for a year now, well, since pleading guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with the Russian ambassador. He's been cooperating with the special counsel on matters entirely unknown to the public, that is until today, because today, exactly two weeks ahead of his sentencing, the Mueller team is due to tell a court just</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2018120406CNV42</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TWN-99K1-DXH2-63X9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3522\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>December 4, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>KANSAS CITY CHIEFS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>George P.

Soros accusedZuckerberg of engaging in 'some kind of mutual assistance arrangement with Donald Trump that will help him to get re-elected' by continuing to run political ads on Facebook. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has taken the opposite approach, banning all political advertising worldwide last October. We've made the decision to stop all political advertising on Twitter globally. </p><p>We believe political message reach should be earned, not bought. Why? A few reasons \u2014 jack (@jack) October 30, 2019[2]Facebook, meanwhile,continues to run them, while exempting them from fact-checking and allowing campaigns to target their ads at specific groups of voters. It does keep a record of them in an Ad Library, which shows how much money politicians are spending on Facebook ads and the messages they're paying to amplify. However, even this meager requirement was evaded this week, after a series of Instagram meme accounts posted sponsored ads for Michael Bloomberg's presidential campaign.Facebook told the Verge and BuzzFeed News[3] that it would not be adding these posts to the Ad Library \u2014 unless the creator paid to boost them. [Read: Facebook and Zuckerberg keep getting 'freedom of expression' wrong[4]] Soros has urged the company to stop accepting every form of political advertisingahead of the US elections on November 4. 'If there is any doubt whether an ad is political, it should err on the side of caution and refuse to publish,' he wrote. 'It is unlikely that Facebook will follow this course.'Soros vs FacebookSoros has frequently lambasted Facebook for skewing democracy[5], and manipulating users for commercial purposes[6].

Those discussions took place during technical meetings attended by representatives of the German automakers, as well as Volkswagen's Audi and Porsche units, regulators allege.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Although companies can work together to improve their products, European Union rules prohibit them from doing the opposite, \"to not compete on quality,\" the bloc's competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, said in a news release Friday. \"We are concerned that this is what happened in this case.\"</p><p>As a result, she said, \"consumers may have been denied the opportunity to buy cars with the best available technology.\"</p><p>The E.U. outlined the allegations in a statement of objections, which is a formal step in an antitrust inquiry. The car manufacturers will now have an opportunity to respond to its findings.</p><p>Daimler said in a statement Friday that it is cooperating with the panel and \"does not expect to receive a fine in this matter.\" </p><p>VW said it would \"examine the complaints and issue a statement after evaluating the investigation file as part of its cooperation.\"</p><p>BMW, meanwhile, said, \"Lawful coordination of industry positions on regulatory framework should not be equated with unlawful cartel agreements.\"</p><p>It is unclear what kind of penalties the automakers might face. </p><p>When asked why a company might want to stall or avoid developing new technology, Andre Boehman, a professor at the University of Michigan's Energy Institute, said, \"The simple answer is cost.\"</p><p>In the E.U. case, he added, the resources needed to develop and implement clean-air technology might have required automakers to raise car prices, which can hurt sales.</p><p>The accusations come just weeks after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accused Volkswagen of defrauding investors during the company's extensive diesel-emissions scandal.</p><p>The SEC alleges VW raised more than $13 billion from American investors as top executives cheated emissions tests. The Wolfsburg, Germany-based automaker has dismissed the claims and contends the agency is \"piling on.\"</p><p>In 2017, Volkswagen pleaded guilty to fraud, obstruction of justice and falsifying statements as part of a settlement with the U.S. Justice Department over intentionally cheating on emissions tests for at least six years. The company agreed to pay as much as $25 billion to American car owners, environmental regulators, states and dealers.</p><p>The E.U. inquiry is the latest in aggressive actions involving big tech. European regulators' litany of investigations and enforcement actions presents a sharp contrast to their U.S. counterparts, who have come under increasing criticism from lawmakers and consumer advocates for taking a far more subdued approach on competition.</p><p>Last month, Vestager fined Google about $1.7 billion on charges its advertising practices violated antitrust laws, marking the third time in as many years that the region's watchdogs have penalized the U.S. tech giant for harming competition and consumers. All told, European regulators have levied more than $9 billion in fines against the company. </p><p>Vestager has acknowledged that an antitrust investigation against Amazon is in an \"advanced\" stage. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>Earlier this week, the head of the Federal Trade Commission, the top U.S. consumer watchdog, asked Congress for more resources and authority to pursue privacy cases. Repeated data breaches and abuses of personal information have raised questions about the FTC's ability to challenge big tech companies.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:hamza.shaban@washpost.com\">hamza.shaban@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPOST-880bff06-57dd-11e9-814f-e2f46684196e</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPOST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VTP-08S1-JBFW-C4XK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8075</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"647\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Post</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12311\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Regional Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 6, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000264W</classCode><className>BAYERISCHE MOTOREN WERKE AG (BMW)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00062F9</classCode><className>VOLKSWAGEN FINANCIAL SERVICES AG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002KER</classCode><className>VOLKSWAGEN AG</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS336991 MOTORCYCLE, BICYCLE &amp;
