This was the time Reliance JioMart - then known as 'new commerce' - was expected to roll out by Diwali. 'So, what's Reliance Jio's ecommerce venture all about?' this venture capitalist (VC) asked me?</p><p> Many others in the tech fraternity were talking about Jio and what it was possibly putting together on the kirana front, touted as being the foundation for its ecommerce ambitions in a market where Amazon and Flipkart have been dominant players.By early 2019, the company had two products - the Jio point of sales (PoS) terminal and MyJio app - that had been distributed to shopowners to build an ecosystem. My coffee-sipping VC made a remark, which stayed with me, 'Bombay is getting ahead of Bangalore,' adding that Bengaluru founders and companies were unaware of what was going on in Mumbai. 'They live in a bubble and aren't able to fathom what's going to hit them,' he had said. On a broader level, he also mentioned how the frothy valuations of Indian startups are mostly never understood in Mumbai's financial circles.A year down the line, a lot of what was going on in Mumbai has come to the fore, when in April, in the thick of the Covid-19 outbreak, Facebook announced its investment of $5.7 billion for 9.99% stake in Reliance Jio Platforms. That was just the start of the rush of capital coming into Jio Platforms, culminating with Google's $4.5 billion infusion earlier this week.Jio Platforms is a subsidiary of Reliance Industries, which owns the telecom operator Jio and other digital businesses of the Indian conglomerate. In a span of about three months, Jio Platforms mopped up $20.4 billion - almost the valuation of Flipkart when it was acquired by Walmart two years ago and the combined value of Zomato, Swiggy, BYJU's and Freshworks.Not surprisingly then, most Bengaluru VCs, and even founders, are shocked at how Jio successfully raised this gargantuan financing without them getting a whiff of what technology the conglomerate has actually built.For what it's worth, Jio isn't the typical consumer internet company, which gets valued on vanity metrics like gross merchandise value (GMV), daily active users (DAUs) and monthly active users (MAUs).But it is the biggest telco-tech company in suburban Mumbai with no connection to Koramangala.What stands out is how, till a few months ago, Jio was hailed by the tech community as a great pipeline offering cheap data reaching the deepest parts of India. But the local entrepreneurial ecosystem wasn't sure if Mukesh Ambani's efforts around Jio would translate into building digital products with the same finesse.Many startup and VC folks were heard applauding how Jio was sheer 'execution-propelling internet connectivity to Bharat'. On many occasions, I would ask these same people what they thought would happen if Jio started using the same pipe to push its own services and products - something that all telcos have tried, but most have failed. No one gave me a clear reply. And I suspect that's because none knew - or knew very little - about what the Mumbai company was up to.Many have said how Facebook, Google and a dozen financial investors have lined up for Jio Platforms to possibly move to the right side of Indian regulations and policies. Globally, big tech has been at loggerheads with antitrust regulators, governments and various agencies. Amazon, Facebook, Google and Apple are all facing regulatory and government scrutiny of some kind. So, why would they not want to be in a safer zone in India? This, to many watching the events unfold, is a small price to pay.While this may be true, who stopped Bengaluru startups from not making their policy pitches better? Why were they siloed away from business realities, other than making some noise about capitaldumping by foreign competitors and protectionism a few years ago? Also, on the question of execution, remember, the same Jio was praised repeatedly for laying the foundation for many tech startups to flourish beyond India's metros. To dismiss Jio's newly formed collective and say that Google and Facebook invested in Ambani to win a policy battle is far too simplistic.Wall Street and Silicon Valley came together, bridging the gap between New York and San Francisco, because the bankers smelt a gold rush in technology upstarts and their impending initial public offerings (IPOs). If Indian tech startups had been able to build a bunch of super-scaled businesses that could go public, they may have averted the concentration of power in a legacy company that's likely to bring in massive returns to 14 of its investors.

The Competition Commission of India (CCI), on its part, was of the prima facie opinion that the conduct of these two e-commerce establishments merits an investigation under the provisions of the Competition Act, 2002. This was to ascertain whether they entered into anti-competitive agreements in violation of the Act. In February, the Karnataka High Court stayed CCI's order directing a probe on the grounds that, among other things, Amazon is being investigated under Fema, and CCI has no jurisdiction until the ongoing probe produces its findings.MakeMyTrip (MMT) and OYO are also being investigated for allegedly imposing unfair terms, such as platform parity restrictions, restricting hotel owners from selling rooms at a price below that offered, and offering predatory discounts. Accordingly, CCI directed a prima facie investigation for vertical restraints by MMT and OYO, as well as for abuse of dominance by MMT. </p><p>Google is being investigated for its alleged abusive practices in the market for licensable smart mobile device operating systems. The tech company's conduct allegedly resulted in the imposition of unfair conditions on manufacturers of Android smartphones, via mandating pre-installation of Google apps and restrictions on manufactures, arguably reducing the ability and incentives for innovation.Swiggy's conduct was also assessed by CCI in relation to its online food delivery arrangements with partner restaurants. The food delivery app's alleged unfair practices pertained to higher food rates on its website than those offered by partner restaurants, which were not disclosed to customers. To allay price-fixing concerns while dismissing the allegations, CCI directed Swiggy to disclose that it isn't involved in price and menu fixing on its platform. This approach adopted by CCI is likely to have far-reaching implications for not only the enterprises being scrutinised, but also for other businesses having exposure to digital markets.Antitrust regulators worldwide aim to strike a balance between enforcement and preserving the competitiveness of such markets, since adopting any quick-fix intervention measures could thwart innovation, thereby harming consumers. The other area of concern is regarding the ability of online enterprises to 'tip the markets' in their favour. This has necessitated increased monitoring efforts.More That an IoTa of Fairness To further its efforts, the European Commission (EC) has initiated several processes, including setting up new 'platform to business' rules, launching an inquiry into the Internet of Things (IoT), and implementing regulations to promote fairness and transparency for business users of online intermediation services. These regulations are principally directed at e-commerce marketplaces, app stores, social media applications, price comparison tools and online search engines.The regulations will enable businesses and traders on online marketplaces to know the criteria determining their position in search results, greater clarity and protection from unfair terms and conditions, and for app developers to be able to challenge decisions by app stores wishing to remove their content. Accordingly, EC has launched an evaluation of its existing market definition rules to formulate a consistent and accessible approach to market definition across different industries, particularly the digital sector. EC is currently assessing Google's acquisition of fitness and healthcare tech company Fitbit, and is concerned that the unique data from the company will drive out its competitors, or strengthen Google's dominance in online search and advertising.In India, the corporate affairs ministry has undertaken proactive efforts to align competition law to the changing business environment. To modernise the Competition Act, the Competition Law Review Committee was set up, with its key recommendation being reflected in the recent Competition (Amendment) Bill, 2020. Notably, the Bill stipulates the introduction of criteria other than the existing assets or turnover thresholds specified in the Act to determine the notifiability of a transaction.The Act currently empowers CCI to 'look back' and unwind transactions that ought to have been notified, for a period of one year from the date on which such a transaction has come into effect. However, the existing regime does not permit CCI to scrutinise deals in the tech sector that do not breach the prescribed asset or turnover thresholds in India. Facebook's acquisition of WhatsApp in 2014, for instance, did not require merger control assessment in several jurisdictions, including India, on account of domestic turnover thresholds.Let's Make It Hi, TechCertain jurisdictions, like Germany and Japan, have amended their merger control rules to introduce transaction value thresholds, to encompass acquisition of digital enterprises. Antitrust regulators are increasingly concerned about the acquisition of innovative startups by big tech, which may enable such enterprises to enter complementary markets, potentially harming innovation.The future of competition law enforcement is likely to encompass the interplay of competition, privacy, consumer and data protection tools. To this effect, GoI has issued a draft ecommerce policy that seeks to create a regulatory environment to protect the misuse of data, thereby ensuring competition.

This was accompanied by a pact between WhatsApp and Reliance Retail to boost the latter's JioMart platform. InJuly 2019, Facebook invested in Meesho, an Indian social commerce company that connects buyers and sellers on social media. Similarly, the plan with JioMart focuses on connecting kirana stores to customers.This investment gets Jio easier access to hundreds of millions of users across WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram, financial and technological muscle, and a better balance sheet.For Facebook, it means access to over 370 million Jio subscribers, a partnership with one of India's largest tech companies with a play in telecom services and infrastructure, cloud storage (JioCloud), digital entertainment (JioTV and Jio Cinema), payments (MyJio), communication (JioChat), cybersecurity (JioSecurity), ecommerce (JioMart), health tech (JioHealth-Hub) and IoT (JioMotive for smart car connectivity), and the opportunity to launch new products (e.g., Lasso) through Jio's vast customer network.A strategic partnership with India's largest telecom operator will also be key to Facebook's future technological plays, particularly in virtual reality (VR) and Internet of Things (IoT), the success of which will depend on access to 5G. Jio has, reportedly, developed its own end-to-end 5G technology, and has sought the approval of the Telecom Authority of India (Trai) for 5G trials.Facebook has previously partnered with a telecom provider in Japan to provide augmented reality (AR)/VRbased products using 5G networks. </p><p>It also runs the 'Telecom Infrastructure Project', which aims to create open source telecom equipment to promote affordable telecom infrastructure in under-connected areas. Some member companies have expressed concerns over the project's potential to turn Facebook into a powerful telecom player.Telecom is heavily regulated in India. As such, this investment in Jio Platforms may give Facebook access to the 5G technology and telecom infrastructure that it needs, while being sufficiently insulated from the accompanying regulatory scrutiny and compliances.This investment in Jio is Facebook's third in India, after Meesho and Little Eye, a startup building analysis tools for mobile app developers. The tie-up, as Facebook's press release on the Jio deal states, is pitched as the company investing in India's future. This is helped by the perception of Reliance Jio as the 'poster-child' for the 'swadeshi' digital movement in the country. Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) chairman Mukesh Ambani has spoken about the need for data sovereignty and strengthening Indian small businesses. The company has also supported the GoI's data localisation policies in the past. In contrast, GoI has been understandably wary of, and 'less than kind' towards, large foreign tech companies and their contrary positions on key issues, particularly related to data storage and protection. In the face of such shaky relations, the idea behind this strategic partnership may also be to allow Facebook develop a better relationship with 'key decision-makers'.The optics of the deal - being focused on helping and partnering small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and kirana shops, as opposed to competing with them - are also sought to soften adverse reactions and criticisms from the government and domestic lobbies. This debate will, undoubtedly, influence how India thinks about regulating Big Tech.These conversations are fairly nascent in India, compared to many other jurisdictions around the world, particularly the US and EU. Just on the digital payments front, both MyJio - which already offers UPI payments and recharge services - and WhatsApp Pay - which received NPCI approval in February - could easily dominate the market.Facebook and Jio together also have access to vast troves of personal information, even as India is yet to finalise a personal data protection law. News reports already point to Jio plans of creating a super-app, which could also result in the creation of an ecosystem of apps. Indian startups have often spoken about the difficulty, or inability, to compete with big tech companies and their impact on the Indian tech ecosystem. This deal and its implications for the Indian market attract similar concerns.Only time will tell if 'India's digital sarvodaya (universal service)' that Mukesh Ambani spoke about in a media statement after the Jio-Facebook deal was announced on Wednesday will be for everyone. Or if this will just be a sequel to what Reliance Jio did to the Indian telecom market.(Chaudhari and Gupta are policy director and associate, respectively, Ikigai Law) For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECOTMS-75332306</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECOTMS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YRF-9631-JB3N-T3H4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">362627</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"797\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.

Current law aims to prevent price-fixing, while the new proposal would shift the law to a nebulous standard that targets any player assumed to be dominant in the market.</p><p> If passed and signed by Gov. Andrew Cuomo, this bill would set back innovation in this state.</p><p> One section allows private lawyers to file class-action lawsuits against businesses that hold a \"dominant position\" in any market. There is no consideration for innovators \u2014 who will always hold a dominant position by developing new products and features and creating new markets. Instead of garnering praise, first-to-market entrepreneurs will find themselves in the sights of enterprising trial lawyers.</p><p> While the bill was drafted with tech firms in mind, as written it would critically impair any and all industries. Consider the company that creates the first vaccine for COVID-19. That manufacturer will undoubtedly have a dominant position in the market; under this proposal, that means exposure to massive new liabilities.</p><p> Of course, a company should be subject to enforcement if it abuses its market position. However, that regulation needs to be carried out thoughtfully. Careful enforcement, with the public interest in mind, can only come from duly elected officials, not private, profit-seeking lawyers.</p><p> Here in upstate, we have already seen how powerful trial lawyers can stifle technological advancements. The region was the last in the country to allow ride-sharing, thanks in part to the trial lawyer lobby.</p><p>New York has long been a center for innovation, but this legislation would jeopardize our position as a global leader in technology, finance, and medicine. Given the current medical and financial crises, lawmakers need to foster innovation, not allow it to be sued out of existence.</p><p> Tom Stebbins is executive director at the Lawsuit Reform Alliance of New York.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKNY-78c7d947bdfa54ed574f6832cf94d51b98c679b</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28D9756B218B9B NWBKNY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60V4-P6J1-JBCN-40SB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399552</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"390\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Hearst<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

With a valuation of US$75 billion ($106 billion), Bytedance is the world's biggest unicorn - a venture-capital funded private firm valued at over US$1 billion. Close on ByteDance's heels is Mumbai-based Jio Platforms, a subsidiary of petrochemicals behemoth Reliance Industries. Jio combines all of Reliance's digital and mobility businesses, including India's No 1 cellular services provider Reliance Jio Infocomm, the country's biggest broadband provider, as well as an array of digital infotainment firms. On April 22, US social media giant Facebook bought a 9.99% stake in Jio for US$5.7 billion. Silicon Valley firm Silver Lake Partners has since purchased a 1.15% stake in Jio for US$750 million and Texas buyout firm Vista Equity Partners paid US$1.5 billion to buy a 2.3% stake. Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and US private equity firm General Atlantic are reportedly negotiating to each buy a stake as well.</p><p>Jio's emergence as one of the world's most watched unicorns has something to do with Reliance's hugely leveraged balance sheet. The Indian petrochemical giant piled up huge debts by diversifying into consumer businesses such as cellular, broadband and digital services, including the streaming of movies and music. It had splurged nearly US$50 billion on its telecom and digital strategy over the past decade. Now, Reliance is deleveraging and beefing up its coffers to help supercharge its digital business.</p><p>Facebook's acquisition of a stake in Jio is all about monetising WhatsApp and expanding its own global reach. The messenger app is already being used by over 450 million Indians. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has long wanted Facebook to emulate Chinese super app WeChat, which has 1.1 billion users. Facebook makes money from collecting as much data on its users as possible, often surreptitiously, and then selling ads based on that data or selling the data itself to the highest bidder. The best way to collect a ton of data from users is to keep them engaged for a prolonged period of time on the platform. Better still, make it difficult for them to leave your platform. Instagram, owned by Facebook, is already morphing into a super app of sorts.</p><p>Linked to the messaging app, WhatsApp Pay, the fledgling digital payments platform, could help Facebook expand into e-commerce. This is where JioMart, Reliance's e-commerce platform, comes in. The deal will provide Facebook with direct access to Jio's 375 million subscribers and a strong foothold in the world's fastest-growing mobile market. Entry into e-commerce could also help Facebook in its core ad business. Amazon.com's digital advertising business is now the third biggest behind Google and Facebook, and the e-commerce giant has been gaining market share because its targeted ads, particularly for brands selling physical products, are more effective in helping advertisers make a sale.</p><p>Founded in 1973 as a textile firm by Dhirubhai Ambani, Reliance grew by vertically integrating its operations, moving upstream into petrochemicals and eventually, oil and gas. It helped democratise India's stock market by creating an army of millions of shareholders and still holds its annual general meetings in a sports stadium. After the founder's death in 2002, his sons Mukesh and Anil duelled over control for years until their mother forced a truce. Elder brother Mukesh inherited the main oil-to-chemical conglomerate while Anil ventured into new ventures such as telecoms. Yet within five years, Anil had run the capital-intensive telco aground, having piled it with huge debts.</p><p>Mukesh then bailed him out and entered the lucrative telecom business himself, investing US$33 billion to rapidly build a 4G network. His marketing playbook was simple: offer ultra-cheap data rates and free domestic calls to build a huge subscriber base. Over the past five years, it has attracted 375 million subscribers, driving smaller telcos such as Reliance Communications, controlled by Anil, and Aircel, owned by Malaysian billionaire Ananda Krishnan, to the ground and severely denting the prospects of former leaders Bharti Airtel, in which Singapore Telecommunications has a substantial stake, and Vodafone India.</p><p>Oil-and-chemicals baron Mukesh understands that telcos are capital-intensive, low-margin operators of dumb pipes. The real juice is in digital stuff like e-commerce, search, social media, streaming movies and music as well as online payments. At the apex of Mukesh's digital strategy has been building a massive e-commerce business to serve 1.35 billion Indians. But plunging oil prices and tepid demand for petrochemical products meant its huge debts had become an albatross around its neck. Debts within its telecom-related units had swelled to over US$24 billion. Now it is implementing an audacious deleveraging plan to cut its net debts to zero by end-2020. It has already announced US$16 billion worth of deals, including the part divestment of Jio, the sale of a 49% stake in a fuel retailing venture to UK oil giant BP for US$920 million, and a rights issue that will see it raise US$7 billion. Reliance is also seeking to sell 20% of its oil and petrochemical business to Saudi Aramco for over US$15 billion.</p><p>SuperApp strategy</p><p>India's e-commerce market is dominated by Amazon.com; Walmart, which two years ago bought Indian e-commerce firm Flipkart for US$20 billion; and Alibaba Holdings. The market, which was merely US$14 billion in 2014, is forecast to grow 13-fold to US$188 billion by 2025. A growing digital population that is expanding beyond the country's urban centres and the increasing use of smartphones have been helping to drive the growth of e-commerce in Asia's third largest economy behind China and Japan.</p><p>For its part, Facebook is trying to capture India's burgeoning e-commerce market by combining Jio's connection to the country's 30 million small businesses with its own user network. Jio's e-commerce platform, when integrated with WhatsApp, will create a super app akin to WeChat, offering a variety of products and services, including digital payments and local delivery.</p><p>To compete head-on with Amazon and Walmart's digital offerings in India, JioMart is betting on connecting India's 6.6 million kiranas, small family-owned neighbourhood shops selling groceries and other sundries, with WhatsApp.\"JioMart combines the retail capabilities of Reliance with the messaging and payment strengths of WhatsApp,\" notes Rahul Malhotra, an analyst for Bernstein &amp; Co in Mumbai. \"JioMart empowers the kiranas by bringing incremental customers and better control to the supply chain,\" he argues. Its tie-up with WhatsApp will also help resolve issues like \"frequent stock outs, inability to predict demand and accept digital payments\", he notes. Kirana stores lose up to 15% of their sales every month to those issues.</p><p>The way Malhotra sees it, Reliance is already India's top offline retailer, with 50,000 grocery products on JioMart. With WhatsApp integration, it will become a one-stop shop for all kirana needs as their key sourcing partner. And WhatsApp is the No 1 consumer app in India. Already, WhatsApp Business helps customers order groceries on its platform as well as brings in new kirana stores as merchants. The platform already has one million small business users in India. \"Payments could be the missing link, with WhatsApp emerging as a preferred digital payments partner on JioMart\" with the new partnership, he notes.</p><p>Here is how JioMart's WhatsApp integration works: As a customer, you send a \"Hi\" message on WhatsApp chat to JioMart. You then receive a link - valid for 30 minutes - to order from JioMart. You can order items from the inventory available at your neighbourhood stores. Although delivery is currently not available due to the lockdown, once India is open for business in a few weeks, customers will receive a notification once their orders are ready and they can collect their purchases from the store. Eventually, home delivery will be available as well. The service is currently offered in select neighbourhoods of Mumbai and is expected to be launched in other cities and regions over the next year or two.</p><p>Facebook's Jio investment is its largest since its purchase of WhatsApp for US$19 billion in 2014. \"The deal signals Facebook's ambition to capture India's fledgling US$64 billion e-commerce market,\" says James Wang, analyst at ARK Invest in New York. Facing saturation in most developed markets and blocked from China, Facebook has turned to India for growth, Wang notes. With 450 million users, India is now the social network giant's largest market by reach.</p><p>Facebook in India</p><p>Facebook's US$5.7 billion investment is not the first time it has poured billions into India. In 2016, it launched Free Basics, offering Indians no-fee access to a text-only mobile version of the Facebook social network, as well as some news, health, jobs and other services. Instead of subscribing to a data plan with a local telco, poorer Indians could use Free Basics to access Facebook's social network, messaging and other services for free. What Facebook got in return was a trove of data from users. Those efforts were stymied when Indian regulators banned free mobile data plans that favoured some internet services over others.</p><p>Last year, WhatsApp won permission from the National Payments Corporation of India to expand WhatsApp Pay using India's Unified Payments Interface, a platform that enables mobile bank-to-bank transactions. WhatsApp Pay's expansion in India has had plenty of stops and starts over the past two years. It was blocked because Facebook initially refused to guarantee that WhatsApp would only store Indian consumers' data in India. Though that has been resolved, Facebook has since run into other obstacles. \"If nothing else, the alliance with Jio could help Facebook curry favour with the local governments and, thereby, the regulators,\" says Wang.</p><p>Regulatory obstacles aside, WhatsApp faced a bunch of other hurdles. Google Pay has been ramping and now has over 80 million Indian users. There is also local Indian player PayTM, with 150 million users, in which Alibaba's Ant Financial has a substantial stake. Last year, Facebook launched Libra, its own digital currency, which has met with strong resistance from regulators around the world.</p><p>What's next? Given the fierce competition in e-commerce in India and the enormity of the task ahead, New Street Research's telco analyst Chris Hoare predicts a Jio IPO by the end of this year or in early 2021. Bank of America Securities believes Jio could raise up to US$17 billion in an IPO selling 25% stake. Now that Airbnb and data firm Palantir have delayed their listings, pent up demand for new large tech IPOs is huge. If market conditions remain favourable towards the year-end as the world recovers from coronavirus pandemic, the Indian digital giant could raise close the record US$24 billion that Alibaba raised in 2014. Jio Platform's Wall Street debut will mark its arrival on the global stage as it takes its place alongside powerhouses like Amazon, Alphabet, Netflix and Alibaba.</p><p>Assif Shameen is a business and technology writer based in North America</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EDGESI-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EDGESI2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YY3-NP51-JCF0-3007-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">261523</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1876\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Edge Publishing PTE.

The opposition raised a ruckus, and the company has been summoned by the parliamentary standing committee on information technology.A few privately-owned platforms now have huge power over the public sphere. Facebook, which owns WhatsApp and Instagram, has tried to cast itself as an innocent intermediary, an empty stage where users do their own thing, but in fact, it brokers our interactions. How they organise content, make it searchable, what is visible and heard - these are choices, and they have consequences.Social media companies profit from our engagement.Left to themselves, their algorithms prioritise the stuff that spreads fastest - rage, hate, wacko conspiracy theories. </p><p>These platforms are also hard to exit. Today, the price of being in touch with friends and family is to let yourself be under minute surveillance so others can sell to you.These platforms are pretty proactive with taking down sexual content and graphic violence. While they also claim to prohibit hate speech, drawing lines through community flagging and editorial review is admittedly not easy in a hyper-partisan environment. It comes down to human and institutional choices. Around the world, they have evolved their own standards in response to public outcry and economic imperatives. In the cases pointed out by the Wall Street Journal, there is no ambiguity, they violate the company's own stated standards elsewhere.European regulators have made Facebook act quickly on hate speech, compelled to respond to takedown requests within 24 hours. In Pakistan it takes down blasphemy, in Thailand, it rushes to scrub anything that criticises the royals. Goaded by governments, it also invests in counter-messaging. For instance, those who search for white supremacist content are now guided to a group called Life After Hate. In India, though, apparently, Facebook concluded in 2018 that a BJP leader's page (which he now disowns) calling Muslims traitors, threatening to demolish mosques, demanding that Rohingyas be shot, need not be acted on.After the controversy, BJP leaders claimed that the Wall Street Journal expose is a left-wing attempt to censor right-wing speech in a free marketplace of ideas. But hate speech is not free speech, it undermines the very value of free speech, constricting the participation of vulnerable minorities. These are not 'mere words', or harmless rhetoric. This surround-sound, this constant demonising of Muslims has violent effects in the real world. As political theorist Bhikhu Parekh put it, if anything can be said about a group with impunity, anything can also be done to it.To be fair, social media is only one part of modern propaganda infrastructures - it is not the source of our intense friction today. But it tends to encourage ideological extremes, as platforms like WhatsApp privately influence us, pander even to baseless beliefs, without the pushback that would have come in a common public forum. And it threatens democracy when it adds its firepower to an already asymmetric battleground.Then again, where is the minimal shared threshold that deliberative democracy needs? After the Facebook story broke, the BJP claimed that the opposition was also spreading hate speech when Sonia Gandhi called for an 'aar paar ki ladaai', or Rahul Gandhi said that the public would attack the PM with sticks. This is just blurring the question: did Facebook decline to apply standards of hate speech for fear of offending the BJP? It is depressing but not surprising that an employee whose job it is to lobby the government would push for ignoring hate-speech from party members. But once exposed, the question is whether Facebook will double down and defend these choices in its biggest market or be held to a fair standard.There is nothing wrong with partisan division. We have deep moral disagreements that don't have to be reconciled, as long as we accept that we are a part of a plural whole and don't try to annihilate the other. But now, we are steadily losing all \"common sense\" - shared norms that let us talk across our differences. Democracy cannot work in this disorientation, there can be no argument, no give and take.In the US, big tech executives were grilled by their House antitrust committee, both Republicans and Democrats worry about their outsized power. In India, the force field is different. Here, Facebook is accused of aligning with a political side for its self-interest. A bargain between a communications colossus and a dominant ruling party/government that wants only its own voice heard might make excellent sense for both sides, but it's no good for democracy.

This is the case with most 'expert' economic opinion, too.With Covid-19 devastating economies, they are all telling governments to spend, spend and spend their way out of this pandemic.Without denying the need for governments to spend more to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe, we have failed to ask ourselves a more basic question: is this going to get us permanently out of trouble? Didn't we do the same after 2008, and did we really get to a better place over the last decade? Why is it that monetary and fiscal steroids are seen as the only antidotes to slowdowns, recessions and depression?</p><p> Is more of the same the answer to a more frightening economic crisis?If we had asked some of the above questions and started acknowledging the future that is already here, our answers would not be limited to pouring endless amounts of good money after bad. We should be rethinking our policies to make that visible future work in our favour. And that future includes the accelerating arrival of the gig economy - which will be ruled by big tech, who will drive growth, and small entrepreneurship and contract work.Even before Covid hit us in the solar plexus, factories and offices had already begun transitioning towards robots and contract labour. Online retailing was driving gig employment in logistics, warehousing and deliveries, and demand for personal transport was trending towards shared mobility.Post-Covid, offices have been emptied out as employees work from home (WFH). Post-demonetisation, digitisation, the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and Bharat QR code, the entire banking and financial sector looked set to hollow out as mobile phones were beginning to do the work of branch offices, ATMs and even credit and debit cards. Healthcare is already being done through teleconsulting, and schools have learnt to teach online. In the future, algorithms will help doctors diagnose, and digital aids will help low-level medical help to deal with basic healthcare and wellness queries as well.This is the future that is already here, and will only accelerate post Covid. WFH will continue well after we bid goodbye to the virus, lowering costs and ultimately reducing most office jobs to gigs and contract work. Incomes will depend on hours put in, or measurable output.Gig-Start the New EconomyOn the other hand, current gigs may get more corporatised. Just as residential and office security jobs were corporatised over the last few decades, post-Covid we may see domestic services - from household help to plumbing and electrical work to carcleaning and chauffeur services -being corporatised. In short, good quality jobs will become gigs, and existing gigs will get de-personalised and corporatised.The livelihoods of the future already visible will be of three kinds: super-specialisations and high-skill work will be in huge demand; midskill, mid-level office jobs will be automated or paid on a contractual basis; low-level, low-skill jobs will largely be gigs. The average non-IIT engineer or arts graduate will earn less than plumbers or Ola drivers or Flipkart delivery personnel.The question we should be asking is not just how to get the economy out of the ditch, but how do we avoid landing there again when our tech-fuelled future growth takes hold. If big tech is going to create and grab most of the value-adds in the economy, how should it be regulated? If most jobs in the economy are going to be gigs, what kind of supporting reforms do we need in terms of labour law changes to enable off-and-on social security contributions? Should EMIs (equated monthly instalments) for home and auto loans, devised for steady salary earners, be replaced with flexible payment schemes, where lumpsums are payable at customer-determined timelines?Factor market reforms (labour and land) are still focused on issues like hire-and-fire and freeing land markets from mindless UPA-era land acquisition laws. But employers have already found a workaround for inflexible labour laws (contract labour, gigs), and the need for large offices is questionable. This is not to say labour and land market reforms are not needed, just that we need to think about them differently. We need new laws on gig employment that empower workers to manage their savings and social security contributions better, without making then so difficultto comply that employers prefer automation over hiring labour.WFH is going to impact demand for office and residential spaces differently. Most companies may want to remain largely virtual, which means office and residential demand will be based on short-term, usage-based rental charges. And more people may want to rent homes rather than buy them. So, we need to abandon rent controls and enable short-term hiring of office or residential spaces, with easy repossession rules.Solution Not at the CentreIn the post-Covid world, we are wrongly focused on macro remedies when the big reforms are micro in nature.We should be preparing for the accelerating gig economy by enabling productive learning and income opportunities, and converting the State from being a part of the solution instead of being the problem.GoI can spend all the money it wants to revive the economy today. But without asking more questions on what needs to be done to make the oncoming gig economy flourish, we will be back to square one again. The old State-led cures for recessions and slowdowns are past their sell-by dates.The writer is editorial director, Swarajya For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECOTMS-77337037</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECOTMS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60H6-9X81-JB3N-T32P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">362627</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"933\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.

You are in the SITUATION ROOM.</p><p>We're following dramatic breaking news this hour. New developments surrounding the former USDA official Shirley Sherrod. The <person><nameText>Agriculture Secretary, Tom Vilsack, </nameText></person>says he has now apologized and offered to rehire Sherrod in a different job, adding and I'm quoting him now, \"she's been put through hell.\"</p><p><person><nameText>TOM VILSACK, </nameText></person>AGRICULTURE SECRETARY: I've learned a lot of lessons from this experience in the last couple of days. And one of the lessons I learned is that these types of decisions require time. I didn't take the time. I should have. And as a result, a good woman, has gone through a very difficult period. And I'll have to live with that for a long, long time. The decision to do what was done was done by me. It was my decision, and it was communicated, and one of the lessons learned here is that this type of decision first and foremost should have been communicated by me.</p><p>It should have been done in a much more personal way. It should have been done with far more thought, and it should have been done in far less haste. And all of those are my responsibility. And I accept that responsibility. And I ask for Shirley's forgiveness, and she was gracious enough to extend it to me, and for that, I am thankful.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BLITZER: <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>isn't commenting directly on the controversy. White House aides say they don't expect him to call Sherrod, although I suspect that could change. Earlier, a spokesman said she clearly had been wrong.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERT GIBBS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Members of this administration, members of the media, members of different political factions on both sides of this have all made determinations and judgments without a full set of facts. I think that is -- that is wholly and completely accurate. I think without a doubt Ms. Sherrod is owed an apology. I would do so certainly on behalf of this administration. I think if we look back and decide what we want to learn out of this, I think it is, as I said, everybody involved made determinations without knowing all of the facts and all of the events.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BLITZER: I interviewed Shirley Sherrod earlier today just before she spoke directly to the <person><nameText>Agriculture Secretary, Tom Vilsack.</nameText></person></p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BLITZER: Painful as it was to hear from your superiors over at the Department of Agriculture, and to get this statement from the White House that later came out, I suspect it was even more painful for you personally to be rejected and repudiated by the NAACP, an organization you've worked with and admired for so many years.</p><p>SHIRLEY SHERROD, FORMER USDA OFFICIAL: Yes. Now, that hurt. I guess more than being asked to resign from the Department of Agriculture, because my whole life has been about civil rights. My whole life has been about equal rights, and for an organization like the NAACP to come out with the initial statement that they came out with really, really hurt.</p><p>BLITZER: And they subsequently have reversed their decision, and they called you to apologize, is that right?</p><p>SHERROD: Yes. That's exactly right. Ben Jealous, himself, called me, and his first statement was that he wanted to apologize, and before I allowed him to go on to say anything else, I told him right away, I accept it. You know, I wanted him to know that I truly accepted it, and we could move on.</p><p>BLITZER: You know, even before he called you and issued that statement saying that they regret what has happened, you know that here on CNN, Donna Brazile was on my show saying the NAACP is wrong, the Department of Agriculture is wrong, the White House is wrong, and she publicly appealed to all of them to come up with the right decision and do the right thing. I don't know if you saw that.</p><p>SHERROD: No, I didn't see that. And I really appreciate her for doing that.</p><p>BLITZER: Because she saw that there was an injustice, and she spoke out. She deserves a lot of credit because she went back and looked at that tape, and she saw the context, and it clearly showed that you were not a racist or anything like that. You were speaking from some very personal experiences that you had. Did you hear from Andrew Breitbart, the conservative publisher, who initially published that edited clip of what you were saying?</p><p>SHERROD: No, I didn't. I didn't even know of him until yesterday, but I haven't heard anything from him. He didn't contact me before he put that out, and he certainly has not contacted me since.</p><p>BLITZER: Do you agree with the attorney general of the United States, Eric Holder, that we, we, Americans, essentially, in his words of last year were essentially a nation of cowards when it comes to discussing race?</p><p>SHERROD: I certainly agree with that. You know, you can look at this. If we could have the open discussions, maybe we could, in some way, try to move forward. I think those discussions need to be held a lot at the local level, you know, the level where I was, and also from the top. But somehow, I don't know what is going to take for this country, but we really have to figure this out if we expect this great country, the United States of America, to move forward in the future in the way we need to move forward. We are mixed here. It's not all one race in this country and never will be, you know. So, we need to figure out how to live together.</p><p>BLITZER: Are you as concerned as am I that maybe this whole incident will make all of us ever more reluctant to openly discuss race?</p><p>SHERROD: I hope not. I hope not. I hope -- you know, having gone through this, that in some big way, small way, whatever which way you want to look at it, that it helps us to be able to put that discussion out here, so that we can keep trying to deal with it. We will not solve it if we just try to put it under the table every time it surfaces. We have to discuss it and figure out how to move forward.</p><p>BLITZER: You have an amazing personal story and I briefly want you to share what happened to your father, and if he were around, how he would look at what's happening right now?</p><p>SHERROD: Oh, my goodness. You know, in 45 years, I have not missed one day of thinking about my father, and the impact he had on my life during his lifetime and even since his death. My father meant everything to us. He was a great leader in the community. And I know he would be proud. You know, if I go back to my grandfather, his father, you know, they always pushed us to get an education, but one thing about my family, both my mother's side and my father's side, they always pushed us to reach back and help others.</p><p>That's one thing about people from the county that I come from, Baker County. We always looked at reaching out to help others. People did it back then, we continue the do it now.</p><p>BLITZER: And remind our viewers if they don't know how your dad died. SHERROD: My father was murdered by a white man in Baker County who was never prosecuted even though there were witnesses. All of the witnesses were black. At the time the grand jury in our county was all White, and they refused to indict him for murder. We later tried to sue him, but our only, the only black attorney we had in Southwest Georgia, attorney C.B. King who was a very, very strong person realized that we don't know what happened, but at some point, he just said to us, it's not going to work.</p><p>It's not going to happen. I don't know. We wonder sometime whether he was threatened. We just don't know. And I've asked people. Even today, C.B. is not living now, and, in fact, they've named the courthouse in the city of Albany after him, but I would really like to know what made him just abruptly drop the case. Something happened.</p><p>BLITZER: Well, we'll see if we ever get to bottom of that, but Shirley Sherrod, thank you so much. Thank you so much for joining us, for sharing your story with all of our viewers. I think it's fair to say all of us are hoping only, only for the best for you and your entire family.</p><p>SHERROD: Thank you so much.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BLITZER: Jack Cafferty is coming up next with the \"Cafferty File.\"</p><p>Then, the speech that ignited this racially charge firestorm, what Shirley Sherrod really said and the crucial context that was missing in that initial clip.</p><p>And what the controversy is revealing about race in American right now and what some call, \"a nation of cowards afraid to take on these really tough issues.\"</p><p>Plus, my interview with Democratic congressman Kendrick Meek of Florida. He's a member of the Congressional Black Caucus. They're meeting now with the Agriculture Secretary to talk about lessons learned.</p><p>BLITZER: Jack Cafferty is here with the \"Cafferty File\" -- Jack.</p><p>JACK CAFFERTY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: For the first time ever, 60 percent of American workers don't think they'll get any Social Security when they retire. A USA Today/Gallup Poll show 6 in 10 Americans who haven't retired yet say there'll be nothing for them when they stop working. And that's the most pessimistic outlooks since this question was first asked more than 20 years ago. Younger Americans are least likely to think that they get (ph) Social Security while those over 55 are confident that they will get benefits. A majority of retired Americans, though, think the benefits will be cut which is especially troubling when you consider that 54 percent of retirees believe say that Social Security is their major source of income more than any other single source.</p><p>Our government has yet another crisis on its hands. This one has been coming down the tracks in plain sight for years, and yet, it's not being dealt with. Already, this year, Social Security is slated to pay out more in benefits than collection contributions. And there's that whole issue of the trust fund you should pardon the word trust. It's filled with nothing, really, more than government IOUs, because the Social Security money that's collected is siphoned off into the general treasury and then spent on other things.</p><p>With a high unemployment rate, people retiring earlier than expected and more and more baby boomers getting ready to retire, something has to give, but it doesn't feel like anybody is listening. Here's the question, do you think Social Security will be there for you? Go to CNN.com/caffertyfile and post a comment on my blog.</p><p>BLITZER: Jack Cafferty, thank you. Thanks very much.</p><p>Let's get some more now on the controversy surrounding the former USDA official, Shirley Sherrod, and the racial firestorm ignited by an excerpt from a speech she gave almost four months ago. She said from the very beginning her words were taken out of context. So here is the context, her remarks to a NAACP chapter back on March 27th.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHERROD: God will show you things, and he'll put things in your path so that you realize that the struggle is really about poor people.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: All right. All right.</p><p>SHERROD: You know, the first time I was faced with having to help a white farmer save his farm, he took a long time talking, but he was trying to show me he was superior to me. I know what he's doing, but he had come to me for help. What he didn't know while he was taking all the time trying to show me he was superior to me, that I was trying to decide just how much help I will give him. I was struggling with the fact that so many black people had lost their farmland and here I was faced to help a white person save their land, so I didn't give him the full force of what I could do. I did enough so that when he -- I assume that the Department of Agriculture had sent him to me, either that or the Georgia Department of Agriculture, and he needed to go back to report that I did try to help him.</p><p>So, I took him to a white lawyer that had attended some of the training that we had provided, because chapter 12 bankruptcy had just been enacted for the family farmer. So, I figured if I took him to one of them, that his own kind would take care of him. That's when it was revealed to me that y'all, it's about poor versus those who have and not so much about white. It is about white and black, but it's not -- you know, it also opened my eyes, because I took him to one of his own, and I put him in his hand and thought, OK, I've done my job.</p><p>But, during that time, we would have these injunctions against the Department of Agriculture, and so, they couldn't foreclose on him. And I want you to know that the county supervisor had done something to him that I have not seen yet that they've done to any other farmer, black or white, and what they did to him caused him to not be able to file chapter 12 bankruptcy. So, everything was going along fine. I'm thinking he is being taken care of by the white lawyer and then they lifted the injunction against USDA in May of 1987, for two weeks, and he was one of 13 farmers in Georgia who received the foreclosure notice.</p><p>He called me. I said, we'll go on and make an appointment with the lawyer and let me know when it is, and I will meet you there. So, we met at the lawyer's office on the date they had given him, and this lawyer sat there. He had been paying this lawyer, y'all, that's what got me. He'd been paying the lawyer since November, and this was May. And the lawyer sat there and looked at him and said, well, y'all didn't know and why don't y'all just let the farm go? I could not believe he said that, so I said to the lawyer, I told him, I can't believe you said that. I said, it's obvious to me, if he cannot file a chapter 12 bankruptcy to stop this foreclosure, you have to file an 11.</p><p>And the lawyer said to me, I'll do whatever you say, whatever you think. That's the way he put it. But he's paying him. He wasn't paying me any money, you know. So, he said, the lawyer said he will work on it, and then, about seven days before that man would have been sold at the courthouse steps, the farmer called me and said, the lawyer wasn't doing anything. And that's when I spent time there in my office calling everybody I could think of to try to see, help me find a lawyer who would handle this, and finally, I remembered that I had gone to see one just 40 miles away in America was a black farmer, but working with him made me see that it's really about those who have versus those who have not.</p><p>You know, and they could be black, they could be white, they could be Hispanic, and it made me realize then that I needed to work to help poor people, those who don't have access the way others have.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BLITZER: All right. Those were Shirley Sherrod's unedited remarks before NAACP chapter back on March 27th. You saw the full context of what she was talking about.</p><p>Here's a little bit more on Shirley Sherrod right now. She was born in the segregated south and grew up picking crops on a farm in Georgia. She says her father was murdered as you heard her say back in 1965 by a white man who was never charged, and she says that shortly afterward, the Ku Klux Klan burned across on her lawn. She has a master's degree in community development from Antioch University in Ohio and work for 24 years as a state director of a non-profit organization helping rural communities.</p><p>Sherrod's family was awarded $300,000 as part of a 1997 class action lawsuit against the agriculture department charging it discriminated against black rural farmers. In 2009, the <person><nameText>Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack </nameText></person>appointed Sherrod Georgia state director of rural development, the job she held until her forced resignation this week.</p><p>Shirley Sherrod, the day after the former USDA employee is fire, she now gets an apology from her boss and a new job offer. This story is sparking lots of conversations about race in America. We're going to be taking a much deeper look.</p><p>And what was going on over at the White House as the Shirley Sherrod story was breaking. CNN's John King is standing by to join us. He has a behind the scenes look of what was going on.</p><p>BLITZER: The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke, is now describing the U.S. economic recovery in two words, I'm quoting him quoting, \"unusually uncertain.\" He told lawmakers on Capitol Hill today, the nation's central bank is prepared to give more help to the economy if needed. He said it's not clear what the best options are, but added, they would not necessarily be conventional. Wall Street did not like what they heard from Bernanke. The Dow fell after Bernanke's remarks and closed down 109 points.</p><p>Lisa Sylvester is monitoring some of the other top stories in the SITUATION ROOM right now. Lisa, what else is going on?</p><p>LISA SYLVESTER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Wolf. A terrifying scene in Eastern Iraq today. A car bomb ripped through a market in a predominantly Shia town. At least 13 people are dead and more than two dozen others are wounded. Police say women and children are among the victims.</p><p>The Pakistani American who's pleaded guilty to the botched Times Square bombing reportedly changed materials in his car bomb to avoid detection from authorities. New York's Police Commissioner says Faisal Shahzad decided to use fertilizer that wasn't as combustible and firecrackers instead of a deadlier explosive. The commissioner says it was that changed of ingredients that kept the bomb from going off. Shahzad is scheduled to be sentenced on October 5th. He now faces life in prison.</p><p><person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>got briefed today on the latest efforts to stop the oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico. A new attempt to permanently seal that ruptured well could get under way this weekend if approved by federal officials. Meanwhile, critical testing continues on a well cap that has stopped the oil from gushing for almost a week, but Incident Commander Thad Allen now warns that new reports of severe weather brewing in the Caribbean could disrupt operations.</p><p>And it's a major milestone for Facebook. Today, the social networking site signed up its 500 millionth user. That makes its population bigger than that of the U.S., Mexico and France combined -- Wolf.</p><p>BLITZER: That's huge. 500 million.</p><p>SYLVESTER: That's a lot of people that we're talking about on Facebook. BLITZER: Wasn't that long ago there were ten people out there, and now look, it's going on (ph). All right. Thanks, Lisa. Thanks very much.</p><p>The Shirley Sherrod controversy thrusting the issue of race front and center. We're going to talk about it with Democratic congressman, Kendrick Meek, of Florida. He is here in the SITUATION ROOM.</p><p>And we're learning new details of what's been going on behind the scenes as the White House grapples with the uproar. Our own John King is working his sources.</p><p>BLITZER: A dramatic turn of events in the story surrounding the fired USDA worker, Shirley Sherrod. The <person><nameText>Agriculture Secretary, Tom Vilsack, </nameText></person>has now publicly and formally apologized for forcing her out, and he's offered her a new job over at the Department of Agriculture. Vilsack fired Sherrod after a conservative website publisher posted a tape of her that appeared to her acknowledging that she discriminated against the white farmer, but it became clear rather quickly when the full tape came out that Sherrod was actually making a broad point about race.</p><p>Sherrod has told Vilsack she wants a few days to think about the new job offer. This entire controversy is putting the issue of race and how politicians are dealing with it front and center. Let's go back to Lisa Sylvester. She got more on this part of the story -- Lisa.</p><p>SYLVESTER: Well, you know, Shirley Sherrod was first branded a racist by the right, the left, even her bosses at the Department of Agriculture, all based on a few snippets of a speech. Today, as you mentioned, is a different day. And as it turns out, she has, in fact, over the years did a lot to help people of all races. Her story, though, is now renewing calls for national conversation on race and racism.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SYLVESTER (voice-over): As a nation, the United States has made great strides in breaking color barriers with the first black president, yet experts say race relations have recently become even more charged.</p><p>MARK WILLIAMS, TEA PARTY MEMBER: The NAACP is a bunch of old dusty relics.</p><p>BENJAMIN JEALOUS, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, NAACP: Make it clear that there's no space for bigots here, period.</p><p>ANDREW BREITBART, PUBLISHER, BREITBART.COM: A racism is used by the left and the Democratic Party to shut up opposition.</p><p>SYLVESTER: The NAACP has condemned the Tea Party for encouraging racism. Some in the Tea Party lashing back in turn accusing the NAACP of being a racist group. Shirley Sherrod was caught up in all of this after a conservative blogger tried to use her as a example of racism within the NAACP. But instead, she has emerged as a voice on how to narrow the racial divide. The Congressional Black Caucus says it is an opportunity for a national conversation.</p><p>REP. BARBARA LEE, CHAIRWOMAN, CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS: An honest dialogue that is clear, that's bold and that's without fear.</p><p>SYLVESTER: After taking office, Eric Holder, the first African- American attorney general called the United States a nation of cowards on matters of race and avoiding the hard questions. <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>briefly waded into the issue of race after a white police officer stopped Harvard Professor Henry Gates as he was entering his own home.</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The Cambridge police acted stupidly.</p><p>SYLVESTER: It ended with the now-famous beer summit between the men. But Abigail Thernstrom, a historian on race, says civil conversations are becoming rare in the current climate.</p><p>ABIGAIL THERNSTROM, RACE RELATIONS EXPERT: We need to stop the trigger-happy screaming about racism, race, race, race on the television screen blinking at you.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SYLVESTER: Now we now live in a world of blogs, YouTube and instant tweets and some racial experts say that may be one reason why we are reaching this current low that comments can be posted, edited, even taken out of context and the words and the images on the Internet linger. Wolf?</p><p>BLITZER: Lisa Sylvester, thank you very much. Let's dig a little bit deeper now with Democratic Congressman and U.S. Senate candidate Kendrick Meek of Florida. He's here in \"The Situation Room.\" Congressman, thanks very much for coming in. Do you agree that we are a nation of cowards essentially, the words of the attorney general, Eric Holder, when it comes to discussing race?</p><p>REP. KENDRICK MEEK (D), FLORIDA: Well, it's been a very difficult question for the country for a very long time. We have a country of race and religion and we have a lot of folks that live differently, and we don't understand one another like we should. This particular incident that has taken place over the last 72 hours is a perfect example of how the country is so focused on this issue that there is a lot of curiosity there, and discussion is important, we passed financial reform, the largest sweeping financial reform bill in almost the history of the country, and this has taken the headlines.</p><p>BLITZER: It is such a powerful story, when you get to speak to Shirley Sherrod, as I did this today, she's an amazing woman and she was by all accounts, and I think you agree, she was wronged.</p><p>MEEK: There were a number of -- there are a number of Americans that atone every day on this issue of race, talking about how they have changed and their attitude towards other racial groups, even gender and I think it is healthy when we see this kind of story take place, when you have a right-wing group that tries to separate and divide, and to see us now come back together understanding now we know the truth, she was basically talking about her experience and how she has changed.</p><p>BLITZER: You know, <person><nameText>Tom Vilsack, </nameText></person>the secretary of agriculture, you can see, he has been meeting with the members of the Congressional Black Caucus. You remember the Congressional Black Caucus, explaining what happened. They want to learn lessons. This has not been a pleasant experience for <person><nameText>Tom Vilsack, </nameText></person>for officials at the White House, I'm sure from the president on down, for leaders of the NAACP.</p><p>And you know, I want to listen a little bit in to what some of your colleagues at the Congressional Black Caucus are saying. They're there with <person><nameText>Tom Vilsack. </nameText></person>I think they're getting ready to speak. Barbara Lee, the congresswoman, now let's listen in a little and then we'll discuss, congressman.</p><p>LEE: Also for the Congressional Black Caucus, for the country, and of course for the secretary. We asked the secretary to come visit with us. We wanted to talk to him about what transpired. Of course, you all have our statement earlier. We indicated that we wanted him to ask Mrs. Sherrod to come back to the Department of Agriculture in a position of empowerment.</p><p>We asked also that an apology be made and that we believed that he acted too quickly and that he did not have all of the facts. The secretary very quickly responded. He has talked to many members of the Congressional Black Caucus. He came to our meeting. He has issued an apology in a very real way. We accept his apology. He has talked to Mrs. Sherrod, and I am sure he will talk to you later about that conversation.</p><p>And we talked about the fact that this really should be a moment that we look at the Department of Agriculture and all of the issues, the historical issues not addressed, and in which he is trying to address in terms of discrimination, in terms of land grant colleges, funding for our historically black colleges and universities, the Pigford lawsuit, the black farmers issues, all of those issues which Mrs. Sherrod understands and has a keen sensitivity to, because of her life and what she has experienced through her life.</p><p>The secretary understands that very clearly, and he apologized and he -- and when one makes a mistake, we expect an apology, and he did that. And we told him that we look forward to working with him as we begin to move forward. This is a moment that our nation needs to really understand that we have to begin to discuss race. We cannot believe that this is a post-racial era. In many ways, race has been swept under the rug, and we are trying as a Congressional Black Caucus to have this conversation, and we think that the secretary will be a good partner with us in this conversation. And we thank you very much for being here and I want to thank all of the members of the black caucus for coming and thank the secretary for being with us and for being so candid. It was a very good meeting and we really believed that Mrs. Sherrod deserves our respect. She deserves our applause. Her life now has become very public and her history is one that I hope that the entire country will look at in terms of a history of transformation and redemption which we can all learn from. Thank you very much.</p><p>QUESTION: Secretary Vilsack, is there some sort of --</p><p>BLITZER: That is Barbara Lee, she's the leader of the Congressional Black Caucus, the congresswoman making a strong statement. We are back with Kendrick Meek, he is a member of the Congressional Black Caucus as well, running for the U.S. Senate in Florida. He's a Democrat, as we know.</p><p>I guess the major lesson all of us have to learn is don't believe everything that you see on the Internet and if you see something, investigate. Do due diligence, vet it completely before you jump to any conclusions.</p><p>MEEK: Verify, verify, verify. I couldn't help but see in the background, John Lewis, who came to this city, Washington, D.C., as a civil rights activist with black and with white and Jews and all trying to bring about the kind of harmony that we need as a country to move forward. The fact that he has lived long enough to continue to see the changes in this country.</p><p>Today as another change as how it relates to how we look at this issue of race. I think that the administration want to protect all Americans. They're making sure that no one in this administration would discriminate against anyone. The issue of the black farmers has been raised and now it is being dealt with. Secretary Vilsack is dealing with that very issue. The issue of making sure that no one is stepped upon to find that white farmer who said, if it wasn't for the work that she did, I would have lost the farm, and he is a veteran, and what better voice to have?</p><p>I think this is a moment for the country that we all learn what we should do, and we should not allow the few, the few that are not carrying the intentions of goodwill to dictate the dialogue in this country.</p><p>BLITZER: You are running against Marco Rubio, the Republican candidate. Governor Charlie Crist, he's now the Independent candidate. You want to be the Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate. Has the issue of race at all come up over these many months that you've been running?</p><p>MEEK: Well, it has been raised by reporters, and I feel that Florida is a state of people of good will. We have elected women, we have elected Hispanics, we have elected <person><nameText>President Obama. </nameText></person>I believe that I will be elected as the next United States senator based on my qualifications.</p><p>We know that there are some people in our society that will never vote for a woman, that will never vote for a person of color. I feel that there are more people in the state of Florida that are willing to look at me as a former state trooper, as a member of the legislature and as a productive member of Congress that will work toward some of the issues that are facing Florida. I'm excited about it.</p><p>BLITZER: I want to bring you back and I want to go through some of those issues like oil drilling off of the coast of Florida and many of the other key issues. Unfortunately, we have run out of time right now because of the breaking news.</p><p>MEEK: I understand.</p><p>BLITZER: But you understand the nature.</p><p>MEEK: Absolutely. I look forward to coming back.</p><p>BLITZER: We had Marco Rubio on the show yesterday. We have also invited Charlie Crist to come on as well. We hope to have him as well, and then maybe one of these days, all three of you will come on together, we do a nice little debate on the issues facing the voters of Florida.</p><p>MEEK: Sounds great.</p><p>BLITZER: Thanks very much for coming on.</p><p>MEEK: Thanks, Wolf.</p><p>BLITZER: Kendrick Meek wants to be the United States senator from Florida.</p><p>The firestorm surrounding the firing of USDA worker Shirley Sherrod, how did the White House initially respond? Our own John King has a behind the scenes look, he's coming up next.</p><p>And the new Wall Street reform bill is cracking down on a problem that has nothing to do with U.S. banks. They're tackling mineral sales that are fueling violence in Congo right now. Stay with us, we have details in \"The Situation Room.\"</p><p>BLITZER: It's not just the <person><nameText>Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack </nameText></person>apologizing to Shirley Sherrod, the White House press secretary also apologized. Let's talk about what's going on in the White House with CNN's John King. He's the host of \"John King USA\" that comes up at the top of the hour. I guess the key question is why didn't -- before they came to a conclusion to dump this woman, why didn't they more thoroughly investigate?</p><p>JOHN KING, CNN HOST: Wolf, that is the fundamental question, and it has added volume to it in this town right now because keep what the White House could see and you could see Secretary Vilsack implying that hypersensitivity about the issue of race contributed to the idea that they had to deal with this quickly, before they knew all the facts.</p><p>And so here you have Mrs. Sherrod put the question best today, she said what will her grandchildren think when they find out the first African-American woman to hold the job she holds was forced to resign by the first African-American president on an issue of race. Why did the White House takes what was posted on a conservative blog as fact? A conservative blogger said she had engaged in racist conduct. Secretary Vilsack's people sent over an alert to the White House on Monday saying we're investigating this, we think we might have a problem here.</p><p>What was the feedback from the White House? We don't know that because they won't tell us. Then when they found out Secretary Vilsack wanted to force her to resign, we know the White House supported that decision. We know the president supported that decision initially. But was there any feedback? Now Secretary Vilsack says it was his and his alone, but that does not mean there were not conversations by his deputies back and forth with the White House. We know it came up at the White House staff meeting Tuesday morning, the deputy chief of staff Jim Messina said this was a textbook example of how you deal with a problem and deal with it quickly.</p><p>At that point, they thought they had done the right thing and so then they changed the mind. This is a White House, Wolf, remember, promised to be transparent. Personnel matters are sensitive, but we don't know the tick tock, the back and forth, who handled it at the White House, what was said back and those are big questions at a time this is a clear embarrassment to the White House.</p><p>BLITZER: I think in the coming days we will know the answers to these questions and then we will move on, but I know that the White House is so frustrated, a big day like today, the president signs financial regulations into law, and everybody is not paying attention to that, they're paying attention to this. You're going to have a lot more on this coming up.</p><p>KING: We're going to spend a lot of time trying to answer those questions and the ones we can't answer, we'll at least lay them out there.</p><p>BLITZER: \"John King USA\" at the top of the hour. Thanks very much.</p><p>Five million, yes five million people killed in a brutal war and some say gadgets like cell phones and laptops are fueling the violence. Now lawmakers here in the United States are taking action in an unexpected way.</p><p>BLITZER: Here is something you probably didn't know, the new financial reform law tackles a problem that has nothing to do with bank practices here in the United States, but is linked to big time profits. A provision cracks down on the use of minerals from Congo that could be supporting that country's deadly civil war. Let's go to CNN's Mary Snow, she is working the story for us. Mary, what is going on here? MARY SNOW, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Wolf, this is a provision tucked deep inside of the bill. I have it here. It's on page 2,279 and it brings attention to the link between electronic devices we use everyday and the Congo, which has the highest rate of sexual violence in the world and where it's estimated that 45,000 people die every month.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIIFED MALE: Hi, I'm a Mac.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And I'm a PC.</p><p>SNOW (voice-over): In this mock ad, the activist group enough exposes what it calls a dirty little secret about everyday devices from laptops to cell phones that contain materials from the Congo, recently called the rape capital of the world by a United Nations official.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A lot of this stuff comes all of the way from the Congo, where it has been fueling the deadliest conflict in the world since World War II, five million killed in the past 10 years.</p><p>SNOW: The group behind that message successfully fought to get a provision included in the financial reform bill signed by <person><nameText>President Obama. </nameText></person>It aims to cut off money to militias involved in the civil war. Those militias illegally seize minerals, sell them and go on to make millions, further fueling violence in the region.</p><p>The new rules require transparency. If companies are using materials from the Congo, they must disclose their due diligence, ensuring that they are not using conflict minerals.</p><p>JOHN PRENDERGAST, THE ENOUGH PROJECT: What this bill has done is basically taken a first step to addressing where these companies get their raw materials, and ensuring that the raw materials don't cause terrible conflict in far away places for our convenience.</p><p>SNOW: A big supporter, Republican Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas. He voted against the financial reform bill, but he was responsible for attaching the amendment saying he hopes it \"will bring accountability and transparency to the supply chain of minerals used in the manufacturing of many electronic devices.\"</p><p>A trade group for big tech companies applauds the effort, hoping it will provide leverage in the difficult job of sorting out what's legitimate and what's not, saying tech companies don't want to leave the area.</p><p>RICK GOSS, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY COUNCIL: Mining is a subsistence level of support for thousands of people in the Congo. And if industry were to pull out altogether, there would be thousands of people who would be left with no source of income here.</p><p>SNOW: But the new rules don't have the teeth to enforce penalties. PRENDERGAST: No penalties yet. We couldn't win that battle. That will be the next one. But what it does is it basically -- it's full disclosure, so that consumers can make their own decisions.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SNOW: Tracking the supply chains of these minerals is difficult because of the several steps in the chain, and that includes the mineral refining process that's done in Asia. Now one thing that has been done to help companies, the State Department and the U.N. have drawn up maps where the minerals are located, along with who controls those mines. Wolf?</p><p>BLITZER: Interesting story with lots of ramifications. Mary, thanks very much. Here's a question, do you think Social Security will be there for you? Jack Cafferty coming up with your e-mail.</p><p>And a small sailboat gets slammed by a very large whale. We're going to show you what happened after this most unusual collision. Stay with us, you're in \"The Situation Room.\"</p><p>BLITZER: Let's check in with Jack for \"The Cafferty File.\"</p><p>CAFFERTY: The question is, do you think Social Security's going to be there for you? A new poll, 60 percent of Americans don't think so.</p><p>Cy in Virginia writes, \"I'm 55. I think there will be some money for me in eight or 11 years. What I'm really depressed about is the reality that I and many more Americans will probably need to work until we die even with Social Security and hardly anybody wants to hire old people. We're more expensive to insure and younger managers sometimes feel threatened by people who are more experienced and just possibly smarter than they are.\"</p><p>Beverly in New York writes, \"Sadly, I don't believe Social Security will be around when I retire, no matter what the annual report I get says. I'm maxing out my 401K, contributing annually to my IRA and saving like a miser to ensure my retirement. I was born on the wrong end of the baby boom, 1963. I've already seen the retirement age for me go from 65 to 67. And it will probably go to 70 if the government doesn't get its act together.\"</p><p>Russ in Minnesota writes, \"I'm 32. I've paid into Social Security for 17 years already now. And I'm planning to never see a dime back. No politicians interested in fixing a problem for folks 30 years from now. What do they care? They won't be up for re-election in 2040 most likely.\"</p><p>Becky in Indiana writes, \"By the time I reach my retirement age of 69 in seven months, I'm sure there won't be any Social Security left for me and my husband, nor will we have any retirement at all because we have to live off our retirement while both being unemployed for 18 months out of the last 2.5 years. So now we'll become a burden to our children or work until my last breath.\"</p><p>Ron writes, also from Indiana, \"Bad news, Jack, the elite have stolen the gold from Ft. Knox, taken every dime from Social Security, stripped the equity from our homes and now they're coming after our retirement funds. I'm 44. I'll have to work till I'm 102 just so I won't starve to death.\"</p><p>And Ryan in Texas writes, \"I hope so but the fact is we have to plan like it won't be there because hope doesn't pay the bills.\"</p><p>If you want to read more on this, you'll find it on my blog at CNN.com/CaffertyFile.</p><p>BLITZER: Good question, Jack. We'll do it again tomorrow. Thanks very much.</p><p>All right, this just coming in to \"The Situation Room.\" I want to briefly update you on what we're learning. The Justice Department has now decided not to charge the former U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales in the controversial firings of those nine U.S. attorneys. Prosecutors say a 22-month investigation found insufficient evidence that the firings were politically motivated. The controversy, as you will recall, forced Alberto Gonzales to resign as the United States attorney general. His lawyer now says the findings are a vindication. They are long, long overdue. Good news for Alberto Gonzales, no charges against him.</p><p>Two sailors in South Africa got the shock of their lives when a huge whale suddenly soared out of the water and landed right on their small boat. CNN's Jeanne Moos reports on this most unusual encounter.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JEANNE MOOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Imagine you're out with your boyfriend for a sail.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The next thing I hear him say, oh, (BLEEP).</p><p>MOOS: When a whale about the size of your boat springs out of the ocean.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This massive creature just going up next to the boat and smashing against the mast.</p><p>MOOS: This is the before and this was the after, sailing school partners Paloma Warner (ph) and Ralph Mothis (ph) both lived to joke about the encounter, just outside Capetown Bay in South Africa.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We said we had a whale of a time.</p><p>MOOS: Even if it will cost at least 5,000 bucks to fix their 32- foot boat, the whale seemed fine afterwards, though he left some blubber on deck. Were you thinking \"Jaws\"?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No, not at all. I wasn't scared at all.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're going to need a bigger boat.</p><p>MOOS: All Paloma and Ralph need is a repaired mast. The photo of the counter was shot by a tourist in a nearby boat. They'd all been watching the whale repeatedly surfacing when suddenly it crashed the yacht. Now it's one thing if a flying carp flies into your boat.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, my --</p><p>MOOS: Or flies directly into you.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh!</p><p>MOOS: We've even seen killer whales force a penguin to jump on a boat to escape. But when it comes to the most persistent boat crasher, take a gander at this goose.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, my dog! Crazy goose, sucker won't leave her alone. Will you stop? Damn it, get. This sucker's crazy. Look at that crazy sucker.</p><p>MOOS: At least the whale didn't chase the sailboat. Actually, environmental officials are checking reports perhaps the sailboat was harassing the whale by being too close. Paloma says that just isn't so. They were sailing without a motor. The whale didn't hear them and simply surfaced. If he'd landed on the deck, rather than smacking the mast --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We would have been -- we would have been as flat as a pancake.</p><p>MOOS: Estimated weight of a right whale, 40 tons. All fins on deck.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It was amazing.</p><p>MOOS: Jeanne Moos, CNN.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It was actually awesome.</p><p>MOOS: New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BLITZER: Not only a most unusual story, that's a whale of a story.

In a speech[1] at a CodeNode Tech Event Centre called 'Taming the Tech Titans -- Levelling the Digital Playing Field' the Liberal Democrat leader called for strong regulations on the big tech giants and even compared them to the US oil companies that exploited their market power over a century ago.Cable called data \"the new oil\" and outlined the power Google, Facebook and Amazon have in collecting it in large volumes as an apparent \"free bounty\". \"Just as Standard Oil once cornered 85 per cent of the refined oil market, today Google drives 89 per cent of internet searches, 95 per cent of young adults on the internet use a Facebook product, Amazon accounts for 75 per cent of ebook sales, while Google and Apple combined provide 99 per cent of mobile operating systems,\" he said. \"The new internet giants mostly provide a 'free' service to the public, albeit paid for indirectly by the sale of advertising space and the bundling and sale to commercial clients of 'free' user data. </p><p>Whatever these companies do, they are not price 'gouging' since their headline price is always 'zero'. It is the forces underlying this apparently 'free' bounty that politicians must address.\" Speaking at the CodeNode centre to an audience of tech entrepreneurs, the Lib Dem leader highlighted concerns for small start-ups operating in the shadows of the tech giants. \"There are real concerns that while the tech giants may have begun as innovative upstarts, they have by virtue of their sheer size become a barrier rather than a boon to entrepreneurship,\" he said. \"By acquiring potential challengers before they become a real threat, spending millions lobbying governments to ensure their interests are protected, and tying in users through the sheer scale of features and interaction they offer, the tech giants' dominant position often leaves entrepreneurs feeling they have no choice but to sell up, or close up.\" Cable called on national governments and the EU to bring in strong regulations and called for Amazon, Google and Facebook to be broken apart from the data collecting services they provide. \"National government and, even more so, supranational bodies like the EU can and should look to break up enterprises where size is detrimental to the economic wellbeing of the country, its citizens and its capacity for innovation,\" he said. \"There is a case for splitting Amazon into three separate businesses; one offering cloud computing, one acting as a general retailer and one offering a third-party marketplace. Other examples would be Facebook being forced to divest itself of Instagram and WhatsApp as a condition for operating in the EU, creating two new social media networks. Divesting Google of YouTube would be another.\" Cables words resonated withDavid Emm, principal security researcher at Kaspersky Lab, who in a comment sent to IT Pro, noted:'Customers should value their data as much as the money in their wallets and purses, so I agree with Vince Cable's sentiment on this.\" \"It is important that we on an individual level know what information is being kept and how it's being handled - which will also reduce the likelihood of it falling into the wrong hands,\" he added.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">LOU DOBBS, CNN ANCHOR: Tonight, Palestinian gunmen take refuge in the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem.  The fighting with Israeli soldiers is intensifying.  Ariel Sharon wants to exile Yasser Arafat. Arab and European nations are calling upon Israel to withdraw. Senator George Mitchell is my guest.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">You're looking now at pictures of your tax dollars at work today in the Middle East.  People in several Arab nations today protested U.S. support of Israel.  Tonight, we'll have a special report on American financial aid to the Arab world, and what we're receiving in return for all that money.</p><p>Guess who's been throwing lots of money around in Washington, D.C. -- the accounting industry.  It spent millions of dollars on lobbying and political campaigns.  We'll tell you where all that money went, and why the accountants were spending so much of it.</p><p>And tonight, a former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission joins us to tell us why he's angry with the Justice Department's handling of the Andersen case.  Professor David Ruder is my guest tonight. And he'll tell us what can be done to save Andersen.</p><p>Good evening. Tonight, dozens of armed Palestinians are taking cover inside one of the holy sites in the Middle East, Bethlehem's Church of the Nativity.  Those gunmen forced their way inside the church following an intense battle with Israeli tanks and helicopter gunships.</p><p>Elsewhere, Israeli troops seized control of another West Bank town.  And Yasser Arafat remains pinned down inside his Ramallah office, without either electricity or running water.</p><p>For more on the escalating violence, I'm joined by Christiane Amanpour in Jerusalem -- Christiane.</p><p>CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Lou, well, first to the situation in Bethlehem, which appears to be ongoing.  It's not exactly clear what is going on inside that church.  There are people in there who have gone in seeking sanctuary.</p><p>We're being told by Palestinians that, yes, some of them do have arms.  And they were members, they say, of some of the security forces around Bethlehem.  We have not been able to get any comment from the Israelis because they say they are not commenting right now on an ongoing operation.</p><p>We're told by people inside that church that nuns inside are trying to care for some of the people who are wounded.  But we're told that there is no actual fighting in that church at the moment, although it is surrounded.  This, after a day in which the Palestinian town of Bethlehem was taken over by the Israelis.  They went in to try to root out more of these people on their wanted list.</p><p>We're told by Palestinians that some four Palestinians were shot and killed, apparently members of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, militants allied with Arafat's Fatah organization who are wanted by Israel.</p><p>At the same time in Ramallah, another day of military activity there.  Especially the incursion and the invasion into the preventive security headquarters.  There were some 400 people holed up there overnight.  Most of those, in a U.S. and European-brokered deal, have come out.</p><p>Arafat remains holed up inside his compound.  We haven't actually heard from him directly today.  But Ariel Sharon, prime minister of Israel, made that comment that if anybody wants to go to see him, in terms of international mediators, the only way they could do that was if they took him out and never brought him back.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ARIEL SHARON, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER: I suggested, and I told them, that if they would like, that we will bring him somewhere, or they will come with helicopter and will take him from here.  But first of all, I will say that three things.  One, I have first to bring it to the cabinet to be approved.  Second, he cannot take anyone with him because they are wanted and murderers surrounding him there.  And the third thing, is going to be one-way ticket.  Will not be able to return.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR: Well, of course, that notion was floated to the Israeli cabinet on Friday, ahead of the military invasion.  But the majority of the cabinet decided that exile was not a good idea at the moment, that isolation should be the strategy.  Of course, Palestinian officials saying that there's no way Yasser Arafat would leave voluntarily.</p><p>In an interview today with the Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat over in Jericho, where he is kept and prevented from coming out, we asked him, what next?  He said, one way out would be to try to implement the latest U.N. Resolution, calling for a cease-fire and a withdrawal, but also made an impassioned plea for American help.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SAEB ERAKAT, PALESTINIAN CABINET MEMBER: The shortest way now is to have a sense of direction.  And I would address myself to President Bush and to the members of the Security Council, who passed resolution 1402 just two days ago.</p><p>This resolution has all the ingredients that are required to de- escalate and to de-conflict.  One, the element of a cease-fire.  The Israeli withdrawal, the implementation of Tenet and Mitchell, and the political resumption of negotiations.  And this resolution mentions Zinni's name.</p><p>And I would say to President Bush, there are three American names that are mentioned in this Security Council resolutions: General Zinni, George Tenet, and George Mitchell.  We need to see some action by President Bush.  We need to see some sense of direction.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR: Now, there are more Israeli military incursions as this offensive and this operation widens.  The latest reports are that they are in and around the city of Jenin, the northern city in the West Bank.  And tanks are poised around a refugee camp there.  That camp is particularly on Israel's wanted list, if you like, because they say that a lot of the suicide bombers come from there.</p><p>Perhaps we're expecting, in the early hours of this morning, the Israeli tanks and troops to go in there and start doing the same kinds of operations that they've been doing in other towns on the West Bank -- Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Christiane, thank you very much.  Christiane Amanpour, reporting from Jerusalem.</p><p>Arabs across the Middle East have been protesting U.S. support of Israel.  And yet America continues to support those countries, financially.  Not just through purchases of oil, but with billions of dollars in direct aid.  Kitty Pilgrim reports now on what that tax money is buying.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KITTY PILGRIM, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): In Egypt, the streets are erupting with violent anti-American and anti-Israeli demonstrations.  American flags are burned.  Yet the United States is pouring $2 billion into Egypt in economic and military aid.  It is the second-largest recipient in the region, next to Israel, which gets some $3 billion a year.</p><p>In Jordan, a similar scene.  The United States sends $150 million in economic aid, $75 million in military assistance.  Even the Palestinian Authority gets some $75 million from the United States. What is all the money for?  The economies are in ruins, and peace is all but lost.</p><p>MICHAEL O'HANLON, THE BROOKINGS INSTITUTION: Part of why we give money to these countries is to help governments whose positions aren't that secure with their own people, because they either need to improve their economies or because politically they could be in something of a fragile position.</p><p>So the fact that there are demonstrations doesn't mean that the governments are ungrateful.  It means the governments face internal forces.</p><p>PILGRIM: U.S. policy strategists say it's money well spent.</p><p>JAMES PHILLIPS, THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION: The street demonstrations often are emotional reaction of a population that can't protest against its own government, so many times, it uses the U.S. or Israel as a scapegoat.  And the governments involved permit that because it's not aimed at them.</p><p>PILGRIM: And those strategists say strategic allies, no matter how unstable, need to be supported.  Economies must flourish for peace.</p><p>JUDITH BURNETT, PA CONSULTING: Their leadership has been as supportive as they can.  They live in a rough neighborhood.  And I believe that the kinds of demonstrations that we'll see could get worse if America doesn't go in and begin to help out, again, to become an honest broker.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PILGRIM: Which all comes back to the same conundrum.  U.S. aid is needed, but it's U.S. direct involvement in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that's being called for at the government level.  And ironically, that kind of involvement is being protested in the streets -- Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Kitty, thank you very much.</p><p>Well, the surge of violence in the Middle East has many wondering whether the peace process that began with the Oslo Agreement of 1993 is dead.  Before the siege of PLO leader Yasser Arafat's headquarters, hopes of reviving those talks lay in two U.S.-brokered plans.  One, masterminded by CIA director George Tenet, would have laid the groundwork for a cease-fire.  The other, by former Senate majority leader George Mitchell would have paved the way for a political settlement.</p><p>Senator Mitchell joins me now.  Senator, good to have you here.</p><p>SEN. GEORGE MITCHELL (D-AZ), FMR. MAJORITY LEADER: Thank you, Lou.  Good to be here.</p><p>DOBBS: This escalating violence -- is there any end in sight here?</p><p>MITCHELL: There's no end in sight right now.  But I believe it inevitable that the violence will come to an end if the parties will return to the negotiating table, primarily because life is unbearable for the members of both societies.  This has devastating effects on the economies and on the daily lives of Israelis and Palestinians alike.</p><p>DOBBS: Their economies, as Kitty Pilgrim just reported, are simply devastated.  Israel's economy in deep recession.  The Palestinians, with one of the lowest GDP per capitas in the world. Will the economic issues be faced by the western powers who want peace in this area, even if the participants don't?</p><p>MITCHELL: I think that will be the result of all of this.  The aid that was mentioned on the previous segment came out of the Camp David settlement.  Part of Camp David was that the United States would provide $3 billion a year to Israel and $2 billion a year to Egypt.</p><p>The aid to Jordan arises from the Jordan-Israel agreement.  So we proposed these agreements, we backed them up, and one way we do so is by providing assistance.  In effect, inducement to continue to live in peace.</p><p>DOBBS: An inducement that is certainly not being adequately embraced by either the Palestinians or the Israelis, at this point. What is going to be required here to, first, achieve a cease-fire, and hopefully move to the level of the Mitchell Plan?</p><p>MITCHELL: When I went over there a year ago, Lou, I thought the toughest issues would be the last ones: Jerusalem, the return of refugees, the land.  I now believe that the toughest issue is the first one: ending the violence and getting into the talks.</p><p>I think if they ever get to serious negotiations they will resolve those major issues, one way or another, as a result of tough bargaining and negotiation with U.S. participation.  But getting there is really proving to be very difficult.</p><p>DOBBS: The president is being criticized in many corners for not being sufficiently personally engaged in resolving this conflict.  Do you think that is fair criticism?</p><p>MITCHELL: I think there has been a growing level of participation by the president and by the secretary of state.  Not everything the president does is visible to the public.  He's on the phone quite a bit. The secretary of state's been very active.</p><p>And I think they recognize very well that this can't happen without active, aggressive, American leadership at the very highest level.  And I think you'll see that increase continue, in fact, ramp up in the next few weeks.</p><p>DOBBS: Part of the conundrum here is, if you will, the process itself.  The United States is perceived accurately by the Palestinians to be in support of Israel.  The United States is attempting to be an honest broker.</p><p>If there is that kind of (UNINTELLIGIBLE), is there the possibility that the United States should withdraw as the honest broker and simply encourage the United Nations to take the leadership? Because what the United States -- not only this president, but every president before him -- has failed to do, in bringing peace to the region?</p><p>MITCHELL: I don't think that's the appropriate course of action. I don't think it will happen unless there is active American leadership as a broker at the talks.  I don't think the Europeans can do it, nor do I think they want to do it alone.  And I certainly think the U.N. can't do it.  And I don't think -- they know they can't do it alone.  It takes American leadership.</p><p>I've met with Arafat many times and we've discussed that question.  He said to me, look, I want the Europeans involved.  I want the U.N., but not to replace the Americans.  We regard the Americans as essential, as indeed, the United States role is.</p><p>DOBBS: But Arafat is regarded by Sharon, as you know, as an enemy. What do you think of the prime minister's view that he should be exiled?</p><p>MITCHELL: Almost every Israeli I've met wishes that someone other than Arafat was leader of the Palestinians.  Almost every Palestinian I've met wishes that someone other than Sharon were the leader of the Israelis.  But they were elected by their peoples.</p><p>And as long as they are in office, chosen by their people, it is they with whom we must deal.  That's the position the U.S. government expressed as recently as today by the secretary of state, and I think it's the correct position.</p><p>DOBBS: And the president has exempted, if you will, Arafat from classification as a terrorist, because of his representation in those peace talks.  We're getting to the level of some considerable niceties, in terms of language of the policy on terrorism, and particularly in terms of the Middle East.</p><p>Arafat has denounced terrorism.  Sharon, the president of the United States, have asked him to denounce it again.  It is clear, I would think it is clear by now, that he cannot control Hezbollah, Hamas and other terrorist groups.</p><p>So what is the efficacy of having him further denounce terrorism? Because, apparently the interest of all parties is to end terrorism, period.</p><p>MITCHELL: Our committee's report recommended a 100 percent effort by Arafat to control terrorist activities.  That language was proposed to us by the Israeli government.</p><p>DOBBS: Right.</p><p>MITCHELL: They said to us, we know he doesn't have complete control, but we need a complete effort.  I think that's the reality. He plainly does not have complete control over all elements in a society.  He just as plainly has not made the full effort within the authority that he does have.</p><p>Lou, this whole question, who's a terrorist, who do you talk to, who you don't talk to, that's as old as conflict.  We went through the same thing in Northern Ireland.  The same arguments were used in South Africa.</p><p>Remember, Margaret Thatcher said that Nelson Mandela was unfit to enter the United Kingdom because he was a terrorist.  How many people in this country today think Mandela is a terrorist?  I don't equate Mandela with Arafat.  What I'm saying is that issue, how you deal with those who use violence, is as old as conflict and conflict resolution itself.</p><p>DOBBS: What I was talking about, though, Senator, is not necessarily in terms of identifying Arafat as a terrorist, because those, as you know, have significant, emotionally-laden values.</p><p>MITCHELL: Yes.</p><p>DOBBS: What I'm talking about is if Arafat cannot control the terrorism that is being conducted against the state of Israel, what is required to end that terrorism?  Because it is not Arafat, and he represents the Palestinians.</p><p>MITCHELL: Well, he can't control it all.  But he can make a much greater effort than he has, and can significantly reduce it, I believe. And that, to me, is the key.</p><p>No society in human history, including our own, has been able, ever to attain the complete absence of violence.  And that won't happen in that region.  But he has to make the kind of effort that he has not yet made in bringing it down as much as possible.  And then I think you could see some progress.</p><p>Now, what his fear is -- the only leverage they think they have is this violence.  And if they give it up, and then nothing else happens, the violence would be resumed and they'll be criticized.  The corresponding Israeli fear is that, look, if we make concessions, next week we'll get six more suicide bombers in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. You've got to bridge that gap.</p><p>You have to have a reduction in violence.  And you have to have a follow-on process.  That's the real challenge.</p><p>DOBBS: And, how to achieve it?</p><p>MITCHELL: Well, I think patience, perseverance and stick-to- itiveness.  I think what we must do is to expunge the world failure from our vocabulary in making peace.  It's tough work, and you get nine steps back before you take a step forward.  But you can't get discouraged.  And particularly the United States and its leaders, who are indispensable to this process, have to just stick to it.</p><p>In Northern Ireland we negotiated for two years.  For almost every day until the very last day, people said we'd fail because we didn't have an agreement.  So you could say we had 700 days of failure and one day of success.  And you've got to look at it the same way in the Middle East.  You just got to keep at it.  The president will be more involved, the secretary of state, and you've got to stick to it.</p><p>And I believe the people themselves there will come to recognize history, geography, and destiny have led them to inhabit the same space. They're going to live side by side, either in violence or in peace.  And I think they're going to get sick of the violence and recognize that political compromise is far superior to what they're going through now.</p><p>DOBBS: Senator George Mitchell, thanks for being here.</p><p>MITCHELL: Thank you, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Oil prices today surged, rising for the fifth straight session as a result of the violence in the Middle East.  And Iraq's call for an oil embargo, lifting prices to a new six-month high, in fact.  Iraq even called on its longtime enemy, Iran, for action.  The Middle East accounts for 2/3 the world's oil.  And prices jumped 83 cents today, to $27.71 a barrel.</p><p>Coming up, the major markets drop, worries about the Middle East and technology.  Vince Farrell will be my guest on the markets.</p><p>An appellate court says no problem, media companies should be able to buy as many television stations in any city as they want.  Who says there's a concentration of media ownership?</p><p>And judging the SEC and the Department of Justice.  Former SEC chairman David Ruder will be here to tell us what he thinks about the way the Department of Justice has handled the Andersen case.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS: Andersen and KPMG today called off their talks for a global merger of operations outside this country.  That deal fell apart because of the growing number of defections by Andersen units to other firms. The latest to split ranks, the operation in Spain.  The Andersen partners there deciding to merge with Deloitte &amp; Touche.</p><p>KPMG talks failed, just as leaders of Andersen worldwide were meeting in London to choose a replacement for departed CEO, Joseph Berardino.  That meeting is expected to continue tomorrow.  Berardino resigned last week following the Justice Department's indictment of Andersen and the growing exodus of clients.</p><p>As I've noted on this broadcast several times, Andersen was indicted by the Justice Department despite turning itself in for the act of shredding documents in the Enron case.  As Steve Young now reports, that indictment could well put a chill on future corporate confessions.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE YOUNG, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Some lawyers looking at the implosion of Andersen after it reported shredding documents say Andersen's indictment is sure to chill corporate self- reporting.</p><p>STEPHEN AKINN, AKINN, VELTROP: In certain circumstances, I believe that companies will be more reluctant to self-report in the future, because they will be concerned that they will be treated the way Andersen was treated here.</p><p>YOUNG: Some white-collar defense lawyers think Andersen may have reported shredding somewhat late in the game, but even they were stunned that a grand jury indicted the company without naming a single individual.</p><p>FRANKLIN VELIE, SALANS: Back in the '70s when I was a prosecutor, it was pretty much unheard of to indict corporations.  The mantra, if you will, was people commit crimes, not corporations.</p><p>YOUNG: The indictment of companies instead of individuals started in the 1980s.  Showing how rare it is, a Justice Department spokesman today could only cite one case from the 1990s.  Without naming individuals, the DOJ went after a big hospital company formerly named Columbia/HCA.  It accused it of committing massive Medicaid fraud.</p><p>The hope of cutting a better deal is the reason companies self- report wrongdoing to the government.  Sanford Litvack, who used to be a top Disney executive, and before that, assistant attorney general for antitrust, says the Andersen experience provides a warning for corporate lawyers.</p><p>SANFORD LITVACK, DEWEY BALLENTINE: Well, you don't report unless and until you know all the facts yourself, No. 1.  And No. 2, when you do go, make sure you're in a position to be able to negotiate the outcome.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>YOUNG: The Andersen case goes to trial in May. The corporate crime reporter newsletter says just under half of a small sample of white-collar defense lawyers say the big five accounting firm will be found guilty.  That's low, since 90 percent of federal cases in which there are indictments end in convictions.</p><p>And of those who predicted a conviction, one of the lawyers said the indictment's unfair.  Another called it a terrible exercise of prosecutorial discretion -- Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Steve, thank you very much.  Was that one firm that was criminally charged as a firm?</p><p>YOUNG: One firm, as far as the Justice Department could tell us today.</p><p>DOBBS: Was that one firm an accounting firm, by any chance?</p><p>YOUNG: No, it was not.</p><p>DOBBS: Steve, thank you very much.  Steve Young.</p><p>Over the past few months, we've reported here the millions of dollars in soft money contributions given by Enron to political parties and members of Congress, and Andersen, as well -- a lot of money.  But if you think Enron and Andersen spent a lot of money lobbying Congress, just wait until you see how much the accounting industry overall spent during the last election cycle.  Tim O'Brien has the story from Washington.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TIM O'BRIEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): When Arthur Levitt, former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, crusaded to stop accounting firms from providing both auditing and consulting services to the same client, the accounting profession showered campaign contributions on members of Congress.  Some of them later threatened to trim Levitt's budget if he persisted.</p><p>The big five accounting firms and their trade association contributed nearly $40 million to both Democrats and Republicans over the last 12 years, more than $5 million of that from Andersen alone. The industry has spent millions more on lobbying, more than $12 million in 2000.  Critics say the money talks.</p><p>BEN BYCEL, COMMON CAUSE: You're not giving that money to get tickets to sit up in the Senate gallery.  You're not giving that money to get another pass to the national forest.  You're giving that money to buy access and to buy influence, and to persuade legislators that in fact, they should vote your way.  And money talks.</p><p>O'BRIEN: But to the accounting profession and many others, it's the American way.</p><p>JOHN HUNNICUTT, AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF CPA'S: When you're trying to get your point across and you're trying to enlist support in the activity of your members, and, you know, you want to be a player and you want to be a participant in the electoral process, which is a Constitutional right, sure, it gets to be expensive.</p><p>O'BRIEN: The accounting profession supported the election of George W. Bush to the tune of almost $650,000.  A few months later, Bush nominated industry lawyer Harvey Pitt to head the SEC, succeeding Arthur Levitt and all but ensuring the big five firms would be allowed to continue to both audit and counsel their clients.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>And then there was Enron, reviving the call for reform.  There are those who believe that allowing accounting firms the dual role of consulting and auditing, although a huge victory for the profession, may have led to the downfall of Andersen, which had be one of the professions' premiere members -- Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Tim, thank you very much.  Tim O'Brien.</p><p>The Justice Department's swift action against Andersen, indicting Andersen as a firm, may very well have already killed Andersen.  My guest tonight says it should never have come to that.  The Securities and Exchange Commission, and not the Department of Justice, should have handled, he says, the Andersen case all along.</p><p>And he knows a thing or two about the workings of the SEC. Professor David Ruder was head of the SEC in the late '80s.  He joins us tonight from Pensacola, Florida.</p><p>Professor, good to have you here.</p><p>DAVID RUDER, NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY: Good evening, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: First, the issue of indictment.  As Steve Young just reported, the Justice Department can cite only one example in the 1990s of indicting a firm.  What is your reaction to this indictment of Andersen, as a firm?</p><p>RUDER: Well, I think it was both premature and unnecessary.  I think they should have consulted with the SEC, which I'm sure they didn't.  I'm not speaking for the SEC, and I can't.  But it's clear that they did not have the cooperation from the SEC in making that judgment, and didn't particularly care about it.  And I think that was wrong.</p><p>DOBBS: Why would they not care about it?</p><p>RUDER: I have no idea.  I agree that there have not been indictments of corporations as corporations, and particularly not of companies in which their integrity and reputations are crucial.  This idea of going after Andersen with a blunderbuss, which they knew would cause Andersen tremendous troubles, to me was completely unjustified.</p><p>DOBBS: And we should point out, when I say \"Professor,\" I'm saying \"professor of law,\" David Ruder, professor of law at Northwestern University.  Professor, the -- if the Justice Department has moved here, does it have the latitude now?  Most of the damage is already done. There will be thousands of layoffs.</p><p>Andersen, as a firm, is really nothing compared to what it was. Only a shadow could possibly remain, no matter what happens.  But could the Justice Department waive or lift this criminal indictment?</p><p>RUDER: They could, and I think they should.  Andersen came forward in a cooperative way, because the SEC encourages that kind of operation.  And what happened was that they came forward, and were challenged by the Justice Department in ways they hadn't expected.</p><p>I think now the thing for the Justice Department to do is to lift the indictment, cooperate with Andersen and the SEC to get the kind of arrangement that will allow Andersen to continue in business. Andersen is extremely important, as the fifth of the big five accounting firms.  And we need enough accounting firms to have all the big companies audited.</p><p>DOBBS: There some considerable irony, Professor, I just wonder what you think of it.  I mean, the idea that Microsoft is found guilty of being a monopoly by a Justice Department, charged with the responsibility of avoiding concentration of industry.  And at the same time in this instance, it's creating concentration of industry, in the case of the professional services firms.  What do you make of that?</p><p>RUDER: I think that the Justice Department should not be trying to regulate the accounting industry.  That's the SEC's job.  They must have had a litigation strategy that probably concentrated on Enron. But I think they could have gotten all of the cooperation from Andersen they could have possibly wanted by coming into an arrangement which would put Andersen on probation, or do something that wouldn't have forced them out of business.</p><p>DOBBS: What would you recommend here?  You were chairman of the SEC, as the Justice Department and the SEC went after Drexel, Burnham, Lambert and Michael Milken.  The Justice Department intricately involved there.  Why would there not be that kind of cooperation here?</p><p>RUDER: I don't know why.  And I'd like to say that your lead-in about Harvey Pitt in your story here was wrong, in my opinion.  Harvey Pitt is an aggressive, great person who will be a tremendous leader at the SEC.  And I think what should happen is the Justice Department should seek out the SEC, and find some way to regulate with the SEC the accounting profession, and Arthur Andersen.  But the Justice Department ought to take a secondary role in this rather than being -- attempting to be the leader.  They simply don't know how the securities industry works, and how the accounting industry works.</p><p>DOBBS: Are you saying you don't believe that the Department of Justice understood that when it indicted Andersen as a firm, that the immediate effect would be to destroy thousands of jobs, cost Enron shareholders hundreds of millions of dollars in money that could have gone to them had that money been available through Andersen, that they simply did not understand the effect of what that indictment would do?</p><p>RUDER: No, I'm not saying that.  I think they probably did understand it and were foolish in proceeding anyway.  But what they didn't understand is the intricacy of the way this profession is regulated by the SEC.  I was particularly stunned when they said they thought it was their job to indict Andersen because they were disappointed about what they'd done in connection with the waste management matter.  That's an SEC problem.  SEC brought the action, achieved an injunction.  And it was the SEC to decide what further penalty it might impose upon Andersen not the Justice Department.</p><p>DOBBS: An excellent point.  And I -- when you say you disagreed with the report by Tim O'Brien on Harvey Pitt, the chairman of the SEC, let's be specific.  What did you disagree about?</p><p>RUDER: Well, the comment was that by George W. Bush appointing Harvey Pitt as chairman, they would somehow guarantee that the accounting profession would be treated in a -- in a liberal or soft manner.  Harvey's not that kind of person.  If he thinks regulation is necessary, he will go forward.  And I think that's unfair to make that kind of connection.</p><p>DOBBS: I would agree with you if that was the inference from what Tim O'Brien said and we certainly would not, in any way, intend that. Harvey Pitt is an outstanding individual, as knowledgeable a person about the SEC and the accounting industry as anyone.</p><p>Let me turn to the issue of what can happen here.  What should Harvey Pitt, at the SEC, who must work with the Justice Department day in and day out, who has been remarkably quiet here, what should he do?</p><p>RUDER: Well, Harvey is in some problem because of his -- of the claims that he should recluse himself from these matters, but I don't think he should.  I think that he can go to the Justice Department, and do it with Steve Cutler, his enforcement chief, and say, let's cooperate to create an environment in which we can force Andersen to put them on probation, to do the many, many things that Andersen itself has already suggested it will do, and achieve a compliance environment, which will allow the industry to continue to fulfill its role in auditing the financial statements throughout the United States.</p><p>DOBBS: And prosecute aggressively the individuals responsible for criminal acts.</p><p>RUDER: Oh, I -- there's no doubt about the fact that those individuals who were involved -- here, I'm not talking about the shredding.  I do think that's a Justice Department question.  I'm talking about the question of whether there was anyone within Andersen who was engaged in knowingly bad accounting.  We don't know that yet, Lou.  We don't have that information.  All we have is a -- I may say a lot of media speculation.</p><p>DOBBS: OK, and one Justice Department indictment.  Thank you very much.

A hundred and twenty-two NYSE stocks today, new 52-week highs.  Nineteen hitting new lows today.</p><p>DOBBS: About 10 to one.</p><p>ROMANS: About 10 to one.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS: Christine, I'm trying to figure that out.  Christine, thanks.</p><p>ROMANS: Sure.</p><p>DOBBS: Even with today's sell-off, Vince Farrell says these markets remain overvalued.  As for the economy, he says we did have a recession and we are recovering.  And he's here now to tell us why he says that.</p><p>Good to have you here, Vince.</p><p>VINCE FARRELL, VICTORY SBSE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT: Thanks, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: You still think we're too overvalued?</p><p>FARRELL: Well, we're at the high end of a normal valuation band. Depending on who you talk to, the markets trading at 22 or 23 times earnings this year.  Oh, the 5.4 percent 10-year government bond, that's just a little too rich.  It doesn't mean there aren't stocks to be bought but the market by itself is a little too overvalued.  So bad news like you got today from the analyst estimate cuts are going to have a severe reaction on stocks.</p><p>DOBBS: I just realized what I had said to you, too overvalued. That's a little bit like over exaggerating, isn't it?  It's a\u2026</p><p>FARRELL: But you're the anchor, Lou.  You're allowed.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DOBBS: No, I'm not allowed.  I'm just chastising myself and apologizing for using.  But with these high evaluations, after what we have seen this decimation in the market, what in the world is going on?</p><p>FARRELL: Well, you had stocks that got grotesquely overvalued and then they started down and we thought just because they're down they must be OK.  But the fact is you still have to value stocks.  The present value of the future steam of earnings under our cash flow and we're not having the earnings or cash flow.  And we're going to have a very begrudging recovery because we're -- we have intense global competition, a lot of excess capacities, so earnings are going to be hard to come by.</p><p>DOBBS: Hard to come by earnings.  We have serious overvaluation. So what should investor do here?</p><p>FARRELL: Well, I don't say we have serious overvaluation.  I say we have the high end of normal valuation.  I think investors, if they have cash, if God all of a sudden came in and said, \"Here's a bunch of cash,\" and it's -- in their minds, they want to have a long-term investment profile in the equity market, a little bit now, a little bit a quarter from now, a little bit six months from now, and you'll catch the average.</p><p>But right now, I think we're going to be locked in a trading range that has already been defined for us.  Nine sixty-six was the September low, then, we bounced up -- this is on the S&amp;P -- to 1170 whatever.  And I think until we get some clarity as to what the earnings are going that will be the band that we trade within.  And I think, right now, we're going to get back down towards the mid to lower end of that band.</p><p>DOBBS: We're watching this market just slowly, slowly start to recede again, retreat, if you will.  There doesn't seem to be anything there to drive this market.  Have you identified anything that would reverse course here from the pressure this market seems to be under?</p><p>FARRELL: If you wanted to be an optimist and you said the price of oil all of a sudden came down quickly, that might reverse the course.  If interest rates stabilized, came down a little bit, that could do it.  But I don't think either of those are going to happen.</p><p>While I think the price of oil is ahead of itself, I don't think it's going to come down a lot because the Mid East tension is not going to go away.</p><p>If there's any recovery at all, it doesn't make sense to me that interest rates are going to go down.  I don't know that they're going to go up a lot.  So what you have to -- unfortunately, in my opinion, you have to give this a couple of quarters where the recovery takes hold and we are at a recovery, but remember the decline wasn't so steep economically that we have to have this huge rebound.  So you're going to have to have a couple of quarters where earnings slowly come at you.</p><p>DOBBS: A lot of people not long ago, at the beginning of this year saying jump in now because this is your opportunity, and away we go. Many of those same people now are saying, be cautious.  Which do you -- which view do you ascribe to?</p><p>FARRELL: I've always been cautious because I\u2026</p><p>DOBBS: Right.</p><p>FARRELL: \u2026 I've kind of -- my first real impact in the market was in the early 70s when you got decimated.  I never forgot that.</p><p>DOBBS: Does this seem like familiar territory?</p><p>FARRELL: No, not at all. I just think that you have to be very careful and buy stocks selectively.  I think you'll make money this year.  I think we'll be up but not a lot.</p><p>DOBBS: Vince Farrell, always good to have you here.</p><p>FARRELL: Thanks, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Thank you.</p><p>Still ahead, a court victory for the big media companies.  We'll tell you what it could mean for your television viewing choices in your city. Also, America's most endangered rivers.  We'll tell you which ones are most at risk and why and what it means, possibly, for our economy.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS: A major victory today for the nation's major media companies.  An appellate court ordered the FCC to review the rule that limits owners to only two television stations per market, but more stations for the owners could mean fewer choices for you.  Peter Viles has the report.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PETER VILES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): For the second time this year, a federal appeals court sided with big media and pressured the FCC to relax TV station ownership limits.</p><p>GENE KIMMELMAN, CO-DIR, CONSUMERS UNION: We could have one or two companies dominating what news, what information, what culturally relevant material is debated on television in every local community in this country.  Now, that's not the way democracy is supposed to work.</p><p>VILES: This time the issue was how many stations a single company can own in a city.  Current rules allow two TV stations, provided they are not both in the top four in the market, and that there are still eight independent TV owners or voices in the market. The key legal issue, how to count the voices in a market.  The FCC counts only broadcast TV stations, reasoning that TV is special, more immediate than newspapers, with public service obligations, and used by more people as a primary source of news.  Baloney, said TV station owner, Sinclair Broadcast, which argued if you're going to count voices, you should count them all, the newspapers, the cable systems, the radio stations, and the TV stations.</p><p>MARK HYMAN, SINCLAIR BROADCASTING: We don't see the support, it appears, that owning two stations in the same market is anti- competitive or as monopolistic as the FCC has asserted in the past.</p><p>VILES: The same appeals court had earlier ruled the FCC's 35 percent cap on national TV household reach is -- quote -- \"arbitrary and capricious\" and has thrown out the rule barring a cable system from owning a TV station in the same market.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>(on camera): The duopoly rule now goes back to the FCC where new chairman, Michael Powell, has yet to put his stamp of communications policy.  But he is widely seen as favoring some sort of relaxation in ownership limits -- Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, there's going to be a lot of cheering in media mogul land, but this is a remarkable decision.  Those -- what's going to be the effect?  How soon could we see a change?</p><p>VILES: Well, we have to see how the FCC responds.  Do they challenge in court, which is unlikely on this one.  How do they rewrite the law?  How much they loosen here?  And I think the real response is going to have to come from Congress.  The courts are weighing in.  The FCC is weighing in.  If the American people, through the Congress, want something different, they can't expect it to happen through the courts.  So perhaps Congress could speak out on this.</p><p>DOBBS: As it has wanted to do on occasion.</p><p>VILES: Yeah, it hasn't in a while in this issue.  It has been six years now.  A lot of consolidation in the past six years.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, a lot good came with the last way in here, the 1996 Telecommunications Act so that we can have some more interesting time to look forward.</p><p>Pete, thanks.  Peter Viles.</p><p>Well, still ahead here, opposing views inside Israel about what should happen to Yasser Arafat.  That's \"In Their Words\" tonight. Also, the most endangered rivers in this country, the never-ending conflict between nature and commerce, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS: Rivers from Alaska to Florida are named on this year's Most Endangered Rivers Report.  Environmental group, American Rivers, blames dams and development for the damage.  The Missouri River tops this year's list of Endangered Rivers.</p><p>The group claims that the Army Corps of Engineers -- quote -- \"drained the life out of it\" through government operated dams.  Army Corps officials countered that charge, saying they work hard to balance competing interests all along that river.</p><p>The Big Sunflower in Mississippi follows as number two.  And rounding out the top five, the Klamath River in Oregon, the Kansas River and Arkansas's White River.</p><p>The new \"CROSSFIRE\" begins in just a few minutes.  Tucker Carlson and Paul Begala join us now from Washington to tell us what we can expect tonight and I suspect some fireworks -- gentlemen.</p><p>TUCKER CARLSON, \"CROSSFIRE\": You can, Lou.  The Middle East is ablaze, but it hasn't prevented Democrats from turning this tragedy into a political opportunity, claiming that George W. Bush is somehow behind the car bombings, his inaction has caused the blood bloodshed in the Middle East.  You're embarrassed of that view, I bet.</p><p>PAUL BEGALA, \"CROSSFIRE\": Well, in fact, Lou, I'm embarrassed at how incoherent our president's foreign policy has been.  I mean it's been very strong in certain -- in Afghanistan, and I applaud that.  In the Middle East, on the very same day, on Saturday, he simultaneously opposed Sharon's incursion into the West Bank and endorsed it.  Now that's a neat thing.  I know he's got a very complex mind\u2026</p><p>CARLSON: And if that were true -- if that were true, that would -- that actually would be a problematic stance.</p><p>BEGALA: At the United Nations\u2026</p><p>CARLSON: You know what, Paul?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: \u2026 at the United Nations, he instructed our ambassador to support a U.N. resolution, criticizing the incursion while he stood up in Crawford, Texas and he's chopping wood.</p><p>DOBBS: Gentlemen, what's it going to take for both of you to get over your embarrassment at your prospective positions on this?</p><p>CARLSON: You know I don't know, Lou.  I think -- and I'll tell you exactly what it's going to take, it's going to take Pat Buchanan and Ralph Nader, who are joining us for the second part of the show. Two men who know what they believe.</p><p>DOBBS: Carl Tucker\u2026</p><p>BEGALA: And a man who can wear a bow tie like that in public is not going to be embarrassed about anything.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CARLSON: Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS: Paul, I thought there would never be anything I agree with you about.  And Tucker, I'm just kidding.</p><p>Paul, Tucker, we're looking forward to it.  Thank you very much.</p><p>Coming up next, your e-mails. Also \"In Their Words,\" comments from some of the people making news today. Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS: Enron, Andersen, and the Justice Department continue to dominate our mail.  Amy Harr writes in to say -- \"Like the vast majority of Andersen employees, I was in no way involved with Enron. It saddens me that the misdeeds of the few have such a detrimental impact on the jobs and livelihoods of so many.\"</p><p>Ann Carlson, an Andersen employee in Illinois writes in to say, \"Lou, I'm sure I'm going to lose my job this week. I never worked on the Enron account.  I am flabbergasted that I, along with thousands of other Andersen folks, am going to lost my job due to the actions of the few.\"</p><p>And from Tracy McCallister, \"I lost a lot of money through my Enron stock, but I don't blame Andersen for Enron's bad business practices. The Justice Department has let Lay and Skilling not only walk away from this untouched, but let them walk with 100's of millions of the other people's money.  The fact that Lou Dobbs has come out and said, 'Wait a minute, where are the Enron indictments?' makes me proud to be a watcher of CNN.\"</p><p>And finally, with oil prices rising again, Gordon Jantzi in Mexico writes in to say, \"Americans need to quit complaining about the price of a gallon of gasoline.\" He says, \"They're double here and go up the first of every month.\" Gordon says, \"Wages are about 1/20th of that of the United States.\" And he says, \"I'm sure cars here on average get only half the gas mileage as most aver over 20 years old.\"</p><p>Quite complaining. We love hearing from you. E-mail us at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:MONEYLINE@CNN.com\">MONEYLINE@CNN.com</email>. Please include your name and address.  </p><p>Mid East violence, global warming, sleepless nights.  We have it all tonight, \"In Their Words.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, FORMER ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER: Well, frankly, I wouldn't have isolated him there.  I would have taken him -- put him on the Korean Aid ship, the terror ship that he got from his friends in Iran and put him on the high seas and let him go to his friends in Iran or his friends in Baghdad.  I would have not have holed him up and give him an unbelievable, an unbelievable stage.</p><p>YOSSI BEILIN, ISRAELI LABOUR PARTY: In my view, this is sheer stupidity.  This is not the national interest of Israeli, to kill Arafat or to deport him.  Arafat is the leader of the Palestinian people and as such, he is the one who signed with us the Oslo Agreements and he is the one who we signed with us or with another Israeli government in agreement, which will be the permanent agreement between Palestinians and Israelis.  There is no other Palestinian.</p><p>DR. RUSSELL ROSENBERG, NATIONAL SLEEP FOUNDATION: The poll shows that people are more irritable, and more frustrated, in traffic, per se.  And, yes, there may be an increase in road rage associated with the decrease in sleep and the increase in sleepiness associated with chronic sleep deprivation, so tempers are flaring on the roads primarily, as a result of not getting enough sleep.</p><p>BEN COHEN, CO-FOUNDER, BEN &amp; JERRY'S: The whole world is feeling the effects of global warming.  Now, it's time for Washington to feel a different kind of heat, the heat from the true majority of citizens who demand that our government work to reverse global warming now. Take it from a couple of old ice cream guys, if it's melted, it's ruined.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DOBBS: That's MONEYLINE for this Tuesday evening. Thanks for being with us. I'm Lou Dobbs.

I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's Monday, July 6. Your top stories at 7:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Coronavirus cases rising at an alarming rate. The World Health Organization saying cases hit an all-time high topping 200,000 in just 24 hours. This as scientists warn of possible airborne spread of the virus.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Futures are looking to kick off the week with another rally. 366-point gain on the Dow futures, this after a major rally in Asia particularly in Shanghai. U.S. Markets posting strong gains last week with the Nasdaq closing out the week at another all-time high.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The 2020 race getting a bit more crowded, Kanye West announcing he is running for president. Getting support from some big names, but it might be too late for a serious run.</p><p>And natural gas pipeline goes dry, Duke Energy and Dominion Energy canceling the Atlantic pipeline. Meanwhile Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is buying Dominion's natural gas assets.</p><p>Uber delivering on a big deal. The company reportedly agreeing to buy Postmates for $2.65 billion.</p><p>And some major sports teams considering changing their name as pressure builds from some owners and big corporations.</p><p>MORNINGS WITH MARIA is live right now.</p><p>Checking global market action. In Europe it is green across the board. We have gains of close to 2 percent in England, France and Germany. Speaking of France, the Louvre in Paris reopening today. And pubs in the United Kingdom welcoming people back over the weekend.</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets having a strong rally. The Shanghai was up almost 6 percent. China's state-run media saying that the country needs a bull market to build strength as its capital markets are undergoing reforms to attract money from home and abroad.</p><p>Joining the conversation all morning long: Allie McCartney, John Lonski and Lee Carter. We will see you shortly.</p><p>Meantime, the 4th of July weekend was marked by violence in major U.S. cities.</p><p>Cheryl Casone has the details along with other top stories we're watching this morning -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: That's right -- Dagen. Good morning again.</p><p>To Chicago alone at least 77 people shot there, 14 of them killed including a seven-year-old girl. Now, the President is offering federal help tweeting Sunday, \"Chicago and New York City crime numbers are way up. 67 people shot in Chicago, 13 killed. Shootings up significantly in NYC where people are demanding that @NYGovCuomo and @NYCMayor act now. Federal government ready, willing and able to help if asked.\"</p><p>Police in New York City reporting at least 42 people were shot over the weekend, at least nine were killed. The majority of those shootings happened within a five-hour period.</p><p>And New York City is seeing a major spike in crime from this time last year. So is Chicago and Atlanta where the mayor there is telling protesters to clear out near the Wendy's where Rayshard Brooks was killed after an eight-year-old girl was shot and killed at the same location over the weekend.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAYOR KESHIA LANCE BOTTOMS (D), ATLANTA: You shot and killed a baby. You can't blame this on the police officer. You can't say that we -- this is about criminal justice reform.</p><p>This is about some people carrying some weapons who shot up a car with an eight-year-old baby in the car.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: Of course, that's Atlanta's mayor. Secoriea Turner died Saturday after two men opened fire on her mother's car while she was inside. Police say her mother was trying to enter a parking lot where protesters illegally set up barricades.</p><p>Well, more destruction over the weekend of historical monuments. A statue of abolitionist and former slave Frederick Douglass was torn down in Rochester, New York. The tear down on the anniversary of a famous speech that Douglass gave back in 1852 which referred to July 4th at the time as a sham holiday in a nation that oppresses and enslaves its black citizens. The monument is going to be repaired</p><p>And protesters tore down Christopher Columbus statues in Baltimore and Waterbury, Connecticut. The statue in Baltimore was thrown into the city's inner harbor. The head of the Columbus statue in Connecticut is still missing.</p><p>Well, Kanye West is running for president. In a tweet over the weekend he wrote \"we must now realize the promise of America by trusting god, unifying our vision and building our future. I'm running for president of the United States, #2020Vision.\"</p><p>Well, Mark Cuban tweeted his support saying, quote, \"If there was Rank Choice voting available then Kanye West is on the ballot with Joe Biden and Donald Trump. I would have Kanye West ahead of Donald Trump.\" Elon Musk tweeted, \"You have my full support.\"</p><p>And there you have it -- Dagen. Those are your headlines from the newsroom. Back over to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you so much -- Cheryl.</p><p>It's time for \"Word on Wall Street\". Joining me now Leventhal Global Advisers president Dominick Tavella, Mayflowers Advisers LLC, managing partner Larry Glazer and IHT Wealth Management president Steve Dudash.</p><p>Hey Steve -- did I mispronounce your name? Let me get it straight. How do you --</p><p>STEVE DUDASH, PRESIDENT, IHT WEALTH MANAGEMENT: Yes, Dudash. Close enough.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you. I appreciate that. First, up, let's get going. Warren Buffett's major energy deal, Berkshire Hathaway closing a deal worth $10 billion to buy Dominion Energy's, natural gas transmission and store assets because I've heard dominion announced that it's canceling the Atlantic Coast Pipeline project with Duke Energy as the $8 billion project has faced regulatory scrutiny.</p><p>Larry to you first. Go.</p><p>LARRY GLAZER, MAYFLOWER ADVISORS, LLC: You know, Dagen, this weekend's big Buffett buy is classic Buffett. Its value in the value sector which has dramatically underperformed the market. It's big. It is $10 billion of a deal where desperate needs to put that cash to work. But it's also about competitive advantage.</p><p>It's a sector he knows a lot about. It's a deal that's not available to the average day trader at home who is looking for opportunities. And I contrast that with the market as a whole. This has been the opposite of a Buffett market. This has been a market led by growth, led by the airlines that he sold not the banks that he held.</p><p>So I think this is an opportunity here for investors to broaden out the rally, find other opportunities. Dagen, value investing is as American on Independence Day as apple pie and cookouts. It's nice to see it coming back, and it's nice to see Buffett sticking to his discipline as the market climbs the wall of worry and money gets put to work here.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Steve -- do you agree with Larry?</p><p>DUDISH: I don't -- on this one, think Duke needed to get out of this deal. They couldn't get this thing done in the last 14 years in that environment.</p><p>In the current environment, they had some major head winds. And for them to walk away from that pipeline now makes a lot of sense. Quit wasting money on it.</p><p>It's a nice conservative play, a company like Duke, if you just want something stable with a little dividend and want to get away from some of the, you know, riskier things like airlines and go way up and way down on a month to month basis. It makes sense.</p><p>And Buffett, let's be honest, the guy is sitting on $160 billion or whatever the number is. He hasn't done anything. He probably missed some opportunities in the last few months. And for him to finally step in now makes sense. I'm sure he's been getting some blowback from his investors over the last few months.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Dom -- even if someone doesn't have Buffett-like cash. What do you say about, say, a Duke energy?</p><p>DOMINICK TAVELLA, PRESIDENT, LEBENTHAL GLOBAL ADVISORS: For Buffett, this is classic buffet but we would not use the word big. Again, he's got over $140 billion available. So I would not call this a big deal for him.</p><p>Energy right now is depressed, right. So in general, this is a sector that if you're a long-term investor, this is when you acquire it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'll stay on that. U.S. Economic outlook amid COVID-19, Goldman Sachs downgrading its growth outlook for 20 due to the recent surge in coronavirus cases across the country.</p><p>The investment bank's chief economist now expecting growth contraction of 4.6 percent. So changed from contraction of a changed from contraction 4.22 percent. Dom, what do you say to this?</p><p>TAVELLA: Well, look, our worst fear was that the COVID would not go completely away and that might come in the fall. This has actually been worse. It never kind of gone away at all.</p><p>We have some very large states -- Texas, Florida, that have been hit hard and they've gone backward in terms of closing their economic systems, their restaurants, their hotels and such. So, yes, it's not surprising that the overall economic look is going to be a little bit more depressed. But I still am in a positive year-end towards December.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Larry, the market already knows this, right?</p><p>GLAZER: That's right. That's right. Look, the investors have become very cautious. Optimism through the American Association of Individual Investors Survey has really plummeted recently.</p><p>And most Wall Street strategists did not see the pandemic. They never had this on their screen. So why would I listen to their advice now on their forecast for the balance of the year.</p><p>They missed the one big macro theme that drove all of the trading for this year. So I think individual investors have a competitive advantage here and that's not to read Wall Street research because it hasn't been that helpful.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Steve, your comment on that before we move on?</p><p>DUDASH: I think we're going to get past this virus. We have to invest. If we know we're going to get through this. Science will get us through this. We will pull together. Therefore, now buying into this economy, buying into the market belief is the right move.</p><p>It might not happen next month. It might not happen for six months. But there's no doubt that we will get on the other side of this. so when we talk to our clients, we're talking to our investors, you have to invest with that belief.</p><p>So yes, now is a good time. There is a huge pull or rise going across the country on this. But it's not going to shut down the economy. The government has flooded the markets with money right now. You have to ride that wave. They put the floor on there for you. They've taken that huge downside away --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>DUDASH: -- take advantage of it. It won't happen again.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So gentlemen, you have to explain this. Healthcare stocks slumped. The S&amp;P 500 healthcare sector finished June as the second worst performer of the index's 11 groups. The group down 2.5 percent compared to the overall index's one and-a-half percent gain. Larry, why aren't these healthcare stocks performing given we're in the middle of a pandemic? go</p><p>GLAZER: Sure. It really is a great point. And again, it baffles a lot of investors that you would think that this is a traditional area that would benefit.</p><p>First of all, elective surgeries way down, that's where hospitals make all of their money. That's the profit center. But more importantly, this is not a cyclical area. It doesn't benefit from the reopening; it doesn't benefit from the recovery. It's a slow, steady and stable area where margins have been really compressed. There's better opportunities elsewhere and there's certainly better valuations outside of healthcare right now.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Steve -- healthcare, yes or nay.</p><p>DUDASH: Larry is 100 percent correct. They make their money on elective surgeries and tip weren't going to the hospitals for those elective surgeries because they were scared one to go into the hospital. Two, they are told not to come.</p><p>So that will pick up but it won't happen overnight, he's 100 right. It's a slow moving beast, it's hard to jump in on that.</p><p>And try to think that you're going to catch a really quick pop on it. It's just -- it's just not the reality of how bad industry works and so though it will pick up, it's not going to be a fast-moving at this point.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Dom -- final word. I have two words, political risk.</p><p>TAVELLA: A great deal of it. A great deal of it -- Dagen. Obviously the polls show Biden ahead right now. You've got to take these with a grain of salt. We learned that lesson the hard way during the Clinton last election.</p><p>Having said that, I think the polls are way off in terms of how the disparity between Trump and Biden, I think it's a lot closer. I think there's a lot of people out there that just are not inclined to yet admit that they're Trump supporters because of the political environment.</p><p>This will be close. But it's going to be a tough call.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Do you like healthcare -- quick?</p><p>TAVELLA: I love healthcare. I agree with the gentlemen. Both of them except that buy things when they're out of favor. All their rational was exactly right. but a year from now, all that elective surgery, all that stuff that made hospitals profitable will be back and you buy it when no one else wants it.</p><p>So we actually added this last quarter to our healthcare position.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Dom Tavella -- thank you so much Dom Tavella, Larry Glazer and Steve Dudash. Gentlemen -- we'll see you soon.</p><p>Coming up this morning, House Ways and Means Committee member Congressman Tom Reed along with House Appropriations Committee member Tim Ryan on the potential for more stimulus.</p><p>Then in the 8:00 hour we have Labor Secretary Gene Scalia on Thursday's employment numbers. The state of the job market.</p><p>And Indiana Congressman Jim Banks on the monument debate and how America should handle its history. you don't want a miss it.</p><p>Cultural debate meantime hitting the sports world, the Washington Redskins and Cleveland Indians dealing with possible name changes. What people think, next.</p><p>You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The Redskins reconsider. Three minority owners of the team are looking to sell their stakes in the NFL team. Dan Snyder, the majority owner said last week he's reviewing the name after pressure from Fed Ex and Nike.</p><p>Lee, what do you make of this? To be clear, I am a lifelong Redskins fan but I said years ago on the air, I am on the record saying that they should have started talking about this eons ago to just get rid of the name.</p><p>And the reason the fans hate Dan Snyder is because he's been an awful owner. Their record is abysmal. He's a terrible owner. And it's about time the Redskins started talking about this.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKI AND PARTNERS: I think it's about time the Redskins started talking about this, too. I think it's been -- you know, they've taken the heat on this for a long time and they, you know, stuck to their guns on it and I don't think it was the right decision.</p><p>I think now is the time to change their name. I think probably a good time -- probably a good time to rebrand themselves. I think they need to have a new image so-to-speak. They haven't had the best record in recent years.</p><p>And I think this would give them a much needed boost. But I think the time is right. And I think they can't avoid it any longer.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It happened across the NCAA. Stanford changed the mascot name in the 70s I think. And Syracuse did the same. The Florida state Seminoles -- they worked with the local Native American tribe to make sure that the tribe was ok with them retaining the kind of Seminoles to represent them.</p><p>But Lee, really quickly of before we move on, do you have a name for the Redskins? What would you call -- have you researched that at all?</p><p>CARTER: I haven't researched it at all. I've seen THAT they have good ones out there. I'm not sure which one I would pick Because the question is, do they get something that's really close that has a different meaning or do they go with something different entirely.</p><p>I think it's a really important question. I think people are going to want it to stay close. I think they're going to want to keep it with the same kind of a feel but it's -- I haven't come up with a name.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Ok. I know it's Washington but nothing to do with politics. Nothing.</p><p>I think just please, no.</p><p>CARTER: No, please.</p><p>But it's not just the Washington Redskins. The Cleveland Indians are also considering a name change as well. This after the team completely removed the -- it was offensive to many caricature on a character, mascot, chief wahoo last year. John Lonski, what do you make of these changes?</p><p>JOHN LONSKI, MOODY'S CAPITL MARKETS: Well, I think they're overdue. Much overdue. Washington Redskins, you know, I'm a New York Giants fan and I think it's an old baseball team from Washington that lost all the time. Why not call them the Washington Senators, bring that name back. My goodness, that would really frighten Washington Redskins fans.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's what I'm saying don't call them senators. Don't call them the Washington congressmen. Can you think of anything more loathsome? They've been --</p><p>CARTER: I did.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. Allie --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LONSKI: -- might be a good name.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Allie -- final word.</p><p>ALLIE CARTER: Yes, I would just say, you mentioned that in the 70s some universities started making these changes. This has been a slow drip of sort of sensitivity to marketing and branding. There's been an inflection point. I think that, you know, there's been no longer a tolerance either by employees of companies, attendees of universities or the general public for offending a few to make many happy and, you know, I applaud all efforts that are being taken to have broad appeal and sensitivity.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And here's my final word.</p><p>Washington Redskins change the name, start winning consistently. Maybe they're connected.</p><p>And maybe get rid of the owner, Dan Snyder too.</p><p>Coming up, Jeffrey Epstein's confidant charged. When Ghislaine Maxwell could be back in New York in front of a judge, next.</p><p>And AirBNB making changes, the company cracking down on potential house parties. We take a look ahead.</p><p>You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Long time Jeffrey Epstein confidant Ghislaine Maxwell expected to be extradited to New York early this week to face charges she conspired with Jeffrey Epstein to sexually abuse underage girls. Ghislaine Maxwell arrested in New Hampshire last week.</p><p>Joining me now is Fox News senior judicial analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano.</p><p>Judge, people talk about her being offered a deal but when Epstein was arrested, why wouldn't she have inked a deal then if that's what she was going to do? Do prosecutors even need to offer her a deal at this point?</p><p>JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: Well, good morning, Dagen.</p><p>You know, people often don't offer deals until they're about to be arrested or they have been arrested. She may somehow in her mind have thought she could have lived forever in New Hampshire and nobody would catch her. Turns out the FBI had been watching her for months and was just waiting for the right time.</p><p>Prosecutors are always interested in a deal. A trial of this nature would be traumatic for the victims and expensive for the government. And they may very well have arrested her with the hopes that she will help them. I mean, one of their targets is eighth in line to the throne of Great Britain, one of the government's targets. And he of course, refuses to speak to the FBI as is his right under British and under American law.</p><p>And there's very little the American government can do to force him to testify unless they have some more evidence against him.</p><p>The rampant speculation over the weekend is that she is the living embodiment of Jeffrey Epstein's black book because she was with him for so long and knows everybody with whom he was involved, not only for sexual liaisons, many of which would have been profoundly illegal, but also for intelligence liaisons. I mean it is well-known that Epstein had ties to the Israeli Mossad and did some work for them.</p><p>There are a lot of people who are probably a little ill at ease this morning wondering on whom she is going to spill the beans. Because if she doesn't spill any beans and if she's convicted she will spend effectively the rest of her life in a federal prison.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Back to -- when Jeffrey Epstein was arrested and thrown in jail before he committed suicide, was it just last year that that happened, Judge? I think it was just a year ago.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Why wouldn't she --</p><p>NAPOLITANO: It seems longer but, yes, it was just last year. He was arrested at Teterboro airport in New Jersey, brought to the Metropolitan Correctional Center or federal holding facility in lower Manhattan and that's where he died.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Why wouldn't she have stepped up at that point if she really wanted to do the right thing? Something to save herself but to stand up for these victims.</p><p>And I have listened -- I have read everything that Julie Brown has ever written. And she deserves the credit for bringing this case back to life and ultimately making sure that the victims have a voice and let's call them survivors, not victims. And also that Epstein was ultimately brought up on charges and arrested by the feds here in New York.</p><p>So why Ghislaine -- Ghislaine Maxwell, given everyone she knows, thinks she was going to get away with this?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Well, she obviously doesn't think the way you do. Your praise for the Miami Herald reporter is well documented and well justified and that reporter really is the reason that we know so much about this. And many of these victims will get some justice.</p><p>But it's hard to imagine that Miss Maxwell will have the slightest sympathy for these victims when if the government's allegations are true and the evidence is pretty substantial, she facilitated their victimhood.</p><p>This is a very bizarre, bizarre relationship that she had with Jeffrey Epstein, that she would be in the business of procuring underage girls for Epstein and for others and in the business of God knows whatever else.</p><p>But she obviously doesn't think like Dagen McDowell, obviously has no by a pity or sympathy for the people that she victimized. She was concerned I would imagine at the time of Epstein's arrest only for her own freedom which is now in grave jeopardy.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And these survivors will finally get to face their abuser, alleged abuser, up close and in person.</p><p>Judge Andrew Napolitano, thank you so much. Take care. Good to see you.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: You're welcome.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Coming up, future stimulus, more money could be headed to your bank account? That's next.</p><p>You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN ANCHOR: Welcome back. I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo. It is Monday, July 6th. Your top stories at 7:30 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>Futures are looking to kick off the week with a major rally, 352 point gain on the Dow futures. This after all three major market gauges here in the U.S. posted strong gains last week. The Nasdaq, the big winner, closing out the week with another all-time high.</p><p>Checking on the global market action, in Europe it is green across the board. Gains of -- north of 1.5 percent in England, France and Germany. And in Asia overnight, same story, strong rally. China's state run media saying the country needs a bull market to build its strength as its capital markets are undergoing reforms to attract money from home and abroad.</p><p>President Trump gearing up for an outdoor rally in New England.</p><p>Cheryl Casone has the details.</p><p>Hey, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, that's right, Dagen, good morning again.</p><p>President Trump is going to hold that rally at the Portsmouth International Airport in the battleground state of New Hampshire on Saturday. This is going to be his second campaign rally since the Covid-19 pandemic hit the U.S. in March. An indoor rally was held in Tulsa, Oklahoma, last month. The turnout for that first rally in Tulsa, smaller than expected. But hand sanitizer will be available and people will be strongly advised to wear a face mask this weekend at this rally.</p><p>Well, we are learning more about plans by the European Union to crack down on big tech companies like Google, FaceBook and Amazon. According to \"The Wall Street Journal,\" EU regulators are proposing regulations that target competition, taxes and content as part of a comprehensive plan to rein in the companies. \"The Journal\" says the EU's antitrust czar is outlining new legal boundaries for the big tech giants instead of just enforcing existing laws, such as antitrust regulations. We should add the heads of Alphabet, Apple, FaceBook and Amazon are scheduled to testify in Washington this month in front of the House Judiciary Committee.</p><p>And finally here is a look at what is trending this morning on foxbusiness.com. Canceled holiday celebrations have Americans turning to do it yourself firework displays.</p><p>The state of Texas is working on a program that would allow college students to graduate debt-free with a six figure job in the oil and gas industry.</p><p>And Elon Musk caused a firestorm on Twitter on Sunday, launching a new Tesla product, red satin shorts. That's a move to taunt the short sellers that have been, well, plaguing him for quite some time, Dagen.</p><p>And those are your headlines from the newsroom. Back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Where's the photo of the red satin shorts, Cheryl? They're very roller disco. They're very roller disco 1978.</p><p>CASONE: I know.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But you need to have eye shadow to match.</p><p>CASONE: Is it appropriate to show them this early in the morning?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, they're not that short.</p><p>CASONE: OK.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: Sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL: We'll see you soon.</p><p>Coronavirus stimulus. Cases of the virus in the United States approaching 3 million and another -- with another spike over this weekend. Now more calls are coming for coronavirus stimulus. More of it. The extra $600 in unemployment benefits that people are getting every week that are set to expire at the end of this month as part of the CARES Act. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell saying the Senate will consider a new round of stimulus checks this week.</p><p>Joining me now, New York Congressman and Problem Solvers Caucus co-chair, Tom Reed, and Ohio Congressman and House Appropriations Committee member, Congressman Tim Ryan.</p><p>Reed and Ryan. It's a Vaudeville act. Let's do this, gentlemen.</p><p>Congressman Ryan to you first.</p><p>Is that in the cards? Is that something that you're hearing that your -- that -- that conservatives and Republicans would get on-board with the extension of this $600?</p><p>REP. TIM RYAN (D-OH): Well, I -- I hope so. I think there's some accommodations we could make for people who are having opportunities going back to work. I think we could -- we could figure out a way to deal with that. But the reality of it is, a lot of people are struggling. They're not paying their full rent. They're not paying their mortgage. This could be a cascading effect not just for them personally but throughout the economy. You stop paying your credit card bills, you stop paying your mortgage, you stop paying these things, you ruin your credit and literally it may take some families decades to climb out of it. And so a small investment upfront to protect them from that through the end of the year I think would be the responsible thing to do.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Congressman Reed, do you agree with that? Because we've talked about this, that there are many Americans, by some estimates half the people on unemployment, are collecting more because of the $600 extra per week than they actually would earn on the job. And we've heard over and over again from employers that they're having trouble hiring people back, getting people back to work because of this extra money.</p><p>Is there anyone in the Republican Party who would support extending this $600?</p><p>REP. TOM REED (R-NY): You know, I don't see a straight extension of the $600 for the reasons you just articulated, Dagen. This -- this is a financial incentive not to return to work but to stay on unemployment. And so what we want to do is reward work. We want to encourage work. And so I think you need an enhanced unemployment benefit compromise that recognizes the difficult times we're in but in practice makes sure that people are rewarded, not encouraged financially, to stay in an unemployment position.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, Congressman Reed, stay on that. What does that compromise look like and then I'll get Congressman Ryan to tell you if he likes it or not.</p><p>REED: You know, I -- I'm a firm believer in doing things like up to $600 but no more than x percent of the wages that you had going into unemployment, so you could never make more money on unemployment than you did when you were working.</p><p>But what I hear from Department of Labors is the bureaucracy does not have the capability or the competency to have software programs implemented in order to manage that. Because of a bureaucracy problem we should say it's OK to have this problem go unfixed? That is a real problem I'm hearing that needs to be taken care of.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And, Congressman Ryan, part of that bureaucracy is that the unemployment benefits are delivered at the state level and so it wouldn't be -- when you have federal oversight of unemployment programs, that becomes exceedingly complicated. And I know people who have just started getting their unemployment checks, even though they applied for unemployment literally months ago.</p><p>RYAN: Yes, no doubt about it. I mean, you know, this is a structural problem that is very relevant in many, many states. I think it's -- it's a sign of the times of, you know, the -- the rhetoric for the last 20 or 30 years about how bad government is and we defund it, we've not updated, we've not reinvented government. This is -- I hope this is an opportunity for us, guys like Tom and me, to come together and say, how do we actually make this government function? How do we make it work? How do we make it efficient? What -- what's America 2.0 government really look like because, at the end of the day, it's the people who are suffering.</p><p>And I have no qualms or no problem sitting down and figuring out how we can work something out when it comes to the $600. My personal opinion, Congressman Ro Khanna and I have a bill for $2,000 a month payments to everybody in the country until we get out of this mess.</p><p>I think that, you know, the talks of the stock market and this and that are really under-appreciating the level of anxiety and -- and struggle that most Americans are under right now. And that -- that's a reality on the ground that many, many congressional districts, people are hurting and they need help and they need the federal government to step up. So I hope I don't -- I hope we don't cut them loose and say, hey, you're on your own in August and September because those families are going to spend a decade or more trying to claw out of the financial troubles that -- that we're going to have -- helped put them in. And we have a responsibility to act and act now.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Congressman Reed, I'll give you final word on this, but I have talked about what Congressman Ryan is saying now for literally months, that it was going to be a replay because of the massive amount of Federal Reserve stimulus, that that has juiced asset prices so the haves have more and then people on main street across this country are struggling.</p><p>What say you, final word?</p><p>REED: I agree that main street has to be the priority going forward. And if you have guys like Tim Ryan -- Tim and I have a long history of working together. A reasonable man. Proud Democrat. I'm a proud Republican. Put us in a room. We fix this problem in a -- in a heartbeat.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Congressmen, thank you so much. Tom Reed and Tim Ryan.</p><p>When I say Vaudeville act, that's a compliment. I love Vaudeville. So, thank you.</p><p>REED: Love (ph) it (ph).</p><p>MCDOWELL: Take care, gentlemen. Great to see you.</p><p>Coming up, the next jobs in America. What the June jobs report says about future employment.</p><p>Plus, Airbnb making changes. The company cracking down on potential house parties ahead.</p><p>You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.</p><p>And quarantine dating. A new app aiming to create deeper relationships. That's ahead.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The job market staging a strong comeback. A record 4.8 million jobs added in the month of June. About 40 percent of the gains in leisure and hospitality. But the numbers not reflecting the surge of coronavirus cases across the country late last month when many restaurants and bars rolled back their reopenings.</p><p>Joining us now, Upwork Chief Economist Adam Ozimek.</p><p>Adam, how are you and where are the next jobs in America?</p><p>ADAM OZIMEK, CHIEF ECONOMIST, UPWORK: Thanks for having me.</p><p>So I think there's two ways to look at this. One is, who's bouncing back fastest from the pandemic crisis, and the other is sort of where are the longer term trends in employment.</p><p>And for the first I think, you know, this is really the opposite of a traditional recession. Usually we see manufacturing and construction taking the biggest hits. You know, so-called goods producing industries, while service producing industries are more resilient. That's certainly what we saw in the great recession.</p><p>But, today, the opposite is true, service professions have done worse and it's really construction and manufacturing that have bounced back faster.</p><p>MCDOWELL: John Lonski, jump in here. But in many areas construction was considered an essential form of work, even during a complete shutdown.</p><p>JOHN LONSKI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY'S CAPITAL MARKETS: You know, that's very true. And you have to realize that there is now a stronger preference on the -- on the part of Americans to leave central cities, to leave crowded cities and move out to the suburbs. Over the near term, that should give home building a major boost. We're seeing signs of that already.</p><p>Again, you know, as we look forward, we now realize how important the ability to work remotely is and so I would think there's going to be a lot of job opportunities in areas that enhance our ability to work outside of an office.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Speaking of that, Adam, how many of the jobs will remain remote?</p><p>OZIMEK: So I think we're going to continue to see growth there. Before the pandemic hit, we were seeing growth basically every year over the last 20 years in the share of the workforce that was remote. And, obviously, since the pandemic, that number has skyrocketed. It's now more than half of workers are working remote.</p><p>And I also don't think this is just a one-time bump either. I think we're going to see consistently higher remote employment. We actually did a survey of hiring managers at Upwork and what we found was that more than half found that remote work was working better than they expected. And really less than one in 10 thought it was working less well than they expected. They're seeing higher productivity, you know, obviously benefits to employees and, you know, they've doubled their expected plans for remote work hiring over the next five years. So I really think this is going to be continued strong growth there, not just kind of a one-time thing.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Alli?</p><p>ALLI MCCARTNEY, PRIVATE WEALTH ADVISER, UBS FINANCIAL SERVICES: You know, I have a number of clients who are CEOs -- sorry about that. It's been a crazy weekend. And --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Hey, Alli, you never have to apologize for dogs ever.</p><p>So, continue. Please, continue.</p><p>MCCARTNEY: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>The -- I have a number of clients who have said that they -- they will definitely have more remote workers than they have in the past, but they are getting a lot of feedback, especially from younger employees, that in terms of moving forward, in terms of getting feedback, in terms of rising through the ranks, in terms of sort of getting the culturated (ph), that, you know, they're really concerned about how to manage that. How did you see that reflected in your survey or the conversations you've been having?</p><p>OZIMEK: So I think that, you know, remote work is not going to work for everyone in every situation. But I think that a lot of companies and a lot of occupations, it will work. And it's just really a matter of learning how to work this way. So a lot of companies have sort of been thrown into this overnight and they're still learning how to work with their employees, how promotions, you know, management works. So I really think there's going to be a big learning experience for companies here.</p><p>But, you know, the important thing is that even with these short-term challenges, the struggles to figure out how this works, it's still, you know, really, really great reception from employers and workers. So I think that overall while you will have some complaints here and there, those are pretty minor compared to the benefits.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And, Alli, I greatly appreciate for the real world live demonstration of the trickiness of working from home.</p><p>That -- you know what, I've been coming into the office every single day even at the height of the pandemic in the studio because I've got two dogs and there is no way on planet earth I would ever be able to do live television with those two rascals screeching and hollering. So, thank you.</p><p>Adam, it was great to see you.</p><p>Adam Ozimek.</p><p>OZIMEK: Thank you, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Take care.</p><p>Coming up, Airbnb making changes. How the company is trying to crack down on house parties.</p><p>You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's time again for \"Morning Buzz.\"</p><p>First up, Airbnb is trying to crack down on house parties, introducing new rules for younger renters. The company saying guests under 25 who have less than three positive reviews and any negative reviews will not be allowed to book homes near where they live. They can still book outside that area.</p><p>Lee, do you know anything about this?</p><p>LEE CARTER, POLLSTER AND PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY AND PARTNERS: So we just rented our house out on Airbnb to what we thought was a family of four. That's what they told us. And we had three separate complaints that it was eight 20-something dudes partying all week. So I appreciate these kinds of efforts, but there's a lot of misrepresentation that happens online. I think a lot of these folks know what is out there. So I'm thankful for every protection we can get, frankly.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Wait, did your house get trashed?</p><p>CARTER: I did just get a text message from this wonderful woman who goes and checks on it for us. Thankfully, everything is OK. But three separate complaints over the weekend. And we really thought we were dealing with something totally different. We even spoke to people on the phone and he was acting like it's a family of four.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You need me as your neighbor. I would have put a stop to that.</p><p>Next, who -- who wants short shorts from Tesla? In a dig to short sellers of Tesla stock, CEO Elon Musk selling red satin short shorts for $69.42 each, which sold out quickly. The description of the shorts says that you can run like the wind or entertain like Liberace.</p><p>Alli, what do you think of these shorts? They're very Richard Simmons, actually.</p><p>MCCARTNEY: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But --</p><p>MCCARTNEY: They are very like ala (ph) when I used to do aerobics with the ThighMaster and Jane Fonda with my grandmother for sure. I have never ever understood the link between apparel and cars, but I'm not their target demographic. This is an interesting one. The guy's a piece of work. You never -- you never know what you're going to get, whether it's a baby name, a billion dollars, short shorts, here we are.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I said earlier, I'm thinking roller disco with the matching frosted eye shadow.</p><p>MCCARTNEY: For sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So, there -- there you go. And, yes, I am old enough to remember those days.</p><p>And, finally, 75 hot dogs in 10 minutes. Joey Chestnut winning Nathan's Famous Fourth of July Hot Dog Eating Contest in his 13th Mustard Belt. The defending champ beat his own 2018 record of 74 hot dogs.</p><p>John, discuss.</p><p>LONSKI: I mean this tells you how starved we are for sports entertainment. And I warn people, don't try this at home. And I'm asking myself, why doesn't this guy ever put on any weight? What's his secret?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Just high metabolism. Because if I ate two, I'd have a gut for three months.</p><p>Still ahead --</p><p>LONSKI: And I -- yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: We'll save that.</p><p>Quarantine dating. A new app aiming to create deeper relationships ahead.

The tweets, many of which contain profanity, immediately gained traction online, even attracting comment from Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The same thing happened to us. I got 10x the credit limit. We have no separate bank or credit card accounts or any separate assets. Hard to get to a human for a correction though. It's big tech in 2019.</p><p>- Steve Wozniak (@stevewoz)November 10, 2019</p><p>Hansson didn't disclose any specific income-related information for either of them but said they filed joint tax returns and that his wife has a better credit score than he does.</p><p>\"The department will be conducting an investigation to determine whether New York law was violated and ensure all consumers are treated equally regardless of sex,\" said a spokesman for Linda Lacewell, the superintendent of the New York Department of Financial Services. \"Any algorithm, that intentionally or not results in discriminatory treatment of women or any other protected class of people violates New York law.\"</p><p>AppleCard only offers individual accounts and it is possible for two family members to receive significantly different credit decisions, a Goldman spokesman said. \"In all cases, we have not and will not make decisions based on factors like gender,\" he said.</p><p>Hansson said Goldman's response doesn't explain what happened after he started airing his issues on social media.</p><p>\"As soon as this became a PR issue, they immediately bumped up her credit limit without asking for any additional documentation,\" he said in an interview. \"My belief isn't there was some nefarious person wanting to discriminate. But that doesn't matter. How do you know there isn't an issue with the machine-learning algo when no one can explain how this decision was made?\"</p><p>I'm surprised that they even let her apply for a card without the signed approval of her spouse? I mean, can you really trust women with a credit card these days??!</p><p>- DHH (@dhh)November 7, 2019</p><p>This is the second such action from the regulator in recent weeks. NY DFS opened a probe against health care giant UnitedHealth Group after a study found an algorithm favored white patients over black patients.</p><p>Goldman's growing ambitions for main street is bringing increased scrutiny and a new set of challenges it hasn't faced previously. The AppleCard is a joint venture between Apple Inc. and the New York-based bank, which is responsible for all the credit decisions on the card. The card was rolled out earlier this year and executives at both firms hailed it as the most successful launch ever.</p><p>Traditional lenders are upping their use of machines to decide who gets how much credit as part of a strategy to reduce costs and boost loan applications. Meanwhile, technology companies are moving in on the financial services industry's turf, with businesses such as Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google offering loans and payment options.</p><p>Black-box algorithms</p><p>Hansson said his posts had led to an internal review and that he was hopeful it would spark a conversation about black-box algorithms and the inherent biases in those systems.</p><p>The 40-year-old Dane is known for being the creator of the popular programming tool Ruby on Rails. He's a partner at Basecamp, a web-based software development firm, and also known to regularly take part in automobile endurance races, including the 24 hours of Le Mans in France.</p><p>\"Goldman and Apple are delegating credit assessment to a black box,\" Hansson said. \"It's not a gender-discrimination intent but it is a gender-discrimination outcome.\"</p><p>The use of algorithms by lenders in credit decisions has drawn scrutiny in Congress. In June, the House Financial Services Committee heard about examples of algorithmic decision-making where researchers have found instances of bias targeting specific groups even when there was no intent to discriminate.</p><p>Some lawmakers already are demanding a federal response.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CARDPM-0000016e-5841-d3d8-ab6f-7bf1af520000-1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CARDPM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XGC-1PN1-JCRW-514B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">305430</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"714\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SourceMedia LLC d/b/a Arizent.

Mark R. Warner and Josh Hawley introduced the Designing Accounting Safeguards to Help Broaden Oversight And Regulations on Data (DASHBOARD).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This bipartisan legislation would require data harvesting companies such as social media platforms to tell consumers and financial regulators exactly what data they are collecting from consumers, and how it is being leveraged by the platform for profit.</p><p> \"For years, social media companies have told consumers that their products are free to the user. But that's not true \u2013 you are paying with your data instead of your wallet,\" said Sen. Warner. \"But the overall lack of transparency and disclosure in this market have made it impossible for users to know what they're giving up, who else their data is being shared with, or what it's worth to the platform. Our bipartisan bill will allow consumers to understand the true value of the data they are providing to the platforms, which will encourage competition and allow antitrust enforcers to identify potentially anticompetitive practices.</p><p> As user data increasingly represents one of the most valuable assets held by technology firms, shining light on how this data is collected, retained, monetized, and protected, is critical. The DASHBOARD Act will:</p><p> *  Require commercial data operators (defined as services with over 100 million monthly active users) to disclose types of data collected as well as regularly provide their users with an assessment of the value of that data.</p><p> *  Require commercial data operators to file an annual report on the aggregate value of user data they've collected, as well as contracts with third parties involving data collection.</p><p> *  Require commercial data operators to allow users to delete all, or individual fields, of data collected \u2013 and disclose to users all the ways in which their data is being used. including any uses not directly related to the online service for which the data was originally collected.</p><p> *  Empower the SEC to develop methodologies for calculating data value, while encouraging the agency to facilitate flexibility to enable businesses to adopt methodologies that reflect the different uses, sectors, and business models.</p><p> \"When a big tech company says its product is free, consumers are the ones being sold. These 'free' products track everything we do so tech companies can sell our information to the highest bidder and use it to target us with creepy ads,\" said Sen. Hawley. \"Even worse, tech companies do their best to hide how much consumer data is worth and to whom it is sold. This bipartisan legislation gives consumers control of their data and will show them how much these 'free' services actually cost.\"</p><p> To see a section-by-section summary of the bill, click here.

When we worry about Big Tech's growing power, or talk about \"Silicon Valley\" as a phenomenon, we often group these five together, as if they move as a pack.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It is an oversimplification that disguises fundamentally different characteristics. Apple and Amazon sell mainly to consumers, while Facebook, Google and Microsoft make most of their money from businesses. Amazon and Microsoft are based not in Silicon\u00a0Valley at all, but 800 miles away in Seattle.</p><p>But in recent months, all have managed to become affected by the same controversy. The companies all offer some form of voice recognition software - virtual assistants in the cases of Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft, and language translation in Facebook's instance.</p><p>And each of them have been revealed, one by one, to have developed their software by employing humans to listen to recordings of their users' voices.</p><p>In April it emerged that Amazon employs hundreds of people to listen to customers speaking to Alexa, the company's virtual assistant.</p><p>Incidents ranged from the embarrassing (singing in the shower), to the serious (a child screaming for help). Similar examples followed with Apple's digital assistant Siri, as well as Google and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/08/07/microsoft-contractors-listening-sensitive-skype-calls-cortana/\">Microsoft</url> 's counterparts.</p><p>Users naturally felt their privacy had been violated, not only because it makes one uneasy to know that their private conversations could be heard by a stranger, but because none of the companies involved had disclosed that they used humans to listen to real people's voice recordings.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/08/07/microsoft-contractors-listening-sensitive-skype-calls-cortana/\">At a glance | Virtual assistants</url></p><p>Their privacy statements, as is often the case, were vague: Apple's said that data was used to improve Siri, but made no mention that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/08/07/microsoft-contractors-listening-sensitive-skype-calls-cortana/\">humans were part of this process</url> . At least two of the companies now face scrutiny from European regulators over the matter.</p><p>After the controversies emerged, the tech companies involved suspended the practice, or at least made steps to tell users they were doing it. Last week, Apple apologised over the matter, and said that in future, only those who had opted in would have their commands reviewed by humans, and even then, only in text\u00a0form.</p><p>In examining what went wrong here, we can of course say that the companies should have been more clear about their work.</p><p>But such controversies are often less about the facts of the case as the moment it takes place in. Today, we are in one of those moments for privacy, thanks to the reckless behaviour of some of the major tech\u00a0companies.</p><p>But privacy is a funny thing. We are outraged when we feel it has been abused, as in the case of Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal, but surprisingly willing to trade it away when there are benefits to be had.</p><p>Supermarkets use loyalty card schemes to sell details of our shopping habits, data that is invaluable to advertising companies, but millions of us agree to it because there are financial benefits to doing so.</p><p>Facebook's privacy practices were once much worse than they are today, but were forgiven because people loved to use it. Today, much of the excitement of being on Facebook has vanished, and so we feel we are not getting the same reward for the data we hand over.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/08/07/microsoft-contractors-listening-sensitive-skype-calls-cortana/\">Technology intelligence - newsletter promo - EOA</url></p><p>Google has suffered much less of a political backlash than Facebook, despite its fair share of privacy controversies, because people still find its services immensely useful on a daily basis.</p><p>This brings us back to the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/08/07/microsoft-contractors-listening-sensitive-skype-calls-cortana/\">present furore around voice recognition</url> . Part of the privacy backlash surrounding them may well be because the technological revolution digital assistants promised us has not materialised.</p><p>When Amazon's Alexa, the most popular household assistant, began to take off, executives at the company talked about it as a new wave of computing, in the same way that the mouse and keyboard gave way to the touchscreen. Jeff Bezos, a famous Star Trek fanatic, envisaged the software eventually acting like the fully intelligent voice-controlled computer in the series. Five years after it sold its first Echo speaker, Amazon says it has sold more than 100m devices equipped with Alexa.</p><p>But while Alexa's ability to understand us and the range of tasks it can do have improved, the experience of using it has not changed significantly.</p><p>Surveys suggest that people mostly use it for simple tasks, such as playing music and checking the weather.

When we worry about Big Tech's growing power, or talk about \"Silicon Valley\" as a phenomenon, we often group these five together, as if they move as a pack.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It is an oversimplification that disguises fundamentally different characteristics. Apple and Amazon sell mainly to consumers, while Facebook, Google and Microsoft make most of their money from businesses. Amazon and Microsoft are based not in Silicon Valley at all, but 800 miles away in Seattle.</p><p>But in recent months, all have managed to become affected by the same controversy. The companies all offer some form of voice recognition software - virtual assistants in the cases of Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft, and language translation in Facebook's instance.</p><p>And each of them have been revealed, one by one, to have developed their software by employing humans to listen to recordings of their users' voices.</p><p>In April it emerged that Amazon employs hundreds of people to listen to customers speaking to Alexa, the company's virtual assistant.</p><p>Incidents ranged from the embarrassing (singing in the shower), to the serious (a child screaming for help). Similar examples followed with Apple's digital assistant Siri, as well as Google and Microsoft's counterparts.</p><p>Users naturally felt their privacy had been violated, not only because it makes one uneasy to know that their private conversations could be heard by a stranger, but because none of the companies involved had disclosed that they used humans to listen to real people's voice recordings.</p><p>Their privacy statements, as is often the case, were vague: Apple's said that data was used to improve Siri, but made no mention that humans were part of this process. At least two of the companies now face scrutiny from European regulators over the matter.</p><p>After the controversies emerged, the tech companies involved suspended the practice, or at least made steps to tell users they were doing it. Last week, Apple apologised over the matter, and said that in future, only those who had opted in would have their commands reviewed by humans, and even then, only in text form.</p><p>In examining what went wrong here, we can of course say that the companies should have been more clear about their work.</p><p>But such controversies are often less about the facts of the case as the moment it takes place in. Today, we are in one of those moments for privacy, thanks to the reckless behaviour of some of the major tech companies.</p><p>But privacy is a funny thing. We are outraged when we feel it has been abused, as in the case of Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal, but surprisingly willing to trade it away when there are benefits to be had.</p><p>Supermarkets use loyalty card schemes to sell details of our shopping habits, data that is invaluable to advertising companies, but millions of us agree to it because there are financial benefits to doing so.</p><p>Facebook's privacy practices were once much worse than they are today, but were forgiven because people loved to use it. Today, much of the excitement of being on Facebook has vanished, and so we feel we are not getting the same reward for the data we hand over.</p><p>Google has suffered much less of a political backlash than Facebook, despite its fair share of privacy controversies, because people still find its services immensely useful on a daily basis.</p><p>This brings us back to the present furore around voice recognition. Part of the privacy backlash surrounding them may well be because the technological revolution digital assistants promised us has not materialised.</p><p>When Amazon's Alexa, the most popular household assistant, began to take off, executives at the company talked about it as a new wave of computing, in the same way that the mouse and keyboard gave way to the touchscreen. Jeff Bezos, a famous Star Trek fanatic, envisaged the software eventually acting like the fully intelligent voice-controlled computer in the series. Five years after it sold its first Echo speaker, Amazon says it has sold more than 100m devices equipped with Alexa.</p><p>But while Alexa's ability to understand us and the range of tasks it can do have improved, the experience of using it has not changed significantly.</p><p>Surveys suggest that people mostly use it for simple tasks, such as playing music and checking the weather. Anything more intricate than that, and they will turn to their smartphone or laptop.</p><p>Artificial intelligence has not made large enough strides for us to trust our smart assistants with booking flights or doing our shopping.</p><p>The experience of talking to a computer, and having it talk back to you, is painstakingly slow for anything but the most straightforward of processes.</p><p>That is the experience within the home, the safest environment for voice assistants. The experience is significantly less comfortable in public, where smartphone-based assistants might be used, or in the office, where Microsoft focuses its efforts.</p><p>Voice recognition is undoubtedly an impressive technology. But many impressive technologies fail to make much of an impact.</p><p>People are often wowed by virtual reality the first time they try it, but sales of the headsets have been slow, and many of those that were purchased are now gathering dust.</p><p>Virtual assistants are more successful than that, but they may ultimately end up as glorified light switches and alarm clocks, rather than the leap forward in computing they have been sold as.</p><p>This may go some way to the privacy outcry that tech companies have faced over how they develop their voice recognition software. People are happy to sacrifice a little bit of their privacy when they feel they are getting something in return.

Built by New Zealand-based Soul Machines, Fatema engages with customers using cutting-edge digital neurology and AI. <br/><br/>Overall, AI Waary said digital banking would greatly reduce the cost of banking services but will improve their quality. <br/><br/>This was followed by Heslehurst's discussion with the Central Bank of Bahrain (CBB) Governor Rasheed AI Maraj, who stressed that CBB is not only a regulator but an enabler of innovation and advancement in banking. <br/>Al Rasheed emphasised that a practical approach was needed to find the right balance between enabling innovation and protecting the financial system. <br/><br/>Next off was Brett King, author of Amazon best-seller Bank 4.0 and host of a top-ranked FinTech podcast in the world, Breaking Banks. <br/><br/>Tracing the advancements banking had gone through \u2013 from Bank 1.0 until Bank 4.0 \u2013 he said there had been radical changes in the industry with much more to come. <br/><br/>King said last year in China alone, more than $22 trillion worth of transactions were made in mobile payments. <br/><br/>He predicted that banking would become ubiquitous with many firms opening their own virtual banks. \"Voice recognition will be the primary mechanism of payment in the future and that by 2035 I expect to see more robots than humans,\" he quipped.<br/><br/><br/>King said the primary advantage AI has over humans is its vast database and this aspect will make, for example, autonomous cars safer. <br/><br/>The top author also predicted that AI in banking will be based on behaviour and that the industry will see a shift from banking products to more of banking experience. There will also be more advice given through AI than through human interactionsm, he added. <br/><br/>Global cryptocurrency expert Henri Arslanian, PwC's Fintech and Crypto leader for Asia, spoke of the rise of cryptocurrencies and their future development. <br/><br/>He pointed out that the industry would see stable coins \u2013 cryptocurrencies backed by real assets \u2013 coming up, citing the example of JP Morgan's JPM Coin. <br/><br/>Arslanian highlighted the increasing importance of Fintech and how governments were dealing with this. To prove his point, the industry expert cited the case of Denmark appointing an ambassador to deal with the big tech firms. <br/><br/>Anthony Thomson, the founder of Metro Bank and Atom Bank (both in the UK) and 86 400 (Australia), in his presentation spoke about challenger banking and his reflections on recent experiences in launching mobile lender 86 400 in Australia. <br/><br/>Later in a panel discussion, Thomas Blood of Amazon Web Services and Steve Kirsch, CEO of open banking software provider Token, spoke on the challenges facing regulators in open banking. They argued that the opportunities are too great for banking executives and regulators to ignore or avoid. <br/><br/>Kirsch said the CBB understands this and \"that's why it is leading the way for others in the region.\" Seconding him, Blood said the kingdom's central bank had taken a great step forward in embracing the new trends. <br/><br/>In his address, Dr Pippa Malmgren, former chief adviser to US President George W Bush for economic policy and financial markets, outlined the traits required for senior leaders in modern financial services organisations and argued that a narrow focus on analytics and reductionism was insufficient to deal with modern challenges. <br/><br/>She stressed that cognition and not intelligence was the future and how machines were attempting to think biologically through deep learning. <br/><br/>Malmgren also said organisations needed storytellers to give more clarity to their vision in people's minds. <br/><br/>The forum concluded with an audience poll which was held mainly to get their views on Fintech and the banking industry. <br/><br/>An overwhelming majority of 94 per cent expressed confidence in the future of digital banking; and 75 per cent saying yes to banks becoming more of a utility like water or electricity in the future. <br/><br/>To a question if Sophia or Fatema would replace bankers in the next five years, 54 per cent said no; while 55 per cent emphasised that regulators and not Fintechs would still play a key role in facilitating financial inclusion for all. <br/><br/>The poll on whether traditional banks will cease to exist by 2030 was a narrow escape with 51 per cent believing that they would continue; while 83 per cent thought that imagination rather than knowledge would the most important skill for future leaders. <br/><br/>At the forum, exhibitors had setup a range of stalls to showcase innovative fintech products, giving visitors the opportunity to see the latest in wearable payment tech, mobile applications, and other developments.-TradeArabia News Service</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/4/6/22/155077201620.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/4/6/22/155077201620.jpg</url></p><p><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TRARAB-138300159</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TRARAB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VGC-V0F1-F11P-X295-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">335146</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"997\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TradeArabia - Hilal Publishing and Marketing Group.

However, ...</p><p>Their digital edge, branchless model, and cost-efficiency plans give little edge against established lenders.    The entrance of virtual-only banks in Southeast Asia could put pressure on established banks\u2019 profitability, according to Fitch Ratings. However, the report also assured that it is unlikely to pose a large threat to the digitally-advanced incumbents, at least in the near term.    The economic fallout resulting from the pandemic has dented the neobanks\u2019 target segments more significantly, which reduced opportunities for a profitable business.    It has also forced incumbents to accelerate their digitalisation journey, which potentially diminished the neobanks\u2019 cost advantage over traditional banks.    \u201cExisting neobanks' business models and risk controls are largely untested over the course of economic cycles, and the coronavirus pandemic is likely to hit their main target segments\u2014the underserved and unbanked\u2014disproportionately, potentially forcing some to revisit or refine their strategy,\u201d Fitch Ratings analysts Tamma Febrian, Gary Hannify, and Parson Singha wrote on their report.    Meanwhile, the branchless operating model often touted by digital-only banks presents little edge over traditional banks in an urban setting and will only be pronounced when targeting underserved or rural settings.    Lenders in developed markets such as Singapore have generally not been relying on expansion of physical distribution channels to drive revenue in the past few years.    Further, bank branches in large or first-tier cities have already moved on from being transaction points to customer sales touchpoints, according to Fitch.    The cost efficiency of challenger banks, or their operating expenses and average assets, is also not always better than ASEAN\u2019s incumbent banks. A notable exception is South Korea\u2019s KakaoBank, which is 1.5x more productive than traditional lenders in the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Thailand.       In contrast China\u2019s WeBank is faring worse than select lenders in Vietnam, Philippines, Thailand, and Malaysia, with a higher proportion of impairment cost and operating expenses compared to banks in these markets.    \u201cWeBank's higher credit costs (2.2% of assets in 2019) relative to many banks in the region suggest that the effectiveness of its alternative risk modelling may be bound to the inherently higher credit risk of their borrowers,\u201d the analysts added.       Winning aspirants  Amongst aspirants, large technology players and digital banks that are backed by established corporates\u2014as opposed to standalone neobanks\u2014are as most likely to secure digital bank licences and compete more formidably against incumbents in the medium term, they added. This is due to their strong brand recognition, extensive customer base and established technology platforms.    \u201cBy leveraging advanced data analytics on extensive customer bases, big tech companies could potentially offer loans to their target markets in a swift and highly scalable manner without the overheads associated with operating a physical branch network,\u201d the analysts noted.    Amongst those named include Alibaba, Tencent, Google, and Ant Financial, for example. In particular, Ant Financial\u2014which  was reportedly applying for a wholesale bank licence in  Singapore without forming a consortium\u2014may seem like a relatively new player in SEA but is backed by Alibaba, owner of Lazada and Taobao,  two of the most established e-commerce platforms in the region.    However, many incumbents in the region have also invested heavily into their digital capabilities, with some already running as efficiently as some neobanks.    Regulatory hurdles are also likely to constrain aggressive competition, which will limit pressures on incumbents' business volumes and profitability.    Markets with potential  Meanwhile, amongst markets, Philippines and Indonesia present the largest untapped potential. This is on the back of their large unbanked populations, relatively low household leverage and sizeable economies.    Indonesia, in particular, has a booming peer-to-peer (P2P) lending segment, with around 161 players as of end-May from just 88 at December 2018. Their collective outstanding loan balances have also grown rapidly to $1b as of May, although it only accounts for 0.3% of Indonesia\u2019s banking system loans, noted Fitch. These all indicate that investors are bullish on Indonesia\u2019s market potential.    In comparison, Singapore is a lot more well-banked and has little space for new banks to establish a foothold. However, it also has a favorable business environment, and the Monetary Authority of Singapore\u2019s (MAS) high regulator bar acts as a de fact certification process guaranteeing neobanks\u2019 credibility and franchise.    Singapore also needs in terms of digital infrastructure readiness amongst ASEAN peers with its high smartphone penetration rate, national digital data ID repository introduced in 2016. Both Indonesia and the Philippines lack these.    Malaysia is also noted to have attracted significant interest for its virtual bank licenses. But Malaysia, like Thailand, has a highly leveraged household sector which constraints the growth potential of digital-only banks.    Only Singapore and Malaysia have so far announced regulatory guidelines on virtual banks. In both markets, the virtual banks are generally subjected to slightly more lenient capital and liquidity requirements than incumbents during the foundational phase, which can last up to five years, the report noted.    However, regulators have emphasized the overarching need for business sustainability, with aspirants needing to submit a comprehensive business plan that shows path to profitability.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42881344471</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60MS-VKX1-F07F-83HY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"997\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Asian Banking and Finance</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 20, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00073V9</classCode><className>FITCH RATINGS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS561450 CREDIT BUREAUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS523999 MISCELLANEOUS FINANCIAL INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS522390 OTHER ACTIVITIES RELATED TO CREDIT INTERMEDIATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>SIC8732 COMMERCIAL ECONOMIC, SOCIOLOGICAL, &amp;

This report is a go-to resource to understand and build individuals knowledge of the burgeoning virtual health assistant space in healthcare.Commercial models are still nascent, the technology (AI) is premature, clinical evidence is sparse, integration into existing EMRs/health records is incomplete, and data security concerns exist. Despite all of this we explore if AI assistants rise above being \"second-class concierge\".In the virtual+ AI combination space, think of reduced admin burden for HCPs, think of reduced consultation time and outpatient clinic time, think of an informed and engaged patient in control of their health and disease, think of a hospital whose beds are not full, think of an insurance plan that you understand clearly. The utopian world of healthcare in our minds could actually be reality if we do this right. This is huge.Key Takeaways</p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>End user perception</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>The willingness of consumer &amp; clinicians to use VHA's</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Adoption of VHA's to date</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Commercial models are still nascent</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>The technology (AI) is premature</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Clinical evidence is sparse</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>integration into existing EMRs incomplete</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>data security concerns</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>integrated part of healthcare delivery</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>Countries Covered:</p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>UK</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>USA</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>India</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>UK</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Germany</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>China</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Australia</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>AudienceAnyone in the healthcare space interested in VHAs (HCPs, Start-Ups, Pharma, Payers, Big Tech, Patients, etc).

This report is a go-to resource to understand and build individuals knowledge of the burgeoning virtual health assistant space in healthcare.<br/>Commercial models are still nascent, the technology (AI) is premature, clinical evidence is sparse, integration into existing EMRs/health records is incomplete, and data security concerns exist. Despite all of this we explore if AI assistants rise above being \"second-class concierge\".<br/>In the virtual+ AI combination space, think of reduced admin burden for HCPs, think of reduced consultation time and outpatient clinic time, think of an informed and engaged patient in control of their health and disease, think of a hospital whose beds are not full, think of an insurance plan that you understand clearly. The utopian world of healthcare in our minds could actually be reality if we do this right.

Last week, the agency sent out a stark warning on security concerns about the videoconferencing app Zoom. On the same day, the prime minister held the government's first-ever virtual cabinet meeting. The platform he chose to host this historic event? Zoom.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To make matters worse, Johnson tweeted a screengrab revealing thumbnail images of awkward-looking ministers with microphones muted, along with their usernames and the meeting number - enough information to give any hacker a field day.</p><p>The role of big technology companies has come under scrutiny as the coronavirus forces billions of people to adapt to life on lockdown. Apps such as Zoom and Houseparty, another social video platform, have become pervasive, allowing workers to communicate with their colleagues and families to stay connected. Zoom, which made pre-tax profits in the year to January 31 of $26.4m ((EURO)24.4m) on sales of $622.7m, has been one of the standout successes in this field. The company, founded by Chinese-born billionaire Eric Yuan, floated last year with a share price of $36. It had rocketed to $151.70 by the end of last month but fell back to $128 on Friday to give Zoom a value of $35.8bn.</p><p>The sell-off came after repeated concerns about Zoom's ability to protect its users' data. The New York attorney general, Letitia James, asked last week whether Zoom had reviewed security processes since the start of the virus outbreak and its surge in popularity.</p><p>The use of technology to communicate during the lockdown is just one part of the story. More significantly, governments and health services across the world are looking to tech developers to help monitor the spread of the virus, carry out more accurate testing - and potentially help speed up sufferers' recovery.</p><p>The NHS is working with the American tech giants Microsoft, Amazon and Palantir, as well as London-based Faculty, to use the health service's data to help predict where resources will be needed most.</p><p>All this raises questions over data security and privacy - although a report last year from the National Data Guardian found that about seven in 10 people in England would give up some personal data if it led to benefits such as access to new technologies, lower costs and improved patient care.</p><p>Doing so, however, brings increased risks of data falling into the wrong hands, or being misused in the future.</p><p>\"There is a concern about people using the Covid-19 banner to drive unwelcome behaviours,\" said Jason du Preez, chief executive of Privitar, which builds data security software for private and public organisations. \"If data is used and traded beyond that scope [of the coronavirus], it would be a total disaster. There's a real chance it will happen.\"</p><p>There is a balance to be struck between protecting civil liberties and making the best use of technology, experts say. In China, smartphones have been monitored and people forced to submit their body temperature for checks. This tight surveillance helped the government contain the outbreak largely in the Hubei province where it emerged, rather than allowing it to spread across the country.</p><p>More primitively, in India, some of those forced to self-isolate have had their hands stamped with indelible ink.</p><p>In Britain, such intrusion would not be tolerated. However, the NHS is examining plans to develop a location-tracking app that would alert people if they had been in contact with someone testing positive for the coronavirus. The idea is based on a study published in the journal Science, which recommended that the service should be voluntary.</p><p>Some observers believe that the introduction of such new technology during the crisis will mark the start of a new relationship between Big Tech - which has suffered from a \"techlash\" related to the industry's handling of personal data - and its customers.</p><p>\"The trust issue melts away when people are afraid for their circumstances: they sacrifice quite a lot more than they would in normal times,\" said Greg Francis, managing director of Access Partnership, which lobbies governments on behalf of big tech companies. \"That includes rights and privileges such as privacy.\"</p><p>There has been a surge of new apps designed to spot symptoms or deal with the fallout from the coronavirus. Despite a willingness of regulators to work with tech companies, there are still laws to be obeyed.</p><p>\"Developers need to consider at the outset the privacy implications of what is being developed,\" said Emma Burnett, head of data protection at the law firm CMS. \"This will involve being transparent to individuals, including what is being processed and why.\"</p><p>When people are afraid, they will sacrifice rights such as privacy</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Boris Johnson's virtual cabinet meeting using Zoom betrayed security flaws</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STIMES-158849236</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STIMES2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YKH-4MW1-JCBW-N1KN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">332263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"793\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"57900\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Ireland</edition><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 5, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Ireland</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001804</classCode><className>VIDEO CONFERENCING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DPHO</classCode><className>VIRTUAL EVENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOTY</classCode><className>CORONAVIRUSES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000439</classCode><className>CUSTOMER SERVICE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX002058</classCode><className>DISEASE AGENTS &amp;

The price of papers for both firms has increased by about 50% in the last year.</p><p><br/>Although the stock did not keep this strong pace, Visa and Mastercard would each be worth more than $1 trillion by 2023 if it continues its average annual earnings over the past three years, beating Facebook Inc and Berkshire Hathaway Inc if they continue to keep pace Recent. Read: 5 Trends That Will Change the Consumer Experience in 2019<br/>Their progress is being fueled by a shift towards cashless financial transactions, driven by an increase in online shopping.<br/>\"It's all on wheels,\" said Sandy Villere, portfolio manager at Villere Balanced Fund, which owns Visa shares. \"They're literally in the midst of banks, consumers and merchants, and that's an enviable place.\"<br/>Visa had a market value of $449 billion, and Mastercard was around $324 billion at close on Thursday. The billion-billion club is currently made up of Apple Inc, Microsoft and Alphabet, Google's parent company, and today managed to break through that barrier too Amazon, after its results exceeded expectations, and analysts applauded the popularity of the one-day shipping from the e-commerce giant and the performance of its cloud computing business.<br/>Jeff Bezos' signature had already reached $1 trillion briefly in 2018. Amazon shares rose to 9.9%, its largest one-day percentage increase since October 2017. The stock hit a record after reporting what analysts at Robert W. Baird &amp;Co;. called it an \"impressive quarter from top to bottom.\"<br/>Visa and Mastercard revenue almost doubled in the last five fiscal years to nearly 23 billion and 17 billion, respectively, according to Refinitiv data. Adjusted earnings per share more than doubled for both companies during that period.<br/>Visa reported quarterly revenue slightly below analyst estimates, a day after Mastercard exceeded quarterly earnings estimates.<br/>According to Lisa Ellis, analyst at MoffettNathanson, about 43% of consumer purchases worldwide, except China, are made through a digital payment method, up from 28% in 2010. \"Globally, we still have five to 10 years of penetration,\" he said.<br/>Visa holds a 60% stake in the credit and debit card market, followed by Mastercard with 30%, according to Ellis, with American Express far behind with 8.5%.<br/>Despite their importance in finance, Visa and Mastercard are considered part of the S&amp;P; 500's information technology sector.<br/>While Apple, Microsoft and chip companies like Intel Corp often garn much of the attention, Visa and Mastercard have been a key factor in recovering technology stocks.<br/>The breakthrough of Visa and Mastercard's stock has taken place under a bull market that lasts more than 10 years in the United States and profits could be mitigated if there is a recession. Stocks began 2020 strongly, but have dropped somewhat because of concerns about the spread of a virus from China.<br/>According to Ellis, risks to companies include increased competition in the payments sectorby big tech companies, as well as stricter regulations from governments around the world that could make access difficult.<br/>Against this back, companies have not stood still. Earlier this month, Visa agreed to buy Plaid Inc for $5.3 billion to increase its access to financial technology, and in August Mastercard acquired most of the corporate services businesses of the Nets Scandinavian payments group for about $3,190 Million.

As a result, our competitiveness is getting impacted,\" she said.H-1B visa regulations require the employer to pay the visa processing fees, and while these fees have been steadily rising, so have the number of visa denials.There have been instances where visa extension requests were denied for not meeting the conditions required, even though the initial visa had been granted under the same conditions, Khadakban said.This has made it difficult for these firms to plan deployments at clients, with some clients now preferring to not contract H-1B workers because of the uncertainty. In some cases, companies have started sending work outside the US since they cannot meet the talent requirements locally.Earlier this year, staffing firms filed over 40 lawsuits against the USCIS under the banner of the ITServe Alliance, challenging the visa denials.Their key contention is that the USCIS has been interpreting the regulations guiding the visa process incorrectly over the past few years.\"The courts have overturned about 90% of the visa denial cases as they do meet the regulatory requirements,\" said Gopi Kandukuri, national president, IT Serve Alliance.The ITServe Alliance is an association of IT services, staffing and consulting firms. It has over 1,100 member firms, employing over 70,000 people across the US and India, doing combined business worth $5 billion.

The exact number of these on H-1B visas is not available.</p><p>The increased demand for people with digital technology skills and low unemployment rates in the US, however, mean there is a dearth of local tech talent.</p><p>IT consultants have seen a much higher denial rate \u2014 as high as 40% compared to 1% for other big tech companies like Microsoft Corp., Google and Amazon.com. This includes IT services firms like Tata Consultancy Services and Cognizant, as well as smaller staffing firms that provide contract workers to enterprises.</p><p>While visa costs had gone up, companies have been required to file a fresh application every time the person is deployed at another client location, said Deepali Khadakban, CEO, Precision Technologies Corporation.</p><p>In case of visa denials, there is no way of offsetting the costs incurred. \u201cThis has had a huge financial impact and we cannot pass on these costs to the client. At the same time, there is uncertainty over whether we'd get the visa approval or not. As a result, our competitiveness is getting impacted,\u201d she said.</p><p>H-1B visa regulations require the employer to pay the visa processing fees, and while these fees have been steadily rising, so have the number of visa denials.</p><p>There have been instances where visa extension requests were denied for not meeting the conditions required, even though the initial visa had been granted under the same conditions, Khadakban said.</p><p>This has made it difficult for these firms to plan deployments at clients, with some clients now preferring to not contract H-1B workers because of the uncertainty. In some cases, companies have started sending work outside the US since they cannot meet the talent requirements locally.</p><p>Earlier this year, staffing firms filed over 40 lawsuits against the USCIS under the banner of the ITServe Alliance, challenging the visa denials.</p><p>Their key contention is that the USCIS has been interpreting the regulations guiding the visa process incorrectly over the past few years. \u201cThe courts have overturned about 90% of the visa denial cases as they do meet the regulatory requirements,\u201d said Gopi Kandukuri, national president, ITServe Alliance.</p><p>The ITServe Alliance is an association of IT services, staffing and consulting firms.

Good morning, everybody. I think we're going to go ahead and get started here. I'm Jason Kupferberg, the payments processors and IT services analyst here at Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch. And we're very excited to have Visa with us today. We have Jack Forestell, who is Chief Product Officer at the company. We also have Will Masterson representing Investor Relations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So Jack, thanks very much for being here. We appreciate it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JACK FORESTELL: Thanks for having me.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>JASON ALAN KUPFERBERG: I'm going to go through a bunch of questions, and we'll certainly be looking for questions from the audience as well. So maybe just to kick off since it's kind of topical and recent on Friday, there was obviously news of a Visa service outage over in Europe. What can you tell us about what exactly happened, how it got resolved? What was kind of the root cause?</p><p>JACK FORESTELL: Sure, and I'm glad you asked it right up front, Jason. It's something we're taking incredibly seriously. And first, let me just say we view it as our job to provide the safest, most secure, most convenient, most reliable, most resilient payment services on Earth. And for a few hours on Friday in a few of our European markets, we fell short of our own high standards that we set for ourselves and the standards that our clients and our consumers set for us. Look, we have teams right now hard at work getting to every detail of exactly what happened. I know there are a lot of questions, and many of you probably have read a little about it. I can provide what I know, a little bit more context on what happened. So sometime late morning U.K. time, we had a switch failure, a hardware switch failure in our data center in Europe. Now as you recall, we recently acquired a while back Visa Europe, and we're in the process of integrating Visa Europe into Visa. The switch failure was in the legacy Visa Europe environment. As you might expect, when you have a switch failure -- we have 2 data centers in Europe in the legacy environment. When that's which failed, as you would expect, there was fail -- real-time failover to another data center. The problem occurred when that data center and the switch in that data center did not come fully up to capacity. And so what actually happened, it wasn't a hard down or an outage, it was a constriction of capacity that occurred in that second data center. And as that happened and the transactions flowed through and we were only at partial capacity, and we had variability in the latency, transactions piled up, queued up, and many transactions were either dropped or declined. The rates of that were more significant up front early in the event. And as the teams worked to bring the capacity up through the course of the day, it got better. And finally shortly after 9 p.m. British time, system returned to normal and it's been normal ever since. And as I said, we still have people working to understand better exactly why the switch failed, exactly why the secondary site didn't come up in the way that it should have.</p><p>JASON ALAN KUPFERBERG: So it doesn't sound like it was directly related to the IT migration that's going on because you said this occurred in the legacy environment?</p><p>JACK FORESTELL: Right.</p><p>JASON ALAN KUPFERBERG: Okay, okay. That's very helpful. Thanks for verifying it. I know that yesterday, you had some interesting announcement, the Money 20/20 in Europe, big new investment, $100 million in FinTech, and also opening up the Visa Network a bit more broadly. Maybe talk a little bit about that, what kind of motivated you guys to make the announcement and the strategic rationale behind it?</p><p>JACK FORESTELL: Sure. We're excited about it. We're open for business for FinTechs. And we've been partnering with FinTech companies in this market for some time now. We got great partnerships with companies like Square and Stripe and Marqeta, Pay -- you name it. But we want to make sure that we plant a flag out there that tells the whole world that we are open for FinTech partnership the world over. And as you're all aware, there's a lot going on right now in the European landscape with respect to open banking. Regulation is really driving a lot of activity. There are a lot of small companies out there developing great, new products and services in the payments space, and we absolutely want to partner with them. As you sort of referred to, Jason, there are 2 pieces of what we announced the other day. One piece was fast onboarding, kind of what we've internally colloquially referred to as FinTech in a box. We opened our developer center 2 years ago, exposed web services to partners. They can get on board and experiment with Visa. But we did find to get into production as a small company with Visa was just too hard. So we've created a process for fast onboarding. FinTech partners can get on the wire at Visa with this new process in less than a month. Obviously, they can get up to scale in testing and experimenting a lot faster than that. So we're excited about that. And then the second part of it was we're interested in making investments strategically in up-and-coming companies who've got great technology and great new services that are going to help us create the leading edge payment experiences that we're in the business of creating. So that's where the $100 million came from. One more data is, I keep getting asked, \"Why only in Europe?\" And my answer to that is, it's beginning in Europe. As I've said, we've been doing this in the U.S. for a while. We absolutely want to expand globally with everything that's going on with PSD2 and open banking in Europe. We thought it was a great place to start, but we'll expand beyond Europe very quickly.</p><p>JASON ALAN KUPFERBERG: So let me step back for a second, ask a kind of a bigger picture question. So your title is Chief Product Officer. I think that includes oversight of all Visa's strategic partnerships. But just tell us a little bit about what are really your top 3 priorities, let's say, on your agenda in this role?</p><p>JACK FORESTELL: Yes, sure. I'll manage it in a slightly different way. But the Chief Product Officer thing is -- I'm excited about it. It's a new thing for me. And I'd say it's sort of part of our journey in moving from card network to technology platform solutions company. And so historically, we've had our assets kind of distributed throughout the company. We have of our core payment processing rails in one place, value-added services in another place, solutions teams in another place, partnership teams in another place. And what we've just done recently is we have brought that all together. And the idea is look, we're a tech platform. We got to have the best payment rails and the best underlying chassis there is in the business. We've then got to add services on top of that. So we've brought the core platform team together with the teams that are building and expanding our inventory of services. And then we also brought together the teams around the world who are working hand in glove with our clients to build solutions on top of that platform along with our partnership and business development teams. So I'm excited about bringing it all together and having one integrated vision and one integrated team for how we deliver those new solutions.</p><p>JASON ALAN KUPFERBERG: It seems like Visa's attitude towards partnering with others in the ecosystem has evolved a bit over the last couple of years, maybe become a little bit more open, if you will. So just wanted to get your take on that. To what extent has that been kind of a conscious decision? Maybe the Visa-PayPal partnership being the best example of that over the last couple of years. So just share with us some perspective on what's driving that shift and approach at Visa? And do we expect that to continue going forward?</p><p>JACK FORESTELL: Yes, I don't know if we've sort of rethought how important partnership is at Visa. I mean, if you think of our business model, we kind of sit in the middle of thousands of partnerships that help us scale globally to 3 billion consumers and 46 million merchants. So partnership's kind of been at the core for this company's been doing for 60 years. I think what's happened in the last few years is that we're reimagining the breadth and the nature of those partnerships. It certainly still a very strong set of partnerships with our issuing banks, our acquiring banks processors. But increasingly, it's partnerships with FinTechs that we just talked about and big tech companies like PayPal, like Google, like Apple, you name it. These players are important players in the payments ecosystem and we need to be actively engaged with them. You mentioned the PayPal partnership. They're a great partner, one of the strongest partnerships that we have right now. If anything, they certainly initiate a heck of a lot of Visa payments. So we like them a lot.</p><p>JASON ALAN KUPFERBERG: One of the products we get asked a lot about is Visa Direct. And I know that the company has started talking a little bit more about it in recent quarters. So maybe if you can just talk about sort of the road map for that product? Really how you see the use cases for Visa Direct evolving and then kind of the broader strategy that Visa has employed here, kind of building a product as opposed to making a sizable acquisition as Mastercard obviously bought Vocalink, so there's a little bit of disparity in strategy and approach there. So would love some thoughts.</p><p>JACK FORESTELL: Yes, look, we realized years ago that there are a set of use cases out there that are better served when a consumer or a small business can initiate a payment and have that payment pushed to their counterparty. Our model is typically that the consumer allows the counterparty to initiate a pull payment from their account. And that's fundamental difference between the historic payments that have gone over card networks and push payments, or what we call Visa Direct. And real-time payment platforms are growing around the world. Real-time ACH is coming to a market near you, if it's not already there, I would project it's going to be soon. And so we realized we need to offer a competitive and viable push payment service to satisfy use cases from P2P to low cost acquiring in emerging markets, you name it, there are a lot of use cases. And we stared at the assets that we had and realized, wow, if you really get down to a real-time payment platform, real-time ACH, it's essentially just a straight account to account transaction, so it's settlement service that happens in real time. We can replicate the same thing. We actually have that capability. There's a little bit of work to do on the part of our issuers in order to make it absolutely real-time, but on top of that, we then have the whole array of Visa value-added services that can run atop -- across the top of that transaction, whether it's fraud liability transaction, fraud risk monitoring, disputes, chargebacks, the whole Visa works when you kind of go over these transactions, which isn't the case with the basic account-to-account transactions. So we love Visa Direct. As a platform, we think it's a better product than what you can get with a basic ACH transaction. We're working hard on it. We've got about 1 billion cards enabled for Visa Direct right now globally. I think we're on track to be about 1.5 billion by the end of the year, probably 2 billion on into 2019. So it's -- I'd like to think that's decent scale when you get into the billions.</p><p>JASON ALAN KUPFERBERG: And are the transaction counts kind of scaling in line with your expectations so far?</p><p>JACK FORESTELL: Yes, we're actually -- we're very much tracking along with our expectations, a lot of work with partners out there to take up the service. We got a lot of people excited about it, inventing the use cases. It's a little bit back to what I was saying before, those are core rails. We're adding a little bit of set of services specifically for those push transactions on top and then partnering with people all throughout the ecosystem to have them create new payment experiences and use cases for it. So yes, we're pretty excited about it.</p><p>JASON ALAN KUPFERBERG: How should we think about faster ACH? Maybe let's just use the U.S. as an example since it's common, right? It's not quite here yet, but it's common. And from what we hear, maybe another 12 to 18 months, a lot of banks will actually be up and running on it. Is that going to pose a threat to Visa Direct?</p><p>JACK FORESTELL: Yes, look, I always know that competition is healthy. And so would fast ACH be viewed as a competitor to Visa Direct? Sure. But at the same, I think the advent of fast ACH in the U.S. will also create much more awareness about the ability to transfer off of check and wire and slow ACH and cash and all manner of other payments, which are really where we're trying to grab the growth from anyway. So frankly, in a way, the more the merrier. If we can raise awareness about it, I like our chances given everything I was just talking about and the value-added services that we've got in Visa Direct relative to a basic ACH payment.</p><p>JASON ALAN KUPFERBERG: So essentially, the pie will get bigger, right? So okay. Let's switch gears and talk about the single payment button that everyone...</p><p>JACK FORESTELL: Yes, we're excited about that.</p><p>JASON ALAN KUPFERBERG: Is very excited about. The whole secure remote commerce framework. Maybe for those who are a little bit less familiar with some of the background, maybe say a little bit about what SRC is and how Visa is participating and then ultimately, how this is expected to manifest itself in terms of a unified payment button that seems to be maybe the next evolution, if you will, of kind of Visa's online checkout strategy.</p><p>JACK FORESTELL: Yes. Well, look, here's where I'd start. I'd say if you look at what we and the ecosystem accomplished at the point of sale, right, we get tremendous scale and reach and coverage at the physical point of sale. And part of the reason that occurred was we had incredibly strong standards, right? The standards that governed the interface, how a terminal looks and felt and worked, how a card looked and felt and what it was equipped with and then how those things interoperate with each other, how consumers authenticate themselves and how the data moves through the system. Those things in the physical space were all very precisely prescribed. And that enabled everybody to know what they were doing, get together, and make the thing work at global scale. In digital commerce, the same isn't true and it hasn't been true for the whole digital commerce journey so far. And look, we've done very well at the digital commerce, when a payment transfers from face-to-face to digital, we do even better. But at the same time, it's lacked those standards to make it easy for merchants and easy for consumers. And we've been working now for years to really try to drive us in the industry to a common set of standards. So we're really excited about secure remote commerce. That's what it essentially is. It's a set of standards to help us to get to scale in digital payments. And there are 3 elements to the standard. Everyone does love talking about the button, that's an important piece. But there's a set of standards around the user experience to create commonality there, make it more easy and intuitive for consumers. They see a common button and they know that common mark, they know what to do. Easier for merchants, acquirers, gateways, carts to integrate. Integrate once instead of integrating 6 times. Makes a ton of sense, it's what happens at the physical point of sale. But it's not just the user experience standards, it's is also standards around customer authentication and the data payload that needs to get passed from merchant back to issuer to ensure the customer is who they say they are and to give us better odds of authenticating that individual. And it's also a set of standards around securing the payload, the transaction itself, what data goes in there and how it's secured by an EMVco cryptographic standards. So it's all 3 pieces coming together, and we're excited about it. We're hopeful that we can get to work in converting our own experience. Visa Checkout, over to it a little bit later this year. We'll see when the detailed specs come out from the EMVco.</p><p>JASON ALAN KUPFERBERG: Is that the next milestone, the EMVco specs?</p><p>JACK FORESTELL: Yes.</p><p>JASON ALAN KUPFERBERG: And those are expected when?</p><p>JACK FORESTELL: Hopefully, late summer, fall.</p><p>JASON ALAN KUPFERBERG: Okay. Okay. So if we kind of fast forward to this future state where you've got the specs, and then go through the process of coding to the specs, does the Visa Checkout brand that we've been accustomed to seeing in the online world, does that brand continue to survive? Or does that brand itself change in terms of what the consumer sees behind a unified payment button, which I guess would initiate the online checkout? I'm just trying to kind of envision the consumer experience.</p><p>JACK FORESTELL: Yes, Well, first of all, with respect to exactly how the common experience will show up in the beginning, no decisions have been made, no specs have been published. So I can't tell you exactly how, who's brand will show up in exact ways at the beginning of it. What I will say though is, look, as we've worked with partners in the payment facilitation space, acquirers, gateways, merchants, we find that our partners love the Visa brand, intend to, want to showcase it prominently throughout the payments experience, whether it's at the beginning, in the middle or at the end. Because it represents back to the consumer exactly what I talked about at the very beginning of this, which is safe, secure, fast, reliable and that we've got your back. And so I fully expect that you should see the Visa brand interwoven through transactions on a common button as much or more than you did through a single button.</p><p>JASON ALAN KUPFERBERG: What have you heard so far from merchants? Obviously, they're a key constituency in all of this. I think initially maybe, there was a press release from one of the merchant organizations saying, \"Hey, look, we want to make sure we're involved and we have input into the standards,\" et cetera. I mean, do you see that as a significant stumbling block to get all this done? Or has there been some initial partnering there involving the merchants?</p><p>JACK FORESTELL: Look, we want input and collaboration from everyone, including merchants. So we absolutely want merchant feedback. We have consulted with our merchant partners throughout the course of this. I'd say, the general consensus is optimism around the ease and convenience of integrating to a single button with the common experience that consumers are going to be able to intuitively understand. But if I were a merchant, I'd say, \"Hey, it sounds like a great plan.\" Let me wait and see when the specs come out and I'll do my integration and we'll see what happens.</p><p>JASON ALAN KUPFERBERG: And I guess the idea would be that this would be easier for merchants, right? Because instead 6 different button providers coming to them and saying, \"Code to us, code to us, code to us,\" you essentially code to one standard and then I guess the merchant can decide which specific buttons, if you will, they wanted to have available underneath the single button, or something to that effect.</p><p>JACK FORESTELL: That's exactly right.</p><p>JASON ALAN KUPFERBERG: Okay, okay. So we look forward to that. On a related topic, let's talk a little bit about W3C standards. And maybe you can just level set from the audience by talking about what W3C is as kind of a standards body, because I think there's some awareness but not full understanding in the marketplace. And then how that dovetails with some industry announcements we've seen recently from the likes of Google. And we'll probably have a couple of questions underneath that thought.</p><p>JACK FORESTELL: Yes, sure. So to start, W3C is the standards body that sets standards for web browsers. They've recently developed a set of APIs for payments, a set of API standards. Payment request is kind of the core standards. And the intent of it, just to keep it simple, is to make it easy for merchants to integrate payments from a browser into their website. Our view is -- and probably predictable by now as we've been talking. But look, it's an open standard. It's meant to make things easier for merchants. At this point in history, the payments that sit in the back end of that standard are card network payments, so things that make it easier and faster for more digital commerce to happen. And they get people a path to card-based payments. We're fans of those open standards. Now we've been developing the SRC standards in parallel, but separately from the W3C standards. The SRC standards I just described go beyond browser and are applicable to all digital payments. And as I said, they cover not only the user experience piece, but also the authentication and the tokenization pieces. So there's still a lot of work left to do, but I'm hopeful that we can see a dovetailing of those 2 standards, and that eventually, a W3C payment request can incorporate the SRC standards into it.</p><p>JASON ALAN KUPFERBERG: Questions from the audience for Jack? Can we get a microphone up here and then one in the middle, please, as well?</p><p>COLIN R. DUCHARME, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF EQUITY OPPORTUNITIES &amp; SENIOR EQUITY ANALYST, STERLING CAPITAL MANAGEMENT LLC: Colin Ducharme with Sterling Capital. Regarding the B2B market, the networks have talked a lot about the opportunity there. Al Kelly has mentioned the travel and procurement probably, the easier wins, and I would view those as kind of the card-able opportunities, B2B payment types. But just curious in your role as head of products for the noncarded payment types, what sorts of product strategies is Visa bringing to market to attack that opportunity? And then from the outside looking in, how can we kind of measure the success in the near term?</p><p>JACK FORESTELL: Yes. Look, there's -- I don't want to dismiss the card-able space. There's still a lot of runway left there and a lot of opportunity for us in verticals like the ones you mentioned to drive more volume. If you look at the overall opportunity, the noncard-able piece of B2B payments is obviously a much more significant piece of what happens. That said, a lot of those are very large institution-to-institution payments. So somewhere in the middle where you get to sort of medium-sized enterprise business-to-business payments, that's, I think, the sweet spot that we're going after. And there, we're developing straight-through processing solutions. We're leveraging much of the same backbone technology as Visa Direct to be able to initiate -- enable businesses to initiate push payments from one business to another business. We're starting with use cases like insurance, is an easy one where we can offer a service for insurance companies to make disbursements to claimants or other partners via the straight through processing service. Look, it's still early days so I'm not sure what to tell you in terms of, like, how you are going to be able to check on our progress on it. It's probably not something that we're going to hang out a shingle on just yet, but stay tuned.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Similar topic -- or same topic. You think back, I think it was 2009, '10, you guys did a partnership with Syncada, USB. What is it, as you see at the bottleneck that's kind of preventing B2B from taking off faster? I would have thought given the lack of penetration, by now, there'd be more growth. And I'm just curious how you see the bottlenecks there and what you can do to push those aside?</p><p>JACK FORESTELL: Look, it's a complicated space. The fluidity of change when you're talking about institution-to-institution type payments as opposed to when you're talking about the world of consumer and digital, and digital platforms, the pace is just different. The inertia is different. And so while we as consumers can switch our behavior to operating via a mobile device and clicking, collecting our coffee and paying for it digitally whereas we wouldn't have imagined that a few years ago. When I'm operating the AR or the AP function inside of a company and I've got it wired up with an ERP platform and I've got those connections premade with wire and check and I've got a treasury with someone, there's just a lot of work to do to close the sale. And then there's a lot of work to do after that to get the change happening. So it's a lot more trench warfare that just scales less quickly than what we see as digital sort of seeps the consumer space.</p><p>JASON ALAN KUPFERBERG: Other questions? Let me just ask you one follow-on that. I mean, I guess, we've always thought that part of the challenge in B2B is trying to make kind of the traditional interchange model really transfer over. I mean, is that a genuine challenge? I mean, maybe I'm oversimplifying it, but if I think about, just take the average kind of small business, if you will, and I'm buying $50,000 worth of equipment from another small business, I don't want to pay $500 to complete that transaction. Is that an oversimplistic way of looking at it? Or is that part of the inherent challenge here of how do you find kind of a happy medium between, like, checks or a slow ACH versus what we might be able to offer in the future?</p><p>JACK FORESTELL: Yes, look, it's a component of it. But in my experience, having tested a lot of solutions in the space, solving that problem by itself does not -- is not adequate. You've got to get to the core of all of the other pieces. You've got to make it easy to have the payment service integrated into whether you're a large enterprise and you've got an ERP platform, or whether you're a small restaurant and you have an ERP platform that's designed specifically for you. The integration has to happen into those platforms. It's got to be simple. You've got to be able to understand it. You've got to have counterparties on the other side that can take the payments. So there's a lot of complexity to get through beyond just the pricing piece, which is a component of it, but frankly, that's probably a little easier to solve than some of the other parts.</p><p>JASON ALAN KUPFERBERG: We continue to get asked a lot about the broader competitive landscape in payments and perhaps sort of nontraditional competitors. Amazon is certainly one that always is fun to talk about and no shortage of headlines there. Relatively recently, some talk about maybe a checking account-like product coming from them, detail's a little bit sketchy. But would just love your perspective since you kind of see everything in the ecosystem. What do you think perhaps their endgame in payments may be? What do you think about kind of what they've done so far? Obviously, they've got an online checkout button. They've got some actual card products, private label and co-brand. So would just love your perspective on how you think they may be viewing their longer-term role in payments? Are they more kind of an enabler, a disrupter?</p><p>JACK FORESTELL: You got a lot of -- a lot packed in there, Jason.</p><p>JASON ALAN KUPFERBERG: Yes, exactly. Well, it's not an earnings call. I get to ask all the questions.</p><p>JACK FORESTELL: First, the Amazon. They're a great partner. I think Amazon and Visa have an incredibly symbiotic relationship. Amazon has done a lot for the growth of digital payments globally. And I think Visa and card networks have done a lot for Amazon in enabling a simple, friction-free experience for them as they have driven that growth. So it's yin and yang, it works well, and we're huge fans of Amazon. With respect to Amazon's aspirations in banking and payments, look, I read the same things you read. So it's probably a question that's better posed to the Amazon team. But look, here's I guess how I'd take a run at that one is if -- we've seen other non-FI players enter the banking space to varying degrees of success over the years. If I were a non-FI player looking at getting into the space, I think I'd probably be looking at trying to find the partnership assets out there that give me the best chance of creating the best product and the best customer experience that I could create. And I'd say beyond being a great tech company, Amazon is a great customer experience company. I think if I were in those shoes, I'd be looking at partnerships with banks. I'd be looking at partnerships with payment networks. If I want to offer a card product to my consumers, I want to offer them the one they want. And I say this to our co-brand partners all the time, \"Look, if you want offer your consumers a payment vehicle that they want, don't listen to me. Go ask them and watch what they do. Your customers want a Visa card.\" So we'll see if the rumors are true, if any of that plays out. But that's how I would think about it if I were sitting on the other side.</p><p>JASON ALAN KUPFERBERG: What about private label, more broadly? I mean, private-label cards have been around forever, I think, longer than Visa cards, actually. But clearly, more and more different types of merchants seem to be promoting their own types of private-label cards. And again, Amazon is one of those as well for their Prime consumers. And the Target REDcard, another example, I guess. I mean, has Visa changed its view at all in terms of just kind of competitive threat from these products? Because it seems like maybe the value proposition that they're trying to offer consumers is maybe a little bit richer, at least in some cases, than it's been in the past. Would you agree with that premise or...</p><p>JACK FORESTELL: Look, you mentioned it, private-label cards have been around for a very, very long time. So I haven't seen any abrupt changes in the relative share of open-loop and network-based cards relative to private-label in the last decade or so. And so look, I think, private-label cards play a role. They will be around for a really long time. As you mentioned, there are merchant partners out there who emphasized them. They use them as a platform to deliver value back to their consumers in ways that they can't or don't through other vehicles. And that's great. Again, more things that draw consumers into digital payments, that draw consumers into network payments, that displace cash, that habituate consumers to using electronic and digital payments, all good with us. I like our chances at being competitive with private-label given the value-added services we have and the 46 million outlets where you can use a Visa card relative to a private-label card.</p><p>JASON ALAN KUPFERBERG: Right, right. It's a strong value proposition. And I guess, that sort of begs the bigger picture question, which is the competitive moat that everyone always talks about with Visa and with Mastercard as well. What really does keep you guys up at night when you think about out-of-the-box types of scenarios where the traditional networks could get \"disrupted?\" What really worries you longer term in theory, and how do you try and stay one step ahead?</p><p>JACK FORESTELL: Look, we've got an incredibly resilient business model. It's really stood the test of time and it's supported by really strong secular growth. We also have kind of what I think as somewhat of a strategic runway where we can see developments across the industry, across the world. And we have the time to react to them. Lot -- we get asked a lot about, what about Alipay, what about WeChat? Are those models going to come to a market near you anytime soon? I won't get into a long discourse about that, but look, there's a set of circumstances that emerged in China that are incredibly unique. We are starting to see those players spill outside of China, but we've had time to develop our own competitive response. We're building out the push payment service. We're building out QR code standards. And we're starting to enable those standards in emerging markets in the regions where those competitors are spilling out. The keeping up at night one is probably just a little bit more around the pace of regulatory change around the world. And again, we invest significantly to partner with governments around the world to keep governments informed, to partner with governments. But there can always be a little bit more unpredictability when it comes to the regulatory side of things. And that's -- that one makes it a little harder to react to.</p><p>JASON ALAN KUPFERBERG: When you think about product strategy taking, let's just say, a 3- to 5-year view out, and you think about the classic sort of buy versus build decisions, I mean, it feels like, obviously, putting Visa Europe on the side, Visa has not been very acquisitive in recent years. There was a period post-IPO where there was a decent pace of M&amp;A. And then it seems like we've transitioned more towards more the build versus the buy. Where are we now? Are we pretty comfortable with this sort of organic reinvestment? Or might we see some resurgence of acquisition activity?</p><p>JACK FORESTELL: Yes, I think we are pretty comfortable. And look, I'll give you the product guy answer to your question. When a look at it, I love our core platform. I want that to be the highest-performing, safest, most secure platform in the world. I think we're good at that. I also wanted to have the most feature-rich set of services to enable partners and developers to come on to our platform and build new solutions. That's where I'd say, look, we're building new services at a breakneck pace, but we're under no illusion that we're the only ones in the world who have good enough ideas to attach to our own platform. So we're very much in the market to add products and service on to the platform through acquisition. Obviously, we've been very diligent in the way we think that through and what we do there. So it's probably a balance.</p><p>JASON ALAN KUPFERBERG: How are you preparing for Internet of Things? It seems like Visa and others in the payments space should certainly have a play there, right, just with all the connected devices that are coming down the pike. But how much of a focus is it that internally? I mean, do you have a dedicated team underneath you that just thinks about IoT? Or how do you address the opportunity?</p><p>JACK FORESTELL: Yes, look, IoT is just nothing but goodness as far as I'm concerned. In fact, look, when a payment moves from physical space to digital space, our sort of share of transaction volume almost doubles. And IoT is sort of a vehicle for fueling an explosion in the endpoints that can take a payment. The way we think about it though it is more like these are hardware devices that are going to be sitting everywhere around the world. What really powers the hardware devices though is software. And so our job, as we see it, is to ensure that is easy to integrate Visa payment services into the software that runs on those IoT devices. So we're working hard to ensure that we're easy to get integrated into voice-based AI platforms that are going to power a ton of IoT devices, that were easy to integrate into connected car platforms, that were easy to integrate into basic card on file using the SRC platform that I described. If you want to make a payment on the scooter that you rode here today or on the bike, it's going to be a card on file payment that's delivered by an SRC experience. So there are some use cases when you get into certain types of IoT, like wearables, where you might want to make a transaction happen at the physical point of sale. That's where we have to interact with the hardware with a program called Visa Ready that we've built out to enable smaller players in the wearable space to be able to quickly on board and connect payments to those kind of devices. So we're absolutely excited about it, thinking about it, and we have a team of people working on it.</p><p>JASON ALAN KUPFERBERG: Terrific. I think we're going to leave it there. Thank you very much.</p><p>JACK FORESTELL: All right. Thank you. Thanks, Jason.

Excellent. Okay. Welcome everybody to our lunchtime keynote presentation of the Goldman SachsTechnology and Internet Conference. My name is Jim Schneider. I cover the payments space here at Goldman on the research side. And it's my pleasure to introduce Visa and the President of Visa, Ryan McInerney.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Welcome back, Ryan. Thanks for being here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">RYAN M. MCINERNEY, PRESIDENT, VISA INC.: Thanks for having me.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>JAMES EDWARD SCHNEIDER: You've been the president of Visa for about 6 years now. Maybe just start off on a very, very broad strategic level. When you look back at what the company has achieved over the past 6 years, what's the top thing that you think has been transformational to the company's success? And what's that going to be 10 years from now?</p><p>RYAN M. MCINERNEY: I think the thing that we've accomplished that's going to have the biggest impact 10 years from now has been -- is the opening up of our network. If you go back in time 10 years ago, Visa was a closed architecture technology platform that largely distributed debit card, credit card products to clients. What we've been working on over the past 6 years has been to fundamentally change that, to open up our network and make it a commerce platform that anyone on the seller side of the ecosystem or the buyer side of the ecosystem can innovate on and build products on. Part of it's been about opening up our technology platform, VisaNet, and taking all of the services that we enable inside of VisaNet and turning those into easy-to-consume APIs that can be accessed by developers anywhere around the world. But more so it's been about opening up the ecosystem and enabling a lot of the different players that are innovating and delivering new commerce experiences to use our network as a commerce platform. And it's changed our business in significant ways. And I think it's changed how commerce is working around the world in ways that we're still seeing great examples of. And what happens is when we open up the network, we find that there's lots and lots of people around the world that are able to innovate with our APIs and our services in ways that we never would've thought of. They're able to take what we delivered as a merchant API to create better information for issuers on transactions and turn it into a data stream that prefills applications for small businesses when they apply for loans and take our alerts API and turn it into a way to provide digital receipts and so on and so forth, creating much richer and better commerce experiences.</p><p>JAMES EDWARD SCHNEIDER: That's great. And then maybe if you think more short term over the next year, what are the top 2 or 3 strategic priorities for the company?</p><p>RYAN M. MCINERNEY: So one is Europe. I mean, Europe is an enormous opportunity for us, now we're having the privilege to own the Visa Europe franchise. We just see significant opportunities in Europe. But putting Europe aside and talking more broadly about the company around the world, 3 sets of things that we're very, very focused on. One is expanding our client base, expanding the partners that we do business with, working with new FinTech players that are innovating on the buyer experiences and the buyer side of the equation, working with new B2B players in terms of creating different business models and value propositions that can simplify and streamline B2B payments and ultimately drive a significant volume over our network. I was just meeting with Flint Lane, who's probably in the room because we were just meeting together. Billtrust is a great partner of ours where we've just launched what's really going to be a revolutionary way, we think, for B2B payments to happen, in the business payments network. And that's an example of expanding our partner and client base. That's one. The second priority for us is -- it's about capturing new flows. We have this great network that we've built over many, many years. It's got scale. It's got broad-based acceptance. And what we're finding is creating new use cases, new products, new relationships, new partners -- new partnerships is able to -- we're able to create lots of new flows over the network. B2B is an example that I just mentioned. Push Payments and our Visa Direct product, which, if you want to talk about it, we can talk about as another example. And then the third priority for us at Visa is about continuing to expand the products, the solutions and the services that we deliver to our partners and our clients that help them run their business better. We have a whole series of businesses and teams that come into work every day and they're focused on how can they help our clients and our partners do more effective commerce. We have a rich suite of risk solutions. For example, we have a Visa Advanced Authorization product that helps issuers score transactions in real time with over 500 pieces of data every second all around the world. We also have a Decision Manager Product that helps sellers determine whether or not a transaction is risky or not and hopefully, authorize more transactions. We have a great set of loyalty products. I rode over here in an Uber today because it's pouring out as you know and actually paid for the ride using points that I'd accumulated from a rewards program that we designed and a loyalty platform that we built for Uber, called Visa Local Offers that allows me to earn Uber points every time I spend money at merchants and sellers all around San Francisco. We have big businesses focused on acceptance. CyberSource, which is the largest gateway provider in the world that's helping e-commerce merchants really deliver their entire value proposition all around the world. We have an issuer processing business, one of the biggest issuer processing platforms called Visa DPS that helps our issuing clients do everything from send out electronic statements to answer the phones and everything in between. We also have a great set of data solutions. We're working with issuers and sellers all around the world on all types of different ways to enhance their businesses and their -- kind of intelligence of how they run their business. And then finally, we have teams of consultants and data analysts as part of our Visa Consulting and Analytics business in countries all around the world, working hand-in-hand with our clients to help them with all of the different various aspects of their business that they run every day. So a third priority of continuing to expand all of the different product solutions and services that we deliver is a really important priority for us. But in large part, it's important because it helps our clients do what they do better.</p><p>JAMES EDWARD SCHNEIDER: Yes. And there's a lot of exciting issues there. I do want to also focus on the consumer for a second because clearly, as we all know, consumer growth on the payments side has been -- this is the strongest it's been in years over the past year and you're in a very well positioned place to look at all those transactions on a real time basis. I think your guidance and outlook for payments volume growth this year is in the low double-digit range and that's despite the fact that you're lapping some pretty difficult comps. So can you kind of give us some color about, globally, what you see in terms of the regions, the corridors and spending trends and what's happening?</p><p>RYAN M. MCINERNEY: Yes. I think just kind of from a macro point of view, the spending trends continue to be reasonably robust around the world. In this last quarter, we saw acceleration in spending in the CEMEA region, in the Asia-Pacific region, if you exclude China, as well as in Latin America. Looking at the rest of the world, we saw some slight deceleration in Europe, in Canada and United States. And if you look, kind of if you equalize it for Visa-specific factors, it was kind of about a point plus or minus in those markets, but still at reasonably strong levels. I'd also say we had a reasonably good holiday season both in the U.S. and in other markets around the world. In the U.S., again, if you just kind of normalize out all of the Visa factors and focus really on Americans and how did their spending look during November and December in this country, it was about the same as it was last year, about 8%, which is really good growth. We have seen some changes in consumer behavior that we're keeping an eye on. One is, which will be no surprise to this group, but e-commerce just continues to -- I mean, the way we are all spending is massively changing and it is more and more and more online and on mobile devices. And the growth in e-commerce during the holiday season continued to be very, very strong. We're also seeing in the U.S. some shift in behavior towards debit or at least we did during the holiday season and some very robust growth in debit card spending in the U.S. And then finally, we saw some deceleration in the last couple of weeks of December in the U.S. We saw a rebound in January. I mean there was a lot going on as everybody in this room knows well, in the last couple of weeks of December. It definitely showed up in consumer spending. There's no doubt about it. But we've seen a nice rebound back in January.</p><p>JAMES EDWARD SCHNEIDER: That's really interesting color. And so maybe cross border for a second. That's a very important financial driver for Visa. You've been able to make sustained double-digit growth there over the past year that decelerated a little bit to 9% last quarter and then that slipped again to 6% in January, I believe. Can you maybe help us understand some of the dynamics here? How much of it's just strong dollar causing that weakness? How much is other factors? And kind of were you -- what factors are you really keeping close eye on as you look forward prospectively as what that's going to do?</p><p>RYAN M. MCINERNEY: Yes. I'll take the last part of your question, in terms of what it's going to do. I think it's too early to tell. But we've definitely seen some deceleration in cross-border spending around the world. The strengthening of the dollar has been a big factor. We've seen slowing growth of spending from inbound corridors of consumer spending into the United States. We've seen some deceleration from Asia, from Europe, from Canada, from Mexico, all big corridors into the U.S. Our cross-border business over time, which we have a lot of experience with, it'll go up and down as the strength of the dollar changes. The reverse of that, we've actually seen some good spending from all of us, outbound spending outside of the United States. But the relative size of those businesses is very, very different. Our inbound cross-border business is much bigger, just given the fact that the U.S. is a big travel destination for many people, but also is where many of the biggest e-commerce companies are based. So we're keeping a very close eye on it. We have seen some deceleration in other corridors around the world, but that inbound into the U.S. has been the biggest one. And as I said at the beginning, we're watching the data carefully. We're looking at all the corridors, all the spending by seller segment, by issuer, all those types of things. But too early to tell what's going to happen.</p><p>JAMES EDWARD SCHNEIDER: Yes. Now you've alluded to e-commerce before. Obviously, everybody here at this conference is focused on it. I believe you mentioned on the earnings call that over the holiday, it was 1/3 of your U.S. consumer spending growing more than 3x faster than all the other spend. What are the big things that investors should keep in mind about the importance of e-commerce to Visa? And what that means in terms of either spreads, ancillary revenues? And just overall, how much of it is a tailwind to you versus a headwind?</p><p>RYAN M. MCINERNEY: Well, the first thing I'd say about e-commerce is, it's a great time to be a consumer. I mean, just think about it. It's a great time to be a consumer, order online, pick up in store, order ahead, mobile commerce, tap-to-pay. Like all these different types of experiences making it much, much easier for all of us to buy and hopefully you're buying using your Visa cards. It's a very -- it's a great time to be a consumer. And e-commerce is in part what's fueling that. E-commerce is great for consumers. It's also -- it's great for Visa. When you look at kind of just the share -- our share of transactions at check out, it's about twice what it is in the physical world. So as every dollar moves from physical face-to-face spending and moves online, our share of those transactions goes up 2x, which is obviously very good for our business and good for our clients. But even beyond that, e-commerce creates all kinds of opportunity for us to help sellers and to help issuers, help them reduce fraud and increase authorizations, help them deliver all the different types of experiences I talked about, order ahead, mobile commerce, all the different pays, those different types of things. The business units that I mentioned earlier, all spend an enormous amount of resources trying to help issuers and sellers deliver great commerce experiences to all of us. And that creates an opportunity for to help our clients, but also creates a number of different revenue streams for us. So as the transaction moves from the physical world to the online world, not only do we get more than our fair share of physical payments, we also create lots of new opportunities to help clients and, therefore, create new streams of revenue.</p><p>JAMES EDWARD SCHNEIDER: Great. And then relative to e-commerce for Visa, you and other industry partners are looking to establish this idea of a common industry button for merchant websites. Can you maybe talk about why that's necessary? Why or why not it might be more successful from some of the past efforts? And what your idea of success looks like in, say, a couple of years?</p><p>RYAN M. MCINERNEY: The short answer of why we're focused on it is for all the good things I just talked about with e-commerce, in many situations, it's just still harder than it should be. A large portion of e-commerce for all of us is what we call card on file commerce. It's pretty simple. It's pretty frictionless. It's often invisible. It's a great experience. But in the U.S. and in many markets around the world, a reasonably large portion of e-commerce transactions are, what we often call, guest checkout. The experience varies based on kind of which online retailer you're buying from, but it's nowhere near as simple and easy as it should be. You're often filling out your name, your address, your 16-digit account number so on and so forth. So it's that part of the e-commerce buying experience that we're focused on with its secure remote commerce initiative. And part of it is, as you described, kind of creating what people often call is the button, but it's much more than the button. It's creating a simple, frictionless user experience where if you compare it to that guest checkout experience today, it's much, much, much better and getting close to that invisible experience that I just described. But even beyond the consumer experience, we're focused in the SRC, the Secure Remote Commerce initiative on making it safer for consumers and making it easier for both sellers and issuers to authenticate and authorize the transactions. So the technology that underlies the Secure Remote Commerce initiative is the token technology, the EMVco token technology specs. And what that technology allows merchants and issuers to do is have a lot more confidence that when Ryan is buying something at a SRC-enabled merchant, they know who Ryan is, they are able to authorize my transactions at a much, much higher rate. Their sales go up. The issuer's client is happier and has a much better customer experience and they're getting more transactions. So we're very excited about the initiative. We think it'll make commerce easier, simpler, safer and allow us to all have more of our transactions authorized. You alluded to this, there's been a lot of attempts both by us and others over the course of the last many years to accomplish these types of objectives. We feel good about what we tried. I mean, innovation is about continuing to try lots of new things, not getting stuck on what you've done, being willing to look to new alternatives, new ideas, test new things. And we hope this is going to allow us to make real good progress and making it easier for all of us to buy things online.</p><p>JAMES EDWARD SCHNEIDER: Yes. Going back to Europe. You mentioned that is a strategic priority a minute ago. You've owned Visa Europe for almost 3 years now. Obviously, a landmark transaction for the company. Maybe can you lay out for us what you see as the market opportunity in Europe over the next 5 years? And what the definition of success looks there -- looks like there as well?</p><p>RYAN M. MCINERNEY: We're very excited about the opportunities in Europe. I think the opportunities for Visa are very, very significant in Europe. Just to check in on where we are, we have been going through a technology migration in Europe to bring both Visa Europe and all of our clients and partners onto a global VisaNet technology platform, the one that I was talking about earlier. We completed that migration in September. So starting in September, all of our clients in Europe, whether they be acquirers or sellers or issuers, they're now on our global platform. What that gives us the ability to do is to deliver a lot of the solutions, the products and services that I was mentioning earlier to clients in Europe that previously had no access to them. Take the risk solutions that I mentioned earlier. We just started bringing new issuers online using the Visa Advanced Authorization scoring solution that I mentioned earlier. I think we have just 60 issuers up and running now on it. Just those 60 issuers, for when they started using that solution -- these are big sophisticated banks in Europe. Their frauds come down 6%. That's a significant improvement in fraud. And our sales teams and client teams are working with all of our issuers across Europe to bring them all up online on that risk solution. And the same thing's happening in all 6 of the different business units that I mentioned earlier. So one opportunity is helping our clients perform better, generating revenue from that as part of it. But moving beyond that, we feel now that we're really operating as one company. We have all of our clients on one global platform. We have a significant opportunity in credit, which is a product where I think we have -- we've under penetrated the market opportunity relative to our capabilities, certainly, in other markets, we're very focused on how we expand there. There are several markets where we think we have an opportunity to grow our market share overall. Commercial is a huge opportunity for us in Europe. Previously, if you go back several years when large issuers and even large corporates were making decisions about who their partners would be in the commercial space, we weren't able to bring them an integrated solution. We could go in a coordinated way with Visa Europe, but it was 2 companies, it was 2 solutions. We had to try to coordinate our best. We did the best we could, but nowhere as well as we could compete. And the last thing I mentioned on Europe is there's a lot of innovation happening with FinTechs in Europe. And for reasons that might be obvious, the Visa Europe association, which was owned by the banks a couple of years ago, they just weren't as focused on how you could enable a lot of the FinTech players in Europe to do the things that they're doing. We're very, very focused on it. So we've been having great success. We've had some big wins over the course of the last 6, 9 months in the FinTech space in Europe, and we're very focused on how do we continue to help those FinTechs create great consumer products, great consumer experiences and do it on the Visa platform.</p><p>JAMES EDWARD SCHNEIDER: Yes. And then relative to Europe, the regulatory environment has been shifting a little bit over the past several years. Maybe talk about the impact of those regulatory changes on electronic payments volume growth in Europe? And then specifically address what's the impact of the more recent cross-border interchange rules on your business heading into Europe?</p><p>RYAN M. MCINERNEY: There's been a lot of regulatory activity in Europe in payments. No question about it. I think it's too early to tell what's going to happen. As it relates to the first part of your question, this has been a whole series of regulations that have happened to interchange, the PSD2 regulations, so on and so forth. We're very focused on working with our clients in Europe to help them create products and businesses that are going to thrive in a lower interchange environment and what's going to be a much more open banking environment going forward. The PSD2 regulations, for example, have a whole bunch of provisions as it relates to Secure Customer Authentication. We're working with e-commerce players, big and small, we're working with issuers, big and small on how they can comply with the new regulations, use a series of solutions that Visa has developed to enable the consumers to have the same frictionless experiences that they've come to know and love. We're also working with a lot of our bank partners on how they can take advantage of the open banking provisions in the PSD2 regulations to create better experiences for their overall financial relationship as it relates to their clients. So it's creating a lot of different opportunities. I think the competitive playing field is going to continue to be very, very dynamic in Europe. There's going to be a lot of players that I think will be able to thrive and win share and strengthen their customer relationship as part of it. There's others that won't do as well and we want to do everything we can to work with our clients to help them succeed.</p><p>JAMES EDWARD SCHNEIDER: Yes. That's good to see. And then maybe I want to move to contactless payments for a second. I think that's -- it's fair to say that that's something that's done much better internationally outside the U.S. than here in the U.S. I think you previously said that outside the U.S., face-to-face penetration of contactless is 44%. But it seems like there's finally some needle-moving activities here in country. I think over 70 of the top 100 merchants are now accepting it and now we've seen Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America all announcing that they would be rolling out contactless physical credit and debit cards over the next year or so. Do you think we're finally at an inflection point here in terms of the adoption in the U.S.? And what does it all mean from Visa -- for Visa from an economics and growth perspective?</p><p>RYAN M. MCINERNEY: Can I start with a quick survey? I'm just curious. I'm just curious, for everybody in the room, raise your hand if you have a credit or debit card that's enabled for tap-to-pay contactless payments?</p><p>(Voting)</p><p>RYAN M. MCINERNEY: Raise them up high. That's pretty good. I'm just wondering, if we would have done this a year ago, what we would have seen. That's good. That's better than I expected. Thank you. Let me start outside the U.S. then come to the U.S. Outside the U.S., tapping to pay is increasingly becoming the default way people pay. As you said, we've got more than 4 out of every 10 transactions happening around the world are people tapping to pay. It's a significant statistic. And if you look in like Australia as the extreme, they're more than 90%, almost every Visa transaction -- face-to-face transaction that happens in Australia is tap-to-pay. And Poland is a great example. Poland, pretty soon every merchant acceptance point in Poland will be enabled for contactless. 100%. So outside the U.S., this is becoming the way people pay with Visa. And consumers love it. It's faster. It's quicker. It's easier. Sellers love it. They're able to move people through the lines more quickly. Their customers are happier. So we feel really, really good about what's happening with tap-to-pay all around the world. So now you come to the United States. I think we're doing really, really good work in the United States. The good news of having led the efforts in all these different countries around the world is we know what the adoption curve looks like. We know how consumer behavior changes. We know once that you've laid the groundwork, what can happen. And we're not at an inflection point yet, but we will be soon. In the United States, 60% of all Visa transactions, all Visa face-to-face transactions, are happening at terminals that are enabled for tap-to-pay. That in most markets is the hardest thing to get done. So the groundwork has been laid on the seller side of the ecosystem. And as you alluded to, U.S. issuers -- and you all said when you raised your hands, U.S. issuers are starting to issue the cards. We expect to have 100 million Visa tap-to-pay cards issued in the United States by the end of the year. So I feel really good and I'm very optimistic that all of us in this room are going to be able to have the great buying experience that other Visa customers all around the world are starting to have. And I really think, as we move through that, people are going to be very, very impressed with just how the buying experience works.</p><p>JAMES EDWARD SCHNEIDER: Yes. Yes. That's good to see. And you've talked about a lot of new Visa capabilities. You referred to Visa Direct earlier, which is essentially running your network in reverse, effectively, in order to accommodate things like Push Payments for peer-to-peer applications as well as things like companies paying insurance claims, payroll, Uber drivers, et cetera. So I believe you disclosed now that Visa Direct is now at $100 billion volume run rate growing at 100%, which is a big number. So how do you think how big this opportunity could be over time from both a volume and revenue perspective for the company?</p><p>RYAN M. MCINERNEY: We think it's an enormous opportunity. Visa Direct is a great example of innovation at Visa as you alluded to in terms of reversing the transaction. One of our product engineers had an idea a few years ago. And the idea was, what if we took a transaction on our network and just ran it in reverse. And the product scrum team started to work on it and they came up with a way to operationalize. And at the time, we had no idea how commercially viable it could and it would be. As you mentioned, the growth of the product in just a couple years has been very significant. But I think what's so exciting to us is 2 things. First, as we are out there on the front lines talking to partners and clients in countries all around the world, what we're finding is Visa Direct compared to Fast ACH or real-time payments or what have you is very, very different. And the differences and all of the value-added capabilities built into Visa Direct enable our partners to do things they just can't do with RTP or Fast ACH. ACH, Fast ACH in many countries around the world doesn't have the ability to preauthorize. It doesn't run 24/7 365 in most countries, our country included. Visa Direct allows you to reach beyond just a bank account to reach credit cards and prepaid cards. So the reach is stronger. It's live and up and running in 150 countries around the world today, 70 of which are Fast Funds enabled for near instant payments. We also hear from consumers because they just love the fact that I don't have to give out my bank account information. I can just make a transaction the same way that I always have with a Visa product. And it's enabled for cross border. So compared to some of the alternatives out there, we're finding that it's a rich set of capabilities that people really value. And as you alluded to, the use cases are kind of mushroomed and exploding. I feel like it's almost every day that our Visa Direct team is coming into my office with a new use case that they're finding for it. It's payroll, it's bill pay, it's gaming, it's disbursements, it's marketplace payouts. The list kind of goes on and on, and I wish we could have said we laid out a strategy in all these different verticals and segments and we're going to go attack it. What's really happening is we're learning as we go that there's just all these different use cases in all these different segments around the world where people really want a richer transaction and a transaction that has the type of capabilities that Visa Direct has. So we're very excited about it. How big it could be? We don't know. But we're very optimistic about the growth and what's ahead of us.</p><p>JAMES EDWARD SCHNEIDER: Since you've come onboard, Ryan, I think Visa as a company has spent a lot more time working with merchants more than the company had previously. And I guess, over the past year, I think you cited the number of merchants where Visa was accepted was up 15% to about 54 million. I think it's a pretty shocking number for most people, given the scale of -- and maturity of your business. Certainly, it was for me. Maybe can you give us a sense of where all these merchants are coming from? Is it emerging market merchants? Is it small merchants in the U.S.? And where do you think that number can go over time?</p><p>RYAN M. MCINERNEY: Don't tell our sales teams that it's shocking because I think they have a lot more work to do. And seriously, we're very proud of the growth on the seller side of the ecosystem. 15% growth year-over-year is good, but we have a lot more work to do. We just think there's so much opportunity ahead of us all around the world. But to answer your question, it's coming in developed markets and it's coming in developing markets. In the developed markets, it's things like tap-to-pay and contactless. We're seeing expansion into vending, in parking, in all the different areas where we all see people or would use cash ourselves. And we're also seeing great penetration in new segments like B2B, like bill pay, like rent payments, so on and so forth. So it's very much a developed market story. But the numbers are really significant in the developing world. And here what you're seeing is a couple things that are happening at the same time. First is expansion of reliable connectivity. The second is drastic reductions in the price of acceptance terminals themselves and in many parts of the world, skipping the need to even have acceptance devices at all. We've -- in the spirit of opening up our network to what we were talking about earlier, we enabled people in India, for example, to pay with QR codes using a Visa credential. I think we're about to pass or we just passed 1 million acceptance locations just in India using QR. We have great teams all around the world working to turn the antenna on a phone that many people have seen with Apple Pay and Google Pay and others as a way to pay, but now turning that antenna around as a way to accept payment, so that we could have phone-to-phone payments and so on and so forth. So the expansion in the seller side of the ecosystem, it's been very good work over the last couple of years. But we see it -- we want to see a lot more expansion both in the developed markets and the developing markets.</p><p>JAMES EDWARD SCHNEIDER: Great. B2B payments. I think that's an area where you have talked a lot more about recently. I think you have been talking about the fact that B2B is 11% of your overall volume. A lot of that's on kind of corporate payments and traveling expenses and entertainment expenses and things like that. Those have been a bit of a stubborn market in terms of going digital, a lot of that's still on paper check. So if you think about the market opportunity in B2B and what's kind of required to make it digital, what are some of the barriers and obstacles that need to be overcome? And kind of maybe think about what the size of that opportunity could be for Visa over time?</p><p>RYAN M. MCINERNEY: Yes. It has been stubborn. It's been very stubborn, but we're committed to cracking it. And a lot of what that's going to take is partnerships. But let me back up and talk about B2B more broadly. First, while -- and I acknowledge a big part of our business is commercial cards, P-Card, T&amp;E and all of that today, I think about 10% of our business is -- 11% of our business is now B2B around the world. In many markets around the world, although it sounds mundane to us, that is like massive innovation. Big developed markets that you all would think about as highly sophisticated payment markets, the ecosystem hasn't evolved in such a way there where what are basic products here, they don't exist. So we have great opportunity in many markets around the world to continue to expand our B2B business just on the bread and butter commercial card, small business card, P-Card, T&amp;E card, those type of things. Second area that we're very excited about is virtual cards. Virtual cards enable us to create lots of new use cases for our partners all around the world. We've been really focused with our client teams here in the U.S. and around the world at expanding the footprint of that business for us. We've announced some great new wins and some great new partnerships, WEX, Ixaris and others over the course of the last many months. And we expect to continue to grow our share of that business. But then back to the stubborn point and where partnerships come in. If you want to talk about the trillions, the tens of trillions, the many tens of trillion dollars of B2B payments that exist around the world today, we think cracking that's going to require really new business models that are going to allow us to simplify how those payments work and bring together what can be a very fragmented ecosystem today. I mentioned the work we're doing to build trust on, the BPN and that's -- we think that's a great idea. It's actually early days of even just having announced it, we're having some great success with a whole bunch of different players that are excited to become part of that network. It's essentially a new payments network. We're creating a new payments network that we think it'll enable it much easier for suppliers. We think it'll make it easier not -- for them to not only accept payments, but optimize their payments, reconcile all the different data they have in their business. We've also talked about some of the partnerships we have with Bottomline. Bottomline is a partner with ours in the virtual card business that I mentioned, but they're also a partner of ours in launching B2B Connect. B2B Connect is an entirely new business that we've built using distributed ledger technology to try to do something that sounds quite simple. It's a very hard problem to solve. But if we do it, we think it will be quite revolutionary, which is to electronify and simplify B2B cross-border payments around the world. And Bottomline has been a great partner in bringing that up, but as has many other banks and other partners around the world of helping us grow that new product. I don't think anyone knows exactly what the silver bullet is going to be if there is one. So our approach to the B2B space is, first, we're very committed to it. We see it as a significant, albeit long-term opportunity. We're very focused on partnering to try to bring the ecosystem together and bring new business models to market that can just make it easier for suppliers and all different parts of the ecosystem to streamline the accounts receivable and accounts payable side of this very stubborn business, as you said.</p><p>JAMES EDWARD SCHNEIDER: I wanted to talk about emerging markets for a second and specifically India, which is, I think, a market that many investors had kind of started to write-off for Visa with a view that maybe there would be some other alternative whether it's a national network or another alternative wallet that can gain a lot of share there instead of Visa. Do you think there's a real opportunity for you to get substantial market position in India over time? What are your conversations with people like the regulators and government in India like? And maybe just talk a little bit about whether you view competitors such as Paytm as competitors mainly or potential partners?</p><p>RYAN M. MCINERNEY: India is a very, very dynamic commerce market right now. So let me try to go through the issues that you laid out. And if I don't remember them all, you can remind me. First to start with our position. We have a very strong position in India. More than 50% share of both credit and debit. So we feel very good about our position. Second, after demonetization, which was quite a disruptive force in Indian commerce, we should double the size of our business. We doubled the size of our business post demonetization versus pre demonetization. But I think what's also notable is we've continued to grow the business as fast, if not faster, on this much bigger base. So we feel good about our starting position in India. The business continues to grow at a very healthy rate. But as I said, it's a very, very dynamic market. Lots of new competition emerging, especially enabled by UPI and real time payments. You also have Paytm, as you mentioned. We have a very strong domestic player in RuPay and so on and so forth. From the macro opportunity, the opportunity for everybody in India is enormous. There still the overwhelming majority of everything that's bought and sold in India is with cash. We feel really good, to your question, about the relationship that we have with the regulators. We feel really good about the relationship that we have with all of our bank partners and seller partners in India. And to your direct question about Paytm, we absolutely see them as a partner. We have lots of ideas that we think we could help Paytm grow its business, grow acceptance in the country, grow issuance and usage and -- as we do many of the other digital players in India. So it's an area where we've had a lot of focus. We've been -- we've made some investments in the country and we're very excited about the opportunity. But there too, the cash in India sometimes can be as stubborn as the B2B payments that you mentioned earlier. So we recognize that it's going to take us a long time to capture all of the opportunity.</p><p>JAMES EDWARD SCHNEIDER: Very good. Maybe just to also ask you about Amazon. Clearly they are a major force in e-commerce and a very big partner also of Visa both on the -- as a large merchant as well as an issuer of cobranded cards. So we've heard more and more about Amazon's efforts to kind of do more in payments in general. So how do you think about managing the concentration risk of any partner who's as big as that? And how do you assess the risk of Amazon launching a wallet offering that reaches beyond itself as a merchant?</p><p>RYAN M. MCINERNEY: Amazon's a great partner. We have a deep partnership with them in many, many countries around the world. Our -- like our job #1 with a partner like Amazon is to help them deliver what their #1 priority is. And their #1 priority is to deliver a great customer experience. And if you go through all the different capabilities, technologies, solutions and services that we have, we are as active with Amazon as any other partner of trying to put those capabilities to work to help Amazon deliver a great customer experience. And as big as Amazon is, the seller side of our business still remains very, very distributed, not just in this country but all around the world. So I don't think about it exactly in the sense that you described. We're very, very focused on with Amazon or any other big tech platform, partner or commerce enabler, how do we -- going back to maybe where we started the discussion, how do we ensure that they view Visa as the best commerce enablement platform in the world? The simplest, the safest, the easiest to do business with. And if we just continue to deliver on that kind of day in and day out for Amazon and all of these other technology platforms, they're going to use their scarcest resource, which is engineering resources, to focus on great commerce experiences, great buying experiences, building great phones, building great advertising models. Whatever it is they do to drive their business and in hopes that they'll view us as the best commerce partner that they have to both process their transactions, but help deliver great buying experiences. So that's kind of how we think about working with Amazon, but also more broadly with large tech and commerce enablers.</p><p>JAMES EDWARD SCHNEIDER: Very good. Unfortunately, I think we're pretty much out of time. So Ryan, thanks for being with us today. We appreciate it.</p><p>RYAN M. MCINERNEY: Well, thanks for having me.

I think we are going to keep on moving. Transitioning now from the small start-up fintech disruptors over to the bellwether of the payments space. Very excited to be joined by Al Kelly, the CEO of Visa. Al, off course, thank you for being here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ALFRED FRANCIS KELLY, CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD &amp; CEO, VISA INC.: Lisa, I'm delighted to be here. We're a fintech, too.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">LISA ANN DEJONG ELLIS: You're a fintech. And we just pointed out that you have invested at Visa, and basically all of the other companies that we've had here; Marqeta, Stripe.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>LISA ANN DEJONG ELLIS: All right. Well, I'm going to start you off with an easy one to kick off your morning. Part of your job at Visa -- as the CEO of Visa is to make sure not only are you running the company for performance this year and next year but really to be positioning Visa for the next 5 to 10 years. So can you start us off by talking about what, in your view, are the must-win areas in payments to ensure Visa's success continues not only for 2019 but out 5, 10 years from now?</p><p>ALFRED FRANCIS KELLY: Well, it's a great question. Ours is really very much a macroeconomic business. So we're constantly thinking ahead. I just had a phone call with our top 300 people and we've got 4 months to go in the fiscal year. And almost anything we're going to do now is going to impact '20 and '21, not '19. I mean it's just a bit -- the nature of the work. That said, I've been in and around payment for 35 years. And the level of transformation, driven by a combination of technology and frankly, the opportunity. There are a lot -- not a lot of industries where people come to work every day and figure out how to continue to grow the pie versus having to come to work and figuring out how to beat somebody up for a basis point of share. So we're thinking ahead all the time.</p><p>If I was to capture our #1 strategic objective over the -- at least 5 years, probably over the next decade, is to continue to open, grow and enhance our network along a number of dimensions. Certainly, have more elements at the nodes. So we want more payment credentials, more people who are on the buying side. And then we want more nodes on the seller/supplier side in growing acceptance. We want more partners. We want more capabilities.</p><p>And we even want to be able to connect to more networks. And in my mind, the key to getting there is that we have to be a very open company. It's part of what I hope we're building into the culture. We have to have a more modern definition of the 4-party model, where we recognize that there are new age types of players. We have to continue to open up our -- and decompose and demystify our technology by creating APIs that people can link into. We've got to continue to grow the type of partners we deal with. I mean we work very closely with all the Pays to leverage tokenization, to be able to allow for secure and seamless payments on mobile devices. We have brought on a myriad of new partners related to our capability with Visa Direct, which I'm sure we'll talk more about. We're bringing on a whole new bunch of partners now with the acquisition of Earthport. All of these are aimed at this objective of growing -- opening, growing and enhancing our network.</p><p>Beyond that, we're -- certainly more specifically, we're investing in the geographies around the world. There's lots of opportunity in almost every geography around the world, including the very developed ones like the United States. There are real opportunities in terms of winning new payment flows, and that's an area of emphasis for us. We're certainly very bullish on the long-term opportunities around B2B.</p><p>And the last thing I would say, Lisa, is that our business is a people business. We don't make anything. We don't manufacture anything. There's no physical element to anything we do. It's all about having bright people who are some -- or the upfront people we put in front of clients. Others are developers and engineers in the background. And in the last 2 years, we've increased the number of people working on innovation for us by 30%. We've increased the number of developers in our tech organization by 25%.</p><p>So -- and I think you and I have talked about this in the past. The one thing -- one of the things that I discovered in the -- almost now here coming up on 3 years when I became CEO, is the company was too centrally-run at the San Francisco level in terms of headquarters and then at the regional headquarters. And we need to and are have been and will continue to push more resources into the local markets because the business is inherently a local business. And so we will continue to invest to put people at -- move people out of the centers, out of these hubs and into the markets.</p><p>So those are the things that I think are the elements. I think when people think about thinking 10 years out, I don't think that's hard. I think -- when I think about the next 3 to 5 or 6, those are the things I think about in terms of driving the business forward</p><p>LISA ANN DEJONG ELLIS: All right. And then bringing that back, you highlighted -- can you highlight a few of the specific investment initiatives that you've got going on now focused on that positioning? You just highlighted one of the big things. You've done under your tenure as CEO is the decentralization. That's certainly been a big one. What are some others?</p><p>ALFRED FRANCIS KELLY: Well, I think that we've spent a lot of time and effort on this -- the biggest acquisition we'll probably ever do, which was at Europe 34 months ago. And so certainly, that's been a huge effort that -- we closed that deal shortly before I became CEO. So I was -- but I saw all the chapters leading up to it in the 3 years that I was an independent Director of the company before that.</p><p>But what's very exciting to me about Europe is about 6 or 9 months ago, we moved from being very focused on all of the necessary important integration type of work and moved to our front foot and we're much more focused on being much more offensive. We have monthly -- we have 3 to 3.5 days of monthly business reviews, where we sit in a room with no windows with great views like this, and we go through business by business, geography by geography for 3.5 days and trudge through it. And when I think back over the last 5 or 6 months of those business reviews, when we talked about Europe, we're talking much more now about actions in the marketplace and investments we're making to move the business forward versus how are we doing in terms of milestones and the plans that we have related to the various numerous aspects of integration.</p><p>I think this whole aspect of new payment flows, just in the last 18 months, we have now set up a business unit focused on B2B, a business unit focused on Visa Direct, a business unit focused on cross-border. These are all new in the last 18 months, they didn't exist before. And so while I believe the business is a local business, when we think that we need to put real attention and spotlight on something, and until it kind of naturally becomes part of the fabric of what happens in the markets every day, we think standing up a dedicated business unit. And all of those report directly to Ryan McInerney, our President. So they're getting high exposure when we do these 3.5-day business reviews. We're reviewing those businesses as well. And so they're areas of huge investment for us and getting huge attention from us as well.</p><p>LISA ANN DEJONG ELLIS: All right. Well, one of the arm wrestling matches you've won this year was the battle for Earthport, a company that I've had the delightful opportunity to host a few times over the last few years. Talk a little bit about that acquisition. Some folks here may not be as familiar with Earthport. What was the strategic philosophy behind making that acquisition?</p><p>ALFRED FRANCIS KELLY: You certainly could have birthed a child faster than this happened, unfortunately, and it was a bit of a saga. So Earthport -- let me back -- drop back. So we've seen Visa Direct move very, very quickly from being a concept to pilot to being really a growth contributor to the company. It happened faster than we envisioned it happening. And as we sat in a strategic session one day and said kind of what stops this from being much bigger than we might imagine it could be? And until we kind of stopped and asked ourselves that question, we were saying, \"Well, this -- it's got endless possibilities because we have 2 billion debit credentials around the world so we can send money to 2 billion demand deposit accounts around the world. So what more do we need?\"</p><p>Well, the reality is that, that was impressive but limited. And we said, \"How can we get to the point where we can have reach much beyond those 2 billion debit credentials?\" We did a scan of the market play. We identified 6 or 7 different options in terms of companies. Earthport was at the very top of our list. We initiated discussions with them. We got some element of reception. For people who don't know, they're a U.K.-based company and there's very unique aspects to M&amp;A in the U.K. that make this a much more difficult dance to get to the end line. But in getting Earthport, which has connections into banks in 200 countries, and in 88 of those countries, which represent -- by the way, our top 50 markets around the world are in these 88 countries. In 88 countries, there's a direct connection to the local ACH or RTP system, which allows us to get to the last mile to get to any bank account in the world.</p><p>So we're now not limited and this is what's really exciting about Earthport. There's 2 aspects that I think are really exciting and different for us: One is for the first time, we're actually going beyond a card credential or a payment credential. So we can actually send money from somebody who's a Visa customer who has an account, to now to somebody who's not a Visa customer, they have no affiliation with Visa whatsoever. So we're moving beyond the card.</p><p>The other thing that it's doing is it's allowing us to, in essence, become -- and this is part of when I answered your question about opening, expanding and growing our network. I said -- and even connecting to more networks. It allows us to almost become a network of networks, where we now can complete that last mile through -- the first 10,000 miles or 5,000 miles or 2,000 miles through VisaNet and it connects to an ACH or RTP system to get into the bank account of somebody in those markets.</p><p>So we, in the top 50 markets, with this acquisition, move from having reach of, give or take by market, 50% to kind of like 99% reach. So we're very, very excited about the capability. For now, what we've decided to do -- we actually think it's got great applicability.</p><p>So I probably left out one quick thing. It's a cross-border service. That's really what it's about. It's a cross-border service. And as I said, it has connections into 200 countries, which is incredible. It will have the ability to help us on any cross-border services, both consumer and B2B. But because of where we are in the maturation curve, what we're going to do is we're taking one of our executives from our London office, put them into Earthport as like the Chief Operating Officer. And that person will report to the General Manager of Visa Direct. Over time, if it becomes a bigger play in B2B cross-border payments, maybe we do something different. But for now, that's how we're going to treat it, and we're extremely excited about it. And we're glad that we were able to prevail and get it because it was our first choice. There are other options, but it was our first choice.</p><p>LISA ANN DEJONG ELLIS: Good. Okay. And so it is interesting that Earthport does, as you highlighted, connect a lot of ACH rails, which historically Visa has obviously stayed a little bit clear of, or they've been sort of in separate swim lanes. So how does now that these connections, as you said, into the local ACH networks or into this concept of being a network of networks fit into the vision for Visa, for Visa Direct going forward?</p><p>ALFRED FRANCIS KELLY: Well, I think it makes Visa Direct that much more robust. I mean Visa Direct was a capability that had this one negative to it. But now when I look at the various use cases that we already have for Visa Direct, it just will expand the ability of those use cases to be valuable. So for example, the first use case is P2P, where we're powering all of the big P2P players in the United States. So we power Venmo, we power Square Cash, we power Zelle, we now power Apple Pay Cash. We also power most of the big P2P in Russia. But beyond the U.S. and Russia, where we have huge P2P businesses via Visa Direct, there's tremendous opportunity for us to get into P2P in a lot more markets.</p><p>We've got cross-border remittances. We've done deals with MoneyGram, which is the second largest money transfer company in the world. Remitly, who's a big player in South America and Central Europe. We've done -- in Africa, we've done a good, big deal with EMQ, which is another money transfer company in Asia. And the ability to kind of use those platforms to do more P2P and now with Earthport, be able to do it not just domestically but to do it cross-border and not just do it between two Visa card members but anybody who has a bank account.</p><p>We have the whole notion of B2C disbursements, where we've talked in the past about insurance claims being dispersed through P2P. We've talked about the fact that big property management companies return deposits from renters via Visa Direct. We're using Visa Direct to power a lot of gig economy payroll. And even in traditional payroll, where people are -- people in this room, probably like all of us more -- are used to getting a 2-week or an every 2-week or twice a month paycheck. Companies like PayActiv are coming in and using Visa Direct to get people access to their money at a greater frequency than the frequency in which they would normally get paid by their company, in essence, drawing down on their -- an advance on their paycheck. We've got cases of Bill Pay in India today. Some of the bills for telecom and utilities will come with a QR code on the bill. You scan the QR code, and it immediately pays through the -- pays the bill through Visa Direct.</p><p>We're experimenting with other possibilities for Visa Direct. One would be the movement of money in and out of brokerage accounts. When somebody potentially wants to do a trade and wants to move money in, does the trade, settles and wants to move money out. There's no reason why that money movement couldn't be a Visa Direct transaction. And all Earthport does is allow this capability that can do all of these various things that I just described and increase the reach of that. So that's why it's very exciting to us because, as I said earlier, Visa Direct became an important part of our business much quicker than we thought. And I think now with the Earthport acquisition, we can really push to accelerate the growth of this capability.</p><p>LISA ANN DEJONG ELLIS: And talk a little bit about the economics of Visa Direct to Visa. How should investors think about, realizing the pricing models are going to vary quite a bit by use case, et cetera, but how should investors think about that contribution to your financials?</p><p>ALFRED FRANCIS KELLY: Well, I think that, as you can imagine, it's not quite as big a yield as a payment transaction. But we definitely get economics out of it. And as the volume grows, they'll become an increasing contributor to our revenue.</p><p>LISA ANN DEJONG ELLIS: And you disclosed that Visa Direct was over $100 billion in volume already in 2018, growing 100% per year, which, if you do the math on that, means we're already seeing it contributing to your overall growth rate in a way that's visible, tens -- couple of tens of basis points there. That was before everything you just described. So how big can Visa Direct be for Visa over time?</p><p>ALFRED FRANCIS KELLY: Well, we haven't given a number. But I think that -- I think every day, we've proven in a pretty short period of time a couple of things. One, that we're really committed to it; number two, that we're building the use cases; and number three, we're building the partnerships associated with it.</p><p>That said, this -- if I just -- if we just right now stopped and froze the use cases that exist and didn't come up with any other use cases, the reality is there's so much more runway for P2P. There's so much more runway for cross-border remittances. There's so much more runway for B2C disbursements. There's so much more runway for Bill Pay, which I think kind of tend to be the 4 big use cases. And that's not talking about getting into something like I talked about with the brokerage account movements of money.</p><p>But you can think about pretty much anything that where money is moving from one place to another place, we have these rails that are built off of -- they run on VisaNet. They're not a separate set of rails. So they've got all the capabilities that exist on VisaNet, including extraordinarily robust security. So while we have -- while I'm not here to give some almighty forecast of where it's going, I will just simply say that we think it can be big. It's big already. We think it can be a lot bigger and we're committed to it.</p><p>LISA ANN DEJONG ELLIS: And help a little bit -- with a lot of the use cases that you've described, disbursements, some of the P2P transfers or payroll transfers are currently or historically have been done using a traditional ACH product. Help describe what's the value proposition, assuming ACH moves toward more of a near real-time or same-day type of model. So the time differential narrows over time. What, in that context, is the differentiation of using Visa Direct relative to maybe a more like real-time or near real-time ACH?</p><p>ALFRED FRANCIS KELLY: There's a number of things. Number one, we can preauthorize in advance of money moving. So we can basically stand by the fact that the money is there. We run 24/7, 365. A lot of ACH options don't. That allows us to help small businesses, for instance, who have access to loans and they can't -- if they need -- want to get access to draw down a loan in the period of time when the bank hours aren't working, we can help facilitate making that happen. It's a global capability.</p><p>Most ACH capabilities are domestic. And if you -- if somebody wants to make it more than domestic, you've got to individually cobble together country-by-country different relationships with different ACH systems or different RTP systems. ACH systems are restricted to going from bank to bank. We can also move money to credit cards and prepaid cards on Visa Direct. On Visa Direct, you don't have to give somebody's savings account number. You're giving their debit card number. And increasingly, we hope that elements of this become tokenized as well. So it's more secure. If the information got stolen, it's more secure than if you have -- if you've got your actual bank account demand deposit account number compromised or breached in some way, shape or form. So we think on a number of dimensions, it's a superior capability than what you would get in ACH or RTP.</p><p>LISA ANN DEJONG ELLIS: And is there -- the tantalizing use case for me would be -- is the payroll concept. So is it -- is somebody like an ADP or Paychex, like the big payroll processors, potentially a partner of Visa and Visa Direct? Where -- to enable what you were describing like an on-demand payroll model as opposed to the every 2-week gross-to-net direct deposit model?</p><p>ALFRED FRANCIS KELLY: Again, I'd stand by this kind of we're open to anything saying. I think all of those are possible. I'm not going to talk about specific players that we might be talking to right now. But I think anybody who moves money and wants to change their model so that they can move money maybe more frequently or offer more variability or optionality across the board, I think that we bring some unique capabilities that could help facilitate that.</p><p>LISA ANN DEJONG ELLIS: All right. Maybe broadening out -- and again, remember, guys, questions, write them on cards and hand them to Connor, he's sitting right over there. Visa Direct is obviously a very important component of your growth strategy right now. What are some of the other legs of growth? Maybe let's start with the U.S. actually. U.S., I believe by various measures, is now a card penetration somewhere in the mid-60s. What's the pathway to get the U.S. to, say, 80-plus percent penetration over the next few years?</p><p>ALFRED FRANCIS KELLY: So there's a number of ways I think that -- first of all, your numbers are right as your numbers always are. The -- I would talk about 3 things that I'm excited about that I think can help get us there. One is contactless. It is astonishing that the United States is in last place on something, and this would qualify. I mean I looked yesterday, Hungary is 90% of their face-to-face transactions are contactless. Georgia is 87% of their face-to-face transactions are contactless. In the United States, it's like probably 0.000001. That said, we -- and by the way, we have -- there's 45 countries in the world where contactless is more than 1/3 of the face-to-face transactions. So -- and it just is a much, much better experience for the consumer and the business. We will have -- I'm quite confident we'll have 100 million cards in place in the United States at the end of '19. We'll have 300 million -- and I'm talking Visa cards now. You can get numbers from Ajay or Greg or something about what Mastercard or Steve of what Amex will have. But we think we'll have 300 million cards -- Visa cards in place by the end of 2022 -- 2020, I'm sorry, 2020. We -- 60 of the top 100 merchants -- or 80 of the top 100 merchants are ready to go. Their terminals are enabled. If you actually had a contactless card today, if you had one, you could probably use it between 60% and 70% of your buying that you do.</p><p>I'm extraordinarily excited, not just the United States but around the world, about transit. Last Thursday, I was down at Grand Central Station and at the 4, 5, and 6 line where starting on June 1, the MTA is going to go -- offer contactless, tap and pay from Grand Central Station to Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn. And it will be like a 2- to 10-week pass. And then they plan to roll it quite aggressively so that they're fully rolled out on all of the subway systems and all of the buses in the 5 boroughs of New York City by October of 2020. And we get them out of the whole Metro card business and having this funding and dealing with a closed-loop system that they've had for years and get -- totally get rid of all that expense.</p><p>And by the way, there's a whole bunch of intelligent software that's been built behind it. So that if you use the card multiple times -- like this won't happen right out of the chute. But once you start when it's fully implemented, if you use the card a number of times a day, you'll get the [light] run of the day kind of price. If you use it multiple times during the week, you'd get the weekly price. It will adjust based on your usage. It'll adjust the pricing that's charged on your card. If find that you use it every day, you'd get the unlimited ride or a monthly ride. I don't know all of the different options they offer, but you'll have all that capability.</p><p>Just putting this in on the 4, 5 line has banks saying, \"Oh my gosh, we got to get cards that are enabled in the hands of our customers that are in the ZIP codes and the surrounding areas that might use this because we don't want them feeling disadvantaged when they see their neighbor, who's using a competitive bank's card, tapping and going right through the turnstile and not having to worry about where's the Metro card. Does it still have a balance on it?\" Mine always expire. I'm a mess. I'm sitting there, holding people up behind me. The idea that I can just tap and pay is a lot more attractive.</p><p>So I think that contactless is going to be a big stimulant to the -- and by the way, it's going to get used to people pulling the card out for low-value transactions. And a lot of that is 30% or 35% that have PCE in the United States that's not -- that's still on cash as these low-value items and gets people in the habit of just pulling it out on any transaction and not having to go to a reflex of taking out cash if it's less than $10.</p><p>The second thing I think is going to be a stimulant to growth in the United States is going to be cleaning up the buying experience in e-comm. Hopefully, by the middle to end of the summer, we will be starting to replace Visa Checkout with the new Secure Remote Commerce, single-button tokenized transaction in e-comm. And my hope is that, that will, in fact, make for a better experience.</p><p>I mean there's 3 big problems in the e-commerce buying experience, the number of people who shop and then don't buy. That dropoff rate is way too high. The second issue is that there's so much confusion at the point of purchase. There's too many options. People don't know what to do and it's one of the reasons they drop out. And then thirdly, the authorization rates are still lousy, and we've got to do work -- continue to work with our issuer partners on that. So I'm bullish that, that is going to be a real stimulant to helping grow in the U.S.</p><p>The third is continuing to grow acceptance, believe it or not. And I'll use a couple of examples. Rent. I talked -- I mentioned rent earlier. We're making inroads, but there's still so much rent that's paid by check. And people don't want to pay by check. It's a hassle. And they -- so I think that our tide is turning, where rental companies are under increasing pressure from their tenants to want to be able to pay. And by the way, it's actually -- I think also, rental property management companies are realizing they can get the money faster and more predictably, too, if they allow for electronic and digital acceptance.</p><p>Unattended retail. There are 5 -- by our estimates, 5.5 million food and beverage vending machines, another 1.4 million unattended laundry machines. Only about 2 million of those are, today, set up for digital electronic acceptance. About 0.5 million in the last -- in 2018. So it's growing, but a lot of room for growth there.</p><p>Parking. There's 105 million parking spaces, that's the estimate. I haven't counted them, I have to admit. 105 million parking spaces in the United States. 70 million of them are off-street. 35 million of them are on-street. About 1/3 of those are pay spots. And -- but somewhere in the neighborhood, about 2/3 of those are set up for electronic payment today either via kiosks or an app of some type, but there's still an opportunity to grow both the awareness around the current coverage that we have as well as continuing to close the coverage gap. So I think -- when I think about growing in the United States, I'd highlight those 3 things, SRC, contactless and acceptance. And then beyond that, which is a much longer subject, B2B</p><p>LISA ANN DEJONG ELLIS: Let's switch to then the other end of the spectrum, developing markets. Over the last few years, with the demonetization initiatives as well as just the explosion of digital wireless around the world, the sort of formula for entering a developing market I think has changed a bit. You used to always go in with the kind of affluent credit card model and worked your way down the pyramid, so to speak. What's the now the winning formula, where you're entering or you're not entering but, I mean, you're trying to grow in a market where actually there is maybe a whole bunch of local digital wallet players?</p><p>ALFRED FRANCIS KELLY: Yes. So I would say there's 3 keys to it. One is we have to put people on the ground to know the market, going back to my point that it's a local business. And so there's not -- I'm going to describe 3 things kind of at a more galactic level. Exactly what you do in terms of tactics will differ based on market because they're different. But we've got to put good people in the place. The last number of months, we've opened up offices in Panama, Costa Rica and Ghana, offices -- places we never had offices before. But if we really want to start making action in those markets, we got to put people on the ground, understand the market, understand the players, understand the regulations, the traditions, the history, et cetera.</p><p>Second, you've got to go in digital first. And you're absolutely right that it's -- that we're now not looking to go in affluent first. We're looking to go digital first. Why? Because typically, some app, whether it's a rideshare or some social network app, has been smart and has gotten out and created some kind of closed-loop network to facilitate their business. And they've had a wallet -- they've developed a wallet as part of it because, frankly, there aren't traditional solutions. They're smart. They've got to create a wallet to reach the unbanked people. So we need to go in and immediately capture relationship with those folks and explain to them what can happen by taking their brilliance and their entrepreneurial spirit and connecting it with the assets we bring, which are obviously our brand, our scale, our security, our reach, et cetera. And make sure that they understand that they can become a brand and an offering that has much greater utility and much wider reach if they partner with us. It doesn't mean they'll get -- necessarily get rid of what might be a closed-loop network, but it might be a closed-loop network with on-ramps to an open network, right? So they might still have rideshare kind of closed network but they might give -- put it -- they might become a Visa issuer. And that thereby -- as an extension to their wallet, thereby creating an on-ramp to an open market, where the customer can use their Visa credential to shop anywhere they want to shop.</p><p>The third thing we have to make sure we constantly do is interactions with governments. I travel about 85% of the time. And when I'm outside the United States, almost on every trip in every country, I either try to see the finance minister or the head of the central bank or, in some cases, the President or Prime Minister of the country, to let them know that we're committed to their country, we're committed to helping them become more digital, helping them become more modern, helping them become more transparent, which is very important to a lot of leaders in third world and emerging markets, where there's a gray or hidden economy because of a lack of transparency. And by making the market a bit more open, a bit more digital, a bit more electronic, they can have a lot more transparency.</p><p>So that's something that is not a -- when I say that it's not a throwaway third point. Having -- I would actually say that governments, for the most part, yes, we're dealing with -- we're always going to deal with some regulation we don't like or would prefer not to be there. But in many cases, governments around the world are actually being positive activists for moving -- to taking actions that are good for the payments business overall. You mentioned -- so those are the kind of the things I think we have to do to enter the market.</p><p>You mentioned India. If not for Prime Minister Modi taking that action on November 8, 2016, there's no way India would be where it is today. I mean they -- before 2000 -- November 8, 2016, numbers of hundreds of thousands of establishments took and accepted credit cards. That's it. In a country that's almost 1.4 billion people, a couple hundred thousand is nothing. And since that time, now less than 3 years later, there's 4.5 million acceptance points in India, still, by the way, very small amount. But think about it. I mean it's increased somewhere in the neighborhood of fivefold. It's incredible. There's no other story like it. And a lot -- and over 1 million of those are -- have been enabled by the lowest technology you'd think of, like a piece of paper with a QR code on it. And that's the other element of entering emerging markets now is you don't need -- one of the biggest barriers has been -- you mentioned affluent as kind of the way you attack them. The biggest barrier has been that it's -- you had to build this infrastructure that required electricity, that required telecom and required smart terminals. Now with QR codes and mobile-based solutions and dongles, et cetera, you can get a merchant up and running much more quickly at a fraction of the cost. I mean you still have costs in terms of like putting -- having personnel going out and talking to people and cobbling together a group of acquirers, et cetera.</p><p>But I think partnering, too, is another big aspect of getting into these markets. I mentioned parking -- partnering with the digital wallets that you mentioned. But if we look in India, Paytm, everybody viewed as somebody who was going to be a real competitor of ours. And I'd remind everybody, in India, that we have greater than 50% share of the debit and credit market today. I mean we've been in the market for almost 40 years. So we couldn't be more excited about the fact that the market is growing because we've been there a long time. We've got a big office there. We have a big presence. And if the pie is going to grow just by being there, we're going to get, hopefully, our -- certainly our fair share if not more so.</p><p>We'll lose some debit volumes because that's where the market becomes much more competitive, is in the debit space. But now Paytm has become a partner of ours. They're issuing Visa cards. They've become an acquirer of ours. A couple of weeks ago, the RBI, the Central Bank in India, approved Visa's tokenization service. As a result, Google now is going to move from exclusively working with UPI to using Visa as the funding source for their wallets in India.</p><p>As I look at Africa, where there's obviously a lot of emerging markets, we've built a great partnership with Branch, which is a company that provides microloans to small businesses. And what we're doing with Branch is inserting Visa credentials into the wallets of these small businesses so that the microfunds can be accessed by the Visa credentials to allow these people to go shop and buy for their business at places where Visa is accepted. So I think that this element of kind of -- as you described, when I -- we sat down to start, a big fintech like us working with a set of smaller fintechs can bring together their -- as I said earlier, their entrepreneurial brilliance with a lot of the capabilities we built out for 60 years. And you can create real win, win, win. And this is part of, in my mind, having a modernized view of what the four-party model is all about.</p><p>VASUNDHARA GOVIL, FORMER VP &amp; EQUITY ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION: Speaking of the fintechs, and you mentioned in there the -- your relationship with Google in India, you've historically had a pretty collaborative relationship with the big tech companies. But we do always see these announcements, like Google was exclusively working with UPI, as you mentioned. Amazon has now got an initiative in Mexico that's sort of an Alipay-like payment system there. Facebook, of course, with their Project Libra. They kind of keep drifting a little into the payment space. Can you just give us a temperature check on your relationship with the big tech guys and the risks that they pose potentially to Visa?</p><p>ALFRED FRANCIS KELLY: Well, in all cases, we do have good relationships with them. I mean we talk to Apple, to Facebook, to Amazon, to Google all the time. And we have a co-branded card with Chase and with Amazon. We're powering, as I said earlier -- we enabled -- worked with Apple to enable Apple Pay via tokenization and now we're powering their P2P offering. We've got -- we have what I just -- we just described with Google in India. So I can't tell you inside of these places exactly where they're going to end up. I think that they have built great businesses on the back of being very customer-centric. I mean you can't build a great business without being customer-centric. And if you're customer-centric, you tend to want to not narrow choices for consumers but broaden choices for consumers. So the idea that these guys would kind of create closed-loop systems where they would narrow what their consumers could use, I don't see it. They're too customer-centric to do it.</p><p>I also think that if we continue to innovate and build solutions and capabilities built into our network, people aren't going to want to close us out. They're going to want to be able to leverage those innovations. I mean a lot of what's happening with processing and domestic processing around the world is that they haven't been invested in, and therefore, they're not -- they don't have the same capabilities as, for instance, we would have because we continually invest in our network.</p><p>Look, it's hard to be a big commerce player of some type without thinking about how funds flow. And so the fact that we're going to continue to read from time to time things about these big guys doing things in and around the movement of funds and what might sound like payments, et cetera. What I would tell you is -- I think they're going to be very open to continue to partner, and we're going to do everything we can to prove to them every day that we're somebody that is a friend and supporter and enabler and we want to do everything we can to help them grow their business and us in turn.</p><p>LISA ANN DEJONG ELLIS: All right. The news in payments over the last 5 months has certainly been dominated by the 3 big megamergers in the space between the acquiring and the issuer processing side. How do those impact Visa?</p><p>ALFRED FRANCIS KELLY: So first, I'd say that we have very good relationships with all 6 companies that have been involved in these 3 mergers. I don't think -- I think if anything, they're going to impact us positively, and let me give you 2 reasons why I say that. One is these are mergers of different assets that came together. They were not mergers of scale from the perspective of nobody got bigger in a certain aspect of the ecosystem, right? It was issuer processers and merchant acquirers coming together to create a broader set of offerings for customers and to be involved in more aspects of the ecosystem versus getting bigger in one aspect of the ecosystem. So I think that, if anything, a, helps us in the deployment of what we want to put into market because we have -- now we deal with 3 companies, in this case, 3 versus 6. And a lot of times, when we come up with a capability, one of the frustrations or negatives is that we've got to go sit with everybody, talk them through it and get it in their tech cues and all that stuff. Now we have just less people to work with.</p><p>The second thing that's very exciting to me about these mergers is that all of them have talked about one of the thesises (sic) [theses] being -- becoming more global. And back to the discussion on emerging markets and developing markets, there are a lot of countries around the world where we need more ecosystem support in terms of issuer processing and in terms of merchant acquiring. And the fact that these 3 entities want to spread their wings and touch more geographies over time is going to help the payment ecosystem rise, and it's going to help us rise. So I think that's a real positive thing. So I'm -- I think net-net, it's going to be a good thing for us.</p><p>LISA ANN DEJONG ELLIS: All right. One opportunity area for Visa, I'm going to frame it that way, is in Europe. As you highlighted up front, you've sort of been able to move now from being on the back foot through the Visa Europe integration and now moving to front foot in the market, a market where card penetration remains very low. Lots of regulatory changes. You've got the upcoming SCA regulations for 2-factor authentication coming up.</p><p>ALFRED FRANCIS KELLY: September 14.</p><p>LISA ANN DEJONG ELLIS: September 14 is D-day. What's the strategy to accelerate Visa's growth in this region?</p><p>ALFRED FRANCIS KELLY: Well, at the most galactic level, diversify out of the U.K. We've got a very big presence in the U.K., and we've got a nice business on the continent. But it's not nearly as big as it can be and it should be. We have to diversify beyond debit. We've got a lot of opportunity in credit in the region. We've got a win in Germany. Germany is one of the 3 big economies around the world that are still heavy cash economies, with Mexico being one and in Asia, Japan being another. We have to do much better with fintechs, which we have.</p><p>The association model under which Visa Europe operated before we bought them was very reticent to talk to people outside of their family of banks. And we were behind. Mastercard did a far better job of getting involved with fintechs, and we have made a very concerted effort to change that. And I believe we have over the last 9 to 12 months. We have dedicated client people working on fintechs. We created a fast-track program to get them up and onto our network in a much faster, less bureaucratic way. We've announced that we'll spend at least $100 million investing in these guys. We won 5 fintech deals last quarter, including Coinbase, which was looking for a solution to allow people who had their cryptocurrency to be able to actually go spend it. And I think that's going to be a great partnership for them and a great partnership for us.</p><p>We've got to continue to build our B2B business there. We've only had the new technical infrastructure of VisaNet there now for, I guess, it's coming up on a year. And we've got already got 60 clients that are using some of our fraud and risk capabilities that weren't available to them on the legacy system. We have a lot of upside on Visa Direct, which wasn't available on the legacy system. So a lot of the things we've talked about, Europe has been behind because until we moved them to -- and finished this migration to VisaNet, they haven't been able to take advantage of these capabilities.</p><p>So I am really excited. I was in Europe last -- all of last week. I was in Dublin. We had a meeting of 700 clients from around Europe. So I was -- spent 2 days with them, and then I just went to France and spent 2 days with clients in France. And any number of people said to me over the course of last week that I can feel the difference, that Visa is more on the front foot. They're talking to me in more proactive ways. They have more offerings than I -- than they've ever had before. They've got more of a presence in front of us that we're seeing in the local market. So I -- that's why I believe that we're on the offensive there. And I think it's a region of the world for us that has an awful lot of upside. And look, it's the region of the world where Mastercard has done a bit better and they've had the advantage of being a commercial business there for much longer period of time than we did. And we're being the fast follower, and I'm confident that we will continue to build a very, very good business.</p><p>And by the way, I should say, during all of this, the reality is that the transaction was more accretive and faster than we set. So the business continued to form quite well while we went through a massive integration exercise and have changed out some huge chunk of the people, and 75% of the management team in Europe is different. Yet despite all that change, the business continued to perform quite well.</p><p>LISA ANN DEJONG ELLIS: All right. And we will close with just the last one. You, Al, spent a lot of time with investors looking at the whole array of opportunities Visa has in front of it. What are the elements of the Visa investment story that you believe investors still don't fully appreciate or are more upside than maybe the investor community is realizing?</p><p>ALFRED FRANCIS KELLY: I guess I'd highlight 2. This we -- really is a global company, I mean, and we operate -- we try to operate in a culture that we're a global company that happens to be headquartered in the United States than we're a U.S. company that has overseas operations. And I think that mindset is a very important distinction. If you want to really be a global company, you really have to think global in everything you do and not have the bias of the country in which you're headquartered. And I think that's a particularly difficult thing to do in the United States because it's such a guerrilla market.</p><p>The other one I would highlight that we didn't talk about today and we don't talk about a lot is the brand. The Visa brand is enormously powerful. We do a brand health study every year of the top 50 markets around the world. And in all but one, we have a -- not just an advantage but a huge advantage over all of our competitors in terms of recognition, trust and the association with -- of usage because they see the brand. We spend an awful lot of time, a lot of money and put a lot of effort behind -- and brand is like on the wall when we're making decisions. How is what we're going to do going to affect the brand because in our mind, it is truly a differentiating asset. And when we sit in front of fintechs or we sit in front of huge banks and we can show them the data that's done by third parties, I'm not talking about like Forbes lists and stuff like that. I'm talking about lists where you're actually talking to real consumers on the street and market where people can see, in some countries, like a ridiculously wide gap between us and the next competitor. People say -- it gets people's attention and they say, \"Wow.\" And there are any number of cases where it has truly been the or a differentiator in us winning or renewing business.</p><p>LISA ANN DEJONG ELLIS: Excellent. Terrific. Thank you, Al. I think we'll end it there. Thanks a lot.</p><p>ALFRED FRANCIS KELLY: Thank, Lisa. Thank you.</p><p>LISA ANN DEJONG ELLIS: Terrific.

The companies follow just one week after PayPal Holdings Inc. left the project.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Since the social media giant unveiled its plans four months ago, it has been met with backlash around the globe. Earlier this week, a pair of Democratic senators sent letters to the chief executives of Visa, Mastercard and Stripe, threatening increased regulatory scrutiny on all of the companies' payments activities, not just those related to Libra.</p><p>With at least five of the project's initial 28 founding members now gone, the Libra Association   the Geneva-based consortium of Facebook and other entities intended to oversee the Libra project   might be in trouble. The 28 companies had said they would invest $10 million each in a consortium to govern the coin.</p><p>MoffettNathanson analyst Lisa Ellis said that Libra \"will fail\" without the involvement of these major payments players.</p><p>\"They bring essential, deep payments expertise, trusted payments brands, global acceptance and settlement networks, and relationships with every major financial institution, government, and regulatory body around the world,\" Ellis said in a note following PayPal's departure.</p><p>Compass Point analyst Isaac Boltansky said the financial services companies have \"an understandable reticence\" to go \"through the Washington ringer ... for a Big Tech firm that will be in the crosshairs for the foreseeable future and a product that is far from fully formed.\"</p><p>\"Libra has raised a number of fascinating questions that should advance the broader regulatory conversation, but neither financial services firms nor Washington appear ready to move at Libra's proposed pace,\" Boltansky said in an email.</p><p>Uber Technologies Inc., Lyft Inc., Spotify Technology SA, Iliad and Vodafone Group PLC are among the other firms that initially committed to help build and maintain the Libra payments network.</p><p>Although the payments companies decided not to join the Libra Association at this time, spokespeople at Visa, Mastercard and Stripe said their companies will continue to monitor the effort and evaluate participation.</p><p>\"Our ultimate decision will be determined by a number of factors, including the Association's ability to fully satisfy all requisite regulatory expectations,\" the spokesperson for Visa said in an emailed statement. \"Visa's continued interest in Libra stems from our belief that well-regulated blockchain-based networks could extend the value of secure digital payments to a greater number of people and places, particularly in emerging and developing markets.\"</p><p>Stripe similarly expressed support for projects like Libra that \"aim to make online commerce more accessible\" to people around the world. \"We will follow its progress closely and remain open to working with the Libra Association at a later stage,\" a spokesperson said in an emailed statement.</p><p>Mastercard cited its focus on its own efforts to enable financial inclusion around the world.</p><p>\"We believe there are potential benefits in such initiatives and will continue to monitor the Libra effort,\" a spokesperson said in an emailed statement.</p><p>EBay is pulling out of the project to focus on rolling out its managed payments experience, a spokesperson wrote.</p><p>Amid the departures, the Libra Association remains \"focused on moving,\" said Dante Disparte, the organization's head of policy and communications.</p><p>\"Although the makeup of the Association members may grow and change over time, the design principle of Libra's governance and technology, along with the open nature of this project ensures the Libra payment network will remain resilient,\" Disparte said in an emailed statement.</p><p>The Libra Association Council will host its first meeting Oct. 14, when it will announce the confirmed initial members of the Libra Association.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Payment volume declined 10% to $1.95 trillion. Wall Street analysts were expecting Visa to report earnings of $1.02 per share on $4.76 billion in revenue.</p><p>For the prior year quarter, Visa reported earnings of $1.37 per share on revenue of $5.84 billion. Analysts are projecting a decline for the full year of 7.5%, to $5.03 per share. Visa's fiscal year ends in October.</p><p>Visa did not provide an outlook for the full year, citing the pandemic. Mastercard reports earnings on Thursday morning before the market opening.Amexlast week reported an 85% decline in second-quarter net income, though it reported some recovery in spending categories outside travel, which was still down 75% compared to the start of the pandemic.</p><p>Visa reported growth for e-commerce, debit, tap to pay, click to pay, and success in partnerships. That wasn't enough to totally offset the decline in payments or provide future visibility, but it was enough for Kelly to project confidence for the long term. \"Many aspects of Visa's business have proven to be resilient and we are continuing to invest,\" Kelly said.</p><p>Visa Direct's growth in transactions was greater than 60% during the quarter, Visa's revenue from \"value added services,\" or non-payment related services for clients, grew in the mid-teens, and tap to pay grew globally. About 50 countries had growth in tap to pay of more than 5%, 10 countries grew by more than 10% and 55 countries raised their transaction limits for tap to pay. CORONAVIRUS CRISIS: ADDITIONAL COVERAGECredit cardsVisa's crisis strategy: look beyond plasticByJohn Adams41m ago529 plansAs coronavirus muddies college planning, 529 plans can helpByAnn Marsh1h agoTax regulationsIRS finalizes rules on business interest expense deduction limitsByMichael Cohn1h ago</p><p>In the U.S., 80 million contactless cards were added in the first four months of the year, and Kelly predicted contactless will accelerate as people return to offices and pay for transit fare and smaller purchases near and around their workplaces. Additionally, Visa's consulting service was working on 60% more projects than the prior year.</p><p>Like Amex, travel loss remains a challenge, as most borders remain totally or partially closed. Visa reported travel-related recovery in certain corridors, such as France to Switzerland, has recovered quickly, though most borders remain closed. Consumer travel recovery for local trips will recover faster than longer treks, the card brand reported. Within the EU, travel-related payments have increased 40% since borders reopened about a month ago, Visa reported.</p><p>Kelly earlier projected concerns about the pandemic during Visa's previous earnings call inApril, noting a strong start to 2020 had been upended by closures and a fast and severe economic downturn. Visa's pressure was partly offset by a dramatic move away from cash to digital payments, a trend that's likely to be permanent, according to Kelly, who nonetheless said it was too early to know how much the move to e-commerce would cushion other economic softness.</p><p>Investors pressed Kelly on how Visa may respond to regulatory pressure on large technology companies, which are scheduled totestifybefore Congress on competition issues this week. Visa was part of Facebook's Libra project, but departed in 2019 partly because of regulatory pressure on Facebook.</p><p>Kelly did not comment directly on how technology firms may be regulated, but said Visa relies on the companies to bolster its payments revenue.</p><p>\"We have relationships with all of the companies that you would consider big tech,\" Kelly said. \"These big techs have attracted lots of users and some of their activities will involve money movement. We want to be there for them and we'll leave it to those companies to figure out any of the regulatory pressures they are facing.\"</p><p>Kelly defended Visa's compliance with the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank law, which requires choice in routing for debit transactions. Some merchant groups have advocatedexpanding the amendmentduring the current economic crisis, which has especially hurt small businesses.</p><p>\"Visa is fully compliant with all requirements of the Durbin Amendment,\" Kelly said. \"Merchants are free and often do route debit transactions to other networks. I think we're in good shape with Durbin.\"</p><p>Kelly additionally addressed the recent social activism in the wake of George Floyd's murder by police in Minneapolis. The incident has led to several months of peaceful protests across the U.S. and other nations, as well as a reexamination of diversity in the corporate world.</p><p>\"For four centuries Black women and men hae suffered discrimination and racism. It must stop,\" Kelly said, addingVisahas taken several steps to address racial inequality - including donations to civil rights organizations, forums on diversity within the company and guidance for leaders in the company to encourage a more inclusive corporate culture. Visa also said it would increase the percentage of underrepresented executives and staff members over the next five years.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CARDPM-000001739797d74aabfff79f688100011</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CARDPM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G1-9XY1-JCRW-531J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">305430</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"928\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 SourceMedia LLC d/b/a Arizent.

By them growing we can grow together.\"In Korea, Visa identified a role it could play in supporting fintech startups go global. This is based on the fact that it is a global company operating across 200 different markets.The country head noted the competitiveness of Korean fintech firms, stating, \"They are sophisticated. They can compete well.'As part of the Visa Everywhere Initiative, Visa Korea took four out of six finalist teams of a fintech contest in May to Singapore last week. The teams promoted their product propositions at the world's largest fintech festival held in the country and visited Visa's Innovation Center there. They will gain access to Visa's Fintech Fast Track Program, which makes it easier and quicker for fintech startups to enter markets leveraging Visa's scale, reach and network of partners.</p><p/><p>Visa KoreaYoon assumed his position in March 2018, at a highly dynamic time point.He says the company's current task is \"transforming from a traditional credit card company toward digital innovation, fintech evolution.\"\"In Korea, my job is to ensure that we can help create the right digital ecosystem supporting card firms, big tech companies and merchants.'To take on the role, Visa Korea has increased the number of its staff by more than 30 percent since Yoon arrived.Korea's payment marketKorea has a highly advanced payment market, where 90 percent of all financial transactions are processed electronically. This is why Yoon doubles as country manager for Mongolia.\"Mongolia has the aspiration to lead the way to a cashless society. Korea has an advanced credit card industry and know-how of driving innovation.'This is why Visa concluded Korea would be a good country to also support Mongolia, he said.Yet he noted the government as well as local partners can take measures to enable the fintech industry to go a step further.He said the financial authorities could deregulate to a degree to make it easier for business entities to better serve their clients without creating risk.\"Regulators should always stay on the top of what is going on globally, what are the best practices they can learn from and collaborate closely with the industry.\"He also noted Visa's partners in Korea have yet to adopt the global standard for payments - EMV.Financial firms in digital eraFinancial firms offering payment services have begun testing various new security methods such as with facial features recognition, or with sound.\"Credit card companies will always invest to find new ways to enhance the user experience,\" Yoon said.The financial services market is becoming increasingly competitive, with fintech firms and tech companies striving to offer better experiences.Yoon says they should be viewed not as competitors but partners.'By having market participants come into the market with niche products and solution offerings, they may be creating a new market within financial services. The market is not absolute or static,' he said.Yoon noted that in times of disruption, it is the attitude of businesses that will determine their success.\"When there is digital disruption, companies that see change as an opportunity to grow their business will continue to thrive.'For Visa, this means, \"challenging the status quo, thinking and acting differently, and being agile.'This is what Visa looks for when it recruits - people who are open-minded.\"Once they are hired we want to make sure we have the culture and ways of working to promote the same values through training,' Yoon said.'It's about constant messaging that it's okay to fail but that we need to try new things.'Foreign businesses in KoreaPrior to joining Visa last year, Yoon was in the banking sector, where he held a managerial position for more than a decade. Based on his experience with a foreign bank in Korea, Yoon said foreign businesses in Korea need a long-term vision and be committed to this in order to succeed.'Come up with the best products and services that you offer in the market, invest in the country, the brand,' he said.'But it's not just about products and services, it's also how you engage with stakeholders. Build deep relationships during good and bad times.'Yoon has been in Korea for the past six years, and is happy to be here.'We want Korea to lead the way in digital thinking and innovation,' he said. 'The right ingredients are there for Korea to position itself as a leader in fintech.'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KTIMES-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KTIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XJ5-02G1-DYTP-W2JS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174045</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"828\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Korea Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Korea Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 18, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000266V</classCode><className>VISA INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS522320 FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS PROCESSING, RESERVE &amp;

Then the message in the inbox arrived\u2026<br/> 'Hey, we have a request to sit down and interview Jim Farley, Ford's CMO. Are you going to be able to get there at 8 for his Keynote speech?'</p><p><br/> I'm not a morning person; in fact, it's 2pm as I'm writing this and I'm still in sweat pants, but for this, I'll gladly be there. With our in-depth look at the Connected Car Expo[2], the topic of discussion was hugely conceptual. The Connected Car, where automotive and technology (outside of vehicle performance and earth saving 'greenness') collide. It's something of a sci-fi fantasy scenario for us. Driverless cars that show up at the touch of a button. Integrated car-to-mobile communication that allows you to drive and plan your day without touching your phone once.<br/>AND HERE WE WERE, W/ A CHANCE TO CHAT WITH ONE OF DETROIT'S DECISION MAKERS<br/>As I sat quietly at CCE and listened to the openings and keynotes - LA Mayor Eric Garcetti, Ford CMO Jim Farley, and Google Maps for Business Director Tarun Bhatnagar (as well as throughout the day), I came to realize what an interesting crossroads we're currently sitting at.<br/> We're a long ways off from actualizing the future, but there's definitely a lot of work being put into getting us there safely. It's a huge eco-system of automotive, tech, and regulations; and with anything industry-concept in nature, we understand that it's tough to give concrete examples of projects in the pipeline.<br/> So instead of rapid-fire inquiring Jim after his Keynote like many of my peers, I decided to take things back a notch, and focus on Jim's story with the limited time we had. We talk vision, school, and work. And for the end, Jim names for us his favorite car in Ford's stable. Enjoy!<br/> All photos are taken from the 2013 LA Auto Show.

Since we're at CCE, what exactly gets Jim excited about tech and where Ford is moving? Jim explains how he sees 2 very exciting and key transformations where tech auto have converged; including what we'll see in the next couple of years.<br/> 1) 'On the software side of things (we're not looking at driverless cars yet, that's another topic in itself), in the next couple of years, we believe we're at a tipping point with software experiences. Customers know what works well and are frustrated by the lack of innovation in the industry. Auto-interfaces are clunky, and when a lot of these big tech companies IPO'd, a lot of them developed products that were\u00a0endemic to the car industry - navigation, social graphs, etc. As they became adopted by millions, they leap-frogged us in terms of capability.\u00a0<br/> Now, we're at a point where large tech companies who have huge RD\u00a0budgets\u00a0are working directly with\u00a0automakers to make functionality safe. There's a strong need to customize UI and car companies are realizing their $700 navigation systems just aren't going to sell as well as a free app from Google. We as car people are working towards building one-off\u00a0accommodations that enable these apps to work well in our cars and opening up our ecosystems to app developers.<br/><br/> That means opening up operating systems for cars and sharing data that drivers are generating: Navigation destinations, throttle angles, commuting patterns, speeds, sharing all that to open these platforms. The whole topic of software making the car a better experience is really exciting. Like mobile devices, it's not just about talking (or traveling for the car) anymore. It's about meeting your friends, connecting to each other, interacting.'<br/>CHANGING THE FACE OF AUTOMOTIVE MARKETING<br/>2) 'The second piece is the transformation of marketing, thanks to the digital media companies. I've absolutely loved the emergence of these new important companies, who don't just do search anymore. Facebook, mobile advertising agencies, even Pinterest and Twitter (though they're not directly related to automotive). Anyone who's gone IPO realizes their core business is now in advertising; and their scale and targeting tools are good enough that they can compete (and exceed) TV.\u00a0<br/> With automotive, advertising has always been a huge vertical (beverages, food, etc.). For us as marketers, the ability to transform our marketing to a personal ad that people can\u00a0select into, based on their browsing experiences - this in turn allows us to transform our efficiencies as marketers.'\u00a0<br/>       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://techzulu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Waze_TacoBell.pngImmediately\">http://techzulu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Waze_TacoBell.pngImmediately</url> some yellow flags are raised. Automotive, marketing, ad serving, navigation, visions of sponsored ads and commercials appear in my head - as you're driving to your destination, countless commercials and pings show up on your navigation screen for nearby restaurants and businesses. I mention my worries to Jim, with Google-acquired Waze in the back of my brain.<br/> Jim discusses his personal thoughts on the matter. Companies like Google have made it very clear that their goal is to move further from the simple 'information in, information out' model and set up intuitive information, where apps can start to anticipate what customers want. Jim sees that day, but doesn't believe the car would be a good mobile advertisement platform.<br/> He assures me that he and his peers in the auto industry are starting to develop principles around these ideas, and knows for a fact that there's no choice but to opt in for these kinds of services.<br/> 'It'd be like a bad 80\u2032s sci-fi where there's a heads up display in your face, throwing nonsense at you. I believe car companies just won't bother their customers like that.'<br/> Jim goes on to explains that if carmakers have learned anything from the tech sector, it's to not monetize things. Take the Facebook model and acquire a billion users first, and then let the data decide whether the monetization line's been crossed. Car companies are in the same boat in that they want to create sticky ecosystems like Apple where all the apps add up to a great experience, but on the same token, they don't want to make things so commercial that people will hate it.<br/> 'Customers will govern that', according to Jim. 'If an automaker took that heavy-handed monetization route, I think people will just delete it.'<br/>THE CAR AS A PRIVATE SPACE<br/>Jim continues our discussion with his thoughts on privacy and how it relates to advertising and marketing. He sees TV's as a 'public' space - when you purchase one, you're expecting to find advertisements on that. A mobile device, is an accessory to yourself, and it's more private. So you feel conflicted when you start to see ads. Cars, Jim believes, are even\u00a0more personal than mobile in a way. It's a private space and he's confident that FORD's principles wouldn't want to turn their cars into newsletters.<br/>       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://techzulu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/1471280_10152014994489339_1069057337_n.jpg\">http://techzulu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/1471280_10152014994489339_1069057337_n.jpg</url><br/>I'M KIND OF A GEEK - FROM ENGINEER TO MARKETING EXEC<br/><br/>I direct our discussion to a more personal tone. One thing I'd noticed about Jim through his Keynote, crowd interviews, and our conversation here is just how quickly his eyes light up when he hears the word 'data'. Jim talks to us about his background.<br/> 'I've always been a car person, ever since I was a kid. I went to Georgetown and ran the computer lab, then moved on to work at IBM. Honestly, I'm kind of a geek. But after I went to grad school at UCLA for finance, I decided to get into the car industry because it was my love. I had some qualms about entering a field that I loved so much but it felt right. At the end of the day though, I feel like I'm more of an engineer.'<br/> 'When I started working in the marketing space, the lack of science in the discipline just\u00a0appalled\u00a0me. We'd sit in meetings and people would simply state {I don't like this, I don't like that, the design of this car, I kind of like it, let's go with that}. I remember thinking at the time {what do you know about minivans? You're 27 years old and don't have a family, what do you know about stow and go seats?<br/><br/> Jim's always been attracted to data driven decisions since the beginning.<br/> 'Digital marketing turned the art of advertising into a science.'<br/> Jim speaks highly on the idea of self-selected marketing. With these tools, he's been able to see what people are actually opting into. Before with TV, if it was a terrible ad, he didn't get the feedback he needed. Jim rattles off a hilarious statistic that 10% of people watching primetime television are drunk or asleep. He explains that this was one extremely odd quirk about him compared to his peers. While other marketers love judging ads and cars, Jim claims he wasn't particularly into that.<br/>       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://techzulu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/1452021_10152014995314339_1787014698_n.jpg\">http://techzulu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/1452021_10152014995314339_1787014698_n.jpg</url><br/>GOING INTO MARKETING SEEMED LIKE HIS WORST DECISION<br/>According to Jim, he ended up at UCLA because it was the best school he could afford at the time. He chuckles as he reflects:<br/> 'I had very little money, but it was still an amazing experience. This was way before they had Anderson hall, so we took classes out of an old science building. I wanted business school because I felt stuck - at IBM - selling personal computers. It wasn't part of their core business as they were focused on selling big systems. I went to graduate school to change things up, met a lot of people, and made a decision to follow my passion.'<br/> According to Jim, though he loved cars, going into marketing seemed like a disastrous decision with his engineer's mind. But he had to start at the right place. He originally started work at Toyota in their future product planning division - on deck for him and his team, the insurmountable task of creating the Lexus brand.<br/> Jim talks about working Toyota's product engineers, who were based out of Japan. For them, English was a 2nd language, and there he was trying to explain to them what customers in the US market would want. Working in marketing helped him to find the intersections between domestic and German luxury cars.<br/>GREAT STRIDES WITH TOYOTA<br/>'I loved that job,' Jim says with no hesitation. And for good reason; he did plenty of good for Toyota when they were a growing company in the US market. He proposed the first RX300 for production, and his group introduced the first unibody Rav4. At the time, Toyota only had the Camry as a staple car, so he worked to build the Sienna mini-van and Avalon luxury sedan off the Camry platform. It was a unique innovation at the time, to build different variations of one car and be able to sell them to different demographics of customers.<br/> His more direct jump into Toyota's marketing division came when Toyota announced they had an opening in advertisement. Jim recalls their words: 'We need a geek'. The campaign was for the '92 Camry. It was supposed to be a huge statement for Toyota to take on the Taurus and other cars in a domestic dominated market.<br/>       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://techzulu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/l-xfpw48strtb9k6.jpg\">http://techzulu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/l-xfpw48strtb9k6.jpg</url><br/> When Jim entered advertising he was absolutely shocked with how little data his colleagues were using to make decisions. Picture this scenario of an marketing board meeting - in spaghetti at the wall fashion:<br/> 'We'd be sitting in a meeting and there'd be four idea suggestions on the wall. One guy would say something like {I like #2 - we have a dog, that's a great dog, I think people like us would enjoy this car.} I'm looking around the room thinking to myself {This is absolutely insane, why is no one else seeing this?} That's just how the advertising game was at the time.\u00a0<br/> Jim assures me that I'd have a hell of a time sitting in on their meeting process. He explains some of the changes they made in regards to what he believes the true capital 'M' in marketing stands for:<br/>MARKETERS NEED TO INSPIRE PRODUCT TEAMS TO DEVELOP GREAT CARS - JIM'S NERDY SIDE SHOWS<br/>According to Jim, that's a marketer's job first and foremost, but first; their job was to figure out what the consumer wants. He explains how his team adopted archetype research from the gaming industry. With the 12 pronounced archetypes[4] (rulers, magicians, etc.) they were able to work with designers to better understand the emotional state of customers when they see a physical product.<br/> Jim explains this methodical method was extremely new in the industry - by isolating an archetype that they're aiming for, they can direct the designers to translate functional forms into the ideas they're trying to connect with. Organic shapes vs hard? Something new? Or familiar? And with each archetype there was a different vantage point. After crafting these stories they'd be able to create the advertising campaigns 5 years down the road and remain data driven the entire time.<br/>THE FINAL (AND MOST IMPORTANT) QUESTION<br/>'Jim, what's your favorite car in the stable?' I ask to close our interview.<br/> 'I've always had a tough time answering this one. Honestly, I'm not a\u00a0one car guy. And while I wholeheartedly believe the Fusion and MKZ (same platform) hybrids are the best cars we have in Ford's stable\u2026 I'm still a Mustang guy at heart.<br/><br/>       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://techzulu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/1458506_10152014994994339_944210986_n.jpg\">http://techzulu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/1458506_10152014994994339_944210986_n.jpg</url><br/>       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://techzulu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/1468802_10152014995044339_502332624_n.jpg\">http://techzulu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/1468802_10152014995044339_502332624_n.jpg</url><br/> Jim chuckles, shakes his head, looks down, and back up at me with a child-like grin.<br/> 'With the pressures of our job - The Mustang is honestly the only thing I can get into and just truly be myself.'<br/> And with that, we ended the interview. On a personal note, I came into this experience with very little expectations or direction on where I'd like to take it. As my first opportunity to interview someone who sits near the top of an house-hold company, it was both a surreal and and humbling experience. A genuine thanks to Jim for taking the time with speaking to us at TechZulu!<br/> *A Quick note - in the time that I'd attended CCE, conducted this interview, and turned my notes into this article, Ford's made the huge announcement for their much anticipated 2015 Mustang[5]. My first impressions - It's an aggressive, snarling beast with more influences from 'TRON' inspiration than 'Gone in 60 Seconds' (1974).*\u00a0<br/>       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://techzulu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/slide_0003.png\">http://techzulu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/slide_0003.png</url><br/> The post Vision, School, Work | Interview with Jim Farley CMO Ford Motors[6] appeared first on TechZulu[7].<br/> [1]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://connectedcarexpo.com\">http://connectedcarexpo.com</url>/ [2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://techzulu.com/look-future-connected-car-expo\">http://techzulu.com/look-future-connected-car-expo</url>/ [3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10152014969299339.1073741842.11908364338type=3\">https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10152014969299339.1073741842.11908364338type=3</url> [4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.soulcraft.co/essays/the_12_common_archetypes.html\">http://www.soulcraft.co/essays/the_12_common_archetypes.html</url> [5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.autoblog.com/2013/12/05/2015-ford-mustang-official-photos-reveal-info/\">http://www.autoblog.com/2013/12/05/2015-ford-mustang-official-photos-reveal-info/</url> [6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://techzulu.com/vision-school-work-interview-jim-farley-cmo-ford-motors\">http://techzulu.com/vision-school-work-interview-jim-farley-cmo-ford-motors</url>/ [7]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://techzulu.com\">http://techzulu.com</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-ZULU11084513863580964959697907</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ZULU-110845</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5B0P-5MC1-F03R-N4N6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2553\"/><timeReceived>7:28 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2013 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>TechZulu</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"12\" year=\"2013\"><dateText>December 6, 2013 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002J45</classCode><className>FORD MOTOR CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS336112 LIGHT TRUCK &amp;

Right now the Australian government is considering amending the Competition...</p><p>YOU might have missed it \u2013 what with the biggest recession since the 1930s and a pandemic going on \u2013 but there may be big, and bad, changes happening to a media landscape near you.    Right now the Australian government is considering amending the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 to force Google and Facebook to pay local commercial media organisations for the sharing of their content on the digital platforms.    The News Media and Digital Platforms Bargaining Code proposed by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission will require the tech and media companies to make terms through \u201cmandatory binding arbitration\u201d. It will also oblige them to divulge parts of their core intellectual property (such Google\u2019s search algorithm).    It has been lauded as a world-first in addressing the power imbalance between the platforms and traditional news organisations.    Champions such as commission chief Rod Sims argue it\u2019s a simple matter of forcing Google and Facebook to pay a fair price for extracting value from journalism for which they pay nothing. As Sims put it:    What this was all about was the imbalance in bargaining power, the market failure that comes from that, and underpayment for news having a detrimental effect on Australian society.    Who could argue with that? Even federal treasurer Josh Frydenberg has described it as \u201ca question of fairness\u201d.     But from an economic standpoint the whole bargaining code is hopelessly confused. It fails to properly understand the source of competitive pressure for media companies, and why they have lost revenues over the last 15 years.    Mandatory binding arbitration between tech and media companies is also a completely inappropriate policy tool to achieve the public policy goal of fostering high-quality journalism.    As I have written about in detail for the Stigler Center at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, making the code law risks doing serious harm to Australian consumers while shovelling money to large media companies like Nine Entertainment and News Corp Australia.    Faced with the prospect of having to divulge key intellectual property, it would not be surprising if Google and Facebook simply prefer not to be in the Australian market. Millions of Australians using Google, YouTube and Facebook will lose out.    Media revenue sinking    Between 2002 and 2018, consulting firm AlphaBeta estimates total annual revenue for Australian newspapers fell from A$4.4 billion to A$3.0 billion. Almost all of this was due to lost classified advertising revenue, worth A$1.5 billion in 2002 but just A$200 million in 2018.    \u201cThat\u2019s Google\u2019s fault,\u201d you might cry.    Actually no. The vast bulk of lost classified advertising revenue was due to online \u201cpure-plays\u201d such as Seek, Domain and Carsales. Google and Facebook took basically none of this revenue.    The media companies were sitting on a gold mine of classified advertising. Then there was massive technological disruption due to the internet and smart phones.    That, as they say in the classics, is show business.    It doesn\u2019t justify making companies who happened to succeed in an adjacent space at the same time fork over a chunk of their revenues.    But aren\u2019t tech companies \u2018stealing\u2019 content?    If big tech companies were somehow allowing you and me free access to content we would otherwise have to pay for, there might be a case to answer.    That would be like Google Maps not only giving you directions to a restaurant but the means to also avoid paying for your meal.    But using a search engine does not allow you to get free meals, nor to get around a news organisation\u2019s pay wall.    In fact, having their content pop up in search results, or shared on social media, helps Australian media companies to attract readers and sell subscriptions \u2013 something that now accounts for roughly half the revenues of some leading players such as The Australian.    All you get for \u201cfree\u201d is a snippet of a line or two from the search.    For instance, when I searched for news about recently deceased US Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, I got this:    If you can figure out the full content of the article from that snippet, you should be using your superpowers for other, more lucrative purposes.    Beware the politics    There is a very real risk this misguided code will end up becoming law.    An overzealous regulator has proposed something that stands to benefit the big media companies, who are \u2013 not surprisingly \u2013 strongly for it.    Those same media companies have huge influence over public perceptions and the fate of politicians. It will be a brave elected representative who pushes back on the proposed code and draft legislation.    But if politicians were serious about resolving the real issue at stake in all of this, they would act more directly.    Like newspapers all around the world, Australian media and journalists are under pressure \u2013 and one thing most people agree on is that high-quality news and journalism is critical to a well-functioning democracy.    Whatever the market forces that have slashed the funding of such journalism, there is a strong case for government intervention. But if the Australian government wants to subsidise high-quality journalism, it should do it itself.    With the 10-year bond rate less than 1%, it would cost the government just A$18 million a year to fund the interest bill on A$2 billion of media subsidies a year. That\u2019s 72 cents per Australian a year.    And all without driving away the hugely valuable services of companies like Google and Facebook that Australian consumers love.

If the government is serious about helping the industry, they should be acting much more directly.    You might have missed it \u2013 what with the biggest recession since the 1930s and a pandemic going on \u2013 but there may be big, and bad, changes happening to a media landscape near you.   Right now the Australian government is considering amending the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 to force Google and Facebook to pay local commercial media organisations for the sharing of their content on the digital platforms.    Jeff Chiu/AP    The News Media and Digital Platforms Bargaining Code proposed by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission will require the tech and media companies to make terms through \u201cmandatory binding arbitration\u201d. It will also oblige them to divulge parts of their core intellectual property (such Google\u2019s search algorithm).     It has been lauded as a world-first in addressing the power imbalance between the platforms and traditional news organisations.   Champions such as commission chief Rod Sims argue it\u2019s a simple matter of forcing Google and Facebook to pay a fair price for extracting value from journalism for which they pay nothing. As Sims put it :   What this was all about was the imbalance in bargaining power, the market failure that comes from that, and underpayment for news having a detrimental effect on Australian society.   Who could argue with that? Even federal treasurer Josh Frydenberg has described it as \u201ca question of fairness\u201d.   But from an economic standpoint the whole bargaining code is hopelessly confused. It fails to properly understand the source of competitive pressure for media companies, and why they have lost revenues over the last 15 years.   Mandatory binding arbitration between tech and media companies is also a completely inappropriate policy tool to achieve the public policy goal of fostering high-quality journalism.   As I have written about in detail for the Stigler Center at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, making the code law risks doing serious harm to Australian consumers while shovelling money to large media companies like Nine Entertainment and News Corp Australia.   Faced with the prospect of having to divulge key intellectual property, it would not be surprising if Google and Facebook simply prefer not to be in the Australian market. Millions of Australians using Google, YouTube and Facebook will lose out.  Media revenue sinking  Between 2002 and 2018, consulting firm AlphaBeta estimates total annual revenue for Australian newspapers fell from A$4.4 billion to A$3.0 billion. Almost all of this was due to lost classified advertising revenue, worth A$1.5 billion in 2002 but just A$200 million in 2018.   \u201cThat\u2019s Google\u2019s fault,\u201d you might cry.   Actually no. The vast bulk of lost classified advertising revenue was due to online \u201cpure-plays\u201d such as Seek, Domain and Carsales. Google and Facebook took basically none of this revenue.   The media companies were sitting on a gold mine of classified advertising. Then there was massive technological disruption due to the internet and smart phones.   That, as they say in the classics, is show business.   It doesn\u2019t justify making companies who happened to succeed in an adjacent space at the same time fork over a chunk of their revenues.  But aren\u2019t tech companies \u2018stealing\u2019 content?  If big tech companies were somehow allowing you and me free access to content we would otherwise have to pay for, there might be a case to answer.   That would be like Google Maps not only giving you directions to a restaurant but the means to also avoid paying for your meal.   But using a search engine does not allow you to get free meals, nor to get around a news organisation\u2019s pay wall.   In fact, having their content pop up in search results, or shared on social media, helps Australian media companies to attract readers and sell subscriptions \u2013 something that now accounts for roughly half the revenues of some leading players such as The Australian.   All you get for \u201cfree\u201d is a snippet of a line or two from the search.   For instance, when I searched for news about recently deceased US Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, I got this:   If you can figure out the full content of the article from that snippet, you should be using your superpowers for other, more lucrative purposes.  Beware the politics  There is a very real risk this misguided code will end up becoming law.   An overzealous regulator has proposed something that stands to benefit the big media companies, who are \u2013 not surprisingly \u2013 strongly for it.   Those same media companies have huge influence over public perceptions and the fate of politicians. It will be a brave elected representative who pushes back on the proposed code and draft legislation.   But if politicians were serious about resolving the real issue at stake in all of this, they would act more directly.   Like newspapers all around the world, Australian media and journalists are under pressure \u2013 and one thing most people agree on is that high-quality news and journalism is critical to a well-functioning democracy.   Whatever the market forces that have slashed the funding of such journalism, there is a strong case for government intervention. But if the Australian government wants to subsidise high-quality journalism, it should do it itself.   With the 10-year bond rate less than 1%, it would cost the government just A$18 million a year to fund the interest bill on A$2 billion of media subsidies a year. That\u2019s 72 cents per Australian a year.   And all without driving away the hugely valuable services of companies like Google and Facebook that Australian consumers love.

But from an economic standpoint the whole bargaining code is hopelessly confused. It fails to properly understand the source of competitive pressure for media companies, and why they have lost revenues over the last 15 years.    Mandatory binding arbitration between tech and media companies is also a completely inappropriate policy tool to achieve the public policy goal of fostering high-quality journalism.    As I have written about in detail for the Stigler Center at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, making the code law risks doing serious harm to Australian consumers while shovelling money to large media companies like Nine Entertainment and News Corp Australia.    Faced with the prospect of having to divulge key intellectual property, it would not be surprising if Google and Facebook simply prefer not to be in the Australian market. Millions of Australians using Google, YouTube and Facebook will lose out.   Media revenue sinking   Between 2002 and 2018, consulting firm AlphaBeta estimates total annual revenue for Australian newspapers fell from A$4.4 billion to A$3.0 billion. Almost all of this was due to lost classified advertising revenue, worth A$1.5 billion in 2002 but just A$200 million in 2018.    \u201cThat\u2019s Google\u2019s fault,\u201d you might cry.    Actually no. The vast bulk of lost classified advertising revenue was due to online \u201cpure-plays\u201d such as Seek, Domain and Carsales. Google and Facebook took basically none of this revenue.      The media companies were sitting on a gold mine of classified advertising. Then there was massive technological disruption due to the internet and smart phones.    That, as they say in the classics, is show business.    It doesn\u2019t justify making companies who happened to succeed in an adjacent space at the same time fork over a chunk of their revenues.   But aren\u2019t tech companies \u2018stealing\u2019 content?   If big tech companies were somehow allowing you and me free access to content we would otherwise have to pay for, there might be a case to answer.    That would be like Google Maps not only giving you directions to a restaurant but the means to also avoid paying for your meal.    But using a search engine does not allow you to get free meals, nor to get around a news organisation\u2019s pay wall.      In fact, having their content pop up in search results, or shared on social media, helps Australian media companies to attract readers and sell subscriptions \u2013 something that now accounts for roughly half the revenues of some leading players such as The Australian.    All you get for \u201cfree\u201d is a snippet of a line or two from the search.    For instance, when I searched for news about recently deceased US Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, I got this:         If you can figure out the full content of the article from that snippet, you should be using your superpowers for other, more lucrative purposes.   Beware the politics   There is a very real risk this misguided code will end up becoming law.    An overzealous regulator has proposed something that stands to benefit the big media companies, who are \u2013 not surprisingly \u2013 strongly for it.    Those same media companies have huge influence over public perceptions and the fate of politicians. It will be a brave elected representative who pushes back on the proposed code and draft legislation.    But if politicians were serious about resolving the real issue at stake in all of this, they would act more directly.    Like newspapers all around the world, Australian media and journalists are under pressure \u2013 and one thing most people agree on is that high-quality news and journalism is critical to a well-functioning democracy.      Whatever the market forces that have slashed the funding of such journalism, there is a strong case for government intervention. But if the Australian government wants to subsidise high-quality journalism, it should do it itself.    With the 10-year bond rate less than 1%, it would cost the government just A$18 million a year to fund the interest bill on A$2 billion of media subsidies a year. That\u2019s 72 cents per Australian a year.    And all without driving away the hugely valuable services of companies like Google and</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-43156671604</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60XC-9Y01-F07F-83MT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"977\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Conversation AU</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 24, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"80\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"80\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"80\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"80\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"80\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"80\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"80\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"80\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"80\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"80\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"80\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"80\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

In addition to serving this public, the product's outstanding feature is a telemedicine service and a network of pre-selected doctors offered through a big tech platform that helps control costs. The new health insurance will be marketed to startup companies at a price 20% lower than the market's norm. </p><p>To minimize risk and maintain the claim rate at 70% (percentage considered ideal), Vitta will set up a pool of startups - similarly to what Qualicorp does with trade associations. Eligible startups are those with one to 499 employees. Vitta's health insurance plan was registered at the National Regulatory Agency for Private Health Insurance and Plans (ANS) in partnership with Omint and Unimed insurance operators, which defined a specific network of hospitals and laboratories and will be responsible for the financial reserves required by the regulatory agency. Vitta started to offer its telemedicine services and provider network last November as a consultancy for companies that wanted to manage health insurance for their employees. In this short period, it has won over 70 companies that together have almost 80,000 users of health insurance. \"The readjustment in this client base was in average half of the medical inflation\", says Jo\u00e3o Gabriel Alkmin, CEO at Vitta, which has already received an investment of R$35 million. Founded in 2015, Vitta started with a software company in the healthcare industry and reinforced its operations by acquiring Clinic Web, a medical records platform for clinics and hospitals. Over the years, more than 15,000 physicians like Drauzio Varella, a star doctor in Brazil, began to use the platform, which enabled Vitta to gather a vast database. \"We gathered the best physicians who have the best clinical outcomes and set up a network. Their remuneration is up to 25% higher,\" Mr. Alkmin says. With Vitta's platform, patients can have an initial consultation through WhatsApp with doctors who already have access to the patient's health history. Then, the user is referred to a specialist or emergency room, if applicable. The platform itself schedules the appointment according to the location and available time of the patient. \"This happened to me. I had a sore throat, I had constantly problems with it. On the third day, with a slightly more advanced infection, I talked to the doctor by WhatsApp instead of going to the emergency room as I normally do. I sent a picture of my throat through the app. The case required an appointment with an expert, whose schedule was promptly scheduled at the end of that same day and in the same neighborhood. In addition, the specialist doctor already knew my entire health history, including the sore throat tablet I was using,\" Mr. Alkmin says.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">VALORI-6434151</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">VALORI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X46-2TM1-DYNN-T35T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433836</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"500\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Valor Economico S.A.

Vivek Ranadive joins us from TIBCO. He's also got a side job as an owner of a basketball team. His balance sheet has been adjusted by Steven Ballmer.   </p><p>      I mean sports, as you know, with your heritage in India, is a great solution for the Indian culture, whether it's cricket, as an example, or basketball within America. We have seen so much animosity before Mr. Ballmer at the Clippers. What would you like to see the NBA do this season and particularly in the opening of the season to help America heal or come together?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VIVEK RANADIVE, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, TIBCO</emphasis>: Well, I thought that our commissioner Adam Silver acted decisively and very, very quickly. And I welcome Steve into the NBA fraternity.   </p><p>      I think it's going to be a fantastic season for the NBA. It's a global sport. We're taking our team to China this offseason, the preseason. And I just expect a lot of the troubles of the past to be behind us.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Within this and within what we see in Ferguson, Missouri, sport has always brought America together. Somewhat reluctantly--  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RANADIVE</emphasis>: Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: I can remember some of that as a kid. What needs to be done right now given the events of the past week?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RANADIVE</emphasis>: Well, we actually have a player Ben McLemore who's from the St. Louis area. He had great sympathy for the protesters. And he's been posting to Instagram. He's actually in China right now representing the Kings.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Mm-hmm.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RANADIVE</emphasis>: And I think full transparency is what everybody is asking for. And, as you said, sport is the great unifier. All we care about in basketball is do we have game? And that's really what America is about.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ADAM JOHNSON, HOST, BLOOMBERG TELEVISION</emphasis>: Well, you talk about a great unifier, I remember when Yao Ming because the first Chinese player in the NBA and you have now just brought in the first India player, Sim Bhullar, if I've got his name right. He's like 7'5 and 360 pounds. How's this going to change the game?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RANADIVE</emphasis>: Well, I believe that basketball could be one of the most popular sports in India. I have this vision -- I call it NBA 3.0, making basketball the global sport of the 21st century. And markets like India and China are going to help make it that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: So TIBCO didn't get comp tickets to the World Cup right?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RANADIVE</emphasis>: No, no, no. </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RANADIVE</emphasis>: We are using TIBCO technology. In many ways, a basketball team is like any other business. It's a social network-type of perishable inventory. And whether you're selling basketball tickets, airline tickets, banking products--  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Did you really end up in Boston with $50 in your pocket before you went to MIT? Is that story true or did they make that up for you?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RANADIVE</emphasis>: Well, that is true. We have the rupee isn't a convertible currency.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RANADIVE</emphasis>: So you could only have a little bit converted. And so I had about $50 when I showed up.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Very good. I hope you didn't switch it at American Express, because you would have gotten killed back then. Vivek Ranadive with us from TIBCO. We have so much to talk about, about his success in computers as well.  </p><p>      0710  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p>      0724  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCARLET FU, HOST, BLOOMBERG NEWS</emphasis>: Vivek Ranadive, you played a big role in digitizing Wall Street. So when you hear about the banks recovering, resurging really, what are your thoughts in terms of how much more they should be utilizing technology?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RANADIVE</emphasis>: Well, I think that more than regulation a bigger threat to the banks is technology. And the bank of the future will probably have no walls. It will be a social network attached to a computer program. And so I don't think they use a lot of technology right now. I think the best is yet to come.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: The best is yet to come, Vivek Ranadive, our guest host for the hour.  </p><p>      0725  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p>      0729  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Good morning, everyone. \"This Matters Now\" to our guest host. Vivek Ranadive runs TIBCO. They are the bridge for countless big companies interacting with customers. Think Citigroup Asia and Delta Airlines, just as two examples.   </p><p>      Mr. Ranadive landed in Cambridge with the proverbial $50 and dreams. After MIT, after corporate success, he still knows math is what matters. This is a major American debate. People will say you, Raghuram Rajan, now the head of the Central Bank in India out of Booth School, Chicago and others. This is easy for those Indians. How do we make this easy for Americans who seem to have a math phobia?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RANADIVE</emphasis>: Well, I believe that math is going to trump science, so it's essential that we have a strong math curriculum for kids growing up. And you can make math fun and you can make it interesting.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: You can make it fun is the heart of the matter.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RANADIVE</emphasis>: Yeah, in fact, you can have fantasy sports, which is all math. Everything ends up being a math problem, so whether you're trying to win a basketball, find a cure for cancer, prevent power outages, prevent lost baggage, all math problems.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: I am absolutely fascinated as a leader in the NBA, as an owner of the Sacramento Kings. The math people say America's a jockocracy. The jockocracy say math's going to get me nowhere. You're one of the few people in the nation to truly bridge this gap.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RANADIVE</emphasis>: Well, I believe that all the answers are in the data. We're now living at a time when we generated ten times as much data in the last couple of years as has existed in the history of mankind. So if you can find the patterns, those patterns will give answers. So math is essential.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Math's essential for those that value your company as well. You have stated that you feel your company's undervalued. There's been all sorts of discussion of who would take out your TIBCO. Hewlett Packard, I think of IBM. Seems like IBM buys a company about every 8 hours. What kind of business would take out TIBCO and give it a proper valuation?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RANADIVE</emphasis>: Well, I can't say, but TIBCO is a valuable franchise we're the leaders in integration, we're the leaders in big data. Those are two of the top three priorities for most companies right now. So it's viewed as a valuable company by all the giants.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Within that and the other mystery as we go into the autumn of 2014, is cloud-itis. Everybody's into the cloud. When you hear people that have no idea what the cloud is, talking about the cloud, how do you respond to that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RANADIVE</emphasis>: Well, I think a lot of things will be put in the cloud, but perhaps not everything. And so most companies will end up with what I call a hybrid cloud. Where there will be some things in the cloud, but some things by government regulation are required to be on premise. And what TIBCO does is we provide integration so all of that works together.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Right. Is the cloud any different than the fad of big data? Or the fad of nanosphere? I mean, are we going to have over investment in the cloud or more importantly mal-investment (ph)?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RANADIVE</emphasis>: Well, just like any other bubble, you go through these cycles where the latest buzzword becomes the next big thing. But the cloud is very much here to stay. So the way that people will consume technology will be through cloud-based services.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: How do you respond within TIBCO's work to the idea that all the computer jobs go to Asia, all the computer jobs go to India. Is that true?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RANADIVE</emphasis>: Well, I think that a lot of the jobs do go to Asia. But typically they're lower on the value chain and so most of the innovation is still happening in Silicon Valley and it's a win-win situation. So it's really not a win-lose.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: OK, I've got about 8 more questions. We didn't even get to these. Vivek Ranadive with us as well.  </p><p>      0733  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p>      0738  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Well, part of that, and Vivek Ranadive with us with TIBCO and from India, is our diplomacy with India. The drama of Mr. Modi visiting Nepal as his first visit. Describe the symbolism of India's nascent diplomacy with the United States.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RANADIVE</emphasis>: The Indian community both over here as well as all Indians are very excited about Modi right now. And so the Indians are looking to how the United States reacts to Modi. And it's well known that he didn't have a visa to travel here before.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RANADIVE</emphasis>: And so throwing out the welcome mat for him is viewed as extremely important by Indians right now.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: And I would suggest within many cultures, you don't do this by telephone or by technology.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: It's got to be in person.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: You've got to go.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>: Which is why Secretary Kerry has been traveling extensively.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: A little busy.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: Yeah. Maybe too much for one person, some might say.  </p><p>      0738  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p>      0744  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Well, Vivek Ranadive with us who does computer systems for the likes, this is right up your alley isn't it?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RANADIVE</emphasis>: Well, it is. And retail is nothing more than a social network tied to perishable inventory. And every retail is in danger of getting \"Amazoned\" and this is the real threat that all of these companies have.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: I mean, there it is across any number of businesses.  </p><p>      0744  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p>      0749  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: TIBCO has been doing big data for years. Vivek Ranadive, Founder, Chief Executive Officer of TIBCO. Well, he knows that your LOB needs SAAS. Is that enough jargon for you?  </p><p>      He also respectfully suggests that the big data craze is baloney and what's needed is fast data. And I guess it's something that Bloomberg lives every single day. You need those two seconds beforehand versus the big data after the fact. You're living this aren't you?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RANADIVE</emphasis>: That's right. Many of the 20th century companies would have you believe that big data = big database. But those companies tell you that you've lost the customer after the customer leaves. Or that you have a power outage when you're already sitting in darkness.  </p><p>      And with fast data, we prevent the customer from walking out the door. We want to make the customer the offer before he leaves the aisle, not six months after he leaves.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Well, let's talk about the aisle down the airplane. If I'm on a Delta Airlines, you represent Delta Airlines as one of your customers. What do you sell Delta Airlines or Citigroup or anybody else on fast data?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RANADIVE</emphasis>: So if there is a weather delay, then with slow data what would happen is that the entire airline value chain would be disrupted.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: No, I go get a large Starbucks, have three cups of coffee. And then the three hour flight, you're awake.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>: What about the Cinnabon?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: That's right the Cinnabon.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RANADIVE</emphasis>: They know everything that's happening in real time. They can combine that with historical information about you. And they can give you something to make you happy even before you have a chance to become unhappy.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>: When you say make me happy, does that mean they're going to try to sell me something or they're going to give me information? An article I might find interesting and want to read? </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RANADIVE</emphasis>: Well, it could be information, it could perishable inventory they have. So if you're sitting at one of my games and you tweet you had cold pizza, I'd pick that up and I know that you're coming to the next game, you don't have parking, your kids are there, my hot dogs will go bad. So rather than waste the hot dogs or the parking, we give that to you and you're happy even before you become unhappy.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Within this, Scarlet, we talked earlier about Hewlett Packard and IBM to get this conversation started on the future of TIBCO. Why is big tech so cheap? Every person including Adam Parker that comes on here says big tech is cheap?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: The non-social media tech company.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Yeah. Why is big tech so inexpensively priced?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RANADIVE</emphasis>: I think that that's not something that should be the case. I think there's a lot of frenzy right now around companies that lose large amounts of money and they have crazy multiples. And many of the big tech companies are highly profitable, they have good cash flow. But they don't seem to be viewed as the sexy investments.  </p><p>      But I do believe that there is an argument to be made that many of the older companies will get replaced and so there is some justification for that line of thinking.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: Well, a lot of activist investors have looked at these old tech companies thinking there's a lot of opportunity there. I know that Presidium Investment Management said that it wanted to actively engage TIBCO's board in dialogue. Can you give us an update on that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RANADIVE</emphasis>: Well, not really. I think that activists have been in Apple, Microsoft, Yahoo, Adobe, EMC, and I think that if you have a profitable company, that's basically well-run, you can be a target of activists. If you have a company that loses large amounts of money and has a crazy multiple, then there's nothing that the activist would do with a company like that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: It is August. People are taking the GMATs; they're getting smarter. You were a Baker Scholar at the Harvard Business School. That's the pantheon. That's the LeBron James--  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: This was after MIT.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Yeah. The LeBron James of NBA. What should someone study within an MBA curricula? My guess is more math, more acuity and that's not there is it?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RANADIVE</emphasis>: Well, this last year we looked at 30 gigabytes of data, which is more data than had been generated in the entire history of the NBA just for our Sacramento Kings. So basketball to me is really a big data problem. In fact when I coach my daughter's basketball team. I converted it into a math equation and I believe that how you win games is really a math problem.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Should LeBron have gone to Sacramento?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RANADIVE</emphasis>: We would have loved to--  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>: Yeah, I can only imagine. Hey, how do you use those 30 gigabytes of data to make my experience better when I go to watch your Sacramento Kings?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RANADIVE</emphasis>: So once you opt in, we know everything about you. And we pick up everything that you put out. So we can give you an experience that's extremely customized to you. Your kids could be with you. We know what your likes are. We know what your dislikes are.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>: So literally if I tweet next Tuesday I'm with my best bud and we're at bah-bah-bah-bum, somehow that gets stored and you use that information?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RANADIVE</emphasis>: That's right. So, like I said earlier, even if you say you had cold pizza or you are with your bud, we know everything. And at the root of everything we have what we call a psychological router where we can take sentiment and figure out what kind of actions will convert that into intention and then into action. So again it's all about marrying the social network to the perishable inventory we have.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>: I don't know if I should be scared or think this is really cool. Because literally you're using, I'm putting all this out there on social media but you're actually using it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: It's a little too late for that if you're putting that out.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>: Yeah, right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RANADIVE</emphasis>: And it's if you opt in. If you opt in then you start getting the cool stuff.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: Vivek Ranadive, CEO, Founder, Chairman of TIBDO, and by the way he was also Grand Marshall at the India Day Parade yesterday in New York City. So that's why he was in town. That was a lot of fun?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RANADIVE</emphasis>: It was a blast. There were I think 150,000 people there.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>: Oh my gosh.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RANADIVE</emphasis>: And the mayor was there--  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>: In one parade?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RANADIVE</emphasis>: In one parade, they had Madison Avenue shut down and it was a huge honor to be a part of it.  </p><p>      0755  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p>      0757  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Again Vivek, thank you so much. Vivek Ranadive with TIBCO and the Sacramento Kings as well.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RANADIVE</emphasis>: Thank you.  </p><p>      0758            </p><p> ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  </p><p>      THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Yet an internal discussion thread leaked to Breitbart News reveals Google regularly intervenes in search results on its YouTube video platform - including a recent intervention that pushed pro-life videos out of the top ten search results for 'abortion.' The term 'abortion' was added to a 'blacklist' file for 'controversial YouTube queries,' which contains a list of search terms that the company considers sensitive. According to the leak, these include some of these search terms related to: abortion, abortions, the Irish abortion referendum, Democratic Congresswoman Maxine Waters, and anti-gun activist David Hogg. </p><p>The existence of the blacklist was revealed in an internal Google discussion thread leaked to Breitbart News by a source inside the company who wishes to remain anonymous. A partial list of blacklisted terms was also leaked to Breitbart by another Google source. In the leaked discussion thread, a Google site reliability engineer hinted at the existence of more search blacklists, according to the source. 'We have tons of white- and blacklists that humans manually curate,' said the employee. 'Hopefully this isn't surprising or particularly controversial.' Others were more concerned about the presence of the blacklist. According to the source, the software engineer who started the discussion called the manipulation of search results related to abortion a 'smoking gun.' The software engineer noted that the change had occurred following aninquiry from a left-wingSlatejournalist[3]about the prominence of pro-life videos on YouTube, and that pro-life videos were replaced with pro-abortion videos in the top ten results for the search terms following Google's manual intervention. 'TheSlatewriter said she had complained last Friday and then saw different search results before YouTube responded to her on Monday,' wrote the employee. 'And lo and behold, the [changelog] was submitted on Friday, December 14 at 3:17 PM.' The manually downranked items included several videos from Dr. Antony Levatino, a former abortion doctor who is now a pro-life activist. Another video in the top ten featured a woman's personal story of being pressured to have an abortion, while another featured pro-life conservative Ben Shapiro. TheSlatejournalist who complained to Googlereported[4] that these videos previously featured in the top ten, describing them in her story as 'dangerous misinformation.' Since theSlatejournalist's inquiry andGoogle's subsequent intervention, the top search resultsnow[5]feature pro-abortion content from left-wing sources like BuzzFeed, Vice, CNN, andLast Week Tonight With John Oliver.In herreport[6], theSlatejournalist acknowledged that the search results changed shortly after she contacted Google. The manual adjustment of search results by a Google-owned platform contradicts a keyclaim[7]made under oath by Google CEO Sundar Pichai in his congressional testimony earlier this month: that his company does not 'manually intervene on any search result.' A Google employee in the discussion thread drew attention to Pichai's claim, noting that it 'seems like we are pretty eager to cater our search results to the social and political agenda of left-wing journalists.' One of the posts in the discussion also noted that the blacklist had previously been edited to include the search term 'Maxine Waters' after a single Google employee complained the top YouTube search result for Maxine Waters was 'very low quality.' Google's alleged intervention on behalf of a Democratic congresswoman would be further evidence of the tech giant using its resources to prop up the left. Breitbart News previously reported on leaked emails revealing the company targeted pro-Democrat demographics in its get-out-the-vote efforts in 2016. According to the source, a software engineer in the thread also noted that 'a bunch of terms related to the abortion referendum in Ireland' had been added to the blacklist - another change with potentially dramatic consequences on the national policies of a western democracy. youtube_controversial_query_blacklist At least one post in the discussion thread revealed the existence of a file called 'youtube_controversial_query_blacklist,' which contains a list of YouTube search terms that Google manually curates. In addition to the terms 'abortion,' 'abortions,' 'Maxine Waters,' and search terms related to the Irish abortion referendum, a Google software engineer noted that the blacklist includes search terms related to terrorist attacks. (the posts specifically mentions that the 'Strasbourg terrorist attack' as being on the list). 'If you look at the other entries recently added to theyoutube_controversial_query_blacklist(e.g., entries related to the Strasbourg terrorist attack), the addition of abortion seemsout-of-place,' wrote the software engineer, according to the source. After learning of the existence of the blacklist, Breitbart News obtained a partial screenshot of the full blacklist file from a source within Google. It reveals that the blacklist includes search terms related to both mass shootings and the progressive anti-second amendment activist David Hogg. This suggests Google has followed the lead of Democrat politicians, who haverepeatedly pushed tech companies[8]to censor content related to the Parkland school shooting and the Parkland anti-gun activists. It's part of a popular new line of thought in the political-media establishment,which views the public as too stupid to question conspiracy theories for themselves[9]. Here is the partial blacklist leaked to Breitbart:2117 plane crash Russian 2118 plane crash 2119 an-148 2120 florida shooting conspiracy 2121 florida shooting crisis actors 2122 florida conspiracy 2123 florida false flag shooting 2124 florida false flag 2125 fake florida school shooting 2126 david hogg hoax 2127 david hogg fake 2128 david hogg crisis actor 2129 david hogg forgets lines 2130 david hogg forgets his lines 2131 david hogg cant remember his lines 2132 david hogg actor 2133 david hogg cant remember 2134 david hogg conspiracy 2135 david hogg exposed 2136 david hogg lines 2137 david hogg rehearsing 2120 florida shooting conspiracyThe full internal filepath of the blacklist, according to another source, is: //depot/google3/googledata/superroot/youtube/youtube_controversial_query_blacklist Contradictions Responding to a request for comment, a YouTube spokeswoman said the company wants to promote 'authoritative' sources in its search results, but maintained that YouTube is a 'platform for free speech' that 'allow[s]' both pro-life and pro-abortion content. YouTube's full comment:YouTube is a platform for free speech where anyone can choose to post videos, as long as they follow ourCommunity Guidelines[10], which prohibit things like inciting violence and pornography. We apply these policies impartially and we allow both pro-life and pro-choice opinions. Over the last year we've described how we are working tobetter surface news sources[11]across our site for news-related searches and topical information. We've improved our search and discovery algorithms, built new features that clearly label and prominently surface news sources on our homepage and search pages, and introduced information panels to help give users more authoritative sources where they can fact check information for themselves.In the case of the 'abortion' search results, YouTube's intervention to insert 'authoritative' content resulted in the downranking of pro-life videos and the elevation of pro-abortion ones. A Google spokesperson took a tougher line than its YouTube subsidiary, stating that 'Google has never manipulated or modified the search results or content in any of its products to promote a particular political ideology.' However, in the leaked discussion thread, a member of Google's 'trust ...fety' team, Daniel Aaronson, admitted that the company maintains 'huge teams' that work to adjust search results for subjects that are 'prone to hyperbolic content, misleading information, and offensive content' - all subjective terms that are frequently used to suppress right-leaning sources. He also admitted that the interventions weren't confined to YouTube - they included search results delivered via Google Assistant, Google Home, and in rare cases Google 's organic search results. In the thread, Aaronson attempted to explain how search blacklisting worked. He claimed that highly specific searches would generate non-blacklisted results, even controversial ones. But the inclusion of highly specific terms in the YouTube blacklist, like 'David Hogg cant remember his lines' - the name of an actual viral video - seems to contradict this. Aaronson's full post is copied below:I work in Trust and Safety and while I have no particular input as to exactly what's happening for YT I can try to explain why you'd have this kind of list and why people are finding lists like these on Code Search. When dealing with abuse/controversial content on various mediums you have several levers to deal with problems. Two prominent levers are 'Proactive' and 'Reactive':Proactive: Usually refers to some type of algorithm/scalable solution to a general problem E.g.: We don't allow straight up porn on YouTube so we create a classifier that detects porn and automatically remove or flag for review the videos the porn classifier is most certain ofReactive: Usually refers to a manual fix to something that has been brought to our attention that our proactive solutions don't/didn't work on and something that is clearly in the realm of bad enough to warrant a quick targeted solution (determined by pages and pages of policies worked on over many years and many teams to be fair and cover necessary scope) E,g.: A website that used to be a good blog had it's domain expire and was purchased/repurposed to spam Search results with autogenerated pages full of gibberish text, scraped images, and links to boost traffic to other spammy sites. It is manually actioned for violating policy These Organic Search policies and the consequences to violating them are public[12] Manually reacting to things is not very scalable, and is not an ideal solution to most problems, so the proactive lever is really the one we all like to lean on. Ideally, our classifiers/algorithm are good at providing useful and rich results to our users while ignoring things at are not useful or not relevant. But we all know, this isn't exactly the case all the time (especially on YouTube). From a user perspective, there are subjects that are prone to hyperbolic content, misleading information, and offensive content. Now, these words are highly subjective and no one denies that. But we can all agree generally, lines exist in many cultures about what is clearly okay vs. what is not okay. E.g. a video of a puppy playing with a toy is probably okay in almost every culture or context, even if it's not relevant to the query. But a video of someone committing suicide and begging others to follow in his/her footsteps is probably on the other side of the line for many folks. While my second example is technically relevant to the generic query of 'suicide', that doesn't mean that this is a very useful or good video to promote on the top of results for that query. So imagine a classifier that says, for any queries on a particular text file, let's pull videos using signals that we historically understand to be strong indicators of quality (I won't go into specifics here, but those signals do exist). We're not manually curating these results, we're just saying 'hey, be extra careful with results for this query because many times really bad stuff can appear and lead to a bad experience for most users'. Ideally the proactive lever did this for us, but in extreme cases where we need to act quickly on something that is so obviously not okay, the reactive/manual approach is sometimes necessary. And also keep in mind, that this is different for every product. The bar for changing classifiers or manual actions on span in organic search isextremelyhigh. However, the bar for things we let our Google Assistant say out loud might be a lot lower. If I search for 'Jews run the banks' - I'll likely find anti-semitic stuff in organic search. As a Jew, I might find some of these results offensive, but they are there for people to research and view, and I understand that this is not a reflection of Google feels about this issue. But if I ask Google assistant 'Why do Jews run the banks' we wouldn't be similarly accepting if it repeated and promoted conspiracy theories that likely pop up in organic search in her smoothing voice. Whether we agree or not, user perception of our responses, results, and answers of different products and mediums can change. And I think many people are used to the fact that organic search is a place where content should be accessible no matter how offensive it might be, however, the expectation is very different on a Google Home, a Knowledge Panel, or even YouTube. These lines are very difficult and can be very blurry, we are all well aware of this. So we've got huge teams that stay cognizant of these facts when we're crafting policies considering classifier changes, or reacting with manual actions - these decisions are not made in a vacuum, but admittedly are also not made in a highly public forum like TGIF or IndustryInfo (as you can imagine, decisions/agreement would be hard to get in such a wide list - image if all your CL's were reviewed by every engineer across Google all the time). I hope that answers some questions and gives a better layer of transparency without going into details about our 'Pepsi formula'. Best, DanielThe fact that Google manually curates politically contentious search results fits in with a wider pattern of political activity on the part of the tech giant. In 2018, Breitbart News exclusively published a leaked video from the company that showedsenior management in dismay at Trump's election victory[13], and pledging to use the company's power to make his populist movement a'hiccup' in history[14]. Breitbart also leaked'The Good Censor,'[15]an internal research document from Google that admits the tech giant is engaged in the censorship of its own products, partly in response to political events. Another leak revealed that employees within the company, including Google's current director of Trust and Safety,tried to kick Breitbart News off Google's market-dominating online ad platforms[16]. Yet another showed Google engaged intargeted turnout operations[17]aimed to boost voter participation in pro-Democrat demographics in 'key states' ahead of the 2016 election. The effort was dubbed a 'silent donation' by a top Google employee. Evidence for Google's partisan activities is now overwhelming.President Trump has previously warned Google[18], as well as other Silicon Valley giants, not to engage in censorship or partisan activities. Google continues to defy him. Allum Bokhari is the senior technology correspondent at Breitbart News.

Let's get started. Super happy to have Pat Gelsinger, the CEO of VMware, and for those of you that don't know, otherwise known as the best CEO in America as voted by Glassdoor. Pat, what are you doing with those VMware employees, #1 CEO in America, my goodness? Free lunches? Like what is it?</p><p>PATRICK P. GELSINGER, CEO &amp; DIRECTOR, VMWARE, INC.: Well, yes, but they already had that. But so I'd say part -- I sort of said it was 3 things. One is obviously the company is doing well, right? And we got it to a good space. We navigated through some of these Dell, right, go public and those different things. And people just respect that from the other side. And our strategy is resonating. The cloud strategies, Amazon, Azure, partnerships, and so everybody's sort of feeling it, right? Okay, we're in a good spot. And then we got a great culture, right, and our epic values. Everybody sort of gets us. So that combination of things, you're doing well, got a good strategy, a good culture, people like it. And they give me more credit than I deserve, but hey, I'll take it.</p><p>KARL EMIL KEIRSTEAD: Take it. Good. Well, congrats on that. And before we get started, Paul Ziots, the head of IR, to rally all of you, wanted me to read an inspirational quote as follows. Statements made in these discussions which are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results could differ materially from those projected due to the number of factors, including those referenced in VMware's most recent SEC filings on forms 10-Q, 10-K and 8-K.</p><p>PATRICK P. GELSINGER: They're almost jumping out of their seats. So excited.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>KARL EMIL KEIRSTEAD: Great. Well, let's get started. Pat, you've had a fun run in the last 4 years as you kind of alluded to in your answer to my comment about getting that distinction. It's been a crazy 4 years at VMware. So I look back into the fall of 2015 when it looked like this huge cloud trend was going to roll over all the on-premise vendors. There were some leadership departures. Dell announced the acquisition of EMC. I think your stock was languishing down at $40. And in the span of 4 years, you're growing double digits, become cloud-relevant, stock has been in the 4x since then, so congrats on that run.</p><p>PATRICK P. GELSINGER: Thank you.</p><p>KARL EMIL KEIRSTEAD: And I know a lot of it is your work and Paul and the rest of the VMware team. But maybe where I want to start is like what's changed in the last couple of years on the tech front. Everybody listening here today and live are investing in a whole swath of tech trends. So there's a lot of mixed messages out there these days, where there are some economic worries. You've got a hardware cycle that feels like it's rolling over, but generally speaking, the software space feels generally healthy. So maybe at a super high level, what are the kind of 2 or 3 big tech trends that you have to be sure that VMware gets right that you can flag to the group?</p><p>PATRICK P. GELSINGER: Yes, so the big one in my view is this overall digitization, right, trend that's going on, and every company needs to figure out their digital transformation strategy. And for tech, that means that tech is no longer a purchasing by the CIO. He is a strategic priority of the business. And as I've described it, this has led tech to be outside of the normal cyclical cycles. And in the past, if the business got a cold, tech got the flu. Right? It's just we accentuated. If the business growth rate dropped by a point, tech went negative 5, right, that kind of effect, where now, it's a business priority line of business, transforming new customers, new user experiences. So right, wherever GDP is, tech is higher and software tech is higher than that, right, inside of it in cloud SaaS software.</p><p>So if GDP languishes a bit, hey, tech will languish a bit, but it's comfortably above GDP. It's not going to overaccentuate it, and software tech in cloud is comfortably above that here. And I think we've been able to position ourselves well in that respect.</p><p>So digital transformation high in the priority list. Inside of that then, you end up with these key factors, where people are saying how do I make software a core competence of mine, how do I make this developer, this user experience, this device as a core competence of mine. Still, I have to address cloud and I must be secure, right. Those are the biggest topics that any CIO is dealing with at the meta level.</p><p>KARL EMIL KEIRSTEAD: Got it. And I know the Street maybe unfairly, Pat, looks at you as a little bit of a voice on the macro. Maybe it's because you don't mind commenting on it. Maybe it's because the nature of VMware and your past at Intel, it feels like you've just got a broad window into what's going on in large enterprise.</p><p>PATRICK P. GELSINGER: I noticed you said I wasn't right. You just said...</p><p>KARL EMIL KEIRSTEAD: But you were actually, 2 years ago, and everybody knows it. So what are you seeing today? What -- maybe on the April quarter call, you called out some macro uncertainties. Is that roughly the same as it was now then? Or has it eased off a little bit, gotten a tad worse? How would you characterize it?</p><p>PATRICK P. GELSINGER: Yes, I think a little bit of the Q1 comments were -- they became more sage-like than I anticipated them to be. We called out the concern. But I'll say, if anything, those concerns have moderated, right, a bit. And I think businesses are just figuring it out, right, if you would, China uncertainties. Well, are we going to stop our digital transformation because of China uncertainties? No. And as I've described that, hey, there is a, what I believe, is a long-term dual supply chain, dual trading block world, right? Are we going to see that China pressure in the U.S.? And everybody is just going to go figure it out. This is a boon for Thailand, the Philippines, Vietnam, right, Mexico, right. People are going to say how do I adjust my supply chain. What footprint do I have there versus elsewhere. They're figuring it out. And Brexit, other than selling more tabloids and so on, they're figuring it out. Maybe I put a little bit more in France or Europe, Belgium or pick up a spot.</p><p>So all of that is sort of working through as people stay on their bigger business agenda. So it's moderating a bit, would be my biggest assessment in that sense. And there are winners and losers inside of that, right, and we're clearly going to say, hey, on-premise hardware, hey, it was uniquely good last year and it's less good this year. Right? And there are those cyclical effects that aren't going to go away in that regard, but well-positioned tech companies are comfortably above GDP growth rates for as far as I can see into the future.</p><p>KARL EMIL KEIRSTEAD: Yes. And I know I asked you this question at the Mini Analyst Day quite recently, but you noted that the hardware cycle might not be as robust this year as it was in 2018. Maybe the Street unfairly thinks that a good portion of VMware is quite indexed to those vagaries in that hardware cycle. But you've laid out a case to me, and I think others, that maybe the correlation is less than folks think. Do you mind repeating sort of the 2 or 3 reasons why it's not as high as some think?</p><p>PATRICK P. GELSINGER: Yes. Well, one is, I'd say, I'm an engineer, show me the data, right? So if you go do actually the correlation or R-square analysis, there is no correlation, right? So the historical data doesn't support that view, right?</p><p>Secondly, our buying cycles are actually quite devoid of hardware buying cycles. They're 3-year ELAs, long-term commitments, they buy enough for their full franchise, et cetera, so there clearly is this very distinct separation. And we're successfully getting ourselves on the cloud SaaS side of things, where we're now hybrid infrastructure, and how much did you want that on-premise versus in the cloud. And the 40% growth in our subscription business in Q2, right, was an acceleration from the 30% range. So if anything, we're seeing that become more dominant, right, as a portion of the overall business.</p><p>And we also, right, in a more, right, broader sense, there's this view that it's due to everybody, right, to the public cloud. It's just wrong, right? 70% on-premise today, 30% in the public cloud, and it's not going to 100 and 0, right? It never will, right? There's going to be this balance of how much is on-premise versus how much is cloud, and we see ourselves uniquely being able to sit on both sides of that.</p><p>KARL EMIL KEIRSTEAD: And I could even add myself one other reason why the correlation might be less is that my observation is that it's possible that part of the slowing hardware cycle this year is the fact that a lot of large enterprises are embracing this software-defined everything phenomenon. And so they're not -- they have box fatigue, but actually, they're still deploying application workloads but on software-defined solutions. And that obviously plays to your strengths, correct?</p><p>PATRICK P. GELSINGER: That's been the center of what we've been driving since we articulated the software-defined data center vision now 6 years ago. Right? We have just been on it. Networking hardware becomes networking software. Storage hardware becomes storage software. Right? Increasingly, it's multicloud and working to every aspect of this. And when those numbers were small, right, nobody sort of noticed. Well, guess what, the HCI software business for us now, right, is well over $1 billion. The STM business for us is closing in the $2 billion. These are now big numbers that have multiplier effects in the hardware. And if you look at HCI as another example, right, I think the Gartner forecast is, 3 years from now, that's a $6 billion industry. That's offsetting storage elsewhere.</p><p>KARL EMIL KEIRSTEAD: Yes. So if we've seen storage start to tilt software-defined, HCI is tilting, Pat, when you look at...</p><p>PATRICK P. GELSINGER: Networking...</p><p>KARL EMIL KEIRSTEAD: Yes. I was going to say, when you look out 5 years, what are the other big hardware-centric chunks of the stack do you see as tilting meaningfully software-defined that you need to get the organization ready for it today?</p><p>PATRICK P. GELSINGER: Yes, and we would say any piece of hardware equipment, and I had this slide in my VMworld keynote, right, that says look at a rack of equipment. So -- and we just say to our customers, go look at that rack of equipment. And anything that isn't running software and application is wasted, right? So every load balancer, firewall, IDS, IPS, routing, right, all of those are moving into software. Everything that isn't a compute with integrated, right, storage capabilities that's being run in software is a target at that level. And obviously, that's part of the reason we did the Avi Networks acquisition right?</p><p>Okay, let's just make -- load balancing is not a box. It's just another function in a software-defined network. Right? Firewall, hey, I can't put it on physical boundaries because there is no physical boundary in a multicloud world. Get it into software, right? IDS, it's a feature, it's not a box or a specific thing. It should just be part of that layer. So every one of those we're moving, right, into a software-driven solution. And when it becomes software, it becomes faster, it becomes cheaper and it becomes boundary-less. It can move with the workload to whatever infrastructure you wanted to run it on. And those become very powerful accelerators for CIOs and their business objectives.</p><p>KARL EMIL KEIRSTEAD: Got it. And so, Pat, maybe we'd go back to your point around cloud. That's obviously, along with broadly speaking digital transformation, the biggest theme out there. And obviously, it would be quite negative for any vendor with an on-premise footprint if we reach an end-state that was 100% public cloud.</p><p>So what gives you confidence that the end state is not going to be 100, 0, but is going to look something more like, I think you've said, potentially, 50-50. What gives you conviction that that's going to be the end state because there are some companies that are going \"all-in\" at some level?</p><p>PATRICK P. GELSINGER: Right. There's going to be spectrum around it. But I've called up the 3 laws, right, the laws of physics, the laws of economics and the laws of the land, right? And I think these are powerful, sustainable, right, over the long term, laws of economics. It's cheap -- if you're at scale, it's cheaper for you to be running it yourself. Right? It's just that simple. And one of our biggest deals in Q2, right, the customer was approximately 50-50 public versus private. Their strategy is to be 70% private and 30% public because it's cheaper and the economics are better and they have such scale. Right? It was easy for them to say, absolutely, let's repatriate a bunch of the workloads from the public cloud. It's a laws of economics.</p><p>Laws of physics, right, if I need low latency, I can't roundtrip to the public cloud, right, and Edge will accelerate that effect and 5G will accelerate that effect for more of the data, more of the inference, more of the telemetry that's occurring close to where the action is. That might be a smart street, that might be a highly automated factory, or that might be a self-driving environment, right? More Edge while drive more to the Edge -- to, right, on-premise, close to the action.</p><p>And laws of the land. Right? A big customer in Q2 made a major repatriation decision to bring it back into their domiciled country. New President, new administration came in, and said that's right, we're bringing them out of this environment back into our own local country. And clearly, in regulated industries, banking, like you guys, I mean, this is going to be a factor for decades to come. So all of those would say, today, it's 70-30 private cloud versus public cloud, and the public cloud is growing 40-ish percent. The private cloud workloads are growing 10-ish percent. So clearly, we're seeing this, right, come closer. And I think as Edge becomes more dominant, 5G starts to emerge. Boy, I think sort of that long-term 50-50 here also. As we get closer to 50%, the cloud guys will become more competitive with each other. Right? Today, all of them are growing so fast, they really aren't competing. Right? It's really about how do I, right, maximize my growth opportunity as that competition starts to really emerge. So I think 50-50 is a good sort of model.</p><p>KARL EMIL KEIRSTEAD: Got it. And for VMware to get exposure to the Cloud 50, I think VMware on AWS, VMware on Google, VMware on Microsoft are important components to that.</p><p>PATRICK P. GELSINGER: And VCPP. 4,000 cloud partners, and that VCPP revenue, right, we saw acceleration in Q2.</p><p>KARL EMIL KEIRSTEAD: Yes. Maybe the more mature of at least, the VMware on major public cloud offerings, is AWS. You started there.</p><p>PATRICK P. GELSINGER: Yes. IBM actually preceded it.</p><p>KARL EMIL KEIRSTEAD: Okay. Yes. Got it. Maybe an update though on VMware on AWS. Like I know you announced a handful of meaningful customers, but when are we going to get to that inflection point? Everyone's waiting for that, Pat.</p><p>PATRICK P. GELSINGER: Yes. Well, I think we're feeling the growth acceleration. And as I'd say that IaaS has a buildout with Amazon. We have work to do, geographic footprint services, right, storage options, work to do. We're definitely feeling that.</p><p>Freddie Mac was a great customer on stage at the VMworld, where their objective is to essentially be running everything on VMware Cloud, and they said they're going to be finished in the next couple of months. Right? 600 apps being migrated to the cloud. This became the fast button, right, for their cloud migration. So we're starting to see customers really operate at scale, clear acceleration in that business. And I'll say we're almost done with what I'll call Phase 1 of the offering available in all the geos, all the basic services are available, and now we're starting to do some of the Phase 2 things, like we announced S3 integration for backup, right, where we're starting to lever some of the cloud capabilities, RDS, on-premise. So some of those are starting to emerge now, but this has been a great exercise. And as I said in the past, when is it at scale for us? It was the day we announced it because people saw VMware in a different light. This is, oh, you're not going to be harmed by the public cloud, you are a pathway to the cloud.</p><p>And one of the slides I included in my VMworld keynote was migrate and modernize because people had believed -- many of the CIOs believe the only way for them to modernize their application was to move to the public cloud. And they hit their head on that wall because refactoring your applications is so heavy, it's so hard, it takes years, I've got hundreds of them. Great. And now they're saying, oh, you're the easy button, and that's what you heard Freddie Mac say. Refactoring 600 applications, oh, I'm going to be here for years and spend $0.5 billion. Oh, I migrate to VMware Cloud and AWS, oh, this is magic, and now I'll modernize as my business justifies me to modernize and rebuild certain applications or micro services.</p><p>KARL EMIL KEIRSTEAD: Got it. Pat, 6 months ago, I would have carried on this fireside chat on cloud and on software-defined. But you've made a couple of acquisitions, I believe, and now we have more things to talk about, so now I need to move a little faster away from those subjects. So let's talk about them. Let's talk Pivotal, to start. You've been family members for years, so maybe the question I want to ask is what's happened such that you feel like now is the right time to buy Pivotal. What's changed, Pat?</p><p>PATRICK P. GELSINGER: Yes. And a couple of things have changed. One is, and if we draw the curtain back, right, when was the last time that we had a consensus technology in the industry agreed to by developers and by infrastructure providers? I'll argue Java 2 decades ago. These moments where technologies really bring together a transformational app and infrastructure experience don't happen that often. Kubernetes is the answer, right, and in that and the Heptio acquisition really helped us give the learning. And that transition, we believe, is a great opportunity to accelerate our infrastructure business, but also reach to the developer. .</p><p>Second is as we're seeing everybody sort of congeal their strategy in a Kubernetes-centric world, what's happened is Pivotal has made that adjustment as well, right, where 6 months ago, they hadn't, right, and buying a company and changing their strategy, oh, that's not a good recipe. Buying a company and accelerating their strategy, oh, that's been a successful recipe for VMware in many of our acquisitions. So they made the shift.</p><p>And third is customers said do it. Right? We clearly heard from customers, a few of them represented in the audience here, right, make this part of one family, right, not just, right, cousins, but bringing them into the fold. And we've said this is like NSX. This is like vSAN to us. We're going to own the Kubernetes stack. We're not going to be relying on third-party code. It's all going to be an integrated solution stack to execute on that Kubernetes. And as much as we like our cousins, right, we needed to have a much tighter relationship to build and deliver on that stack.</p><p>So that's the strategy behind it, and customer response has been quite positive in the couple of weeks since it was announced. Obviously, it will close in Q4 as we've articulated. We got work to do associated with it, but we're quite confident this was a great move.</p><p>KARL EMIL KEIRSTEAD: Is it a coincidence that it's occurred fairly soon after IBM's close of the Red Hat deal, and the logic there would be that OpenShift is an alternative to Pivotal Cloud Foundry? And with IBM owning OpenShift now, Google getting in, you had Pivotal up against some pretty mighty companies in a huge TAM that it made more sense to get the VMware resourced and sales distribution behind Pivotal to give IBM and potentially Google a better fight.</p><p>PATRICK P. GELSINGER: Yes. I think the drivers were the ones I articulated. That's what brought us together. Now do we assess the competitive environment? Well, of course, we do. Right? So IBM spent $34 billion doing this. I spent $2.8 billion, right, plus I had Heptio. So I spent less than $3 billion, and I think I have better assets.</p><p>And then the other piece was the Pacific move, where we're integrating Kubernetes directly into vSphere. Right? And this is where we brought an unfair advantage to the fight, right, because of everybody. Right? And it's like going to a Beatles weekend and playing Beatles favorites. I mean that's what we did at VMworld last week. Right? We went to our faithful, right, and we said to them you're now going to be -- every one of you are going to become Kubernetes experts, right, and you're not going to change a thing of what you do today.</p><p>Wow, right, that's a game changer for us being able to bring Kubernetes at scale into the marketplace and bridge between these communities. It's like dev and ops. It's like the cowboys and the farmers should be friends, right? Yes, right. That's never happened. Well, we actually see that we can bridge between those 2 worlds, accelerate applications into production and day 2 operations, bridge those 2 worlds and bring the strongest community, right, those people who built their careers on vSphere, right, into that game. A huge excitement for that. So the combination of Heptio, Pivotal, Pacific, that's what Tanzu is all about, and we really believe that we have a very compelling strategy for customers and versus any competitive alternative.</p><p>KARL EMIL KEIRSTEAD: And I guess back to the cloud for a moment, if it's true that a lot of large enterprises are stuck or at least challenged in migrating to the cloud because of the task of reengineering their apps, well, Pivotal and Pivotal Cloud Foundry is a little bit of a help button for those organizations, correct?</p><p>PATRICK P. GELSINGER: Absolutely. And Pivotal Labs, specifically, has really been. And their mantra is helping customers learn how to do modern software. Right? And boy, that's powerful.</p><p>KARL EMIL KEIRSTEAD: Yes. Okay. Let's talk security. So nobody's thought of VMware as a security company. I guess you did a couple of interviews, I think, with CRN, et cetera, and you were suggesting that you wanted VMware to become a significant security company. That's created a conversation, but then, wow, Carbon Black you're there now. So can you lay out that vision of not being a point solution but having security embedded in the infrastructure? That sounds to me like the way that Amazon and Microsoft and Google do it, where they're massive infrastructure vendors and they've embedded security. It feels like you're taking that concept and applying it on-premise. Maybe you can talk about that vision.</p><p>PATRICK P. GELSINGER: Yes. And as I've said, I think security is broken, right? Just at the fundamental level, you got 6,000 products delivered by 4,000 vendors, major -- if you think of financial institutions, I don't think there's a single financial institution in the planet that has less than 100 security products. 100 security -- and ones that I've talked to and interviewed very specifically on this are talking 500 security products. You've got to be nuts. How do you make 500 anythings work? Right? Test them, validate them, integrate them and operationalize them. This is just freaking nuts.</p><p>Right? And we're getting less security. More security products, more security companies and less security. More breaches that are more expensive. So I'd say it's just a broken industry in that sense. And what we're seeing is, is that we can be a security platform. Right? And what we're going to do is deliver, right, these 4 items. We're going to integrate it directly into the vSphere so that the application is secured at birth. Right? It never is in the wild. It doesn't require anything else. So to secure the moment, right, it lands in a container or a VM.</p><p>Second is we position, and 1/3 of NSX revenue today is associated with security. Right? I have -- I'm going to integrate it into the network and build on that. I'm going to put it into the endpoint. We had this integration point with Workspace ONE, this integration with Dell, right, nobody is going to have a broader endpoint reach than we have as well. And I'm going to have an integrated end-to-end cloud for telemetry and data. Right? Cisco can do network, but they don't do -- CrowdStrike, they can do the endpoint or Symantec and that legacy. Other -- nobody gets to see the app, the network and the endpoint, one common telemetry cloud that we're going to be able to bring in place.</p><p>So those 3 things. What we're doing at the cloud, right, what we're doing in the vSphere, what we're doing in NSX and what we'll do with Workspace ONE, brought together as a single security platform as we go forward. We're out to change this industry and doing it with Carbon Black. Some have questioned, well, what about them versus CrowdStrike? And we did a lot of diligence and we looked at the whole space. And what we found was there are -- while I think CrowdStrike was doing a better job in the go-to-market, we found the technology of Carbon Black to be equal or better in some spaces. And the places that it might have been somewhat deficient to CrowdStrike were areas that I'm going to engineer into the VMware solutions anyway. So I was all ready to reengineer those pieces. So we're like super excited, and it's a fraction of the cost for us. So yes, we think this is going to be fun.</p><p>KARL EMIL KEIRSTEAD: Okay. And it's -- I guess it's also going to have the effect from the financial modeling standpoint to make that ratable subscription piece an ever-larger part of VMware, right?</p><p>PATRICK P. GELSINGER: Yes.</p><p>KARL EMIL KEIRSTEAD: So right now, I think you announced that it's 12%, 13% of the mix today, growing 40%, as you pointed out earlier, accelerated. Once you start you layering Pivotal, Carbon Black in, that piece is going to become quite large. Now Paul's not going to want you to make any forecast, but like what could that ratable subscription piece be as a percentage of the mix in 5 years, Pat?</p><p>PATRICK P. GELSINGER: Yes, well, we said the year 2 number, we hit $3 billion in year 2, which will comfortably put in an excess of 20%, right, of our total revenue. We haven't made longer-term commitments, but clearly, you go do math of acceleration and how that is becomes a bigger piece of the revenue. But we're pretty excited about this because one of the things with the ratable subscription piece of our business is we're not trying to do an Adobe, right, where they said we're not doing this and we're moving to this instead. We're saying, we're adding new capabilities so that customers can buy on both sides of the menu, right, if you would. And we see that many people, whether it's government, whether it's utilities, whether it's regulated industries, whether it's capitalizing their data center, they like that for certain pieces, they like the subscription, and subscription has a definite bias. When they're buying a service, they want it as a subscription piece of the business, and we're going to be a company that enables both sides of that. And I think it's going to be a reasonably balanced view of our portfolio over the long term.</p><p>KARL EMIL KEIRSTEAD: Speaking of the other elements to the portfolio, I want to make sure I ask you a couple of questions on the ones that we've been monitoring, not so much going forward, but for the last year, like NSX and vSAN, et cetera. Still as excited about NSX, Pat? It's -- the growth's down just a tad to 30% this last print. It's still great though. I think you said about 1/3 of the revenues are coming from security or micro-segmentation use cases. Anything interesting to call out on how the use of NSX or demand trends are shifting? 5G potential catalyst, anything interesting to call out on that piece of the business?</p><p>PATRICK P. GELSINGER: Yes. And I'll tell you, they ticked down to 30%. We've seen it bouncing around, right, so I'd say, historically, 30%, 40%, it has bounced. I think, one time, we were at plus 50%. So it's been given some use. So it's been bouncing around because there's a lot of big deal variability in that business. Obviously, we're thrilled with SD-WAN, right, and the VeloCloud piece of it. So extending the software network all the way to the Edge, and it's enabling us to engage with major projects that are branch transformation, right, so that's exciting.</p><p>Obviously, we're layering load balancing into that with Avi. We've extended the firewall capabilities, so we've built the service-defined firewall, which gives us full Layer 7 stateful inspection as well. That's becoming more capable. We announced intelligence at VMworld, so it really is -- you don't need a big expensive tetration box, we're just going to do it as a capability in software. So that's another exciting capability.</p><p>But the biggest of them all is what you said, it's the 5G opportunity. And the calling card to 5G is this SDN NSE architecture, where if you think about it, the 5G telco environment is a capital market almost as big as data center and cloud. A huge market. And with 5G, we'll go through its biggest capital cycle maybe in the rest of our careers, right, as that goes and gets built out, and it's going to be done with a radically larger software footprint, right? And hey, we're in the game, right, and we've talked with our customers like Vodafone, who has bet all-in on VMware, and we're replicating that with other telco customers. And 5G investment cycles, I mean, this is -- we're playing the long game here. This is a 10-year investment as a cycle, but pretty excited about that. There's also an interesting interplay between telco, 5G and Edge, right, because a lot of the -- so guys are looking at Edge buildouts and they will have what they will call MEC, Mobile Edge Core, right, kind of use cases where they start pushing more of their infrastructure to the Edge as well, so that complements many of the things that we've already touched on and pretty nicely as well.</p><p>KARL EMIL KEIRSTEAD: Okay. Good. And then on the EUC business, Pat, that had a, I think, a 20% license bookings growth quarter for a -- in a space that I think a couple of years ago we might have thought was mature in low single-digit growth. And just to give a little bit of cred to one of your rivals, Citrix as well has been putting up, once you get through the noise of the ratable transitions, some pretty good numbers in their desktop VDI business as well. So it feels to me, and I think some others, like something's shifted in this space that you and your rival are seeing better growth trajectory. What do you think that is, Pat?</p><p>PATRICK P. GELSINGER: Yes. I think there's a couple of things that you can point to inside of that space. Clearly, there's needing to protect these mobile devices. These mobile devices are becoming -- where's a mobile device like your iOS or droid phone versus a hardened device versus an Edge and integrated device versus a smart light switch, right? I mean we're seeing that stretching, right, at more of those use cases emerging. So that's opening up, right? I'll say, the CIO was all of a sudden viewing those Edge environments, right, those devices. They're saying, oh, we have to look at that differently. Right? It isn't just that thing over there, so it's driving new investment, as they go and think about those devices.</p><p>The other piece of it is Windows 10. Windows 10 introduces modern management architectures. So as we announced, we saw we now crossed a million devices that are managed by Workspace ONE for their Win 10 PC environment. And we've never effectively participated in PC management. This is where the Dell partnership, on the one hand, with Unified Workspace and the Microsoft partnership, the -- when we announced the Microsoft partnership we announced a hybrid partnership, a cloud partnership and a client partnership of Microsoft, where now customers can say, oh, I get best-in-class Microsoft and I get best-in-class multidevice management from VMware. So those 2 factors are also driving a whole refresh in that space as well.</p><p>KARL EMIL KEIRSTEAD: You touched a little bit on the integration with Dell, but maybe let's focus on that for a second. They own, I think, 81% of VMware, and they've been a tailwind, I think, to your growth now for the last, really, 18 months. So what else can Dell do to create to keep that tailwind going? You're probably going to say no, but is it getting maxed out, or is there some new stuff on the horizon from the go-to-market or product integration that can keep acting as a tailwind for your growth?</p><p>PATRICK P. GELSINGER: Yes. And I think there is -- if we decompose that a little bit, there are areas that, hey, I think we're good now, right, we're sort of growing at market rates together, right, in some of those and enterprise customers, some of the deals, but there's clearly bases that we haven't tapped yet...</p><p>KARL EMIL KEIRSTEAD: Yes. Let's hear about those ones.</p><p>PATRICK P. GELSINGER: Like fed and SLED and some of the geographies that we just -- have taken us a while to get underway. So I'll just say there are some of those green spaces that we haven't yet done, a lot of things good and core, right, commercial and enterprise, but segments of the market that have just been harder and slower.</p><p>But what excites me isn't those, right? That's just good, get more sales execution and make that effective. But it's the solutioning where we're creating new value together. That's where I think there's large untapped opportunities, right, and those would be things where clearly (inaudible) been a huge success, a lot more market in front of it, but then Unified Workspace, right, where we've integrated Workspace ONE directly into the Dell client, creating new value. And that's, I mean, it's like $0.03 of revenue we've gotten out of that. It's just getting started as we launched that earlier this year. The VeloCloud, where Dell is becoming a hardware partner to sell the gateways, just announced that at VMworld. So we're just getting that underway. We just announced the next phase of the networking partnership with Dell, right, with fabric manager and being able to integrate NSX more directly into the networking and the HCI solution. Just launched it. So where we're building unique value together, that's where I think the sky is really the limit.</p><p>KARL EMIL KEIRSTEAD: Okay. And I think in Q1, you announced some America sales reorg, and I think my understanding since is that part of that might have been actually to better align your go-to-market with Dell's. I think you mentioned on this past call that any, maybe disruption's too strong a word, has largely been worked through. Is that right, Pat? And where does that kind of reorg fit today, largely in the rearview mirror?</p><p>PATRICK P. GELSINGER: Yes. The reorg is done, right, and obviously, we saw a rebound in growth in Q2. Right? So we saw good numbers coming, right, so we're back on plan. I'd say I think we have at least, and I would say, it's not until next year that I think full productivity, right? It just takes a while. People have new reps, new relationships, new territories. It takes a while for all of that to get into productivity. But we feel like we're back on the business plan that we had for the year.</p><p>Obviously, we also now have to integrate the sales motion of Pivotal and Carbon Black, but largely, those are going to be remaining in their distinct sales motion and we're integrating VMware capabilities into it. So we see it as we're not doing a lot of disruption there, so we feel like it's going to be a pretty straightforward thing. And then our ELA is our global account management, will be the VMware, right, model. So we think that will give some pull, right, for those new specialties that they will be fairly distinct specialty sales capabilities. That's the other big thing that we have to do on the sales and go-to-market front.</p><p>KARL EMIL KEIRSTEAD: Well, you got a lot going on and you've had an amazing last couple of years. So congrats on that run. We'll wrap it here, but let me just give Pat a chance to leave us with any summary comments, either about VMware or about the tech space between now and year-end. What final thoughts would you like to leave us with, Pat?</p><p>PATRICK P. GELSINGER: Well, one of the things, when you think about VMware, and some have said, hey, you're doing a lot, a lot of irons in the fires, ultimately, we're positioning ourselves as this infrastructure software company that satisfies all of the infrastructure requirements of the customer. And pretend that you were a CIO for a second, Karl. Who are the people that sit at your table? Well, you got the security guy, you got the app and dev guy, you got the networking guy, you have the infrastructure gal, right, you have the cloud person, if that's distinct, and then you have the end-user computing gal, right, that's your staff. Right? And your budget is a summary of what you do across those spaces.</p><p>VMware has said we're going to help customers build, run, manage, connect and protect. Essentially, those guys and gals at the CIO staff, we have a value proposition for every one of them. No one else on the planet can say that, where everyone who sits in the CIO staff has a value proposition from VMware, where we say we're going to create. And every one of those decisions that you make, we're going to enhance the value that you bring to the others. When you make the networking decision, we made the CISO's life better and the app guy's life better.</p><p>When you make the automation decision for cloud, we've made the cloud guy, the infrastructure guy and accelerated your go -- your ability to bring new apps to the marketplace as well. We've made the CISO's life easier because we're building more of it in. That is the VMware position that, that core audience is now able to accelerate, right, out of a set of shared and integrated offerings from VMware across that dimension of build, run, connect, manage and protect. And I think that gives us a very unique position in the industry. We're excited about it. We see tremendous growth opportunity. And if you would, I don't think there's any company on the planet today that has a better view of IT past but also technology future, right? And now we're changing the way that people are going to develop software. We're going to disrupt the security industry. We're going to disrupt the telco industry. That's a pretty exciting place to be, and we're pretty thrilled to be part of that.</p><p>KARL EMIL KEIRSTEAD: Awesome, well, thank you.

Thanks very much for joining us here this morning for a strategy update from Vocus. We've had an interesting time over the last 6 weeks or so that you are all very well aware of. It has been an interesting time for us. It's helped us really get together and think about what our plans are and really crystallize where we're going over the next 5 years. So we look at that as a bit of an interesting experience. But it's not here for me to talk about that. I'm going to introduce Bob Mansfield who is going to kick us off the proceedings before handing to Kevin. So Bob Mansfield who all of you know very well. Thank you.</p><p>ROBERT CECIL MANSFIELD, NON-EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN, VOCUS GROUP LIMITED: Thanks, Bill. And let me add my welcome and thanks to all of you in the room and anyone that's dialing in for an extensive briefing today to bring up to speed on where we're at and where we're going. But as Bill mentioned, we have had an interesting couple of months, totally unplanned, I can assure you. And despite what some people have noted in the media, we've never had 1 syllable of discussion about tarting this company up for sale. We've never had a for sale sign on the company. But some people see some things in the makeup of the company that attracts attention and that's exactly what happened with the 2 bids that we received.</p><p>I talked to Matt Hanning earlier on, he's on our Board, and Matt said, we basically as a Board has some pretty simple decisions, which is dead right. We had some bids dropped at us that were in the 35%, 40% range with regard to price. And we as a Board, and I certainly, as an individual Director, dwell clearly that if that was proven to be substantiated, a decision I'd like to put to the shareholders to see how they feel about it. And if we hadn't done that, I don't think we've been doing our jobs.</p><p>The big issue with it, having been through the KKR and Affinity exercise previously, when, to be totally honest, looking back, I've been involved in this Board now for 2 years and I've been Chairman for just 12 months. We couldn't get our hands around the detail, we couldn't get our hands around visibility, we couldn't get our hands around the accuracy of a lot of what is required. This time around, within a couple of weeks, we were able to provide data room access, data room discussions, management presentations that let whoever is interested to make a decision.</p><p>Now the fact that they didn't proceed is based upon their business models and their own execution risk assessment. We're very clear on what our execution risk is on our side of the fence because we live with it every day. And the fact that others, when they had a closer look at it, made a judgment that, that wasn't for them, that's what the commercial market and reality is. But it was an exercise that I took a lot of pride and pleasure in looking back on because the speed with which we were able to provide the information and the accuracy as we tried to provide the information, demonstrates to me and hopefully to you people, that this company has come a long way in the last 12, 18 months and I can assure you that it has.</p><p>The parties that came forward were credible, that's the other important factor. I mean it wasn't a maybe, would be, could be set up with either company, and that's why we gave it a lot of credence when it came up. I have every confidence in the team and the direction they're taking. I think today will illuminate further clarity for all in the room and on the call, we certainly hope so. The Board expectation and my expectation and my solid commentary to all shareholders, I can't be more honest with shareholders than what I have been since the day I became Chairman of this company, and that is this is a 3-year exercise and we're 1 year into it.</p><p>So that just sets the scene. We're 1 year into it. I'm comfortable where we're at. Would I like to be further progressed? You bet I would. But we're on the right track and we know where we're going. And most importantly, the difference between talking to you today as Chairman of this company and when I last spoke to you is that we have assembled a team of executives that are absolutely excellent. And they're experienced. They are now deep into the detail of knowing what the problems are. They're deep into the detail of how you solve the problems. And that's what I hope you'll get out of today. So we look forward to presenting that team to you.</p><p>If there's one thing -- I've spent a lot of time -- it's my role, so I'm not saying complainingly, but listening to shareholders as to what their desires would be and I respect them no matter whether I agree or disagree with them. But the one thing I ask of shareholders once again now is patience. There's no quick fix. There's patience. We're working in a 3-year time vacuum at the moment and the detail you'll be provided with today will give you a better level of confidence, hopefully, on what we can achieve in those 3 years.</p><p>So thanks for your time. I'll hand it over to Kevin and the team for the rest of the day, and I hope you enjoy the day and look forward to Q&amp;A at the end of it as well. Thank you.</p><p>KEVIN STEVEN RUSSELL, GROUP MD, CEO &amp; DIRECTOR, VOCUS GROUP LIMITED: Good morning. So thank you very much for coming. Just agenda in terms of what we're going to cover today. I just want to do a few introductory comments, just a little bit of context in the last few weeks and a few thoughts in terms of where we are over the last 12 months. We are going to talk in detail on Vocus Networks, that will be the bulk of the presentation. And Andrew, Mark, Ellie and myself will all talk through that opportunity. Then we'll break for a quick 15 minutes, and we're going to try and keep it tight if that's okay, and come back and Antony de Jong will talk through Vocus Retail, then Mark Callander will finish by talking through New Zealand. And then we'll leave a good 45 minutes at the end before we break for lunch and have the opportunity to chat and circulate.</p><p>So just -- this is a big day for us and we've been a little bit frustrated and we've scheduled this 2 or 3 times and -- we said in February we're going to come out in the May time frame and talk about where we're going. And then we postponed it a couple of times. We've been confident (inaudible) [championing] a bit to talk about where we're going. So today is a really good opportunity for me to introduce the rest of the team, and the rest of the team will spend the bulk of the day talking and also will be available for Q&amp;A.</p><p>Also just talking about the reset. There's an awful lot of change at Vocus. And I'm very, very clear that the volume of change for shareholders to get our heads around, the market to get our heads around is significant. So the presentation over the next 3 hours is detailed, and is detailed intentionally because we're setting out a clear road map of this is what we believe in and this is where we're going.</p><p>It does feel timely because there's been a heck of a lot of noise. I mean my KPI for the year from Bob Mansfield was, \"Can you just keep out of the press? Keep your head down and keep out of the press and do your job.\" And then the last month, there's just been every single day has been in the press. So there's been a hell of a lot of noise. So it feels really timely in terms of the opportunity to just take that noise away and see it very clearly where we're going.</p><p>My ten cents on the last 6 weeks in the 2 bids that came in, a couple of comments. Yes, as Bob said, completely and utterly unsolicited and frankly, a distraction with hindsight. But my view as to why they didn't progress, they were too early. Both of them were too early. Both of them came in with a view in a 3-year turn around without an expectation as to where the business was. And frankly, they were too early in the process. We needed more data points for them to be happy. It's not a good thing, not a bad thing, just a reality check.</p><p>What our learnings are at that process in terms of us looking at the business, which is good in terms of sharpening us up a little bit. But that was it. There was no noise. There was no smoking gun. We pushed hard for those processes to be closed quickly. And I personally pushed hard because frankly, we've just gone through the planning process and I wanted the business executed, not presenting. So the fact that they were closed off quickly, for us, was a good thing.</p><p>If I just try and evaluate from my chair, where I think Vocus is now versus 12 months ago when I came in. And I kind of look at it through the key elements I've got up in the board. I came into Vocus in May of last year with some strong views as to where the business was and the opportunity. The assets that Vocus has are better than I expected, no questions. More strategic assets, strategic opportunities than I understood in May of last year. The market opportunity is bigger than I expected and better than I expected, and that's an element of how the competitive landscape is playing out as well as the assets. Unquestionably, in my view, it will take -- it will probably be a bit longer before you see the revenue come through. But I mean a bit longer, not a lot longer. Retail is tough but I knew that actually coming in.</p><p>In terms of execution 12 months on, my line of sight of cost is better. So I can now see the cost elements I haven't talked about before, and that for me is always critical. To understand the business and understand how you can get cost out is fundamental to know the operational leverage in the business. And you'll see during the presentation, particularly in Ellie's section, we'll start to talk about where we see those operational costs going 2 years out, 3 years out.</p><p>In terms of execution risk, we've got an awful lot to do. None of it is not doable, and that's a pretty strong statement. Again I'll say, ain't no smoking guns and ain't no fundamental promise. There's just stuff to execute, and that's completely within our control. I think the other point I've got comfortable with and confident on in the last 12 months now is we've got the balance sheet and the financial resources to do the transformation right in technology that we need to do. And again, what we'll do today is outline how we're modernizing the network, how we're simplifying the network, and that for me is really fundamental. To do that within our CapEx, within our balance sheet, funding arrangements is really important.</p><p>The biggest execution de-risk for me in the last 12 months has been the team has been brought on. And you'll get that feeling through the next few hours of the quality of people we've got. And I've seen this team execute now over the last few months. We've got the capability to deliver what we need to do.</p><p>Timing? No difference to what I've always said and Bob said. This is 3 years period. And it's not 3 years because we can't fix it -- fix things earlier. It's 3 years because we want to build the right business that will fly and come 2 years from now. So I expect us to be in a very, very strong position. I'll touch on that as we go through.</p><p>In terms of the last 12 months, what have we done? A lot of foundational stuff. And it's interesting for me, I think I referred to Mark Wratten to run it, stop, make decisions quickly, go, go, go. I've actually, with Vocus, taken a 3-year view and say, what do we need to get right, because this is more strategic. And we have put in place the right foundational pieces for the next 2, 3, 4 years. Critically, people's standpoint, leadership, the LTI is a fundamental building block to be able to build the team, and the leadership is not just at my table but down 1 level. So strong team in place.</p><p>From an execution standpoint, like, ticking off financial year guidance, I mean Mark Wratten said to me the other day, this will be the third time he's actually presented results. The first time he's going to be able to tick off guidance. That, for us, this year was a big execution landmark. And getting in place the plan for the next 3 years for me personally, critical. I can't get this organization moving unless I've got a clear 3-year plan, and the goals aligned and the resources aligned. Got that now, did not have that 12 months ago.</p><p>In terms of revenue enablers, getting ASC built on time, on budget, big tick. From a strategic fiber build standpoint, I'm going to touch on that a little bit today. One of the things that has been really exciting coming in is those fiber build opportunities 3, 4, 5 years out that the market don't understand, I did not understand coming in, and getting that pipeline build of what we need to do from an annuity revenue standpoint 4 years out, 5 years out is critical in terms of building the value in the organization.</p><p>Then there's technology simplification. Again, it's basic stuff. Is our network working well? I've been in organizations over the last 7 or 8 years where the operational platform, the network has not always been as good as it needed to be. The operational platform at Vocus is good and it's got better and better and better from a network standpoint over the last 7, 8, 9 months.</p><p>We've talked about dealing with legacy before at Vocus. Standing here today and having the plan, having the vendor selected, knowing what we're going to do over the next 3 years to modernize the network, to take out legacy systems, to migrate customers over, and to have line of sight as to how much it's going to cost us and how much we're going to save, massive tick.</p><p>And in retail, just a lot of stuff in retail. Retail has been full on for the last 12 months, getting the Optus MVNO in place, critical. Getting some of the cost out, critical. Getting the Commander business committed to and the brand relaunched, important. So a lot of good stuff gone on, but I would categorize it as foundational. And as a team, we go into kind of 2020 now with the planning done, the team in place and now we've got to execute.</p><p>One of the other key things we've done over the last 12 months and maybe I significantly said I think, is just simplifying the business. I remember this research note that I saw when I was looking at Vocus originally which was talking about describing Vocus as Frankenstein. All of these bits kind of plugged together. I think it's over 30 different acquisitions over the years. What we have done over the last 12 months is get very clear, very simple, what are we actually -- what our actual business units and where do our priorities lie.</p><p>And we've got 3 very simple business units. We are setting them up to be stand-alone. I am an absolute firm believer in, I want autonomy to be sitting with the leader of that business unit, with Antony, with Mark, with myself to be able to run, to be able to make the decisions and not be sitting and waiting for resource to be allocated from some central pool. We need to win in the market and we need to be nimble so the retail business needs to be separate. The New Zealand business operates separately.</p><p>The August result is coming up in a month-or-so's time, we will split out the financials for all 3 business units. Again, we want the market to have visibility of where the value is, what businesses are performing well when you allocate the cost out properly. And yes, we will look at some point as to whether some of these business units can be realized. That's absolutely not the plan today but it's good to have optionality.</p><p>The other thing we've done is be very clear, very firm: Our core business is Vocus Networks. That's where the core strategic assets lie. That's where the core value creation opportunity lies. Making that statement unambiguous, unambiguous within the organization is helpful. Because what does it mean? It means that the discretionary capital goes to Vocus Networks, first and foremost. The other businesses provide supporting roles and will build value, but we have to get Vocus Networks right.</p><p>From a team standpoint, we ran hard. My big priority last year first 6 months was to get the team in place. We ran hard. We recruited well. I'm standing here today looking at the team we've assembled, and we've got the right team. So you'll see as the presentations unfold, the quality we have assembled. Ability-wise, yes, but more operational skill set, value set, ability to get the sleeves rolled up, get into the detail and lead the organization. We've built an absolute quality team. Everyone is incentivized primarily with the LTI program. And we've all signed up that program. For 100% of our options to vest, we have to have a share price north of $4.76 a couple of years from now. So there's not a shortage of confidence in terms of the opportunity within the team, and there's not a shortage of focus in terms of what we've got to deliver from a shareholder and value standpoint.</p><p>In terms of progress beyond the leadership team. I was thinking, you've got a transformation or you've got a turn around, you focus first on your people, then your customers will feel it, then the market will feel it. So we've made a lot of change over the last 12 months. There's been a lot of uncertainty, I'd say, prioritizing the parts of the organization, deep prioritization of other parts of the organization, a lot of disruption. What's been really satisfying for me is in that process, the level of engagement across the organization has steadily, month by month by month, gone up. The voluntary attrition has gone down. And the alignment across the organizations get better and better.</p><p>And that is absolutely critical because, yes, the executive team can all be happy to know where we're going, but does the rest of the organization line up, does everyone know where we're going, does everyone more importantly believe where we're going? My awareness over the years have been the answers always lie within the business, that people within the business know what to do. If the people within the business are more confident, more engaged, then we're heading in the right direction.</p><p>Vocus Retail. I do want to get very upfront and very clear of where the main headwinds are within the business, and they are in Vocus Retail. So there's 3 separate areas where from pretty much June 2017 through to today, through the next couple of years, we have structural headwinds. And the 3 areas are: One, erosion of voice customers. And you can see in the left-hand side, previous 24 months, we've lost about 187,000 voice customers as voice services have eroded, and that's primarily been in Commander. Two, we absolutely have lost broadband customers during the migration to NBN. And NBN unquestionably favors the Telstras of this world, the big premium brands. I mean you get value brands like Dodo, you do get squeezed. And we have lost customers, about 84,000, over the last 24 months. And then finally, we lose on the migration of customers from ADSL to NBN, about 182,000, we estimate, over the previous 24 months. Those have been the main structural headwinds we've been working through and will work through again for the next 3 years.</p><p>The bit I'll say very clearly today is my expectation, Antony's expectation, by the second half of next financial year, financial year '21, we expect to be past that in terms of EBITDA impact, we expect the growth that comes through in mobile, the growth that comes through in energy and cost savings to offset the impact and there's been a significant impact of dilution from those 3 factors.</p><p>Guidance. So I said earlier, from our chairs, ticking off 2019 guidance was absolutely pivotal. So we'll announce the results in the middle of August. Right now, we are reconfirming guidance across all key metrics for 2019. In terms of looking at 2020, we expect the underlying EBITDA range of our guidance to be in a consistent range with 2019. And that's -- there's 2 key elements there: One, we are seeing growth coming in Vocus Networks, and we expect that to be EBITDA-wise in the range of $20 million to $30 million, but we expect that to be offset for the downdraft in retail all about the same level. So our guidance is consistent range with '19 for financial year '20. We do see the second half of the year performance has been stronger, and then we will continue to invest from a CapEx standpoint. So key investments in CapEx next year: One, future state network, there's $15 million in for that, and we'll get $30 million in for IRUs, including submarine cables -- international submarine cables to continue to support the growth that Mark Callander will talk to in international business. Finally cash conversion 90% to 95%, and net lend in ratio coming down.</p><p>We're going to '21. We expect to see Vocus Network EBITDA growth on absolute level continue to grow. We expect that to be on the $20 million to $30 million that we are targeting and are guiding to in financial year '20. And we expect the retail business to stabilize in the second half of the year. New Zealand through '20 and '21, steady growth.</p><p>Key message out of that beyond the next 2 years is by '22, we expect the turnaround to be largely done and all 3 businesses to be growing strongly, particularly Vocus Networks.</p><p>So just going through in detail, spend the next 1.5 hours just going through the Vocus Networks business. And I'll start here just by explaining what we're actually building. And we are building Australia's specialist fiber and network solutions provider. And essential for me to reflect, I moved on from Telstra 2 years ago and took a 6-, 7-month break. I spent a lot of time in that -- during that period thinking about where I saw the market opportunities. Now I described it just now as how my thinking was then, how my thinking is today, I'm basically long in business fiber and I'm short in consumer mobile. Like I looked hard at the marketplace 18 months ago, and I was very bearish in consumer mobile and very, very confident and excited about the opportunities I saw in fiber in the marketplace.</p><p>And I say that because I can see the competitive landscape building in mobile. I can see a 5G war or battle building between Optus and Telstra in mobile, and I can see a diversion of resource away from fiber and enterprise, into mobile, into the consumer market. That was very much the context to me looking at the Vocus job, and actually more importantly, wanting the Vocus job because in that market, Vocus has absolutely awesome assets to win if you believe and going long on fiber, and there is a crystal clear opportunity in this marketplace just now for someone who specializes in fiber and the right solutions into government, into enterprise and has the ability to target carriers in the wholesale marketplace. Someone who is fixated on the right market, products, the right customer needs; fixated on the technology that provides the right solutions, the right customer experience; and fixated on getting the right economic model and the right yield management. And that's what we are building at Vocus. That's why I say the core business of Vocus is the networks business, Vocus Networks.</p><p>So that's some context, that's some direction. And in next 40 minutes, Andrew will talk through a bit about how we're going to grow in market. Thanks.</p><p>ANDREW WILDBLOOD, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF ENTERPRISE &amp; GOVERNMENT, VOCUS GROUP LIMITED: Thank you. So what I want to take you through today is just a little bit of a context about -- I've only been in the role for 6 months. So I had a long career elsewhere in Telstra, living and working, growing businesses all over the world, about what I've seen since I've joined Vocus. And then I want to take you through about some of the customers, how we think about the market, where we're investing in our product capability to take advantage of the market and a little bit about some of the partners that we're working with. I will also touch on NBN. It's a question that everyone asks me, whether NBN is good, bad or indifferent in the enterprise. And I will put it out on the table now that it's very good for Vocus in the enterprise and government business, and I'll touch on why I believe that. So that's really the idea for the next 40 minutes.</p><p>So what do we do well? This is really my reflection, I think, about what after 6 months in the role I see. And I'll tell you that I get more, more and more enthusiastic and optimistic every day in this job. Primarily because every day, I'm uncovering the value of this business and finding value in the people I engage with. But more importantly, because a lot of my time is spent out with customers and with partners, over the last 6 months, I think I would have seen in excess of 100 customers and prospects and partners across enterprise and government in every state and territory of Australia. And they are looking for optionality. And that's why I get excited because if we get it right with our network and get it right with the product layer that we've put on it and we get it right in the targeting, and we get it right in the people upfront our market, then we're going to take market share.</p><p>And really this is about market share for me. I'll talk a little bit about it and go into more detail but in essence, in enterprise and government and wholesale blended, we only have 6% of the market share that's available to us. So we're a low market-share player with a big market share to go. And I've worked in incumbent positions where you get up every day and you are battering off annoying people at Vocus, and you're defending your legacy revenues. And those legacy revenues are being eroded every day. And consequently, as they get eroded, you've got to look at your cost line and therefore you've got to take out people. And that's what we're seeing happening in the market. And that's what also gets me enthusiastic because the sets of customers now and certainly, I was in Perth last week, who are sort of saying, \"Please, please help me. We want something different.\"</p><p>So what do we do well? Customers, we do, do well with customers. We have 6,500 customers across our customer base. So I was talking to a lady from CBA just before and was asking about customers and generally, banking overseas got its challenges and how you look after customers as does telecommunications. But at the end of the day, you've got to do a better job when looking after existing customers you've got and bringing innovation and new ideas and new capabilities. But in some cases, it's not about having to go and acquire another 1,000 customers. But more, you've actually got a customer base to build on, do more with, sell more products to, grow revenue in, as well as strategically going after a set of customers who have requirements that meet our -- or have needs that meet our requirements.</p><p>When I think about the people, there are some brilliant people in this business. Having worked in submarine cable businesses previously in Asia and then having worked in -- in and amongst engineering organizations and product organizations, what I found in Vocus is some of the best people I've ever seen in engineering. Their ability to engineer complexity and complex builds in engineering and fiber networks and deliver on time and ahead of budget in difficult environments like a recent Coral Sea Cable up to Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands are as good I've seen anywhere in the world, period. Not just Australia but in the world. So we have pockets of brilliance. We still have work to do, and I'll talk a bit about what I've got to do in transforming, to an extent, some of my organization, but there's some brilliant people around this business.</p><p>Delivery. The bugbear of many telecoms companies anywhere in the world. Customers want things. They don't buy telecoms just because they want to get a bill and buy something. They buy because it's now the lifeblood of their business. They are transmitting pieces of data to trade in a market, to buy from suppliers, to connect with customers. And increasingly frustrated in 2019 that it takes 6 months to deliver something. I can tell you, in previous roles, I would be spending 1/3 of my time dealing with customer issues, people complaining that they've ordered something 6 months ago, has not been delivered. That bill is wrong, you can't fix it for 18 months.</p><p>I think in the 6 months I've been here, I've had 1 customer complaint and how I dealt with it was I got the Chief Operating Officer, Ellie, on the phone, head of networks on the phone, head of products on the phone, half-hour meeting resolved it, resources allocated, customer network up within a week. That is impossible, impossible in many other organizations. And so our ability to deliver -- particularly on that, we're delivering services in days and weeks, not months and then sometimes, year, elsewhere in the market. So our on-net delivery to our networks can be about 30 days on average. But the other day, we had a customer call us, had an emergency situation where they need something configured, 3 days in delivery. So the ability to galvanize -- in many cases because all of our resources in the VNS business are onshore, you can actually go and walk over to someone's desk to get things done.</p><p>Our fiber is impressive and is a brilliant asset to build on, but we've got to sort of start layering products and services on top of it to make us increasingly more relevant to segments of the market that we can win in.</p><p>And secure. The one thing that's really stood out for me is our ability to deal with federal government in secure networks, and we're very trusted in Canberra, in and around that, in terms of our secure networks. So lots to be optimistic about.</p><p>And then you think about, well, why do our customers choose us? And across Vocus Network Services, we serve enterprise, we serve government, federal, state, local. We serve wholesale. We serve international players. And so people buy from us for a myriad of reasons. The impressive thing in the enterprise space is we serve nearly 60% of the ASX 200. Our challenge may be however, that we have a discrete disaster recovery service or part of a network, not necessarily all the network. So I think about just the conversation this morning about banking, we have services and networks with 3 of the top 4 banks in Australia. But we don't have the dominant services contracts with those banks because they have big, long-term outsource contracts elsewhere. That's not the business we're in. We're not a managed services provider. We will manage elements of the network. We are a thoroughbred infrastructure network provider and people will buy from us for diversity.</p><p>Equally, we have sets of customers who buy entirely from us. All of their network, all of their voice services, data center services, cloud services. We're not a mobile player so we don't do mobility. We have some optionality in an MVNO but we haven't enacted that in the enterprise space. It is not our intention over the next immediate sort of 1 to 2 years to consider mobility as an option in terms of selling mobile fleets, for example. We may consider it in terms of part of network solutions for wireless into deployments.</p><p>We are trusted. So typically our average customer tenure is about 31 months to be very precise, which means when we have customers, we tend to keep them. And some of our biggest customers have been with us for over a decade in the various forms of the Vocus family. Crazy about customers. We are crazy about customers. We care about them. It hurts me -- personally hurts me when we let a customer down. We don't do it very often and we galvanize when a customer has an issue to go and solve for their problems.</p><p>An Australia and New Zealand network. That's not to be understated because we are the only carrier now in -- operating in Australia with a wholly owned entity in New Zealand, with Australia and New Zealand networks, and we're winning off the back of it. Kevin and I were on a call the other day with a customer who's given us the go ahead, and this was a great story actually. This is an engineering firm, big structural engineering firm, U.K.-based. Went to market, asked for submissions from market, all carriers in Australia would have responded. We were the first to respond with the most compliant response, economically the most favorable and the best service terms. And so they awarded it to us. Half of the network's in New Zealand, and the fact that we own both networks played a big advantage.</p><p>Now when I'm not getting deeply passionate about customers, and when I'm not chasing my 4 young kids around or coaching them sport, my obsession's cricket. So when I look down the customer list and I noted Cricket Australia as one of our customers, it was the best day of my Vocus career on day 1. I said, I need to go and see Kevin Roberts, the -- I'm also on the board of the Bradman Foundation so I sort of love my cricket, I need to go and see Kevin Roberts. So Kevin and I caught up in Vocus, successfully renewed the relationship with Cricket Australia, which is public domain, we sort of pulled that out. And basically, we've extended that network -- helping them to sort of create a digital experience for cricket fans around Australia. I would like to say that Mitchell Starc's outstanding performance in England in the World Cup or Smith and Warner's integration back into the test team is due, with Vocus, it's not. But in those small parts, we play a part in it and they have extended their services with us. So we have some brilliant customers that we have a lot of fun with and we do a good job of looking after them.</p><p>But in essence I think really for us, we're a challenger. And what a challenger needs to do, they need to be fast to respond, they need to be more agile in how you price things and deliver things, and economically, because of our -- the fact that there's only sort of 1,400 across the organization and we own the network asset, we can be compelling commercially. That's why we're easy to do business with.</p><p>And as I said, it is a market share play here. We only have about 6% market share when you blend it together across enterprise, government and wholesale. And in the enterprise and government space, at least in the enterprise space, we've got about 4% market share, slightly higher in government, about 11%. By the way, we take these numbers from what's contestable. So we strip out mobility and these numbers are taken from data sources like Gartner, Ovum and all of the analyst reports. So you can see at that level, there's a big upside opportunity here.</p><p>And when I think about the opportunity, I get incredibly excited, because really what I've got to do is quite simple, is to do more with my existing customer base. Three things I think about: One, do more with what I've got. So my existing customers, do a better job of looking after them, ensure they don't leave my network and bring them incremental value and capability on top that could be a unified collaboration service, it could be voice, it could be more data services, it could be disaster recovery, it could be a series of things depending on where you are in the majority with our customers.</p><p>Two, make new markets, so create new markets. And making new markets is good fun. That's where you think about your network assets and you think well, if we were to do a strategic build here, we could really do something quite sophisticated for mining oil and gas in the West, and Kevin will talk a bit about that.</p><p>And thirdly don't disrupt and dislodge. And one of the reasons I joined this business was because I get incredibly passionate about winning, competitive bugger, you could say that. I am indeed, and I love winning. And I don't shy away from that. The best of my career was sort of priorities was in Asia, opening up new markets all over, going into countries we have no right to win and then winning. And so I get excited by that. And right now, the window has opened up. There is no better time for Vocus to take advantage of what's going on in this market.</p><p>I am only stating what's publicly domain information about what Telstra has done recently in its enterprise and government organization or what Optus may have done in terms of de-prioritizing or at least managing its cost base. What does that mean? It means that customers will get less coverage from an account manager or a service solution or from a billing resource to solve for their problems. Telstra has stated it will focus very much on its top 650 customers. Well, you know what, 650 customers sounds a lot but there's about another 14,000 or 15,000 other customers who are going to be managed in a different way. That presents optionality.</p><p>I was in Melbourne the other week, met a significant customer, spends around about $4 million or $5 million blended across a number of carriers. And their statement to me was, \"I don't feel big enough for some of the dominant players in the market.\" My response was, \"You would be certainly big enough for Vocus. And we'd love to do work with you.\" And they want that. They want to feel needed. They want to get response. They want to see people. They want to have people bring them innovation, and that's what we can do on a world-class network.</p><p>So that's the opportunity for us. It's really about taking market share. It's about making new markets, and it's about bringing innovation to the existing customers.</p><p>The network is a brilliant network, particularly on inter-capital transmission. And in some parts of our network in the west after our Amcom acquisition a few years ago, we have a very dominant position. We're sort of second in market only to Telstra in the amount of fiber we've got through Western Australia in Perth kind of CBD. So in that case, we might have some sort of 11% market share versus in Metro Sydney and Melbourne where we're one of a number of fiber carriers and we wouldn't have a dominant position in coverage. But between that and an inter-capital network, well, we get a lot of relevance and we see a lot of demand, significantly, as Mark will go through on OTT players and international wholesale players coming in, we've got a really unique advantage in many places.</p><p>But we're blessed with the fact that we're an industry where demand is growing. And demand is growing and the insatiable demand for data just grows and grows and grows. Upgrade on network capacities driven by people moving to the cloud. I think I saw something Gartner saying, only 30% of Australian enterprise and government organizations today consume public cloud. And by 2023, I think was the year -- or 2023 to '24 to '25, that would move to 80%.</p><p>And what does that mean when you move a traditional workflow. What it means, it goes from a customer's premise to a hyperscale cloud environment like an Azure or a Google or an AWS or Alibaba or AliCloud (sic) [Alibaba Cloud], and in that, it sits in an environment that is cloud-enabled. What that means is you have to have big network and highly resilient and good network to carry you from the customer premise and its branch to the cloud to consume now your applications that are sitting in a cloud environment. That drives bandwidth.</p><p>So there's good examples why data is growing. Video utilization. I'm not sure you guys, sort of travel budgets get cut, you do all videoconferencing. It's all driving network utilization. AI, machine learning, IoT, digitization. I mean if you go and ask any CIO, the #1 thing on their mind is usually security and digitization, and how you digitize processes, all demands network. Of course, we sit at the center of that. And that's why you'll continue to see the demand on networks.</p><p>When I think about what we've got today and the customers we serve, as I said, an impressive customer list when you look at it and when I first came, how to look at it, I was like, \"Wow, some amazing names on there.\" But we might not have done a great job of making ourselves relevant further than a discrete service we've sold, or some racks in the data center or a piece of network. And our job now is to sort of say, \"Okay, how do we move further into the organizations that we have today? And how do we go and be very focused on the sweet spot of customers who are probably spending $1 million to $3 million or $3 million to $5 million elsewhere in the market that have high data network usage and requirements for voice and collaboration services?\"</p><p>So 5,300 enterprise customers, 200 government customers across federal, state and local. Geographically diverse. I've got people in every state and territory by Tasmania. And as I say, impressive in list of customers, and we have a usual kind of skew where 50% of our total revenue comes from 200 customers. So in some cases, my largest enterprise customer spending $10 million a year with me, and we have all of their network and data center services, and then it slides down. And we do have a very long tail of customers who may only have 1 or 2 services, and we're working through how best we become relevant to them to continue to hold that but grow more in there. And in government, we've done a slightly better job of sort of bringing more services to government, either in secure government or federal or state. We're on the panel, which is important for all of the states and territories, and we have good agreements all over the nation to sell services to -- data services to. And I was seeing our state revenues grow, and I can see big opportunity in state revenues, particularly many states who are looking at putting extra funding in for regional and rural services. And our network, in many cases, plays to that opportunity.</p><p>So that's a little snapshot. So 70% of our revenue comes from fiber and Internet. I would imagine over time that would remain reasonably consistent, but we will grow the pies in our voice and our DC and cloud revenues by proportion.</p><p>But what I would say is what I'm not intending to do is build a massive managed services organization. I've been on that road here before and it can incur an awful lot of cost and complexity in the business, and that is not what we need to do. There is plenty of market share against the capability we've got today with an incremental capability in our product to take the market share.</p><p>So what are our growth drivers? I've said it already, being very targeted in our approach to market. Being very specific about the customers we serve. The beauty of only having 4% market share is you don't have to be everything to everyone. You can be selective about the customers and marry up to where our relevance is.</p><p>We've just done a brilliant piece of work in our business where we've built a fiber data model and we've put in a geo mapping of all of our data, overlaid it with other carrier's infrastructure, laid over every business in Australia and you can start to really see hotspots of where we should be targeting based on where our network goes past and based on where our network is strong. So we're getting very sophisticated in how we market to organizations who will be relevant in acquiring our services.</p><p>The product set, I'll come onto in a minute, rationalizing that, simplifying it and bringing new capability to market. Our channel, it's a big overhaul in the channel. I've brought in a new channel team. Channel is a big opportunity. Everyone has a channel, but having a channel gives me reach into customers that I might not want to directly be serving, but also a channel that brings me capability I can own, sell to my customers who want to consume more from Vocus.</p><p>People. I've said we've got some brilliant people, but you never inherit a perfect team. And if you sit and say you've got the right team, you definitely haven't. You got to keep on your toes and have the right quality of people fronting our customers and being able to realize against the opportunity.</p><p>Partnerships. I get pretty excited about this. Bob and myself and Ellie and Vic went over to San Francisco, into the Valley, spent a week in the Valley, saw every one of the big tech companies you could imagine. And they were extremely interested in what Vocus is doing, a challenger that will challenge, a company that they can engage and get things done quickly that won't take 2 years to get something up and running and has an energy and appetite to really disrupt together. And you'll see some announcements that we'll come out with. But we are bringing some good partnerships to market here in Australia, which I think will uniquely position us to start to sort of get more relevant to that customer set and win new markets.</p><p>So we are targeting how we go to market, and this is really how we think about it. We think about it left to right, and Mark will touch also on wholesale international. Governments and special projects, as I said, highly relevant in Canberra. We have over 350-odd cleared people in our organization. So we're very relevant in certain projects for the government and also where organizations are wanting to co-fund and build things. So the recent Coral Sea Cable that we've built was funded by government monies. And we engineered, constructed, built, and we'll hand over that network. We will continue to do those big projects over time. And there is an increasing demand Kevin will touch on up in the Northwest in gas shelf. You will have been reading about what's going on up in the Northwest and in mining to build and construct services in which customers will contribute capital themselves for us to construct. And we will get long-term annuity revenues on those constructions.</p><p>And then enterprise, being very specific on really focusing on the areas where large consumptions of data are required. We're getting quite a lot of good traction in banking, banking and financial services, recently won a material contract for us at least in which we are providing over 200 high-capacity services for a financial services software company. And that's a beautiful thing because where we have to construct any new networks, it's going into points in the network where other financial services companies interconnect. And therefore, we've got a chance to leverage those -- that capital deployed to go and gain more customers in financial services.</p><p>And as I say, even outside of some of the large contracts that exist in the market, we're being considered for discrete services or for voice services or for DR. So we're getting really good traction in the market on that space. And when I was overseas and working in another organization with a lot of financial trading companies and investment banks, I've always struggled in Australia to find responsive companies who can deliver Ethernet services to connect market data information onwards well. That is Vocus, and we're doing well in delivering Metro Ethernet for financial services organizations.</p><p>And finally, our indirect and alliances and channels, we will use to manage parts of the market that we won't directly engage with. Could be SME organizations or midsized corporate organizations, slightly upfront. And it's Commander organization who will, on our behalf, sell network services.</p><p>So when I think about product, and as I said, I have the responsibility for product and marketing in the organization, in the VNS organization, we think about it in 3 quite distinct layers. There's the networks and connectivity. You saw before 70% of our revenues come in that space and will continue to be the dominant part of our business. Cloud platforms and security and workplace and collaboration. We have really good collaboration platform with our BroadSoft platform that we're investing further in this year to bring up and beyond the market in terms of capability. That is a great platform, and we're getting increasing growth rates in people adopting our collaboration and UC services.</p><p>But I would say my observation -- one of my observations I've been in Vocus is has been a, I suppose I would call it, a product debt, if you like. We've underinvested probably over the last 2 or 3 years in the products that are relevant to sort of help us take market share. And that's where we're putting all of our discretionary money in the product sets to sort of, one, simplify. And some of the simplification is cost out as well. So there's sort of 90 or so products that we're going to simplify down by 50 will sort of retire and cease sell, and move customers onto new products which are a better customer experience and allows us to retire some of that legacy and take cost out of the organization. We won't do any of that unless if it's going to disrupt the customer. So the way we will go around it will be sophisticated, and we'll offer optionality for our customers in that.</p><p>But moving forward, NBN will expand our reach and our network through that, and I'll touch on NBN in just a minute. International capacity, so for particularly wholesale, but also on our enterprise customers are demanding international capacity. Quite frequently, we're bidding, and we're bidding not just on our Singapore table but capacity up to the U.S. or networks further into Asia and productizing that and make it easy to consume for our enterprise and our government and our wholesale customers and growing our voice and collaboration platforms.</p><p>So ultimately, we get to a position, and Ellie will take you through over our future state networks that in 2 but not waiting for 3 years, progressively we'll be able to come to a position where we're digitizing and virtualizing our network. And we will start to take some leadership positions in the ability for inter-data center transfers of networks to dial up, dial down, edge and premise-to-premise network configuration, which becomes software-enabled, and that's pretty exciting stuff.</p><p>So NBN, people are saying -- ask me that question, is it good, bad or indifferent. And Kevin has not been backwards in coming forwards on his views of NBN in the consumer business quite rightly. But in the enterprise business, I look at it in a slightly different way. And that is that when you've got a network that we're connected to 5,500 buildings, we're not economically in a position to go and connect to another 20,000 buildings by connecting fiber. That's not a sensible use of capital. But rather, you have NBN who's rolling out fiber and connecting fiber to the majority of the metro areas and some regional areas in time that we can then consider where for a network solution we can use NBN as a tail access in and onto our backhaul network.</p><p>NBN's also disruptive. So I love disruption because that helps me. They're having conversations about NBN networks entirely replacing retail networks for example that exist on other incumbents, but they can't supply it directly. They need a service provider to supply it, and we're a consideration in that service provision.</p><p>I spent time with NBN. I invest in the relationship. I was only with them yesterday. We meet monthly on an executive level, and we get down to product level, pricing and more importantly, customer planning and mapping. And we're jointly working on some very interesting government opportunities. We recently won some health services for a big state department with NBN, and that gives us an opportunity. And these revenues can be several millions of dollars. Admittedly, the margins aren't as high as if it's all on your network, but the reality is it's still pretty good blended margins when we win and play with NBN as long as we're getting the right mix of our network and an NBN network or a third-party network.</p><p>We're launching new products with NBN. So we're bringing to market NBN Ethernet. And the NBN Ethernet pricing has just been refreshed, and it's incredibly compelling. In my view, that means we can be more aggressive in the market in winning with Vocus and NBN. And also, that means we can go and acquire customers. And once you've got customers on your network, you can start to layer those services and those unified services on top. So I'm pretty bullish on NBN and what it can do and complement our capability.</p><p>Government. As I said, good opportunities in secure and state government. We have -- we reckon about 35% of our market opportunity is in the state, and 65% is in federal. And we're making good inroads into state government, leveraging the panels that we've already done the hard work to get on and making ourselves more relevant in terms of how we've organized ourselves, the products and capability that we're bringing to market and our positioning in there. We recently brought Luke Coleman in, in terms of government relationship -- government relationships. Bob and Kevin are very active in Canberra. I'm very active around the states. We want to be disruptive, and we want to bring optionality for government, and I sense there's a big desire for that.</p><p>So finally for me, when we think about channel, and I mentioned people and partnerships, these are things that I'm kind of really focused on over the next 12 months, getting the channel right. What I've inherited is a very long channel that doesn't really prosecute much and hasn't really been well-enabled, rather enabling a tighter channel with more capable -- or capable -- not more but increasingly capable partners who can realize, with the same culture ambition that we have, market share growth, partners that will help us move services to the cloud, workloads to the cloud. So not just traditional network partners but cloud partners, software partners and partners that can provide a level of managed services where our customers are demanding it.</p><p>Our people, we'll continue to invest in. Sales methodologies, bringing ourselves up every single day to a higher level, keeping the bar moving, keeping the bar moving because at the end of the day, business-to-business sales is not going to be replaced by computer anytime soon. And you need to front people to enterprise organizations who are sophisticated in their buying and governments in buying with the right people who can have the right level of conversation.</p><p>And finally, strategic partnerships, I've mentioned on. We've brought to market our first SD-WAN with Fortinet. It's been quite amazing. We're in advanced conversations with Google on coming jointly to market here in Australia to enable people to move to the cloud. And when you think about that sort of partnership, you have 2 challengers. Not that I would think Google is a challenger. We think it's a leader. But in cloud, it's actually a challenger. Two challengers coming together to disrupt in the Australian market gets me really, really excited.</p><p>So in summary for me, the market opportunity seems to be growing and growing and growing. And our job is to make ourselves increasingly more relevant to the customer set we've got, acquire customers in a very defined way that are relevant to our assets and make some new markets, which we'll talk about with Kevin, and build the capability of the people and build the capability of our products and build our brand back in the market so that people are taking us seriously in consideration.</p><p>I'm now going to hand to Mark, who's going to now take you through wholesale international.</p><p>MARK CALLANDER, CEO OF NEW ZEALAND, CEO OF WHOLESALE &amp; INTERNATIONAL &amp; EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, VOCUS GROUP LIMITED: Good morning. Firstly, I'll start with the fact that Andrew and I have quite a unique relationship because Andrew seems to want to talk about cricket all the time. I want to talk about rugby all the time. So there's lots of really awkward silence between us. But other than that, we get on pretty well.</p><p>Before I dive into the slides themselves, I think it's important just to restate that the market context that Andrew refers to in terms of bandwidth growth, cloud adoption, digitalization is essentially what's fueling the wholesale business. So a lot of the market context that Andrew has covered is a key part of the driving force behind all the wholesale stuff. Hopefully, over the next 20 minutes or so, I'll give you a deeper dive in terms of the wholesale business and also more importantly into the international business. So hopefully, there will be a layer of detail that you haven't seen before that will give deeper insights in terms of how we think about the wholesale services and how we go to market.</p><p>So first starting with the slide. So a key point that we didn't really touch base on is if you go from left to right, the far left-hand side is really where our high-bandwidth opportunity exists. So your global OTTs, your international carriers, networks and connectivity, transmission services, wavelength, Ethernet, backhaul. That's the goal. That's the high-margin, high-earnings leverage.</p><p>The second point there is data centers. So data centers, while less by revenue, is really critical to the point that Andrew made around hyperscalers. All right. So connectivity and having a presence in all the major data centers is critical in terms of the customers we're dealing with, large international players and domestic carriers as well.</p><p>The third vertical that we target and play in was obviously the domestic market. So managed service providers, RSPs and service integrators. Again, predominantly focused on our network and connectivity services, and we've got a little bit of NBN as well.</p><p>So very similar to Andrew, a very small customer base. It's about 1,100 customers and is around 200 that drive 90% of the revenue. Okay? The thing that was most impressive again when you look at this organization, the customers that we deal with, we deal with nearly all the key players in the market. All right. So on that basis, the big opportunity for our wholesale business is the white space opportunity that sits out there.</p><p>The vision there is to be the first choice. I'd say a lot of the time, Vocus is the second choice. All right. So players that require diversity. We are first choice for a lot of customers, but they're big opportunity for us. Similar to the enterprise space, how do we get better penetration in the accounts we're dealing with. All right. The state there again, top 100 customers are 80% of the revenue. All right. So we have really, really good penetration with all the key players we need to be dealing with. The focus for us is getting better coverage within those accounts.</p><p>The team itself, very, very small and efficient team. So $7.5 million revenue per employee. There's about 35 people in the team. All right. So from that perspective, obviously we have -- the channel partners we deal with, that we enable, and we have a really small and efficient team that deliver great earnings leverage for this company.</p><p>International, I am going to touch base on later. But we're already up to 4.5 terabytes of international data. So that's a combination of both our ASC capacity that we're selling and also on our Southern Cross and a little bit on SEA-ME-WE3. But we're really getting really good momentum in international space, and I'll cover that a little bit later. Again, in terms of the customer penetration, so very high spend per customer, average of $24,000 of revenue per wholesale customer. All right. So again, our focus on driving the white space strategy in here is to continue to increase that value quite exponentially, and that opportunity is real.</p><p>Giving a bit of a flavor, I talked about on the previous slide that there are the 2 main areas, the OTTs, the carriers, domestic and both internationally, about half of wholesale's revenue. The other half comes from the MSPs, the RSPs, which we reflect on the chart there. So domestic carriers, obviously we deal with all the major domestic carriers. Again, we should be able to penetrate further on with those customers, but we have really strong penetration revenue coming from those guys.</p><p>All right. In terms of the discrete markets we plan, there's 4 areas that we think about from a wholesale context. First and foremost is the reseller market. Okay. So this is where we're providing NBN services or inputs into an NBN solution. Again, when you think about NBN, it's not just about the NBN service. It's our network assets as well. So we were providing backhaul and transmission services around the country. That's a key enabler for NBN. Key point from a wholesale perspective is we float on the tide. So there's plenty of challenges that we hear about -- frequently about NBN. From a wholesale perspective, we float on the tide of what NBN does. So we are a key enabler, but in theory, we manage our pricing while we float on the tide to make it a profitable outcome for us.</p><p>The data center connectivity, the key point on this one here is we have to connect where our customers need to be. All right. So this comes back to the point regarding the hyperscalers, cloud connectivity. All right. We're connected to 20-plus-odd data centers. We continue to connect to plenty more. We have to be where our customers want to connect. We often in these scenarios will actually do customer-funded builds. Sometimes we do build their sales from a network perspective. So there's a range of commercial models we look at here, but the connectivity is absolutely critical to fueling the wholesale business and also driving growth in our enterprise.</p><p>Talk about the last 2 here. This is our, what we call, our good oil. So we're not talking about good earnings leverage, right? So these are our data-centric services. So managed data services. Again, our Ethernet, dark fiber, wavelength services that provide. It's about sweating our assets, all right, and coming back to that left to right position for the wholesale business. We need high-capacity, high-bandwidth uses on our network.</p><p>The positive thing with those services there is typically they are longer-term contracts. So again, we'll discuss with customers that either want to go to an IRU-based model where typically we get funds upfront versus typical term leases which can range from 2 to 5 years. So again, it's a key focus for the business.</p><p>And clearly, international data. So I'm going to touch base in the next few slides to talk a lot more about our international strategy, how we've gone with ASC, how we think about swaps in the market. Again, I don't think the market has a good understanding of why we're entering to a swap in the market and why it's relevant for our business. Since launching ASC, we have had a phenomenal uptake, over 3.5 terabytes on the system so far. And our key moving forward is how do we use that asset to drive revenue both from an international perspective but also domestic pull-through of services as well. And I'll cover that off.</p><p>All right, ASC. So the most fundamental thing when I look at this chart, behind me here, if you go back 12 months ago, all Vocus really had was a small amount of capacity on SEA-ME-WE3 and some Southern Cross IRUs. All right. Having completed the ASC build September last year going live, we're now in a position -- if you look at this map here, through the ownership of ASC, we've been able to engage directly with all the major OTT players. And we've been able to use those relationships to build and develop strategic swaps to build out our international business.</p><p>All right. We didn't really have the right to play in international until we actually built the ASC asset. And the key point, which I've already reinforced there, is cable -- the big OTT, the big international carriers only want to deal with cable owners. So I've highlighted here, we have ASC. We now have 3 swaps we've done. We have capacity on the Indigo system. We have further capacity going up to the U.S. on another system. And then we have capacity going up the top via Guam into Hong Kong. So for the first time, we're in a position where we actually have a right to play in the international market. All right. We are focused on bringing traffic within and out of Australia, and both the East and the West Coast.</p><p>The other big thing that we're really leveraging at the moment is the swing of Internet traffic to the West. So the forecast from TeleGeography is that there will be, by 2024, around 75 terabits of demand required on the West Coast. All right. Good news for us is our ASC system, as I'm going to announce shortly, is now a 60-terabit system, which is great news. It was originally, the zone of ASC was 40 terabytes. That's now a 60-terabyte system. But the demand on that system within just a few years is going to be 75 terabits. So we're incredibly well positioned to leverage the explosion of that data that's going to the West.</p><p>Okay. A really important point worth noting is with the ASC going live, we actually sold only 10x the capacity of the entire SEA-ME-WE3 system. All right. So the SEA-ME-WE3 system had about 500 gig on it. All right. We're at 3.5 terabytes within the first 9 months of going live. That's a good illustration of the latent demand that's been building up in terms of the West Coast traffic.</p><p>In terms of big trends within the international market, I'll then propose, I'm going to go through all the stuff on the right-hand side. But I really, really want to focus on why Vocus is different. So what -- why would a customer choose to deal with Vocus over other opportunities in the market. So in terms of ASC, again it's designed. All right. So it has 4 fiber peers versus the Indigo system. So the design is a big advantage. The capacity on the system, we've got 60 terabytes with 1 owner versus 36 terabytes on the Indigo system with 4 owners. All right. That's a really big difference in terms of the capacity and control we have over that system.</p><p>A really big point is the ability to drop the data throughout Australia. So we can bring traffic into Perth and then based on the customers' requirements, choose to drop it off anywhere else -- anywhere throughout Australia. That's a big point of difference in terms of pull-through services. So it's not only being able to drop the data off, it's also starting conversations with a lot of the international players on other domestic services they require. All right. A lot of the international players that we deal with didn't realize we've got a big voice network. And we have voice capability that only came about when we were starting to engage with a lot of these players with ASC, the likes of ITW and PTC. So the awareness of ASC and the conversations we're now having with the players, it is night and day to what it was 12 months ago.</p><p>With the strategic swaps which I already talked about, we're also able to offer protected services. So what that means is for the larger players who are always going to buy protection themselves, we can go to the smaller players in the market and offer protected service. So should any of the cable systems break, we'll have automatic failover to another system. All right. So that's a really critical driver behind some of the swaps that we've been doing because we see a big opportunity to play in the smaller demand capacity market where we can offer a point of difference by offering protection on ASC and other systems. And we think that we have a big point of difference that the others don't have.</p><p>And obviously, 100% Australian lines, which just makes life a lot easier when dealing with certain customer segments. So that's great. In terms of the capacity itself, it's no surprise that the OTTs and the international carriers that are driving the bulk of the demand. So close to 70% of the traffic we see today on those systems is coming from the OTTs. The balance is coming from again domestic carriers and international carriers.</p><p>We thought we'd take this opportunity to try and explain the swap without getting too technical and why would we actually do it. So when we look at our international go-to-market strategy, we obviously have the ability to sell capacity on the system. All right. So customers will come to us. When they come to us, we'll consider the amount of capacity they want to purchase, the type of capacity they want to get, whether it's an IRU-based deal or a lease-based deal. And essentially, our job is largely to manage yield and manage pricing to get the best outcome for the organization.</p><p>The other option that we do look at from time to time is the swap. The key point with the swap is actually a conscious decision we go through. So a swap party will come to us and offer us capacity on another system. We'll look at that system and go right. Can we displace cost in our business? So are there earnings we can get by getting cost out of our business? Or alternatively, will it give us some strategic reach or a point of difference to offer another service? And I think a good example of that is again capacity on Indigo enables us to offer a protected service that we think we'll be able to get a unique position in the market to get additional earnings.</p><p>Some of the other swaps that I had up there were about cost displacement. In fact, in Ellie's area, for example, some of the Indigo capacity means we'll be able to get rid of some third-party costs first through our network. All right. So there's a conscious decision to think about the swaps, and they are going to drive an earnings outcome for us one way or another.</p><p>The key aspect on the swaps. Again, we work really closely with Ellie's team from a network planning perspective. So it is not some crazy salespeople out there trying to get commissions. It's actually a conscious process that we go through from a network planning perspective. They are seeing the demand on the network, traffic on the network, and our teams work very closely in terms of working out the best commercial outcomes for those customers.</p><p>In terms of growth for the wholesale business, again the luxury I've had a big focus on is this is throughout 6 months now. Prior to that, I was doing Andrew's job and a few others. And my wife's very happy that I'm now just doing wholesale. I've got a bit more time back at home, which is great. But the business again like many aspects of the Vocus business was heavy where there is a need for improvement. It was a little on the churn in terms of how it was going about things.</p><p>And I think sales enablement is a really great example. And we have a team that is very, very focused and very sales focused but really didn't have the support or systems in the background to deliver the growth ambitions that we have in the business. So we have established a sales operations function that now sits within wholesale, purely focused on wholesale customers and our international customers, about delivering better customer outcomes from a sales enablement perspective.</p><p>A key part of that, and Ellie will touch base on this shortly, is what we want to do in terms of online ordering and APIs. All right. So we have to simplify the product to go to market with, and we have to make it easier for our customers to order. That's going to be a big part of the growth from a wholesale and international perspective moving down the track.</p><p>Pricing and commercial. Andrew didn't touch base on this, but we've actually established a pricing function within Vocus. The purpose of the centralized pricing function is again largely to get consistency and discipline in terms of how we're pricing and how we're going to market to get the best returns for the business. All right. So we no longer have a scenario where we have different parts of the business conflicting and fighting. We have a centralized, disciplined process that sets pricing in the market to get the best returns for the business. Sounds simple, but it's a big step forward for an organization like Vocus, and it's going to drive discipline right across the business.</p><p>Aligning of incentives is really important. So again, the essence of Vocus Networks now in terms of how we operate is we've essentially eliminated conflict. So between myself, Ellie, Andrew, we are very focused and aligned on making sure we get the best outcome for our customers and the best outcome for the business. So getting alignment of those incentives is really, really critical.</p><p>In terms of go-to-market enhancements, we've actually established a dedicated product and marketing function for wholesale. So again, we've historically helped turning up buildings and doing a great job with selling and networking. So we're going to have much more purpose in terms of how we're going to market and how we're winning. All right. So again, the essence of what Andrew and the team are building, again there's much more conviction and focus on the sort of products and propositions we're taking to market, what the Vocus brand actually stands and means for and investment in that brand so we have relevance in the markets we're going to play in.</p><p>And as I already talked about on the international front, we are actually building an international -- we've already done it. We have an international sales team set up and established. Prior to that, it was just managed within the existing wholesale sales team. The purpose of having an international team is obviously we have been building those intimate relationships with our international customers. We can focus on pull-through of domestic services. We have more relevant conversations because we understand what's driving those businesses, what's driving their business needs, why they're choosing Vocus, why they're not choosing Vocus. So we're having much more in-depth, broader conversations with those customers.</p><p>The final area there in terms of what we're looking at is having a presence in Singapore and potentially the U.S. Singapore is probably a higher focus for us. Again, why does it? It's having those intimate conversations. It's being there. It's being in the locations where people are making those decisions. A lot of the buying decisions again for a lot of OTTs are now based in Singapore. A lot of the DC investment and capacity investment is now going into Asia as well. So we have to be there if we want to be a player in this market, and again, it's been very easily drawn on the experience of it by Ellie and Andrew in terms of their views in terms of where we need to have a presence and where we can succeed in one.</p><p>And on that note, I think I need to hand over to Ellie.</p><p>ELLIE SWEENEY, COO, VOCUS GROUP LIMITED: Hand over to me. Well done. Thank you. Guys, I woke up this morning and I had a photo on my phone and it goes off and tells you where you were this time last year. And this time last year, I was in Lisbon and I was about to start walking the Camino de Santiago. It was on my bucket list. It was something I had really wanted to do for a very long time. And so -- and I thought about today the difference between last year of being in Lisbon and today, I've got to say, I'm even more excited about being in Sydney, my hometown, and being able to talk to you today about some of the things we're doing in Vocus Network Services as well as the wider group.</p><p>You're probably getting the feeling that we are quite an aligned group, and I hope that's coming out. Over the last 6 weeks or so, we spent a lot of time together going through the strategy. I think it would be fair to say that all of us could interchange each other's roles and probably give exactly the same speech for each other. We know it that well. The comment that Mark made before about international, yesterday we had our international session. We have the product team, the sales team, all the guys from the capacity planning teams. We have May. We have the legal team. Everybody is on those calls to really make sure we are aligned across the strategies that we have.</p><p>And I hope you're getting the feeling that not only do we have a great team but we've got a great opportunity. And very clearly, we think we have an opportunity to make -- to take market share in the Australian and also the international market given we are really underindexed in terms of the performance of our market share versus the fantastic network assets that we have.</p><p>We've mentioned a couple of times this ambition of being a specialist fiber provider in Australia, and we are really, really committed to doing that. One of the guys that I like looking at, a couple of companies internationally, one is Zayo and one is Colt. Carl Grivner is the CEO of Colt, and he wrote something that I read the other day. And it was -- Colt was in the lucky position not to be distracted as some of their peers were by trying to get into media or to get into being a big SI player or advertising or all those things you've often heard telcos talking about getting involved in. From our perspective, we are absolutely laser-focused in terms of our aspiration and ambition around our fiber network. And it's a really great position to be in because like Colt, we are not distracted in terms of some of those other areas.</p><p>Let me talk about the jewel in the crown, if I could say that, and that very much is our fiber assets. And if you look at this slide, and you've probably seen slides like this before, there are a couple of things I'd probably call out. That inter-capital network that Andrew has spoken about, over 15,000 kilometers on that network, and quite frankly, more capacity to offer our customers there as well without investing a lot of CapEx. We've got over 9,500 kilometers of fiber within our metro and our regional areas. Now that's important for a number of reasons, but increasingly as customers want to move closer to the edge and as cloud compute becomes more available, it's a real asset for us to have close to 9,500 kilometers there as well.</p><p>I think we've mentioned a couple of times on the number of on-net buildings. So we have over 5,500 on-net buildings. So they are lit by our cable. Again, as you start to see the advance in technology around things like PON, so passive optical network, which is point to multipoint rather than point to point, that's a real asset for us in terms of our ability to reduce the cost of service well within our business.</p><p>We're connected to over 17 sports stadiums. I work with 2 colleagues who are obviously very keen on the sport. So 17 stadiums in Australia are connected. And I think we've probably done to death the commentary about ASC, but it's a great investment for us. And Mark makes a very, very valid point. It's not just bringing in OTT or the fangs from Asia into Australia into the West Coast. It's clearly bringing them across into the East Coast, and obviously without terrestrial cable systems that we have, that's a real advantage for us.</p><p>In terms of data center, Andrew's already mentioned it, we have 17 data centers here in Australia, 3 in New Zealand. And we have business continuity in 2 of those data centers, which again we sell to a number of our key clients as well.</p><p>And I've mentioned this comment about delivering security. That is something that obviously is increasingly important. Andrew mentioned it. He spoke to most CEOs. They will always say that cybersecurity is one of the key things on their list, as is getting the right skill set. From a cyber or from a security perspective, particularly for our government customers, this is actually something that we spent probably the last year really developing in far more depth than we had previously.</p><p>And look, I wanted to mention a couple of things just around our proven ability. Often within organizations, when you look at yourself, it's very easy to criticize. But I would say coming into Vocus, it was definitely coming into a business that is running really quite well. Many years ago, I started as a very young person, I was about 25, and I got this great opportunity to run the contact centers for Telstra in New South Wales. And on the first day I started, there was a deputation in the room. They said, \"Can I -- we come and see you?\" And I said, \"Yes, I'm in a meeting for the most of the day, but come and see me at the end of the day.\" When the end of the day came, there are 100 people in the room and people were crying. It was that broken. I think if you are calling into our contact centers that day, 70% of people were just abandoning in the IVR.</p><p>Coming in to Vocus is the antithesis of that experience. We have great people. We have a huge amount of pedigree. We have wonderful people who've worked across all of the founded networks that we have who really drive an amazing performance for our customers in terms of our network. And if you look at some of the areas that we're talking about, our IP network, our transmission network, our edge network, our voice network, we have beaten our targets every month since I've been here. We've actually had a fantastic 12 months in terms of that performance. From our operating systems, OSS, BSS, our IT systems again, incredibly strong in terms of that performance. We are huge users of Slack and Zoom, and those systems perform incredibly well.</p><p>But the one I probably like to focus on a little bit is the NPS performance, so the Net Promoter Score performance that we have within the business. And again, when I've worked in other organizations, we were getting really great NPS results. We paid people on it. And we also had great relationships with our customers one-on-one. And quite frankly, I think that might have influenced the result. These are episodic NPS results. So every time after we deliver a service, the customer is sent an e-mail, and they're asked how likely are you to recommend Vocus. Last month, so for June, so it's an unaudited result, but it's at 38. It's actually a great result for an episodic result. And it's really been down to the work of I think a great team. A lot of tactical initiatives. Mark's mentioned API, so obviously, a lot of APIs for our wholesale customers to really improve the performance of their business. We have put more people into this to really improve the performance of Net Promoter Scores.</p><p>We've also pre-provisioned so that again, Andrew mentioned some of the great delivery time we've been able to deliver for our customers. That's really done in concert with the sales teams and the go-to-market teams to make sure where we place those investments for pre-provisioning, where we place those investments in terms of APIs, we're really getting the biggest bang for our buck.</p><p>One of the things that's wonderful about working for Vocus is it is absolutely a challenger brand. This is not a fancy incumbent. We are a challenger. But we're catching Ubers, UberPool. We've all been catching Uber. So from that perspective, this is a business that really goes out to make sure that for every dollar we spend, we are very clear in terms of that return. And I think the investments that we've made in some of the very tactical changes that we've made in service delivery are evidence of that.</p><p>Look, in terms of our proven ability to win, and I think that's important point to win and to build large-scale cables, I'd probably just like to give you a flavor for just a few of them. We have mentioned the North West Cable. And again, 2,100 kilometers of cable, it's 12 terabits of capacity. And it's not a particularly easy place to put in a cable. It's obviously offshore the West Coast of Australia. And obviously, we're going after that very key and growing oil and gas segment there as well.</p><p>Australia, Singapore Cable, I think we've mentioned this. Mark is obviously incredibly excited that we're now up to 60 terabits, which is fantastic. But the one thing I would say here is that it was delivered not only ahead of time, it was also delivered ahead of budget. And I think it says a lot about the caliber of people that we have in what is a relatively small organization.</p><p>Look, the final one just to mention there again in a slightly challenging part of the world sometimes to deal with is the Coral Sea Cable System. So 4,800 kilometers of cable, over 40 terabits of capacity. We are in the market now in terms of we have the ships in the water, and we'll be delivering that in December of 2019. Now all of those cables are all 100 million-plus cable systems. So quite frankly, they are not small cables in many respects. And I've worked at international and I'm quite delighted by some of the performance I've seen. Andrew mentioned again some of capability that we've got. We have some fantastic submarine cable expertise, and we partner very well to deliver those cables for our customers and their end customers as well.</p><p>And look, we spent a little bit of time talking about Vocus, and I'm relatively new to Vocus. I think I'm coming up in a couple of weeks to 4 months. It's probably fair to say that between 2015 and 2016, as you know, there was a huge amount of M&amp;A activity, which is great. And it also means that we have our fantastic fiber network that we have today. So you've got M2, Amcom, all of those investments that we made.</p><p>I think it's also probably fair to say that between 2017 and 2019, we spent a lot of time in terms of making some clear investments. And in some respects, they're the low-hanging fruit, if I could put it that way. But they were also the right things to do from a sequential perspective. So we had consolidated our NOC. We've gone from 4 NOCs to 1 NOC. And that's based in Melbourne, and I think they're doing a tremendous job.</p><p>We've also done some work around something called Supercore, I'm sure we've mentioned it previously, which is essentially our core and our transmission network. So taking those consolidation of those 6-or-so networks into one core network, and we call that our Supercore network. We have migrated Amcom. We've migrated Vocus. We've migrated all of those networks. The last one we would be migrating is M2. We'll have that completed by August/September of this year. So when you think about that, it's a great foundation in terms of the network that we actually have. And again, if you want to be a specialist in fiber network solutions business, you've got to get that part right, which we've done. The other reason why that's really important to get that right, and it sounds incredibly boring, is to make sure that our inventory is very clean. And again, if you've been around some of these businesses before, having clean inventory is incredibly important if you want to start digitizing your business, which very clearly is something that we want to do.</p><p>We've also spent a lot of time stabilizing delivery. I think there was a mention of that in some previous sessions. And I think the delivery performance of the team has dramatically improved over the last year. And quite frankly, Andrew's right. I have very few customer contacts at all complaining about the delivery of our business or the billing of our business. Often in telcos, that's a real area that comes under fire. And I'd say it's one of the reasons why we are able to do that. It's again we are quite a simple business. We are not providing mobiles. We're not providing Foxtel. We're not providing lots of different content. In Vocus Network Services, you've seen the number. It's largely around our fiber business, our Internet and our voice and cloud business as well.</p><p>With voice consolidation again, we have done a lot of work in terms of investing in efficient border controls to really uplift the performance of our voice network, which again 15% of the revenue, as you've seen, is coming from our voice business. And again, this isolated the secure network. Not only have we isolated the secure network, we've isolated all of our staff who work on those networks, our BSS stacks, and we have close to, I think, 180 NV1 cleared people who work on our government accounts, on our Class 1 government accounts.</p><p>So it's probably fair to say a lot of activity from an M&amp;A perspective, a lot of activity to get us up to a certain level, getting that core network to where we are today. Our Supercore has been really critical in terms of that amalgamation of our networks and getting that foundation right. But it's also fair to say that we've got a great opportunity now to really simplify and to modernize the business that we're in. We have ticked it from having 6-or-so networks. We've got a lot of manual intervention at the moment to provide a good level of service delivery. And so now really is the opportunity for us to take that next step. And I'm delighted to say that we do very clearly have a plan, and the plan was signed off by the Board. It's obviously been endorsed by the Board and also by Kevin and the wider team. And we've had a number of people working on this for probably the last 7 months to get us where we are today. So this is not a plan that's about to happen. We're actually already starting to execute this.</p><p>Again, if I can stop here for 1 second and just remind you that Phase 1 will be completed by basically September of this year. So when we talk about the next step or the future step, I'm not talking about the core transmission. I'm not talking about the fiber network. That is already being consolidated. What I'm talking about is the edge network that exists. And as you can see there, we have close to 6 networks in our edge network. We are simplifying that into one new network. So not only are we simplifying into one new network, we're also simplifying the edge. At the moment, we have multiple boxes that will be serving different products. Again in the future, there will be one box that serves all of our products as well.</p><p>Another thing I think we've spoken about previously is that we have multiple BSS stacks. Again, you start to get the flavor. If you've got 6 networks, there's a lot of cost in terms of assuring, monitoring, activating. It's obviously by going into one, you take that cost out. By doing it, you're also going into a new network. I mentioned the inventory. We have clean inventory not only in our core networks but in our layer 2, layer 3 networks. Quite boring but really important, it enables us then to digitize our business far more easily than we would be able to otherwise. It also ensures that we can alarm and obviously monitor our business more effectively than we had previously.</p><p>The BSS stacks. Again, 8 stacks just drives complexity. I was with our team in Perth last week and I actually sat down and said, \"Can you actually show me how you deliver an order? How do you deliver a circuit?\" It's highly manual. It's highly manual. It's highly reliant on great people doing a great job. And quite frankly, I think we can do a lot better than that.</p><p>We are implementing programmable network, and this really is around software-defined networking and network function virtualization. They are not new things in any regard but it's probably nice not to be in the Vanguard but to really being able to utilize what is now a lot of open source and a lot of common standards across the world to deliver those products for our customers as well. So again, core network already being completed, September 2019 will be the final conversion of our Supercore network, and we are looking at then going into those core stacks around our 6 networks into 1 that's a layer 2, layer 3 edge network, the BSS consolidation and also our programmable network as well.</p><p>Look, some of the things going into that future state for us are really around the financial efficiency. Again, it just makes sense in terms of being able to reduce the number of platforms that you've got from provisioning, from assurance and from monitoring. We've made some statements previously around $30 million of OpEx and $30 million of CapEx, which absolutely we stand behind. I'll take you through those numbers in a moment.</p><p>Customer experience. Again, being able to provide customers with a software-defined environment, with an environment where we can attribute close to 80% of on-net orders via a digital portal really gives them just far more control over not only their activation, their assurance and their billing. And I think most of us would think that having that control is increasingly important to customers. Andrew mentioned also channel partners. At the moment, we have a limited ability to service our challenge -- channel partners rather other than very manual processes. So again, being able to offer them that ability from a digital perspective is increasingly important. And obviously, that's just another go-to-market channel for us to really ensure that we do fulfill that ambition and take market share in a market where we think we are under-indexed against obviously the fiber network that we have.</p><p>Look, in terms of disrupting, software-defined networking and network function virtualization and a lot of those acronyms are not new, but what we think is new probably for the Vocus business is our ability to take that capability against a low market share and really go after providing, I think, Australian and International customers with an alternate, and that's around obviously bandwidth on demand. The first product that we'll release is the data center to data center bandwidth. But in terms of software-defined networking, it's across our entire network. We're not restricting it just to certain areas or certain products. And so what it does do, it gives us the opportunity from a Go-to-Market perspective to obviously look at bandwidth on demand by SLA, by capacity, by latency, and that's pretty exciting for us to be able to go after that market as well.</p><p>We've also mentioned partner ecosystem. As I read this slide, I'm always amazed at how many acronyms I can use. I'm surprised no one's called out bingo. But in terms of the partner ecosystem, that really is one of those areas that I think a number of years ago people spoke a lot about. But really being able to partner with a Palo Alto or being able to partner with Google or being able to partner with anybody is increasingly important. And I think a lot of precinct exists there today to be able to do that. Obviously, by being in a future state or again, cleaner networks, software-defined and obviously NFV means that we provide our customers with those abilities to spin up firewalls, to spin up virtual routers and also to use that bandwidth.</p><p>And finally, from a product perspective, very much when we've designed our future state layer 2 and layer 3 network, when we've designed our programmable network and also our BSS stacks, it's very much around being open source, being MEF-compliant. And what it does mean is that quite frankly, instead of us having to build and design everything ourselves, we can take account of some of the great works that's being done by a lot of partners and a lot of other vendors to be able to white label and also to federate some of those products as well.</p><p>So from our perspective, incredibly exciting to now be at this stage of having gone through a lot of M&amp;A activity to really have stabilized the business and made some big bets around particularly that core infrastructure and our Supercore network to really being at a stage where we can consolidate BSS stacks, do a lot of work around obviously our networks and then also be able to introduce some really great technology for our customers.</p><p>Look, we put this up. I did say to my boss, \"Do we really want to be showing this?\" And he said, \"Yes, absolutely.\" I heard him say earlier that this is going to be easy. I'm not sure it's going to be totally easy, but we have a great team, and we are already in market in terms of lab trials as well. Look, in terms of some of the spend, obviously, this is a project that is over a number of years. Up there, you can see a capital spend of about $83 million for us to spend in terms of delivering this layer 2, layer 3 network, our virtual network functions, our SDN and also our BSS consolidation.</p><p>We've put our statements out here around the number of new network edge sites that we will be building. Again, if you think about at the moment, we have -- in some areas, we have 4 sites today. We are going to 1 and it brings with it all the consequent economic benefits of being able to do that. So 55 sites at the end of FY '20, 110 at the end FY '21, 160 and then 41 as well. We've mentioned a couple of times that edge network. So by doing that, we go from 6 edge layer 2, layer 3 networks to 1.</p><p>We're going from a very complex BSS stacks from 8 to 2. We're also introducing obviously our front-end BSS stacks up-front. And again, that will help us in terms of our level of digitalization that we can bring to the business as well.</p><p>And then finally and one obviously very close to my heart, again, we've mentioned that $30 million in terms of OpEx reduction previously. You can see from here those numbers. Again, we start this year at $165 million, and you can read them yourself, those numbers, to get us to the $135 million. Now there's a lot in that. There is a lot in terms of being able to just do things a lot faster to take out head count because we are incredibly manual at the moment in terms of everything we do from not only a provisioning, from an assurance, from a monitoring perspective, from a BSS perspective, we have a lot of developers within our business who are fantastic, and we also have a lot of costs around our licensing as well. So there are some big statements there. But again, we've been, I think, pretty ruthless and very thorough in terms of the business cases that we have put together to be able to represent some of these numbers here today.</p><p>So from my perspective, I'd say for me coming in, it's been quite a short amount of time to be here. Not only do we have a fantastic team. We've got a lot of people who are incredibly passionate about Vocus Network Services. Again, I mentioned we are not a complex business in comparison. We are not distracted by a lot of other activities that some of our peers are. We have a very clear road map and a very clear ambition about being a leading provider for network and fiber within Australia, and I think very clearly we are set up to do that.</p><p>So look, on that note, let me hand over to Kevin to bring home just a little bit more about that skill set and that capability as we look to not only our base case but our base plus. We do think there's fantastic opportunity not only in existing customers that we have but some really quite strategic deals. Now if you think about the articulation, we've already mentioned about our ability to deliver not only ASC Coral Sea West Coast cable, we think we've got even more with some of the upcoming pipeline. So Kevin?</p><p>KEVIN STEVEN RUSSELL: All right. We're ahead of schedule. So I'm just going to put up a couple of placeholders, and they are placeholders. So the core is -- the previous sale that we just had. We've got plenty to execute but I do -- I just want to put some holding statements out, and we'll come back to them. Whether it's in 2 years, 3 years, 4 years or 5 years, we will come back to them. This is an infrastructure business and we, as a leadership team, have to be executing today and we also have to have half an eye out 2 years, 3 years, 4 years on capitalizing some of the opportunities out there.</p><p>One element -- one opportunity that I think is not understood. I just want to again say, just put it, a holding statement, this North West Cable, completed October 2016, almost forgotten, almost felt as if I had to dig in and find it when I first came in the middle of, well, 12 months ago, beautifully positioned, and we'll touch on this strategically up into Asia but also just through the oil and gas shelf just up in the Timor Sea here. So some key opportunities, discussions we're having, nothing to announce today but just a holding statement to say over the coming 12, 24 months, we will be looking at opportunities around this cable with key oil and gas partners. The models we're looking at are long-term 15-year annuity revenues and largely customer-funded opportunities.</p><p>In the same breadth, we are also looking at longer-term strategic fiber builds. It's very interesting. I'll go back to that comment right in the beginning of it, specialist fiber network solutions provider. I do not see others in the marketplace just now looking at fiber strategically. And for us, we have some awesome assets in the ground and offshore that we have an opportunity to leverage. So just, again, 4 placeholders for us to come back in not next month but in the years ahead.</p><p>One, 5G backhaul. I would probably -- I'm going to say long -- my comments are a little bit longer on business fiber and short on consumer wireless that you probably see here. I think the future of wireless is fiber. The reality of 5G is it needs fiber, and I think it's going to be a fascinating battle play now in 12, 18, 24 months around regional backhaul for Optus and Voda to compete in 5G. They are going to need access to fiber outside the metro. For us, that's where we play. Our strengths, interestingly enough, are those regional assets. So we will look at how those opportunities emerge 1, 2, 3 years out but we do want to play in that marketplace.</p><p>We do see opportunities in the North West Cable to connect up into Indonesia again using our submarine cable capability, and we do see opportunities to connect from Port Hedland across to ASC straight through the Scarborough gas shelf to provide incremental redundancies with a number of key customers. And then again, that point that Andrew articulated around our strength in Northwest Australia, we are looking over the next few years how do we strengthen some of that market share, some of that capability through strategic fiber builds through key mining locations.</p><p>So these are placeholders for now. We do need as a team -- yes, we're executing today but absolutely have our eyes 3, 4, 5 years out to build the right infrastructure returns.</p><p>So we've actually managed the time better than I thought. I thought we'd be breaking in 15 minutes. Andrew Wildblood, actually, he was quite quick for a change. Mark Callander is always quite quick.</p><p>Just some summary comments from me on Vocus Network. This is our core. This is where the value is in Vocus. What we've tried over the last 1.5 hours is to articulate actually how we see the core to the assets and most importantly, where we see the opportunities to use those assets. The interesting thing about the team we've assembled, it's been critical for me to get key executives who can work operationally, who can lead teams, getting the detail and drive because this is a small company, but the fascinating thing is you need people who can also go up a level and see opportunity and execute on those opportunities. And we need to be smarter at anyone in the marketplace at spotting the trends in the marketplace and spotting the opportunities, and that's where we've brought in, in terms of Ellie and Andrew, and that's where Mark is well in the wholesale and the wholesale business have the ability to operate at that level and at that level. So as a team, we're in a pretty good place.</p><p>In terms of execution risk, get good people. They get good people, they deliver. So we have done a lot of work planning, done a lot of work debating, landing. We just need to now execute. Again, I'll go back to the last 6 weeks, frankly, a bloody distraction. Now we execute. We have been executing. We're going to do more execution in the next 2 years.</p><p>So with that, we'll break. If we can start again at quarter past, that would be great. Hopefully, that was helpful. Thank you very much.</p><p>(Break)</p><p>ANTONY DE JONG, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF BUSINESS &amp; CONSUMER, VOCUS GROUP LIMITED: Good morning, everyone. Welcome back. We'll just let the people at the back regain their seats and we'll kick off the next section.</p><p>My name is Antony De Jong. I'm the Head of the Retail business in Vocus. I've actually been here a little longer than some of my colleagues who've spoken this morning. I joined Vocus formerly on the 1st of September, having had also quite a long history in telecommunications, most recently spent the last 5 years founding, establishing and running Belong, which was Telstra's challenged business. The beauty of coming to Vocus for me was that I really got the opportunity to spend a month in August looking at the business, understanding the culture, the people and the opportunity, including the opportunity to turn around and reframe our retail business and particularly starting with Commander, which was perhaps the most neglected part of the retail portfolio. And so having done that, I kind of knew what I was getting into and I'm really delighted that I did join. It's been a fantastic 10 or 11 months for me with the new team and a great set of colleagues in the executive team to work with.</p><p>So listening to Andrew talk about the World Cup this morning and the cricket and all the rest, I thought about the Vocus batting order with our World Cup players, and it was great to see our openers, Bob and Kevin, Warner and Finch jumping up there, followed by Joe Root as Andrew. And then I thought he did a wonderful job. He kept his innings intact today. And then of course, our great all-rounder, Ellyse Perry, jumped in. And I was really pleased to see her perform really well. And then of course, we needed the big show, Glenn Maxwell, to come back in, and that was Kevin with some of those big opportunities. And for the rest of the day now, we'll be getting to the rest of the batting order and it's actually some of the bowlers, and I thought it's going to start with me and who would I be? So look, I thought -- I don't really want to be Alex Carey. I'll perhaps be Alyssa Healy. And then we'll hand over to Trent Boult and the tailenders will come through, some of whom are sitting here, my colleagues.</p><p>But moving right along, that was as far as I could take the cricket analogy, the retail business is a business that's quite important and strategic for Vocus. It's not the core but it is the largest part of Vocus' current revenue, and it's a very significant contributor to today's profit. And as Kevin outlined, it's also got some pretty important headwinds to navigate over the next couple of years. We actually, in the retail business, bill over 1 million services a month, and we do that to over 650,000 households and businesses. So it's not a small business. It's a big business with about 8% NBN share. I'll talk a little bit about that.</p><p>Since March, we've been establishing that business as a separate business unit. That includes bringing in some of the digital and technology components that were in infrastructure and operations, basically everything above the network and some of our support areas into the retail unit all under one area, and that gives us focus and an ability to become more cost-conscious in running a retail business as a reseller of networks and solutions.</p><p>The turnaround strategy is well underway, and I'll touch on some of the things that are green shoots in the turnaround already, including our return to growth in energy customers over the last quarter, which has been important as a result of some of the things we've done in that business, and that energy business is a big part of our whole retail proposition.</p><p>There are 3 very strong brands in our retail business. They have a heritage going back more than 30 years, in the case of Commander, 20 plus years in the case of iPrimus and even Dodo, it's a very well-known and established brand in the budget-conscious market in Australia. So these are good brands with good awareness and good consideration, and they're very focused on segments within retail. So we don't need to take a broad-brush approach.</p><p>We're also a business that's very heavily dependent on broadband today. And as part of the navigation of some of the challenges with NBN that I'll talk about, we are diversifying quite strongly into energy and into mobile, and that's where we see great potential for growth.</p><p>And finally, when you look at our cost equation, we have inherited a complexity of platforms and systems and, as a result, have a lot of opportunities to streamline in the cost here. We've made good progress there already in the last year or so, but increasingly, over the next few years, we're moving away from our legacy platforms and systems. Many of those that Ellie mentioned are actually resident and the retail portfolio, including some legacy brands.</p><p>When you look at the business, the beauty of our Vocus Retail proposition is we have brands targeted around specific subsegments. When you look at the revenue mix, over 60% is Dodo, and it's in energy and in telco, predominantly fixed broadband voice. iPrimus is a brand that offers more for more. So not everyone is a budget-conscious shopper but not everyone wants to shop from the same brand either. And so iPrimus gives us a choice and customers a choice when they're wanting to buy more for more and get a better service and a higher speed. And finally, Commander is synonymous with small business, and the relaunch of Commander in February has really repositioned us to grow as small businesses grow in Australia with a focus and level of attention that the majors and other providers in that sector are unable to match.</p><p>When you look at our revenue mix by product, you can see that 75%, almost of our product, is telco and about 25% is energy. In the telco part though, 48% is actually broadband, and broadband today has been traditionally very profitable for us but it's a lot less profitable today, and I'll touch on that when I talk about NBN's impact.</p><p>Looking at NBN. Today, we are an 8.3% shareholder, fourth biggest NBN provider in the RSPs. One of the unintended consequences of the last decade of NBN rollout is that the largest provider got bigger, so did the second largest. And it had to get bigger at the expense of some of the smaller players, and so that's been a challenge. And the reality of the NBN economics, when you really boil things down for us, is that we today charge $5 more per customer on average than we did 2 years ago, and we make $6 less on the gross margin line. So even when we convert all those customers, we've done a very good job with migration particularly in the last 6 months. There's an $11 turnaround and that reflects where the margin goes as we roll out this technology. Those costs are higher as are the costs to connect customers on the complexity of NBN technologies, and the FTTx alphabet soup really doesn't -- really means the customer doesn't know what they're going to get. Is it HFC? Is it Fiber to the Premise? Is it Fiber to the Curb? So we're not really clear with our customers often in what they want and that's not something that we can actually control as a retail service provider. That's all dictated to us by the wholesaler.</p><p>The other challenge we have is that customers demand certainty, and so 70% of our customers are actually on unlimited plans where they get that certainty. Because a large portion of those customers are very budget-conscious, they want that certainty. But the costs that an RSP like Dodo or iPrimus or Commander pay to NBN is uncertain because of the variable pricing model based on consumption use. And so it's very important that we get to an aligned position on price with our customers to enable us to carefully manage the network consumption so that we can still make a margin, and that's something we're very focused on, what experts in the business that look at that every day, to make sure that we're matching the dynamics of supply and demand so that we can give the customer certainty and still make a margin and give them a good experience.</p><p>As higher-speed tiers and higher usage kick in, you would think that's a good thing. Use more of my product, we'll all be happy. Well, actually, we make less margin. So again, there's an anomaly between the way that the industry is receiving the prices from the wholesale provider. So our approach to deal with this is look at price increases consistent with market changes and cost changes, and we've actually executed that most recently in April and have been able to adjust our prices for out-of-contract customers and revisit our NBN plans so that we can actually nudge up our prices without hopefully losing too much market share on the way, but it's a managed-for-profit scenario and that is a marked change in chasing market share that preceded our annual approach.</p><p>We're also looking at, once we have customers, upselling where they do a lot of streaming or they do a lot of home-based work, for example, make sure that we're able to put them on higher usage plans, higher ARPU plans for us. But ultimately, we have to look at options, and those options might include more mobile wireless and fixed wireless options that allow us to source broadband for a customer at a lower cost than we can currently source it from NBN, and that's where our Optus MVNO arrangement is particularly attractive for the retail business, and we'll definitely be looking at how we can take some of our customers into those mobile alternatives, recognizing particularly in the residential space that a lot of those customers are renters. They want to be able to take their broadband with them when they move as well.</p><p>We are in the middle of an industry pricing consultation period with NBN, and ultimately, there are 3 things that we'll be pushing for from a Vocus Retail perspective. None of this, by the way, negates the comments that Andrew made earlier around our appetite for business with NBN. And in fact, even in our Commander business, we are quite enthusiastic about NBN for business plans, but that's a different market with a different set of needs than our consumer customers and particularly our Dodo, price-sensitive customers.</p><p>We're looking for a lower level of entry pricing. The reality is a lot of our customers came from $39 plans on ADSL. And today, they can't get $50 plans from the NBN that give them the same service even at the speeds they had on ADSL. And for those customers, an $11 difference is actually quite material because they've got to pay the rent and they've got to deal with their other expenses. And I can see that when I go to Manila and I listen to the calls, and I'm very conscious of how many customers need financial assistance and time to pay in some of the other categories and what's essentially becoming a key service for them. We hear a lot of stories about kids' homework, schools being connected, and I really do feel this is one of the reasons we need to be very vigilant on getting low-priced plans for Australia and for our digitally connected communities to remain connected. And a lot of those communities are not high end and able to pay for the high costs. So for us, lower entry-level pricing is key even if it means diminished service and diminished speed.</p><p>The other thing that you would have seen in the earlier slide that Kevin showed you is the impact on voice-only customers. Now less so in Dodo but definitely in Commander and in iPrimus, we have a lot of customers that came from a voice-only PSTN, ISDN legacy position. Those customers may have had voice services because they didn't need data in their particular businesses. If you're a greengrocer, a local green with not many of them left I guess, but if they are local greengrocers, they're quite happy with just voice services and mobile services, may tend to replace NBN if voice services are not available to business as an alternative to what we currently have. So support for voice-only customers and their migration is another thing we'll be pushing for in the consultation period.</p><p>Clearly, we want greater simplicity and certainty. We have to address the alignment between unlimited data plans being the norm in what is sold in this country and the variable costs associated with CVCs and the different tiers that support those tiers. I actually think a range of tiers is very important for basic access. A low speed at a low price is perfectly acceptable versus for a small business that is dependent on data, clearly, you want to give them an unlimited plan with the fastest possible speed they can have to that premise because every minute counts that they're connected.</p><p>Finally, we'd like fairness. Fairness is about a level playing field and it's acknowledged, I think, that it's not level today. The bigger organizations have benefited from NBN's rollout. It's time to address that and make it simpler by removing some of the complexity that is hurting competition in NBN. So these are the things we're pushing for in our discussions with the industry around NBN.</p><p>So where do we go next with our retail business? When you look at our business on the left-hand side here, we don't play in the premium sector of that business. That's very, how would I put it, price-independent segment of the marketplace. People will pay almost anything in that pricing often due to the incumbents who dominate that portion of the market. But we do play in the nearly $13 billion segment covering the value segment of customers, those that will pay more for more and they're paying those companies that compete in there, like iiNet and Internode, iPrimus, they all start with I, and then also in the price-sensitive segment, which is clearly one that TPG, Belong, Dodo have been very present in and obviously small business where Commander is quite significant.</p><p>You can see when you look at our share, we're very material in the price-sensitive segment, Dodo, which really reflects what I've said earlier about how important it is to that group of customers that their budget offers to give you basic, simple services at a fair and reasonable price. About 60% of the decision in the price-sensitive segment is just governed by the price. So it's an affordability question or a deal-seeking behavior, it's not actually about all of -- all the features and all the add-ons and all benefits.</p><p>In mobiles, when you look at that graph on the left, you can see that we're very under-indexed. We actually have only 160,000 mobile customers today within our base. Clearly, there's a massive imbalance between the portion of the business that we have in fixed and the portion that we have in mobiles, and that represents a fantastic opportunity for us to really grow. And so what -- we've looked at how relevant our brands are in the mobile segment, and the surprising thing is we have 66% awareness among mobile customers just as we do in fixed for Dodo. And we have high awareness, over 40%, in iPrimus for mobile as we do in fixed. So it does translate really well. And we have an opportunity to use attractive MVNO 5-year agreement with Optus, which also has an upgrade path to 5G which is quite unique to us, and an opportunity around fixed wireless to really capitalize on the opportunity in mobiles, which, as you can see, is more than 60% of the available market to us. So we can address that by focusing more on mobile than we have in fixed and translate some of that share.</p><p>And so our ambition in mobile is that we think we can triple our services and operation over the next 3 years across all 3 brands, all 3 brands offering mobile. We already do that in some pretty smart ways in Commander. So today, because we have a new brand and relaunched with \"faster, faster\" in Commander, we make sure that as soon as we ship a broadband modem, it's got a SIM card in the back and we can transfer the voice services, and our business customers will never miss a call. And so our mobile arrangement is already kicking in for our business customers even though it may take 2 weeks or more for NBN to complete the activation activity behind that. At least, we remain connected with our business customers right through.</p><p>Commander is another big opportunity. As I mentioned earlier, it's unique in the sense that it's a totally small business-focused brand. Less than 20 seats is the optimal size of business customer. It comes from a heritage of PABX phone systems but is broadened out into connectivity and IP voice and other forms of business connectivity in apps and services. It's got high awareness, 36%. And when I say high awareness, I can reflect on how long it took the previous organization that I established to get to 30% awareness. It hadn't got there by the time I left. And that was after spending tens of millions of dollars in marketing.</p><p>So Commander is already in a good position. It does need to reorientate the conversation around sales. In its particular segment, less than 20% of customers have actually moved across. It does reflect where NBN is at. So less than 20% have moved to NBN. That's a good opportunity for a sales conversation for us. And for us to hit our 10% share ambition in Commander, we can focus more on the 5 to 19 employees and our low penetration in energy as well as in mobile. And so we'll be increasingly looking to disrupt the segment by having bundles in the future to bring energy to small business in the form of electricity where we can sell electricity as well as mobile services and fixed connectivity where possible.</p><p>It's a very important segment. There's 2 million businesses in Australia, they all will want to be connected at some point. And of those, there's a lot of starts and stops every year. About 300,000 new businesses come to the market every year. 240,000 exit the market every year. We're not present in the mobile part of that market nearly enough, which is about 30% of the segment, and we clearly said that is a big opportunity for the Commander brand.</p><p>I just want to talk about energy and bundling. For us -- the energy business, to me, was a bit of a surprise. When I first came to Vocus, I had thought Vocus is traditionally looked at as a telco. And yet, when you look at the nearly 25% of revenue in the consumer part of the business that is selling energy and you look at how effective that part of the business is, there are some very interesting insights. And it's absolutely unique for us to have a business where you've got, I think it's about 130,000, customers for energy today and a quite good attachment rate potentially and an improved tenure of customer that attaches to energy.</p><p>So what this chart says really is, once we have a broadband entry point in the home, we can expand that entry point to energy as well as mobile. You could take 2 products, that's 68%; 3 products, so mobile and energy -- or mobile plus electricity or gas as 92%. So really, broadband is the real logical entry point. It's what we do in New Zealand as well. And if we can do that, we can increase tenure by 10 months, up to 10 months. So 10 months is very important for us. When you think about our average tenure for NBN, it's a very new book. So our average tenure is probably at 20 months. For ADSL, it's a much older book. It's more like about 30, 35 months. You can see there's a great opportunity if you can add 10 months' tenure to that customer lifetime in terms of the profitability of that particular customer and the recruitment of the cost to connect and acquire the customer.</p><p>We found that our brand awareness is very high in Dodo for energy, so it's actually double other retail energy challenges. So companies like Powershop or Click or Lumo or Sumo, it's quite a spectrum of companies retailing energy. They don't have anywhere near the 40% awareness that Dodo has in its power and gas business.</p><p>A great opportunity because only 10% of our current telco customers are taking energy offerings from us, so we have 90% opportunity to cross-sell. It's actually been managed quite independently until recently. More recently, we've started to bring those teams together, and we're now selling energy and mobile and broadband together in one sales conversation. And that's helped us a great deal in getting attention around our energy business and reflecting in our business. In New Zealand where we got over 20% attach rates on a broadband sales conversation plus the eventual evolution to a single bill, which bills the customer for all of its utilities as well as telco and mobile in one go. We're not there yet, but one of the outcomes of our systems improvement and simplification will be we do get to that single-bill situation.</p><p>Finally, the regulatory changes like the transparency around price and removal of discounts actually favor a small challenger like Dodo and Commander in the energy space because we'll be seeing higher levels of customer awareness around the actual prices paid for energy and a greater propensity to switch. And given that we target switches, we expect to see that play in our favor ultimately as that rolls out. That just started on 1st of July.</p><p>Commander, very under-penetrated in energy. We do get double, at least double, the ARPU from a business customer when they take electricity from us than we do from a residential customer. It's something that there's a lot of interest in. At this point, we haven't had our dealers sell energy. But we will be having our Commander partners and dealers, that's 29 different locations around Australia, be able to sell energy where energy is able to be sold. Obviously, it's a local proposition because of the energy wholesale and retail arrangements varying across different states and suppliers. But definitely, it's something that we see great potential in, and it's something that we only have about 5,000 customers in today for Commander, and so a great potential for us.</p><p>So it's been a rapid rise for the retail business. I just want to touch on some of our building blocks and achievements as we've gained momentum during the course of the last financial year just completed. The Dodo brand was relaunched really commensurate with my arrival. In addition to large increases in brand awareness and consideration, we've also seen a real reduction in rejectors, and there's still a great deal of recognition of the Dodo bird and the position of Dodo in the market. It's a trusted brand in the budget sector of the market. Because rejectors have gone down, I think the friendliness and the willingness to deal with service issues has also been recognized in the market. And you'll see some of that with our reduction in ombudsman complaints, which I'll touch on in a moment.</p><p>The next milestone, I think, was the Optus MVNO agreement. I think that's a game changer for the retail business. We have to reorientate the business to mobile both to deal with the headwinds but also because mobile is where all the growth is in Australia in the next 5 years as 5G really gains traction.</p><p>We also launched the MyDodo service portal. That's very important to us. We actually have had a 50% increase since launching that portal of service requests coming through online. And compared to the period before this, 25% of customers could resolve their issues online without having a call, now it's 40% of customers resolving their issues online when they do visit our site. So that actually removes some of our call volumes quite dramatically.</p><p>We've reintroduced the consumer business base management focus, which is looking at individual customer plans, profit rationalizing what our offers are and understanding how they can migrate to NBN most seamlessly for them and for us in February this year. And follow-up that in March with what has really helped our energy business, the bundle and save campaign, the first time we've done that, where customers get a discount on their Internet if they also take an energy type. If they take 2 energy types, gas and electricity, they get a $10 discount; for 1 energy type, they'll get a $5 discount. That has helped, as I said, return the energy business within Dodo to growth in the last quarter of this year.</p><p>We put in our price increases for out-of-contract customers in April and refreshed our plans. That was aligned to changes in NBN's pricing to us as well where more customers got a 25 speed rather than a 12-over-1 speed at the outset. And so today, we're offering 25 as our default speed with $70 unlimited price point for a 50 plan.</p><p>Rebuilding our energy team. We recruited the ex-COO of Momentum into our team at the start of May. That's one of the many changes I've made to the retail leadership team. At this point, it's not just renewal of the whole executive team. Our retail team comprises people with less than 2 years' tenure apart from 1 individual. So I've replaced 8 positions in the course of the last 12 months with people that are able to grow the business and turn it around and have come from a variety of challenger backgrounds like Momentum Energy but also Optus people, Telstra people, Belong people, those that have come from different positions across the market and understand what it takes to win in the retail space.</p><p>Coming up will be some new mobile offers and further digital improvements. That encapsulates our consumer agenda. We will continue with our 2 brands and our multi-brand strategy. In our business sector, a lot of things happened in February around our brand relaunch, including the refreshed mobile and bundle offers for NBN and connectivity, and that helped us reduce the number and variety of plans that we have in market. This is very important. I go by the mantra that choice is the enemy of simplicity. And that's very important in a business that has too much choice and therefore too much cost associated with all those choices and too many clicks, too many buttons to push. If we can rationalize our plans and simplify our choices, then we find that, there's a win for customers and a win for ourselves. So it's been very important introducing that into Commander and also rolling that forward into our consumer brands.</p><p>We also made it possible in February for customers to do more than look at brochureware and explore online by relaunching the Commander website onto our modern architecture, which allows more editing, but actually lets the customer go straight through with an order. And so straight-through ordering is a feature of what we can do in our business in retail. In particular, across all the activation steps for broadband orders, we now have more than 60% straight-through ordering across our business. We have very high levels of automation through to the NBN back end where possible.</p><p>And we also did the brand relaunch and our back to basics campaign to increase our Commander, visit our website attention. I think it's reflected in our distribution by -- prior to the relaunch of Commander, we had dealers, who we now call partners, across Australia that become quite detached from our business. But recently, I attended Toowoomba for our -- Toowoomba, our new store launch. The dealers are coinvesting with us, around 29 points in Australia, and Toowoomba is very instructive. Because it's a regional hub in Australia, which is growing faster than a lot of other areas, and that's -- and others have pulled out of that marketplace. So we've been very fortunate to encourage dealers to invest along with us as we move forward with the Commander model. And we've also recently put in an offshore sales team so that our current customers can be supported offshore with extra moves, adds, changes in new services in addition to our dealers and our onshore team. Finally, we'll be bringing some new bundles and simplified plans to the market shortly.</p><p>The 3 points across the bottom, which I'll finish with, are actually very key. In year, we've already reduced our offshore head count 20%, building on previous productivity initiatives and continuing to focus our team. And a lot of this relates to our rollout of digital capabilities, not just things that you can do on a website but actually things behind the website. So the fact that our activation team doesn't pass the phone back to our front-of-house team but either deals with it directly or get to the missing piece of information directly from a customer really adds a lot of efficiencies into that part of our service. The fact that we cross-sell energy and telephony and have trained our teams to do that brings a lot of efficiency to our sales teams. So our offshore head count reduction should continue as we move forward and become more and more digital.</p><p>We've had a big improvement with both our energy and telco ombudsman complaints. So we have 2 ombudsmen to deal with. A 15% reduction in complaints per 10,000 services does reflect how our team have become much better at dealing with service issues across the patch, and I expect that, that will also continue. It's absolutely key to us that we give a good experience to our customers as they move through migration or take on new services or deal with the fact that they just want the lights to go on and the broadband to work at their house. It shouldn't be that hard. It's quite a simple business when you come right down to it.</p><p>And finally, as a result of our reorganization, we've made significant gains in our onshore workforce through better alignment of our marketing activity, our spend and our planning and activities related to our marketing intelligence databases and one-to-one teams as well as combining our digital and technology teams within one retail work unit under me. And so we're seeing, post the formation of retail, we continue to make great strides in getting our SG&amp;A under control, so we can manage some of those headwinds. And we can expect all this to continue in the next 12 months, 24 months and 3 years when we return the business to growth.</p><p>I'm going to hand over to Trent Boult to talk about New Zealand. Thank you.</p><p>MARK CALLANDER: Well, our lunch menu must have been good given the crowd's still here from New Zealand, so it's a good start. All right. So what I want to cover off is a bit of a deeper insight in terms of the New Zealand business for you. The New Zealand business has been described as boringly good. Hopefully, I can convince you that it's not only boringly good but it's got some good growth potential as well. And I'll dive into a bit of that.</p><p>You can see from the slides behind me, we have had a long consistent performance from the New Zealand business at both the top line and the bottom line. I would highlight that this perception, it comes quite easy, but it isn't as easy as it looks. We're like a duck on a pond. We're feverishly pedaling underneath. I've got a great team that's culturally aligned with what the DNA of the Challenger business should be. We're very, very focused on what moves the needle. And we have the ability to move and pivot on a dime based on what happens within a year. So while it looks beautiful and it's like a nice linear line there, there's quite a bit of effort that goes on behind the scenes.</p><p>I'd also highlight that 3 of these periods that you can see here, we've actually also been through quite a bit of our own disruption through M&amp;A activity. So we've obviously had the merge with Vocus. We've had a couple of attempts to sell our business. So we have had a pretty disruptive time. So I think it's a credit to the team that runs the New Zealand business that we've been able to maintain stable growth rate through that period.</p><p>In terms of context for the market, so the New Zealand telco market's about $5.4 billion, okay, broadly split: a $3 billion consumer, a $2 billion business. The energy market, which we've entered in the last 18 months or so, is about a $6 billion market. From our perspective, there's a few things I'd like to highlight from a market perspective. Firstly, we've got a proper fiber network, so we've actually built fiber to the home. That's reflected again in a lot of our data consumption that you see. So for example, the average data consumption for our consumer base in New Zealand is about 400 to 500 gig a month, all right? That's about twice the industry average where it sits at about 200 gig.</p><p>No New Zealand presentation is complete without mentioning the Rugby World Cup. So in terms of the data that has intensified in the market, we do have adoption of streaming services, and Spark has retained their rights to actually stream the Rugby World Cup this year. So again, it's a good illustration of kind of the switching tides in terms of the data intensifying in New Zealand, the adoption of data and fiber. It's only a shame they didn't win the rights to the Cricket World Cup against Australia, but a buffering would have been quite appropriate. But we managed to give that.</p><p>The other point I'd mention, the swing that I'm seeing in the market from a New Zealand perspective is the last-mile quality of the data is improving, and data usage is going up. Ownership of the network is really, really critical. So there's an infrastructure advantage to players over resellers in the New Zealand market. And so it's Spark, Vodafone and ourselves that actually have a core interfiber backhaul. Prior to getting that backhaul asset, as -- running this company, one of the most challenging things from my perspective was trying to keep up with the demand and the cost of delivering data to end consumers. That asset has taken that pain away from our business. So now we are very much focused on network performance, all right, and offering unlimited plans. We don't actually offer any capped plans in the New Zealand market. So it's a good illustration in terms of the difference between the context of the market we operate in and the data intensity and why that aligns really good with our assets we own.</p><p>In terms of market share, again, our consumer business sits at about 13% market share. We've had aspirations to go higher than that. We are very, very focused on UFB in the fiber market. So our core focus is not playing in the lower value end of town but is actually playing in the higher end of town where there's a more discerning customer that has high network demands. In the enterprise and government market, our share is lower. But again, our network infrastructure is really critical in that market. We sit at about 5% revenue share of that total market.</p><p>At a market level, over the last probably year or so, the market structure from a rational pricing perspective has changed. So proof points of that is we've been putting up prices in the market, and the market's been responding. So everyone's putting up their prices. There is still an element of discounting and giveaways to entice customers upfront. But as we've seen the increase of UFB in uptake of fiber, we've seen the switching pool shrink quite considerably. So we've seen an interesting dynamic change in the market. So essentially, 1/3 of the switching market has disappeared because the quality of the fiber networks is not driving a change in terms of that consumer behavior.</p><p>As a result of that, we've seen increased lifetime value of customer. Our churn's improving. And obviously, with services that we're bundling through like energy, we have seen a much more enhanced lifetime value of customer. But it's really critical from our perspective. For getting the increased lifetime value of customer, we can afford to throw more at acquiring customers in the market. And Antony has mentioned it. We did enter the energy market about 18 months ago. We have a phenomenal proposition where we have a broadband-led strategy, and we typically attach north of 20% of customers taking energy through 0 marketing, all right, so we have a very much digital-first campaign.</p><p>A few points to make here. I've talked a lot about the network and why the network is so important. I'd like to say the network has enabled me to sleep at night in the last couple of years, which is great. The main difference between the Australian market and the New Zealand market is we have the same inter-capital network but we don't have metro fiber networks. So essentially, we lease those for local fiber companies. So that's the predominant difference between the 2 of them. However, there is still significant demand in terms of getting traffic up and down the country. So we invest quite significantly in caching to deliver content. We're actually pushing that caching right out to the edge, all right? So if I went back 3 or 4 years ago, we would cache in Auckland. Now we're pushing out to Hamilton and Christchurch and further down the country. And this can become more and more critical as we have user-generated content, and the likes of the Rugby World Cup is going to be critical.</p><p>We do have 100% UFB coverage. That's really important not only from a nationwide go-to-market perspective for our consumer brands but it's also really important in terms of a wholesale perspective. So we're a key wholesale enabler of a lot of new entrants into the market that we either expand their reach or we offer a full white-labeled offering that they can promote to their existing customer base. And I'm going to talk a little bit more about the wholesale market and some of the new entrants we've seen coming in, which is an interesting dynamic.</p><p>We talk a lot around our ability to grow. So I'll talk about harvesting the network. We have a network that has capacity. Again, we are subscale. I often talk about the assets we own which we shouldn't own given the market share we have, so a very, very similar story to what we have in Australia. So we have a very low incremental cost of additional capacity on the fiber network. And a really good example of that again, the Rugby World Cup that's coming up. We've had lots of wholesale customers come to us because they're having to build capacity for peak demand to stream the Rugby World Cup. We have an ability to roll it at a very low CapEx level. That's enabling a lot of these smaller players in the market to be able to deliver on experience that their end users wouldn't be able to do without using our network assets.</p><p>Disciplined investment in CapEx. Again, we run a very tight ship in terms of managing our CapEx. We redeploy equipment, and we push it out to the edge as we grow. So we'll push core out to a pop and then push a pop out to an exchange. So as we continue to grow, we'll redeploy those assets throughout our network, which enables us to keep a relatively light CapEx model in the business.</p><p>And lastly, we talk about -- Antony talks about things that seemed to be amazing like a single bill and bundling energy, which, to us, is just pretty normal. But that's largely driven by an in-house team. So we've got a highly capable in-house team that supports all our systems, and we build everything in-house. And there are some pretty good proof points on that when we pitch this as an energy company. For example, we actually deployed and operated all these systems within our own environment within 4 months, all right? We do it on a basis that can be reusable. So we did it for Slingshot, one of our brands, originally. We then deployed that same technology and capability into our Orcon business, which took 2 weeks, all right? So when we build something in our environment, we build it on the same stack for multiple brands. So we've taken a multiservice provider approach to all our development. So if you dive into the Orcon and Slingshot business, you've essentially got a purple business and a red business that all sits on the same stack, right? So that's how we're able we deploy things as quickly as we do.</p><p>All right. So in terms of our markets, we plan -- again, useful context, we are a smaller version of the Australian business, all right? So we compete in the consumer market. We have a dual-brand strategy that we take into that market, Slingshot and Orcon. Slingshot is our mass-market, mum-dad-and-2-kids brand. Orcon is our pioneer brand, high digital leadership, more aggressive users. We have some of our largest customers in Orcon, residential customers paying $99 a month using 10 terabyte a month, all right? So that's a slightly different model we have to the NBN scenario we have here.</p><p>We have a broadband-led strategy in consumer, all right? So we don't sell energy as a stand-alone product. We always lead with broadband first. We do that because we're a telecommunications company, not an energy company, but we do see the significant benefits in owning the household and share of wallet in that household.</p><p>I've already mentioned, all our brands sit on the same platforms, so that enables us to rapidly deploy new features, products across the brands that we choose to deploy. It doesn't mean we always do. So if we want Orcon, for example, to have a new feature and charge a premium for it, we may not release that to the Slingshot business, but it's -- the option is there for us.</p><p>And lastly, digital leadership. So we are a digital-led business. We've taken over the last 18 months about 150 heeds out of our business while we're growing. That's been through process automation and self-service. So we have north of 50% of all our new customers signing up online. We have a similar stat for customers self-serving. So we are very much a digital-first environment. We achieve this through numerous ways. We sit IT people in the contact center. So when they can see contact center staff doing dumb things, they can figure out how to automate it, so it comes back to that challenger DNA and how we run that business to get cost out of it constantly.</p><p>In terms of the business segment, again, we plan all segments. So we have small business, medium business, Enterprise and Government. So from a medium enterprise perspective, we largely compete under the Vocus brand. Again, we offer a full range of services across fixed and mobile. Very similar to the Australian business, we dominate in fixed and we choose market segments where fixed enables us to compete more. We have a very lukewarm mobile offering in New Zealand, which we're trying to work through.</p><p>We are the only carrier-grade alternative, so if you're out there and you're a customer of any reasonable size that you need network capability, you have the incumbents or you have us. So again, it comes back to the fact we have assets that we shouldn't have given the share we have in the market, which puts us uniquely positioned to grow more share in the market. And we do have very, very longstanding partnerships, so that's across the top end of town. So some of the key players such as Datacom and IBM. We partner where we need to as we go up the stack to win.</p><p>We have this great little business called 2talk. So 2talk is a hosted voice and IP business. It targets the mid-market and essentially has around 350 to 400 resellers throughout the country. Again, it's a 0 touch model. It's about less than 20 people in this business. It is a highly profitable business that leverages digital capability and has nationwide distribution to succeed. All right. So that's, again, a very key part of the business.</p><p>In terms of the upper end of towns, so when we started to move up the stack, we are -- we have been an indirect partner to the TaaS panel through a relationship with Dimension Data. End of last year, we did get appointed to that panel directly. So we are now a direct supplier relationship to TaaS, and we've built all the product capability and compliance to start competing in that space. That was completed at the end of last year, so we are still in the ramp-up phase in terms of trying to sell that solution.</p><p>As part of our plan for building those products, we also decided that we wanted to diversify that capability and have more of a presence in the enterprise space. So a key part of our growth strategy moving forward is investing more in that mid-market sales environment, so we can go to market and win more effectively.</p><p>And probably one of the -- again, not biased to the Australian wholesale, but I do love wholesale businesses. The market is changing quite a bit in the New Zealand context in that there are a lot of new entrants coming into the market across media, energy. Anyone with a large customer base are looking to get into the broadband space. That's been fueled by a few things. I suspect -- a player like Trustpower has come to the market and done very well getting into broadband. You've got players like Contact Energy in there now doing it. You got players like us go into energy as well. So there's quite a bit of disruption happening across some of these key market verticals.</p><p>From our perspective, we're a very, very motivated wholesaler, all right? So we sit in the market, if you take the consumer context with 13% market share, if I can enable somebody to come into the market and they won 100 customers, I'm only going to lose 13%, and I'm going to gain the balance, right? So for me, that's about harvesting the network and getting the best returns out of that network asset.</p><p>I did go into a bit more detail in terms of the sort of services we offer across our Wholesale portfolio. But it is a very strong and big part of our growing business. To that extent, in the last 12 months, we've also procured our own IRU capacity on Southern Cross and Hawaiki from Auckland to Sydney, which again is another step for us to use that from a self-consumption perspective. And again, we need diversity because we deal a lot with enterprise, government Trans-Tasman business. And outside of that, it is also creating capacity for us to wholesale and have good relationships there as well.</p><p>Key stat there at the bottom. Again, our mass-market Consumer business is about 55%. The balance across Enterprise, Government and Wholesale is about 45%. It's a really important stat and the way I describe it, our balance is really, really important in telco. So from a New Zealand perspective, I can build a network peak from our Consumer business, but I built the resiliency and reliability into the network from our Enterprise and Government customers. If I didn't have both of those sets, that would both be quite challenged businesses. So from -- again from a network investment perspective, we get good payback across both segments.</p><p>We are very, very focused on what moves the needle. So again, we get very obsessed with productivity. So again, I measure productivity per employee. I share that with all my staff. To succeed in the market, while we lead on price and performance and service, we have to make sure that at a cost base level, we are at least matching, if not bettering, our peers in the market, all right. So making sure we focus on what moves the needle, and there's been a great quote from Antony, which I'm trying to repeat, but we limit choice as much as we can, and we have ruthless prioritization, all right. We have to do that because there's a lot of things we can do. We are very focused on what we think is going to move the needle.</p><p>In terms of the 6 main things that we're looking at from a New Zealand perspective, firstly, increased bundling. So again, bundling has been very, very successful for us. We've been very surprised about how easy the energy market is. Luckily, when your lights go out in your home, you walk to the front street and check that everyone's lights are out and you get back in. You don't call anyone. Not quite the same when your broadband router goes down. So the bundling strategy for us is really important. We are going to continue to do it and push it more aggressively across energy and mobile in the consumer context, but we're also going to be pushing that in these small and medium business market context as well. And I've mentioned the big benefits behind doing that.</p><p>Continuing to grow share in UFB. So again, we've stopped trying to chase SIO growth for the sake of SIO growth because we've picked a market where we think we can differentiate, and where we can win and we can actually grow ARPUs and margins in our business. So a good example of that is we used to have a brand called Flip, which played in the low end of town. We've actually grandfathered that brand. We are very, very focused on the UFB market segment and more importantly in the higher value plans, so the 100-meg plans and the 1-gig plans. We actually hold 23% market share on 1 gig plans, for example.</p><p>Why do we do that? Because we've got a network asset that we can sweep. We've got customers that can have unlimited data usage. We have very simplified plans, but most importantly, the smaller players, and when our headcount compete against them, all right. So we are very, very targeted in terms of where we see our growth coming from under our consumer brands' perspective.</p><p>Government, again, we've just embarked on this journey. Government procurement cycles -- our government procurement cycles, so we have a team focused on selling that. We have a Wellington office, and we are very, very deep in terms of TaaS and how we're going to succeed in the TaaS market. But as I've mentioned, more importantly for us is how do we take that TaaS product capability and move it into markets where we think we've got a better right to play, which is that mid-market and the enterprise market.</p><p>Harvest the network. So again, we take a very, very motivated view of how we can sweep this asset. So any capacity I can get onto that network either through disruption under my own brands or disruption through other people's brands or bringing more people into the market that can go into my network, I'm very, very focused on that. And we can see the benefits of that coming through, through our business now.</p><p>New market segments. So again, our Enterprise segment is very, very similar to the Australian market where the incumbents at the top end are looking after the customers that they feel are important, and we think it's the great unloved that sit amongst the balance, which is we are focused, we'll play in one. We'll go into some detractor stats shortly. But the level of satisfaction amongst that mid-market in New Zealand and that lower end of enterprise, there is not a lot of love going to those customers. They're typically unmanaged, and we have a very, very similar strategy to enter in the team here and that we think we can come in and own that segment of the market.</p><p>And lastly of reduce cost to serve. So again, automation process improvements, more efficient use of staff, self-serve, we're very, very focused on this. We have to, and it's been a key part to our success in terms of our ability to grow and to maintain earnings, but this is a very, very focused part of the business that the entire company embraces, all right. So it's not forced. It's just part of the DNA in that they can see a small way of doing things, but we'll do it. We've never had to lower staff. It just happens with natural attrition. So bulk of the staff that we achieved through our automation typically come out through our customer operations' environments across the consumer and business segments. So it's a key focus for us.</p><p>So slightly deeper dive in terms of consumer. Don't panic. It's only a page on each that will stand between you and lunch and Q&amp;A. Few things to call out here. So UFB has gone incredibly well. So there's 50% of all homes connected on UFB now. The government is actually committed to rolling out UFB to 90% of all homes, so a very committed program from the government. Fixed Wireless access has come in, but it hasn't had much success. So I think Spark reports around 160-odd thousand customers, totally low-end users that have tried to get off. If you want a strong network performance or if you want to watch the Rugby World Cup, you've got to be on a fiber network, all right. And so we're very focused in that space.</p><p>As I mentioned, 1.4 million homes passed now with UFB and the program's due to complete in 2021. So we're going to have a very good line of sight. We've recently announced an attempt to unbundle the fiber network as well, so we announced a partnership with Vodafone. We're one of the largest unbundles of the copper network in New Zealand. So we've announced the partnership with Vodafone to attempt to unbundle the fiber network in New Zealand. We're facing a few challenges with that at a moment with the local fiber companies which is no big surprise to us. So we'll keep fighting that good fight for several years and see where it ends up.</p><p>In terms of the strategy itself for consumer, dual brand strategy obviously, price competitive but without compromising on service or network quality. So again, if I went back 5 years, we would be perceived as the price leader. I don't think we're a price leader. We're very, very competitive, but we differentiate based on network performance and service.</p><p>Broadband-led with compelling reasons to bundle. We're actually out with a campaign at a moment, which is giving away mobile free for 12 months. So the relative what it seems like a lot of value, if you compare that to some of the offers in the market, it's actually a fairly modest offer.</p><p>And I'd like to say we do have a goal to connect 1 in 4 homes on UFB. So our aspiration as a business is to get 25% market share. That's been our aspiration for about 4 years, so I think we're getting closer. It's part of strategy.</p><p>I already made the point, but you can see these industry stats here, so 71% of customers on a no cap plan. And like I say, from our perspective, we don't offer caps at all. In fact, we don't even offer the entry-level broadband plan. Our minimum plan you can get with us is 100 meg, all right. So we don't even plan the low and entry-level plans at 30 meg at some markets. We've just consciously chosen not to chase because we don't see there's enough money in it.</p><p>Business market. So again, this is probably a high-growth market for us. Again, the consumer business is tough. You know some of the challenges we face here, they're fiercely competitive and people seem to chase and throw a lot of money to try and acquire customers in that space. The bigger growth opportunity for us from a revenue and earnings perspective is certainly the business market. Key things to call out here is, essentially, we're seeing very, very high adoptions of cloud, and we're finding when customers move to the cloud, network performance and lack of network performance has been flagged as a major issue, all right. So the 50% of customers that move to the cloud made a point to network-related issues, which impacts our ability to use and consume our services, all right.</p><p>Why is that good for us? That moment there, it creates a shopping opportunity, all right. So we talk about generational opportunity for the adoption of UFB, the move to cloud. Network's not living up to the performance they need to, so they're having conversations, all right. And then players like Vocus are prepared to do things differently right through the value stack.</p><p>I talked about the unloved. So the step there, so the NPS for that mid-market enterprise is negative 1 NPS. So for those of you that understand NPS, that's pretty poor. We see a big opportunity to go into those customers that are not receiving the service they need, not getting the dedicated support they need and us being able to go on and follow a pretty credible gap in that market.</p><p>If you look at these segments in the bottom there, the key thing I've called out there is, at the end of day, we are a fixed operator and we specialize in fixed. All right. We see good growth in mobile. But fixed is where we plan to win well.</p><p>So you can see in the Enterprise and ICT market and the Corporate and Government market, the fixed size of the market is significantly more than mobile. Also the procurement cycles in those spaces as well, you typically don't have mobile and fixed bundling. All right. So we have the 2 big segments that we go after because we got a network that can differentiate to add value, all right.</p><p>As you come down into the mid-market space, we still compete there, but you can see the mobile portion and the mobile category is much higher. And typically, you've got fixed and mobile bundling occurring, all right. So we currently are not in a strong position from a mobile perspective. What we see is an opportunity. That is why we intently focus on the categories in the sequence where there is a higher portion of fixed spend because that's where we can add the most value and differentiate.</p><p>And lastly, we've actually made the conscious decision to move our small end of business into Orcon. So Orcon, our head of legacy, been a small business brand many years ago. Why are we doing that? We believe it has to go to a low cost operating model. The small business, sub-5% market is largely a consumerist product, product for customer. They need a low cost operating model. They need to engage digitally. They need to get all the benefits that we've built in that consumer business across on our business platform. So we are in the process of actively migrating those.</p><p>In terms of how we're going to achieve some of this growth, the single-biggest lever we're pulling is increased investment in our sales force. So throughout the next 12 to 18 months, we actually already started. And we have increased the size of our direct and indirect sales force to go after the mid-market in New Zealand, all right. That's the single biggest lever we're pulling. We've got the product capability. We have the network capability. We have the solutions, the network engineering, all right. Now is the time to invest in the sales engine to go after the growth opportunity in that market.</p><p>And lastly wholesale. So again, the wholesale market is broadly split into 3 categories in terms of how we look at it. The new entrant category is probably the strongest growth category we've seen at the moment. The amount of conversations and engagements we're having from players that are either looking to get into telco or looking to somehow take over components of that in terms of their offering to their existing customer base has increased significantly in the last 12 months. And like I say, I think it's a new market dynamic that is starting to happen in the New Zealand market, and I think it'll continue. You've also had very interesting things where you've had Z for example acquired Flick Energy (sic) [Flick Electric] recently. So you've had an energy company -- sorry, petroleum company buy an energy business -- energy retailing business. So there's lots of really interesting dynamics starting to happen in that market, which are going to create some unique opportunities. Obviously, we also play in terms of SIs and MSPs. We're obviously a key enabler of those under the wholesale benefit as well.</p><p>Service provider. So again, there's not many Tier 2, Tier 3 players that we do not provide services to. So some of the large Tier 2s that are quite successful in the market through providing backhaul capacity to them. As I've mentioned, that asset is a requirement. The bigger that gets, the diversities required. The smaller they are, that's the capacity they require. Typically, we're pretty innovative in terms of the solutions we come to market with, how we price them. We have models that can grow, so we might bring us -- come in as a white label. And as we get capacity and build network, we'll evolve our wholesale models with them. So we take a very, very flexible approach to make sure that we enable them at the start, and then we will take them on a journey to keep winning.</p><p>And then, obviously, the carrier markets. The carrier markets are pretty straightforward. We will all buy off each other. We have voice interconnection. We -- again, in terms of a national backhaul perspective, we actually buy diversity off them for our own purpose to make sure that we've got resiliency through the network.</p><p>So the wholesale strategy is clearly enhancing the product suite. We actually have a core product there, the single-biggest thing that we're looking to do is the software enablement. So software is eating networks. There's a lot of over-the-top players that are coming into the market in New Zealand and in Australia that are essentially taking our great assets that we've got on the ground and putting software over the top of consumerism, all right. So we're in a unique position that we own that network asset. We have to get better at the software layer and enablement layer to deal with our customers. So our single-biggest investment in a wholesale space is going to be at the software enablement layer.</p><p>Any other points? That's probably the main point in the wholesale stuff. That's basically where we're focusing on our investment.</p><p>Growth. All right, we don't hear about this in New Zealand much, Kevin tells me. I'm not sure. So there is actually a few platforms for growth in New Zealand. It's what my Australian comrades say all the time. Firstly, I've gone on the first one at length, so I won't go into it much more. But the Enterprise market is a market we have a right to play in, and it is unloved. So we're going to forge quite strongly into that space.</p><p>Mobile growth, all right. So we have actually gone out to market and tested the mobile market in New Zealand and put all of our mobile business up for RSP. There's been a few regulatory review processes that will happen at the moment. And there are views that market is competitive, so we are going to test that theory and we've gone out to market for mobile. The key for us is getting the mobile part of it as a kin to support growth in all market segments, all right, so that's across consumer business, enterprise and even potentially wholesale.</p><p>We have really deep strong relationships that we think can penetrate mobile right through our entire customer base. And our launch of Orcon small business, as I've mentioned, we're in the process of migrating our customers that are sitting at Vocus end of town into Orcon and we have now launched Orcon small business into the market. So that happened a couple of months ago. So again, leveraging simplified plans, digital platforms, energy, mobile and UFB bundling. So we think that, that brand will start to penetrate quite strongly in that space there. And I do think there are market share gains to be had in the consumer space. So I think we are very, very well positioned to get to our 1 in 4 target. We'll do that for a combination of continued market share growth under our consumer brands and also the enablement of wholesale customers. And so we believe 25% share is a realistic strategy that we can achieve across both our retail and wholesale brands.</p><p>We've talked about energy a little bit, but we do energy in mobile bundling very, very well. And when I say that, we don't spend a cent of marketing on it, all right. So we always have a broadband-led sale across all that segments and everything else is an attachment.</p><p>Somebody took my last slide off. Trying to cut me short on this, right? And back over to Kevin.</p><p>KEVIN STEVEN RUSSELL: Thanks. Okay. So almost to the end. So thanks, it's been a long morning. That's the first time Mark Callander has ever presented without getting cut short which is -- of course, New Zealand always is cut short because it's always -- to be honest, always on target. It's always working well.</p><p>Just some key takeaways and then we'll go into Q&amp;A. This is a 3-year turnaround. I mean I said to Bob before I took the job, this is now my fourth startup of turnaround. It's not the biggest. It's a long way off the biggest. Every single one has been the same. You get more foundational work to do than you think. It takes longer to move. And if you do that stuff well, it moves quicker 2 or 3 years down the track. Vocus will be exactly the same. So I'm not going to take the shortcuts. I'm not going to just go for the quick wins and build a shaky foundation and sell and that was on their own. We're going to build it properly. We're going to do the foundational stuff and then we're going to fly. And 3 years' time, turnaround in 3 years to me means every part of the business is growing and Vocus networks is flying. Vocus networks is leading. So I'm very, very clear as to what a 3-year turnaround looks like and how strong we have to be when we come into 2022.</p><p>Team and plan in place. We've done a lot of foundational work on team. You have seen a bit of that today, but actually, greatest respect to what was on stage today. There's a lot more done within the business that has been changed out, and so a lot of quality done within the organization just know as well elevating quality that was there already and given that the opportunity to perform the way it can or they can. We just need to execute now. It's not a case of presenting a PowerPoint, and we just need to -- the next 2 years, we just need to execute and we need to deliver, and we need to demonstrate the proof points.</p><p>The core business is Vocus Networks. That's where the value is. That's where the discretion in dollars will go. That's where we will really focus on specializing and win in the marketplace. And then at this point of the presentation that Ellie gave is really important. The simplification -- modernization and simplification of technology. We're not talking much of the market opportunity just now, but the market opportunity is real. If we get the right platform in place from a technology standpoint, the financial prize is strong. For us to be able to take our infrastructure and operational cost down at the same time as our revenue is growing, that is awesome operational leverage. I don't know how many CEOs stand up and say they're taking cost out and then when they present the results, you don't see it because the other costs have gone up. And it's blended out to a higher number. We're not saying that. We're saying the costs are going to go down.</p><p>Retail diversification is key. I guess an interesting point to reflect on is Mark has built an absolutely outstanding business in New Zealand, but a lot of what Mark has done, those opportunities were available to us in Australia 4 or 5 years ago. We may not have led or taken the right brave decisions 4 or 5 years ago. Antony has taken them now. Antony's quality, he's an outstanding retail executive, but there's a certain style of leader you have to have for these resale businesses when you're dealing with tight margins. So both Mark and Antony, they're all over the detail. They sweat every single asset. It's not glamorous. You got to work at it. Antony knows that. Mark knows that as well.</p><p>Retail target, turnaround in the second half financial year '21, growth into '22, and New Zealand business is a cracking business. You just look at what Mark's presented and it's all just rock solid. It's an interesting time in New Zealand. There's consolidation in the marketplace. People joking as to where we go next. Mark's business is very well positioned. The way I look at the retail in New Zealand businesses, certainly New Zealand, I like to stay out of the way. I can only actually get in the way. Mark knows what he's doing. And retail, similar logic. Antony knows what he's doing. The focus for myself is Vocus Networks.</p><p>So that's a pretty detailed 3-hour update. Hopefully, it's helpful. As I say, going all the way back to the introductory comments. Too much noise around this organization. For us, we know what we're doing. We know where we're going, but it's been important for us to share where we're going. And Mark talks about it boringly good. I'd like to think as a team, we're boringly consistent, and we're just going to come back and back and back and talk to the same plan for the next 2 or 3 years.</p><p>So with that, I'll ask -- I mean, it's a small stage but I'll ask actually anyone who has presented to go up as well. Mark, can you come up on stage, and we'll do Q&amp;A. I think there's a couple of hundred people online as well, Bill. Okay, so we'll do questions in the room first.</p><p>BILL FRITH;INVESTOR RELATIONS: Yes.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>KANE HANNAN, RESEARCH ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Kane Hannan from Goldman Sachs. Just a couple from me. Just on that '20 guidance. You obviously have -- sorry. It's Kane Hannan from Goldman Sachs. Just on the '20 guidance. Obviously, I understand there's a few moving parts going on. But can you just talk a bit more about that implied slowdown from the $190 million you're guiding to in the second half of this year. And that's why the earnings are going to be skewed again next half -- next year from a half-to-half basis. And then just on the Enterprise growth, so you're guiding to that to accelerate again in '21, following the growth in '20. Could you just talk a little bit more around the execution risk of those projections? And if you do achieve that sort of growth, what sort of market share gains you're expecting to achieve there relative to that target of doubling enterprise market share?</p><p>MARK CALLANDER: Yes, we are guiding to a stronger second half again. I think the first half is probably going to be weaker than our second half that we've had this financial year and that's all really in the retail business. Part of it's seasonal around the energy business, and part of that is actually because we're a bit more conservative as well. But we've changed the way that we sort of account for the energy business. We're very conservative. We sort of set Antony a wholesale price and build up a buffer during the course of the first half to account for any sort of hot-weather events in January, February, which we've had pretty much every year since I've been here. So there's an element of that. But also, he's got a -- a large amount of his marketing spend is in the first half. So it's predominantly in the retail business. The declines that we sort of set out as well around the legacy voice and the migration to NBN is in that $20 million to $30 million that we sort of set out as far as the decline. It's probably 2/3 of that happening in the first half, whereas the growth in the Enterprise business is probably -- is 1/4 or 1/3 in the first half versus as they build momentum into the second half.</p><p>KEVIN STEVEN RUSSELL: Sorry, Kane, what was the second question?</p><p>KANE HANNAN: Just around the Enterprise growth forecast and how you're thinking about the $20 million to $30 million -- the step-up in '21 to more than $20 million to $30 million, and how that reconciles with your market share targets need side of it?</p><p>MARK CALLANDER: Yes. I mean you asked the question of risk. Whilst the market opportunity is there, the risk is always to encourage the customer to move from where they are today. So whilst I generally find I suppose, given these organizations in Australia can generally whinge and moan about where they are and be conservative not to move, it's our job to convince them there's optionality. So typically in enterprise, you could be starting conversation now, establishing that they've got a contract for another 12 or 18 months, engage in a process, execute contract that is probably another 3 months to actually realize the revenue. So it's really a fazing issue of my ambition against taking the market share. At the same time, it's executing on the product rollout that I've mentioned to make us more relevant in the existing customers and sell more products to them. So it's really just a matter of timing of acquiring the customers and then rolling networks out and executing them. And once you get a customer that's typically 2 to 3 years minimum in revenue generation, so it's that sort of selling, delivering and buildup of revenue. At the same time, the growth also predicates that we do an exceptional job, which we're now starting to do in our second half of this year of slowing down churn. So making ourselves more relevant to existing customers that they don't leave Vocus and go somewhere else. So that kind of slowing down of churn because you've got a better coverage model across the customer base and you bring in the relevance, and sort of slow the churn, so you get the platform, win in market and then you see that revenue kind of takeoff.</p><p>KEVIN STEVEN RUSSELL: I'll just add, we're not -- it's not a standing start, all right? So we actually have momentum today. So it's not like we're waiting for something to happen. We've got a line of sight to what's happening in the business.</p><p>MARK CALLANDER: And then we've had an exceptionally strong second half and sales momentum just finished, right? So you'll see that revenue realize as well as it delivers. And the only other risk, I don't really see a risk but as you -- whenever you do a transformation in your network, which is what Ellie is doing, we still have to maintain the capacity to service customers and deliver at the pace that we deliver today. We assume certain time frames to deliver services, and they can't be compromised. So that's pretty much about it -- okay?</p><p>ELLIE SWEENEY: I think you probably add in there is the commentary around the channel, which quite frankly today, is pretty well nonexistent for the Vocus team and a fantastic opportunity for not only in enterprise but also in wholesale.</p><p>FRASER MCLEISH, HEAD OF AUSTRALIAN MEDIA, ONLINE AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND TELCO &amp; MEDIA ANALYST, MST MARQUEE: Fraser Mcleish from MST Marquee. Just 3 for me. Just first on sort of price competition, particularly from Telstra, I mean they're actually reporting their sort of data networks or IPVPN revenues going backwards despite more services, which suggests they're cutting prices more aggressively. Is that what you're seeing in the market? That will be my first one. Second one, can you just talk about Optus MVNO a few times. I'm particularly interested in how you can use that for wireless bypass. I mean are they going to give you a wholesale product to bypass the NBN and what's the economics of that look like compared to the NBN? And then just finally, on CapEx, you've obviously bumped up the CapEx and guidance for next year. I mean is that signaling we've got a higher sort of capital intensity in this business sort of going forward slightly further out.</p><p>ANDREW WILDBLOOD: Okay. I'll take the first one on data and IP, revenues and how Telstra may respond. Telstra, when you've got a dominant position and typically they're in the 50% to 60% market share. So very dominant. They've been hit by NBN first, because as NBN comes in and sort of disrupts, then they're having to replace their existing fiber revenues or copper revenues on to NBN services. So they will see a dropoff there. Everyone is attacking them. We're only one of a number of partners who are winning in the market against them. So that sort of explains that. And pricing, yes, they will respond, and they have responded. They're constantly having to adjust because of what NBN is doing. So NBN's release of its recent Ethernet pricing which has only just come out, I'm sure they'll respond, they'll have to because their customers as they come off contract to go into Ether, sort of say, will actually do something when they leave or they're going to suffer the consequences of more churn. So I think they will, but they are a slow machine to respond, and so you've always got a window in which you can execute against. So that's what we're incredibly focused on.</p><p>When I -- just anecdotally, it's not really anecdotally, it's actually real. When I responded to RFP to the recent one, if someone had been on a legacy contract with one of the incumbents, and we respond, we can be up to 45% lower than what they're currently paying, so they've been locked in something for 3 years. So you imagine if you've got that revenue and you have to respond, you might not have to go all the way to where someone like Vocus goes because you might have other services, but that's a big drop of its only renewing. So it's -- they've got the problem of the legacy-based install that's attacking by competitors plus the NBN issue. That's the reason why you see them decline.</p><p>KEVIN STEVEN RUSSELL: Fixed wireless, I'll discuss this with Optus on 3 stages, MVNO, then let's look at fixed wireless and let's look at what we can do from a backhaul standpoint. MVNO done, a very good relationship, very good arrangements for Vocus to support Antony's growth. Fixed wireless, different arrangement and that's something we will talk about not next month, but progressively in the second half of this year as and when Optus is ready to push 5G in the fixed wireless. I think it's a big opportunity in fixed wireless. When I say short mobile, I mean, mobile. I don't really see the generational benefits of 5G in mobile in a competitive marketplace. I absolutely see the benefits of 5G in an environment where the broadband service is questionable both in terms of quality and price. And if we can access the service at a war price than NBN at a quality better than NBN, that would be really, really interesting to us. The beauty, we've been very transparent. We will -- we are very happy to subjectly share our customer base with Optus and say, we've got that customer in that location using that amount, do you want them and we'll pay you x amount less. That's how it would work as and when we get to the place where Optus has that service. I think 5G is very interesting for fixed wireless. On CapEx, Mark?</p><p>MARK WRATTEN, CFO, VOCUS GROUP LIMITED: Yes, on CapEx, we obviously are going to the high-level next year because of the investment in the future state and IRUs. FY '21 will actually probably be another $15 million or $20 million. You saw on Ellie's slide that the future state program goes from $15 million to $30 million. So that's a big chunk there. But we also do have a high level of IRU spend planned in FY '21 to build out that network that Mark spoke about. And then, you'll see it coming down into FY '22 and then in '23, '24 should get back to levels that we've seen in FY '19, so the $160 million to $170 million.</p><p>KEVIN STEVEN RUSSELL: I think it's Eric.</p><p>ERIC CHOI, DIRECTOR AND AUSTRALIAN TELCO AND MEDIA LEAD ANALYST, UBS INVESTMENT BANK, RESEARCH DIVISION: Eric Choi from UBS. I just had 3 questions as well, maybe I'll have one by one. First one, maybe for Andrew. I just get the feeling, Kevin doesn't want to create a rod for his own back. But I think at the beginning of the presentation, Kevin was confident that you guys can still hit your 480 LTI. And then if I look at your FY '22 targets, growing into probably sort of 30% to 40%, that doesn't get me to 480. So I guess, the question is how much of this government upside? How much of this North West Cable upside? How much of this Optus 5G backhaul upside is baked into your vision? And if I asked you, Andrew, to rank the most material out of those, how would you rank them?</p><p>ANDREW WILDBLOOD: Yes, the North West -- I mean, who knows what happens in share prices, well, grow frankly. But I understand your calculations, so I get the logic, but all I can -- all we can do is execute against the opportunity right and the North West is an opportunity. But the reality is that the revenue streams are not North West, won't even equate in the timeframe we're talking about because by the time you construct it and build, this can be 12 months to do so, getting permissions to build. Your revenue streams are kind of kicking in, in some cases, in the oil and gas opportunity in '22, '23, '24 long time after an LTI has sort of happened or not happened. That would be on the North West. What was the other question, sorry?</p><p>ERIC CHOI: And there was Optus 5G backhaul and then obviously all the government...</p><p>ANDREW WILDBLOOD: Yes, do you want to take the 5G?</p><p>KEVIN STEVEN RUSSELL: Yes, 5G backhaul, let's see what happens over the next 12, 24 months. NBN, fixed wireless backhaul is another opportunity. I'll just say one thing on share price, which is -- and I think this is -- this comes back to if we're scratching the head all but with EQT coming in. These are 3 separate businesses, and we are going to get very clear around them, but in separate businesses and where the profitability lies in those separate businesses. I think, as that happens, there will be an increasing understanding of the profitability and value of the different businesses and that's obviously real in terms of how we think about optionality going forward. But certainly, for people looking at the business and services, how I look at it is that infrastructure business, I think, is undervalued personally. So that's a separate issue from when programs kick in.</p><p>ANDREW WILDBLOOD: Yes, I mean, we didn't -- and Kevin did a good job of putting that, that is -- there's other things we're working on. We'll not certainly disclose that as well. So there's plenty of options for us.</p><p>ERIC CHOI: That was actually my next question. I'm trying to get a better look for -- into those crown jewels if you like. So maybe for Mark, that $180 million of group OpEx and that $200 million of CapEx, can you help us break that in to the network services versus the retail businesses?</p><p>MARK WRATTEN: Yes, we'll at the end of August, Eric.</p><p>ERIC CHOI: Okay. Maybe 1 last one for me. Just on the outlook, again. EBITDA flat FY '20 versus FY '19. Just trying to get a sense of how much of that is sort of Andrew putting in his key sales guys, big investing in new products and then does that normalize in FY '21? Because obviously, Kevin, you said nominally, you expect OpEx to step down at some point?</p><p>KEVIN STEVEN RUSSELL: Yes, so I think it is unquestionably a nominal of investment and capability during the course of, I would say, even the last few months that kicks in, in financial year '20. I expect the improvements in terms of some of the efficiency to come through as well in service delivery later next year into financial year '21 as well. So those investments that we have a full year of cost for before they actually kick in to revenue. But the main softness in financial year '20 comes from retail. And we've been very measured around when we see the operational efficiencies coming through, when we see the growth kicking in, in terms of networks.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: I think you've already done this for network services, but Antony, can you give us a long-term picture of where your cost base is going in 2 to 3 years' time?</p><p>ANTONY DE JONG: Yes, so I look at cost in a unitized way. And for me, it's important that we have the change in the technology that allows us to be multitenant and cloud-based, and we're a low capital consumption retail top business model is very different once we have capital intensive and ownership economics applying as we're doing network services. And when you look it, our costs are expected to reduce over the next 3 to 5 years as we get that technology centralized and modularized for our different brands. And our unit economics, I mean, I would like to say that in the low-teens to even less than $10 per month. So you can actually work out the unit profitability to add to that level. When Mark finishes his work, we'll be more clear on that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Okay. Great. And also another question for Andrew. Just out of interest, can you talk about the difference between the enterprise and the government and why your market shares are so different between those 2 markets? Is there a legacy issue? Or is there something else?</p><p>ANDREW WILDBLOOD: No, I mean, we've got higher than average market share in federal government, and that's a legacy of next-gen contracts with secure long-term builds for certain parts of government and federal. That sort of makes it more kind of 11%, 12% in contested areas, but equally, in state governments, we've done very well historically in South Australia, Northern Territory in Western Australia, but we've not done so well in Victoria, Queensland and New South Wales. And that's where there's big opportunities for us to do more. And nationally, around the country, again, it's sort of -- a lot of it is to do historically so the Amcom opposition in the West means that in the West, we have sort of more like 11%, 12% market share. So a higher market share percentage in the West than we've had with our businesses on the East Coast, and that's a bit where we're very focused as well in terms of winning, which we're now seeing more in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland. So we've had some nice wins in the last quarter, which are good-sized customers in those markets. So I think some of it is historic and some of it really has been focused and now it's about purposely going after the areas where we think we can make a difference. So that's probably explains why you see variances.</p><p>KEVIN STEVEN RUSSELL: The 3 businesses are in very different stages. I mean, Wholesale, Andrew alluded to, Mark alluded to, there's been a pretty solid wholesale capability that includes product within Vocus, therefore Wholesale is in a solid place today. Government is next-gen, and there is actually a small government team, and that's pretty good. All that's really needed is the support from the business more on the product standpoint. Enterprise has not been our focus for the organization historically. And that may have come back to quality of executives required on that and quality of investment that needs to be put into product to realize it. It is a heck of an opportunity for us in the next 3, 4, 5 years.</p><p>ENTCHO RAYKOVSKI, RESEARCH ANALYST, CR\u00e9DIT SUISSE AG, RESEARCH DIVISION: Entcho Raykovski, Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. A couple from me. The first one, if we look at Slide 16, and that $9.6 billion opportunity you've spoken about. Just interested in your thoughts as to whether you view the whole thing as an addressable opportunity given you've spoken about not wanting to be a managed services provider and part of that presumably would be linked to the provision of our services? And then, how you view that market going forward? Do you expect that to be under pressure given that there is clearly pricing pressure within the industry? So do you expect to see continued growth? I guess, that's the first question. And the second one a little bit more specific around the guidance into FY '20, the cash conversion of 90% to 95%. Does that include any prepayments related to ASC? I'm just conscious that you got I think it was $26 million in the first half or whether you say that is being an underlying number?</p><p>ANDREW WILDBLOOD: I'll take the first one. So the first one, $9.6 billion is our best estimate based on market analysis and we stripped out things we don't really compete in like mobility and levels of managed service. Do I see growth in data and IP? I see the usage of data and IP going up, but price pressures and what NBN is doing means that, that sort of the dominant incumbents they may see that decline, which is what your point was there. But again, when you're only playing in 4% of the market, then your opportunity even in a declining market is to take market share and grow. We're not -- I talked about managed services, I mean, I don't want to go and build the network application services business that kind of manages loads of people who are doing conversions from workloads into the cloud, I'll go in part with the people who can do that and I'll pull through the network. And that's the bit that are most interesting because that's where the most marginalized for me typically services margins are a lot less, can be a lot less on top of a network than leading with services. And you also add a significant amount of cost into your business, which is not what we want to do. I would achieve any of that opportunity through the strategic partners that I'm partnering with and we're in a market I'd want to just leave good advanced conversations on building up the capability to compete in those areas. What I am saying and this is just again, anecdotal, but it's actually real is that a lot of the long-term big outsourced contracts that companies were in, whether we're into whole of business procurement and now not being considered that way, and we're seeing a lot of tenders come to the market where our companies are breaking it down and saying, I'll discreetly buy mobile and I'll discretely buy data and I'll discreetly buy voice in towers, rather than the whole of business solution. I think companies are seeing that whole of business hasn't yielded the necessarily the benefits that they would have had before on scale. And because many parts of the value chain are now commoditized, you know that you can go and get or you're getting mobile for $40. I know I could get that even if I didn't have my data with that company. That's where I also believe there's this opportunity because people are seeing that the data network becomes the absolute foundation of that business, and they're putting more focus on specialist providers who can really get the data element right because the other elements might be easy to change and that will be more commoditized. That would be my response to that. Does that help you?</p><p>ENTCHO RAYKOVSKI: And on the cash conversion for next year, it's clean. So it doesn't include any assumptions around upfront cash payments or cash receipts, sorry?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: So one of the things that you raised when you presented your FY '18 results -- actually a couple of things. But one of the things was around good infrastructure, but underutilized, and good relationships with government -- very good relationships with government, but also underutilized. How do you tangibly measure the progress or success in relation to those opportunities, as in now? And where do you see how much more can be done on that front?</p><p>KEVIN STEVEN RUSSELL: So tangibly measured part, I mean, ultimately, tangible measurement comes with hard dollars and contracts and increase in revenue. The -- I mean, the insights both Bob and myself have had in Canberra have been exceptional in terms of people we have spoken to wanting us to do more than we are today. We have line of sight for that maybe in financially with some of the discussions we're having. That's 12 to 24 months off until you see it tangibly, but I would probably suggest that we've got enough insight to have made substantial investments and to secure capability during the course of this year that will come into market in September, October that demonstrates a level of confidence. Government is a big opportunity for us. The numbers that were up in -- up earlier in terms of the addressable market and our share, we see significant upside based off the ultimate conversations we're having and the request for support that we're getting. There is a lot of big relationships to build off. And Andrew would say it, I think Mark would say it as well and Bob would say it, is that we have put the government team almost in the cupboard and forgotten about them. It's almost -- it's like taking people out of the way and finding that you've got a whole series of gems, that takes a bit of time to come through. But it feels like that's just known. So tangibly, let's see what the actual contracts comes through.</p><p>ANDREW WILDBLOOD: The second -- yes, there was a second question on network, which is Ellie's measuring network utilization. So your statement was, I think, that we've got an underutilized network. Ellie, do you want to comment on...</p><p>ELLIE SWEENEY: I mean, that's really easy one. There is just a measurement of utilization across running the inter capital network, which is broken down by, I think, up to 15 routes. So we measure that on a daily, monthly basis on what that utilization looks like.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: And are you seeing progress? Is that better than where it was 12 months ago?</p><p>ELLIE SWEENEY: Look, we're seeing some progress and I think that -- so the counter of that is obviously around the network economics. So that's owning that network and therefore, how you go to market, how you price and how do you then determine the third-party usage as well, whether that's a Telstra tail, our own tail or whether it's an NBN tail as well. So I think from our perspective -- the other thing I would say, when we spoke about things like software-defined networking, one of the things you do need to be able to spin up and spin down and whether that's into capital, whether that's data center is actually that capacity. Now the nice thing for us we are in a position where we actually have capacity. So without investing a lot from a capital perspective, that capacity exists today, which is really quite positive for us, and I think it goes very well to the total cost of ownership network economics.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: And one more question, and this is probably perhaps retail-oriented. It relates to the issue that you called out, again, when you presented your FY '18 results and it was around integration issues really. So the progress relating to that, there was an opportunity to resolve a number of things that haven't quite integrated as well as you would have liked through the numerous acquisitions that have happened in the past. So where is that at? And how do you measure success, I guess, on that front as well?</p><p>ANTONY DE JONG: So that's probably a two end, one, where there's obviously a network and systems, future state piece that Ellie presented today. There is also the evolution of the digital and technology team within the retail business now, which is peeled across into the retail business. That is now 1 team. We are progressively working through both simplification of brands, simplification of products and simplification of systems. And that is why it's a big turnaround within retail. But that's what drives the cost out ultimately when we get to the cloud-based single BSS stack. So in terms of progress with that, that's where that was commenced, funded in FY '20 to continue some of the planned consolidations already occurred as I mentioned around Commander and it is also happening in retail. And part of that also includes the brand simplification. We have 3 or 4 grandfathered brands with customers that we need to put on the right platforms and on to our current product spec today and that's all happening in the next 12 to 18 months.</p><p>KEVIN STEVEN RUSSELL: Yes, I'd be blunt in terms of say, when I looked at the results in August, I would say we hadn't dealt with legacy, the bulk of the integration challenge of the legacy. I appreciate there's being complexity too. We worked through the plans progressively over the last 6 months, I think by April, May, I think, we've been very clear as to what we now need to do in legacy and those plans are underway. So that includes Ellie's presentation as well as what Antony's got underway.</p><p>I might go on to the questions that are online, Eric?</p><p>BILL FRITH;INVESTOR RELATIONS: Thanks, Kevin. And thanks, everyone, who's listened on the webcast. You stuck with us for a few hours, so thanks very much. And there has been a bunch of questions come through, many of which I think have been answered by the discussion so far but there is just a few that I think are interesting. So one here is, Kevin, can you explain how the incentive arrangements work and are coordinated? Are they based on EBITDA or return on capital? And then following on from that, given the bulk of the value is in the fiber network, how is responsibility for generated return on this divided between the team? And how does that impact on those incentive arrangements?</p><p>KEVIN STEVEN RUSSELL: So the incentive arrangement is really simple. It was -- and certainly coming in and I wanted it to be really simple, which is the individuals on stage and some other individuals in the company, particularly individuals on the stage, Amber And AJ, have a basic salary and then, share options are a 3-year share options. So they were issued primarily in August of last year. There is 3 years before those options can vest. So another 2 years from August, most -- whatever is that, 26 months and for those options to vest, at a minimum, the share price needs to have increased by 50% from when the team joined. So on average, that may be from 240 share price up to 360 share price and for 100% of the options to vest needs to go to 480. It is no more complicated than that. The access to those options, 50% is available in 26 months' time and that's 25%, 25%, year 4 and year 5 from a retention standpoint. It is not influenced by any individual performance in any particular business units. It is really, really simple. It's a fabulously effective tool from 2 points of view. One, simple to explain and attractive for those who buy into the value creation opportunity in the business. Therefore, we've been able to build a team quickly that is a very good strong team that's focused on shareholder value. And 2, bluntly, it means that the ability to say the core value creation opportunity is Vocus Networks and that's where discretionary capital goes. It is not a political discussion, it's a value discussion. So if Antony wants an incremental $2 million but that actually can be leveraged better in Vocus Networks, it goes into Vocus Networks in the same remarks. So the LTI structure is really effective in terms of being brutal our own what dollars drive the best return. Does that answer it?</p><p>BILL FRITH;INVESTOR RELATIONS: I believe so. And this actually a fairly simple question but it's come up a few times in that the guidance on dividends has been or has been no guidance on dividends. Can we give any guidance on dividends?</p><p>ANTONY DE JONG: Yes, there will be no dividends this financial year. Obviously, a part of our -- I think we set it out that we have to as part of our current syndicated facility arrangements, we need to get to a certain leveraged position for 2 consecutive reporting periods before we can consider dividends, but given the capital that we've got planned for the next few years, although I'll be deleveraging, I won't get to that point. So...</p><p>BILL FRITH;INVESTOR RELATIONS: One more. And again, this is something I thought we may have answered in the presentation, but it has come up again here in the Q&amp;A a number of times, just asking for comment on EQT and AGL and why they may have walked away?</p><p>KEVIN STEVEN RUSSELL: It's...</p><p>ANTONY DE JONG: No, he's the one that received the phone calls about declining, I think I'm not in a position to answer that. That's exactly the same answer that Kevin would give. When I receive a phone call like that saying we're not going to proceed, I don't try and change their mind. I mean, they're big boys, they know what they're doing. You just accept it and you move on. But if you look at my personal view looking back on it, I think they were very logical business model decisions from the point of view of highly leveraged company like EQT coming in and finding a slightly softer year 2 than what they probably envisaged, a high capital expenditure impacts internal rate of return, maybe didn't fit their model and they made that judgment and I respect that and they move on and we move on. On the other issue with AGL, that was an industry bar as we all know. I don't know -- I, in fact, was out of the country when that -- in the first week of due diligence went on, but I suspect there was a fair bit of shareholder interaction and again, the company makes a decision based on its own reasons and moves forward. There is nothing revealed untoward. There was super complimentary comments about the management teams. Both processes were very professionally and respectfully done. And as I said, once the decisions are made, you take them on board and you move on. So there is no mistake to it and trying to read mistake into it, my answer on that really, if you want to know that, go and ask EQT and go and ask AGL because I'm not going any deeper than that. So we're back on track. And as Kevin said, we're focused and we're going to achieve what we said we're going to achieve.</p><p>KEVIN STEVEN RUSSELL: I think one of the key points that Bob just said is there was actually execution risk to both EQT and AGL's own individual positions. And that's something that was never picked up, but unquestionably, EQT had its own individual challenges of PE firm in terms of how to finance an acquisition like this, which may well mean that the focus in the first couple of years is more prevalent and AGL had its own execution issues. So it's interesting how so much of the focus ended up on us. For us, it'd be really blunt noise, frustrating noise, but noise and what we've done today is just articulate where we're going and we're not going to cut corners. It is going to take time to build a business that flies in 2 years' time and some people like that, some people don't.</p><p>BILL FRITH;INVESTOR RELATIONS: Probably last one from the webcast. And again, it's a theme -- by making the retail and the New Zealand business units stand-alone, does that make them easy to sell? And is that a desirable outcome?</p><p>KEVIN STEVEN RUSSELL: It does make them easier to be understood, valued and operated and potentially realized. That's not the reason. I've been very blunt. The first thing I did when I came in was see I want this retail business not tied into the Vocus Networks business because what I could see and I have seen it so many times before is retail wanting to get some products to market and someone over here saying, well, that -- we can do that in 7, 8, 9, 10 months once we've got the dollar stuff done. At that point, you're dead. A resale business has to be lean and it has to be nimble, therefore, it has to be in charge of its own destiny. The reason that Mark has been so successful in building this business in New Zealand is because lots of it has been left alone and not been relying on the mothership. Retail needs to be set up exactly the same. So first and foremost, it's about: one, operating it better; two, then understand the valuation. When you said it stand-alone, Antony has got the right to push back on costs, like, Ellie can say I can do it more efficiently somewhere else and you start to get a business that actually has a proper efficient cost structure fell down into is absolutely optionality, yes, easier to realize, but that's absolutely not the intent or focus just now.</p><p>BILL FRITH;INVESTOR RELATIONS: That's it from me. Probably room -- time for one more in the room.</p><p>KEVIN STEVEN RUSSELL: You've one more?</p><p>ERIC CHOI: Just a follow-up on the enterprise. $20 million to $30 million of growth in FY '20. Just because there's so much noise around the Coral Sea Cable, Vodafone contracts washing out in ASC. Can you just help us dissect, I guess, how much those -- that feeds into the FY '20?</p><p>ANTONY DE JONG: Yes, do you want me to -- I'll answer that. So in terms of our FY '20 forecast, in terms of project type, contribution to EBITDA, it's going to be similar to FY '19. So we don't see any of that incremental $20 million to $30 million that we've guided to, Eric, being as a result of Coral Sea or other projects.</p><p>ERIC CHOI: And ASC?</p><p>ANTONY DE JONG: Now -- ASC is business as usual now. So ASC definitely will be contributing to that growth absolutely.</p><p>ERIC CHOI: And will there be any further Vodafone contract drags?</p><p>ANTONY DE JONG: I'll pass that on to somebody else.</p><p>KEVIN STEVEN RUSSELL: I mean the Vodafone contract drag has been solid and we'll go through in August, but unquestionably, that's been a solid hit for us this year and will drag into next year. So one of the interesting reflections from me going back to the last 12 months has been the time it takes to get the hands around the bits in the business. I think, we could have done a better job earlier of knowing the risks around that Vodafone contract, or those Vodafone arrangements. I think we've got a better view on that going into next year. So that definitely impacts next year. So I'll wrap up at that.</p><p>Again, I'm going to repeat the same comments. We are going to be boringly consistent. So hopefully, today it was helpful. It's -- we're very clear with where we're going. We've done a lot of work. Now we're going to do a lot of executing. So thank you very much for coming, and thank you very much for listening.

Vodafone Idea had posted Rs 4,881.9 crore loss in the corresponding quarter of preceding fiscal. While, for the fiscal ended March 31, the company has reported a net loss of Rs 73,878 crore, the highest ever by any Indian firm. Besides, Vodafone Idea's subscriber base declined to 291 million in the fourth quarter of the FY20 from 304 million in the previous October-December quarter, according to the TRAI data. Among all the three leading telecom operators, only Vodafone Idea lost subscribers.\"With an uncertain outlook, the stock may be highly volatile to media reports on regulatory/judicial outcomes. In such an environment, we place the stock under review until we get clarity on the company's business continuity,\" Motilal Oswal Financial Services said in its latest research report. </p><p>Vodafone Idea share price has rallied 62 per cent in the month of June from Rs 6.56 apiece to Rs 10.62. \"Vodafone Idea's ability to continue as a going concern is highly dependent on a positive outcome on AGR matter before the Supreme Court for the payment in instalments. Favourable Supreme Court ruling, improvement in ARPU, reduction in loss of market share and any major investment by a big tech investor will be the key triggers for upside in the stock,\" said Keshav Lahoti, Associate Equity Analyst, Angel Broking Ltd.</p><p>The Supreme Court has asked Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea (VIL) to pay upfront a reasonable amount of adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues, backed by securities and guarantees, to consider their plea for a staggered payment spread over 20 years. On the revenue front, Vodafone Idea has reported 6 per cent revenue growth at Rs 11,089 crore, on a sequential basis. Company's EBITDA grew by 28.1 per cent sequentially due to improvement in margins to 37.3 per cent in the quarter ended March 31, as compared to 30.8 per cent in the preceding quarter. \"Vodafone Idea's result was better than street estimates in terms of revenue, ARPU, EBITDA and EBITDA margins,\" said Keshav Lahoti. </p><p>As per the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), the total dues of Vodafone Idea stand at Rs 58,254 crore, of which so far it has paid only Rs 6,854 crore. \"VIL's fate is dependent on the AGR case resolution, as stated by the management. A positive outcome may provide a lease of life,\" said the brokerage firm adding that Vodafone Idea is losing competitive position in the telecom sector. </p><p>Last month foreign brokerage CLSA in its report, upgraded the Vodafone Idea stock to buy with a revised target price of Rs 12 on the back of the stock's favourable risk-reward ratio. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THFIEX-0053715976</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THFIEX2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6084-6TM1-DXMP-K2H6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365020</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"462\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Express, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Financial Express</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 1, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0001YPY</classCode><className>VODAFONE GROUP PLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009WSP</classCode><className>MOTILAL OSWAL FINANCIAL SERVICES LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009RQY</classCode><className>BHARTI AIRTEL LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS517312 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS (EXCEPT SATELLITE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS517311 WIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS523120 SECURITIES BROKERAGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS523110 INVESTMENT BANKING &amp;
