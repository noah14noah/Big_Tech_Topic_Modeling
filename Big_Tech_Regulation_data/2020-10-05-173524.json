The remainder of 21st Century Fox, which will concentrate on news and sports, will be spun off into another company dubbed New Fox.</p><p>The trigger for <person><nameText>Comcast's </nameText></person>bid was AT&amp;T's resounding court victory over the Department of Justice on Tuesday night, when a federal judge ruled that the telecoms company's blockbuster merger with Time Warner, the television and film company, could go ahead. <person><nameText>Comcast </nameText></person>believes that AT&amp;T's win will make it easier to get its deal with 21st Century Fox past the department's competition enforcers.</p><p>Traditional media companies are turning to mergers as they try to make up ground on the fast-growing video streaming services, such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, and digital advertisers, such as Google and Facebook. AT&amp;T's victory is likely to be a precursor to a spate of deals in the industry.</p><p>21st Century Fox, which is valued at nearly $80 billion, is an American media company. Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corp, owner of The Times, is co-chairman of 21st Century Fox with his son Lachlan. His other son, James, is chief executive of 21st Century Fox and chairman of Sky.</p><p>In a letter to the three executives, Brian Roberts, chief executive of <person><nameText>Comcast, </nameText></person>said that his company had \"long admired what the Murdoch family has built\" at 21st Century Fox and was \"convinced\" that the businesses it was selling to Disney would find the \"right strategic home\" at <person><nameText>Comcast.</nameText></person></p><p>Mr Roberts said the company was \"disappointed\" when 21st Century Fox decided to sell to Disney last year when <person><nameText>Comcast </nameText></person>had offered more. 21st Century Fox pointed to concerns that regulators could scupper such a deal.</p><p><person><nameText>Comcast </nameText></person>has offered to pay a $2.5 billion termination fee to 21st Century Fox if the deal is blocked, the same offered by Disney. <person><nameText>Comcast </nameText></person>also said that it would pay the $1.5 billion fee that 21st Century Fox would owe to Disney if it walks away from their deal.</p><p>21st Century Fox said last night that it would \"carefully review and consider the <person><nameText>Comcast </nameText></person>proposal\".</p><p>Shares in 21st Century Fox closed up 7.7 per cent at a record high of $43.66 in New York last night, with Disney shares rising by 1.9 per cent to $106.31 and those of <person><nameText>Comcast </nameText></person>shares closing down by 0.2 per cent at $32.32.</p><p>                     Ruling paves way for flurry of mega deals                     Wall Street's dealmakers had waited with bated breath for Tuesday's night's judgment in the court battle between AT&amp;T and the Department of Justice, so when Judge Richard Leon ruled decisively against the government, after a six-week trial, the champagne corks began popping (James Dean writes).</p><p>The ruling has paved the way for a flurry of monster deals to proceed in the media, telecoms and healthcare industries, and for new ones to be brokered. Nearly all have the same thing in common: they are do-or-die attempts to counter the power of Big Tech.</p><p>AT&amp;T's core business is content distribution and Time Warner's is content creation. The companies argue that a merger is necessary to help them to challenge Netflix, the $161 billion video streaming company that recently surpassed Walt Disney to become the world's most valuable entertainment business.</p><p>The same argument is proffered by Disney and <person><nameText>Comcast </nameText></person>as they vie for 21st Century Fox's entertainment assets. Traditional media companies are also being squeezed for advertising revenue by Google and Facebook, which dominate the digital world.</p><p>The AT&amp;T and Time Warner tie-up is a \"vertical\" merger, in that two distinct companies combine without removing a competitor from the market. A proposed marriage of CVS, the $70 billion pharmacy chain, and Aetna, the $62 billion health insurer, also fits this category and is now less likely to be challenged by the DoJ's competition division. Their companies' shares were up by 2.4 per cent and 3.6 per cent, respectively, yesterday morning.</p><p>Cigna, another health insurer, is seeking to buy Express Scripts, a pharmacy benefits manager, for $67 billion. Their shares were respectively down by 1.3 per cent and up by 3.8 per cent.</p><p>Amazon, the $825 billion ecommerce giant, hinted last year that it could start delivering pharmaceuticals by post, which is big business in the United States. In February Amazon said it was setting up a healthcare company to cut employee medical costs. Many believe that this is a precursor to a broader push into healthcare.</p><p>T-Mobile US's proposed $26 billion acquisition of Sprint is more likely to face scrutiny as it is a \"horizontal\" merger of competitors. T-Mobile US, valued at $48 billion, is the No 3 network and Sprint the No 4. It is the third time in four years that they have tried to merge. Their shares were up by 1.4 per cent yesterday.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-44727278</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SJJ-J2X1-JCJY-G3H4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"881\"/><timeReceived>12:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"06\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>June 14, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper; Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC0001PB0</classCode><className>COMCAST CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002LO7</classCode><className>WALT DISNEY CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002IHB</classCode><className>TWENTIETH CENTURY FOX FILM CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS517311 WIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

Each of them indulges a similar shtick: Tricking famous people into outrageous interviews in order to humiliate them,' suggested Reason Magazine[2].But it is not just the powerful. Cohen allegedly tricked an economically-troubled village in Romania, allegedly telling them they were being filmed in a documentary, when they were used as a comical fake village from which Cohen's 'Borat' character came. </p><p>'[T]he villagers of Glod in Romania, which doubled as Borat's village in Kazakhstan, went to the courts, unsuccessfully demanding $38m for being depicted as inbreeds, rapists, thieves and prostitutes,' The Telegraph[3] reported.Specifically naming \"Facebook, YouTube and Google, Twitter and others,\" Cohen declared in his Thursday speech that he believed 'it's time for a fundamental rethink of social media and how it spreads hate, conspiracies, and lies.\"He condemned Zuckerberg's recent speech[4] about the importance of free expression at Georgetown University, calling some of Zuckerberg's arguments, 'pardon my French, bullshit.''This is not about limiting anyone's free speech. This is about giving people, including some of the most reprehensible people on earth, the biggest platform in history to reach a third of the planet. Freedom of speech is not freedom of reach.'Cohen also quoted the First Amendment, that ''Congress shall make no law' abridging freedom of speech,' ignoring regulations already placed on internet communication and seemingly advocating for online censorship of ideals that with which he and those on the left disagree.Cohen blasted Zuckerberg's commitment to keeping Facebook as an open platform, and asked, 'If a neo-Nazi comes goose-stepping into a restaurant and starts threatening other customers and saying he wantsto kill Jews, would the owner of the restaurant, a private business, be required to serve him an elegant eight-course meal?'But as reported on before, who determines who or what counts as a Nazi? If you listen to some[5] in the mainstream liberal media, then that answer might just be President Donald Trump.He suggested Zuckerberg 'seemed to equate regulation of companies like his to the actions of 'the most repressive societies'' and was incredulous at the comparison.He condemned Big Tech CEOs as people who care 'more about boosting their share price than about protecting democracy.' He dubbed this alleged phenomenon as 'ideological imperialism' and lamented how 'six unelected individuals in Silicon Valley [are] imposing their vision on the rest of the world, unaccountable to any government and acting like they're above the reach of law.'Finally, Cohen blasted Zuckerberg for 'welcoming a 'diversity of ideas,'' suggesting that our elected officials should have a say in what goes online and further suggesting that 'groups like the ADL' should monitor social media to fact-check and purge lies and conspiracies from online platforms.Then Cohen himself gave an example of why his solution, in fact, presents a problem. 'On the internet, everything can appear equally legitimate' he complained later, citing how 'Breitbart resembles the BBC.' But which outlet is to be believed?

Each of them indulges a similar shtick: Tricking famous people into outrageous interviews in order to humiliate them,' suggested Reason Magazine[2].But it is not just the powerful. Cohen allegedly tricked an economically-troubled village in Romania, allegedly telling them they were being filmed in a documentary, when they were used as a comical fake village from which Cohen's 'Borat' character came. </p><p>'[T]he villagers of Glod in Romania, which doubled as Borat's village in Kazakhstan, went to the courts, unsuccessfully demanding $38m for being depicted as inbreeds, rapists, thieves and prostitutes,' The Telegraph[3] reported.Specifically naming \"Facebook, YouTube and Google, Twitter and others,\" Cohen declared in his Thursday speech that he believed 'it's time for a fundamental rethink of social media and how it spreads hate, conspiracies, and lies.\"He condemned Zuckerberg's recent speech[4] about the importance of free expression at Georgetown University, calling some of Zuckerberg's arguments, 'pardon my French, bullshit.''This is not about limiting anyone's free speech. This is about giving people, including some of the most reprehensible people on earth, the biggest platform in history to reach a third of the planet. Freedom of speech is not freedom of reach.'Cohen also quoted the First Amendment, that ''Congress shall make no law' abridging freedom of speech,' ignoring regulations already placed on internet communication and seemingly advocating for online censorship of ideals that with which he and those on the left disagree.Cohen blasted Zuckerberg's commitment to keeping Facebook as an open platform, and asked, 'If a neo-Nazi comes goose-stepping into a restaurant and starts threatening other customers and saying he wantsto kill Jews, would the owner of the restaurant, a private business, be required to serve him an elegant eight-course meal?'But as reported on before, who determines who or what counts as a Nazi? If you listen to some[5] in the mainstream liberal media, then that answer might just be President Donald Trump.He suggested Zuckerberg 'seemed to equate regulation of companies like his to the actions of 'the most repressive societies'' and was incredulous at the comparison.He condemned Big Tech CEOs as people who care 'more about boosting their share price than about protecting democracy.' He dubbed this alleged phenomenon as 'ideological imperialism' and lamented how 'six unelected individuals in Silicon Valley [are] imposing their vision on the rest of the world, unaccountable to any government and acting like they're above the reach of law.'Finally, Cohen blasted Zuckerberg for 'welcoming a 'diversity of ideas,'' suggesting that our elected officials should have a say in what goes online and further suggesting that 'groups like the ADL' should monitor social media to fact-check and purge lies and conspiracies from online platforms.Then Cohen himself gave an example of why his solution, in fact, presents a problem. 'On the internet, everything can appear equally legitimate' he complained later, citing how 'Breitbart resembles the BBC.' But which outlet is to be believed? Seemingly, Cohen prefers one and not the other. And this comparison comes after a recent decision by Facebook to include Breitbart in its human- curated 'News' tab[6] in an effort to represent all sides of political debate, provided they adhere to the platform's terms of service.

Good evening. Deep state strikes again, disgraced former James Comey, apparently will escape prosecution. The Justice Department Inspector General referred Comey for potential prosecution for leaking classified information. We take up the latest developments in that issue here tonight.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">President Trump continues to defend the United States against years of theft of trillions of American dollars, theft of American technology and intellectual property, and unfair trade, of course, by the Chinese. The president announcing additional tariffs to be levied on Chinese goods, those tariffs will be imposed beginning September 1st if the United States and the People's Republic of China fail to reach a trade deal by that date.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And the president just two hours ago acknowledged he is considering a blockade of Venezuela. You're looking now at pictures -- live pictures of Cincinnati, Ohio, where the president is only moments away from addressing his ardent supporters in Cincinnati, but we'll -- we'll expect the president to address amongst other things the Chinese failure to honor their agreements, the necessity of tariffs.</p><p>He will surely be scoring last night's Debate of 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls, and as always tickets to his rallies in high demand, only 18,000 seats available in this arena and the president telling me earlier today that more than 100,000 people had asked for tickets to this even tonight.</p><p>We'll bring you his remarks throughout this hour, as he expands on his administration's policy initiatives and news developments of the day. And yes, we suspect he may also take up a few political issues as well.</p><p>Breaking news tonight, according to Fox News sources, the Justice Department has decided not to prosecute former FBI Director James Comey for leaking classified information. This despite DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz who reported recommended a criminal referral for Comey.</p><p>The Hill's John Solomon reporting and writing that prosecutors found the IG's findings compelling, but they decided not bring charges because they apparently didn't believe they had enough evidence of Comey's intent to violate the law.</p><p>And President Trump today announced additional tariffs against China. Those tariffs will effective September 1st. President Trump threatened to impose 10 percent tariffs on the remaining $300 billion of Chinese goods exported into this country each year. These tariffs do not include the $250 billion of goods already under tariff at 25 percent. Radical Dem (ph) Senator Chuck Schumer, praising the president earlier today and aligning himself with the president on China. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. CHARLES SCHUMER, (D-NY): We have to be really tough on China. They've taken advantage of us. America has lost trillions of dollars and millions of jobs because China has not played fair. And being tough on China is the right way to be.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: And joining us live Byron, you are Chief Political Correspondent for the Washington Examiner, Fox Business Contributor. Byron, good to see you and did hear Chuck Schumer lineup with the president on any issue, is extraordinary and newsworthy, but on issue of trade with China it is important -- an important alliance.</p><p>BYRON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, WASHINGTON EXAMINER: Schumer has done this before and you're absolutely right. This is a really big deal on anything, any president, it's not a bad idea to have leader of the opposition in Senate on your side, it -- It bodes well.</p><p>But specifically on China where Trump apparently has the support -- he has the support of the farmers in the Midwest who are hurting by this, but they're saying we have been abused by China for so long, something has to be done.</p><p>And really when you look at the complexity of this issue, when you look at practices of China over many, many years, this was not going to be easy.</p><p>And so, that -- that the fact that it is moving on this stage, and there have been fits and starts, and unkept promises, all of that stuff I think it was completely to be expected, but Schumer thing very good for president who can claim bipartisan as he does this.</p><p>DOBBS: He can claim it, and in fact, it is very important in his negotiations with Xi Jinping because of -- lied (ph) with the Democratic Party and its leadership, the Chinese have to understand.</p><p>There will be -- there will be but one result and that will be the president's position, and he won't be second guessed or undercut by many of the very same opponents within the Democratic Party who had undercut him for the first two and a half years of his presidency.</p><p>YORK: That's -- that's a very important point you raised which is that the president and American negotiators can say to the Chinese, \"Look, this is not the president of United States out there all by his lonesome. The Democrats are on his side. The leader of the Senate Democrats is on his side with this.\"</p><p>So, if you're thinking about waiting Donald Trump out and it's all going to get better, you can go back to what you were doing before, not going to happen. You need to make a deal now.</p><p>DOBBS: And it comes as the president was, if you will, preparing the battleground, saying to the Chinese, that if you're going to wait (ph) me up, wait (ph) me up but I'm going to win 2020, and I'll be here waiting for you, and the deal will only get tougher and tougher.</p><p>So, the leverage is improving considerably. The president has plenty of it begin with, but now this is a marked improvement of the -- of the prospects.</p><p>I want to take up the -- the -- the issue of this rally tonight where the president is going to be, as he always does, talking policy, the initiatives that he is driving, and yes, the politics, of course, as well.</p><p>But now with so much going on whether it'd be Federal Reserve, the drive to cut interest rates, to deal with the -- the alliance that is, well, enlarging between Russia and China, and all that the president is contending within foreign policy, these are -- this is now the 2020 election writ large in a matter of just weeks.</p><p>YORK: Well, you know, Lou, you just listed a lot of really big and serious issues, but you know that a lot of the press coverage tonight about this, will be whether the crowd says, \"Send her back again,\" that is whether the -- the chant that we heard briefly --</p><p>DOBBS: Right.</p><p>YORK: -- at this rally in the North Carolina will appear, again, the president says, he does not want that to happen.</p><p>DOBBS: Right.</p><p>YORK: You know, there's another thing that's really just sitting in plain sight with this, which is the president is drawing really big crowds. As you -- you mentioned, this is an 18,000 --</p><p>DOBBS: Yeah.</p><p>YORK: -- seat arena. If -- if -- if Kamala Harris or -- or Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders were pulling crowds like this at this stage in a race, that would be a very, very big story, and this is, of course -- it was the biggest single indicator of the intensity of Donald Trump support throughout the 2015 and 2016 as the -- as the campaign went on.</p><p>DOBBS: Yeah.</p><p>YORK: And he appears to be just going out and doing the same thing, getting enormous crowds, again.</p><p>DOBBS: All right. Having the opportunity to talk with the president earlier today by -- by phone as I indicated, he's -- he -- he was very proud of the fact that so many people wanted those tickets and by my count that's about a 5 to 1 ratio which, you know, I mean, you've - you need a guitar really to make those kind of claims.</p><p>This president has done so from almost the very moment. He began his candidacy back in 2015. It is truly a phenomenon.</p><p>YORK: It's a very big deal to him, too. I mean, obviously when he was in television, the ratings were a very big thing, crowd size is -- is really, really important to him, and it's -- it has been a marker of his popularity, and, you know, it -- and it's a marker of everybody else's as well.</p><p>I was in South Carolina a few weeks ago, went to a Kamala Harris' rally. It was in the middle of day in Myrtle Beach. She got a thousand people there which is pretty good.</p><p>DOBBS: Yeah, not bad.</p><p>YORK: Lunchtime, people had other stuff to do, but they came to the Kamala Harris' rally, so a thousand, very good, but you're talking multiples of that coming to Trump rallies.</p><p>DOBBS: Trump rally and, as you say, multiples and we're going to be going to -- to the rally as soon as the president takes the stage. And Byron, if you will, can you stay with us to -- to take -- to take part in the festivities as we try to watch what is happening politically to this president and -- and the issues that he is going to take up.</p><p>Always good to have you with us and thanks for -- for being here.</p><p>YORK: Thank you, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: One of the things, we will certainly be taking up is the president's scoring of the debate last night. All of those Democratic hopefuls and their sudden attack on a president and it wasn't Donald Trump.</p><p>And we got more breaking news for you tonight North Korea has fired two more short range ballistic missiles into sea of Japan. It is the third weapons test in just over a week, the sixth since last year's summit with the president.</p><p>The North Koreans also firing short range ballistic missiles last Thursday. They tested a rocket launch on Wednesday. President Trump says, \"The situation with North Korea, very much under control.\"</p><p>Up next, the radical Dems use the -- the latest debate to attack one of their own and, of course, each other and boy, did they ever. Also tonight, thousands gathering for the President's rally and well, actually tens of thousands in Cincinnati, Ohio. Look at that crowd. We'll be looking at that crowd and the president, here next right after these quick messages. Stay with us.</p><p>DOBBS: Breaking news now, the United States preparing to withdraw thousands of our troops from Afghanistan in a deal with the Taliban. The United States would slash the number of troops from 14,000 to about 9,000 in exchange for concessions from the Taliban, which would include a ceasefire, a renunciation of Al Qaeda.</p><p>The Taliban would also be forced to negotiate a peace deal with Afghan government and, of course, this withdrawal is absolutely conditional on reaching that agreement with the Taliban.</p><p>We've been reporting to you that American workers in the middle class are under assault in the Senate right now. Major business lobbyists, the biggest in the country, and they are the biggest lobbyists of any kind in the country, the Koch brothers, the business roundtable, Chamber of Commerce and yes, combined with the Republican and Democratic leadership, they intend to make it easier to outsource American jobs to cheap foreign labor.</p><p>Absolutely, really (ph) a contravention of the president his policies and everything he has run on. Senate Bill 386, it's called, it would mean the doubling of H-1B visas and that India and China would take most of those visas to compete directly with our American workers.</p><p>But a handful of Republican senators are skeptical at least some will oppose it amongst those who are skeptical and we will soon learn whether they will oppose the legislation.</p><p>Senator Josh Hawley, he told Fox News Bret Baier, that the bill has yet to be discussed in committee and that he, at least has serious concerns about what it would do to America's workers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: There is a bill -- Senate Bill 386, the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act, there were reports that it may be taken up and discussed in judiciary, has it been?</p><p>SEN. JOSH HAWLEY, (R-MO): It has not been and if -- if it comes before judiciary, I'll certainly look at this closely.</p><p>BAIER: Some see this as a gift to big tech (ph), and like Indian H-1B visa workers.</p><p>HAWLEY: Yeah, I would be concerned about anything that is a gift to big tech (ph) and anything that would hurt American workers or drive down wages. I mean, one of the features of our broken immigration system is that it has helped keep wages flat in this country for too long, especially for workers, who are trying the hardest to get a raise.</p><p>We have got to reform legal immigration so that our workers kind of have a chance to move forward.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: Senator Josh Hawley, well, this gift to our biggest lobbyist and this attack on our middle class is sponsored by Senator Mike Lee, cosponsored by 19 other rhinos (ph). They include Mitt Romney, Rob Portman, Joni Ernst, all of them willing to sell out apparently American working men and women and their families.</p><p>There are two telling lines today from the left wing national media. Those lines suggest that recent debates didn't go too well for the radical Dems 2020 hopefuls. Take a look at this, one headline from today's \"Washington Post\" reads this quote, \"Facing Trump, Democrats turn on another president, Obama.\"</p><p>And the Washington Post, Dan Balz also writing in part, quote, \"The candidates have done as much as -- as much to make a case against one another as against the president without offering much in the way of an aspirational message or connecting directly with the voters they will need to win the presidential election.\"</p><p>Joining me now, former Reagan White House political director, Fox Business political analyst and Republican strategist, Ed Rollins. Ed, good to have you here.</p><p>ED ROLLINS, GREAT AMERICA PAC CHAIRMAN: Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS: The Democrats having a tough night of it.</p><p>ROLLINS: Well, they're going to have tough time because, obviously, though -- the processes with 20 candidates in there and several other elected officials, some are articulate about their positions and some like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren who aren't (ph) in that debate last night or the night before, really are very passionate about their socialist beliefs.</p><p>And they basically -- the establishment is sort of the -- the Biden camp, and I don't think and no one else I think, thinks Biden can survive, but he -- he certainly doing or being canned up --</p><p>DOBBS: Or whether they can or he can't he has a huge lead in every major poll.</p><p>ROLLINS: He has in any -- in a -- at a low bar last night to pass it, and I would say that he passed it. But the reality is he's only claiming (ph) the fame at this point in time as he was a duck and dodges 40-year record is -- I was -- I was chosen by Obama.</p><p>So, therefore, the idea the -- I got to be vice president and Obama vetted me with 10 lawyers is a good excuse why the Democrats should nominate him.</p><p>DOBBS: I would (ph) --</p><p>ROLLINS: Go ahead.</p><p>DOBBS: -- let's give our audience a sample of -- if by any chance you missed the extraordinary evening over on CNN. Biden was attacked by a lot of folks on the stage. I think nearly every one of them.</p><p>Let's take a sample (ph).</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. KAMALA HARRIS, (D-CA): In 2019, in America, for a Democrat to be running for president with a plan that does not cover everyone, I think is without excuse.</p><p>MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO, NEW YORK CITY, Mr. Vice President, you want to be president of United States, you need to be able to answer the tough questions, I guarantee if you're debating Donald Trump, he's not going to let you off the hook.</p><p>SEN. CORY BOOKER, (D-NJ): There are people right now, in prison for life for drug offenses, because you stood up and used that tough on crime phony rhetoric --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: And the -- and the parade went on, Ed.</p><p>ROLLINS: Well, it was -- this is much disarray in Democratic Party that I've seen since probably the -- when the -- when McGovern was the -- was the nominee back in `72.</p><p>You know, the reality here is they've got a long ways to go before they pick a nominee, and they have a different process than Republicans have -- Republicans have mostly winner take all primaries. They don't. You have to get 15 percent of the vote in order to get delegates.</p><p>So, you could draw this thing out for a period of time. It may narrow to five or six people, but those five or six people could fight all the way to the convention.</p><p>DOBBS: Right.</p><p>ROLLINS: And they're obviously on different -- different wavelengths than the vast majority of Americans.</p><p>DOBBS: This president has nearly everything going his way</p><p>ROLLINS: Absolutely.</p><p>DOBBS: The last several weeks - I mean, it's victory, after victory whether it's in a court, whether -- you name it on every -- every contested field, he is prevailing.</p><p>And then he has the Senate and Senate Bill 386, Mike Lee, 20 other rhinos (ph) that I mentioned going after American jobs and offering up more outsourcing to cheap foreign labor, it's outrageous what they're doing to the president.</p><p>His -- his motto, \"Buy American, hire American,\" and he is standing up for the forgotten man and women in this country, and they are attacking him.</p><p>ROLLINS: Well not only that. It totally distracts him. The issue here is the border security and trying to fix that before anything else. They want to basically fix this with a Chamber of Commerce and like Koch brothers and the --</p><p>DOBBS: They're -- they're sold-out to the people who won (ph) --</p><p>ROLLINS: -- and that -- there's no -- there's no question and it's the -- it's the Washington (ph) lobbyists and that's what have you and the reality here is if this bill passes which obviously with this all -- his cosponsors that Republican vote (ph) with the Democrats, it will match (ph) --</p><p>DOBBS: Well, Mitch McConnell, you know, the -- all this nonsense about him being an agent of Russia. He is an agent though. It turns out he's an agent of Walls Street, the Koch brothers, the Chamber of Commerce. This is outrageous, and he should be supporting the president in stopping this before it is an embarrassment to him, his party and the president.</p><p>ROLLINS: I totally agree and that -- and then all the controversy around the tech community, I mean, this is something that shouldn't happen quickly.</p><p>DOBBS: Unbelievable.</p><p>ROLLINS: We really ought to make this thing drawn out and -- and if they pass it, the president needs to veto it with -- as I said the other night and he ought to make that clear right or today.</p><p>DOBBS: Ed Rollins, thanks so much, appreciate it.</p><p>ROLLINS: Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS: Up next, President Trump says, he's seen success along Southern Border.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Getting very good numbers from the border. The 21,000 soldiers supplied by Mexico, and I want to thank, Mexico. They're doing a great job. The numbers are way down at the border.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: And we take up that progress with former acting ICE Director Tom Homan. We'll have the latest from President Trump's rally in Cincinnati. Stay with us, a lot more straight ahead and there is Vice President Mike Pence, and my guess is he's just about to introduce the president.</p><p>We'll have just a few quick commercial messages, and we'll be right back with the President of the United States. Stay with us.</p><p>DOBBS: Breaking news tonight, Immigration and Customs Enforcement has reported the release -- River Harden Lee (ph) released more than 218,000 illegal immigrant families into United States since the end of last year.</p><p>Homeland Security source telling the Washington Examiner's Anna Giaritelli, that the greatest number of illegal family members were released in Texas; 82,000 of them in San Antonio Region, 75,000 in El Paso Region.</p><p>Acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Ken Cuccinelli says, \"Trump administration officials are clamping down on the oft ignored requirement that asylum seekers must first seek safety in their home country.\"</p><p>Cuccinelli reiterating that the requirement is not a new policy. It is the latest in the administration's effort to follow the law, to enforce the law, to secure the border and the lawsuits and judicial activism undercutting the president's border seeker are the efforts notwithstanding that's the pursuit -- the way they're going to proceed.</p><p>Joining me now, Tom Homan, former acting Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, also Fox Business contributor. Tom, great to have you with us. How should we interpret this? The ICE let 218,000 immigrant families loose in the country?</p><p>THOMAS HOMAN, FORMER ACTING DIRECTOR, IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT: Well, there are a couple of ways you can interpret. First of all, they had to release them because the Flores Settlement Agreement, they can't hold them more than 20 days since they're trying up (ph) to see a judge.</p><p>DOBBS: Right.</p><p>HOMAN: And Congress has never funded ICE enough family detention beds. So, again, Congress failed to close that loopholes on Flores Settlement Agreement. Congress has failed to give ICE enough money to have more family detention beds.</p><p>But the second part of this, ICE needs to go out there and find, look family (ph) units have final orders in a large scale operation and remove that. I've been saying this and you know, I've been talking about this --</p><p>DOBBS: Yes.</p><p>HOMAN: -- for a year now. And that -- it needs to happen because until you show a consequence - until you show determination (ph) -- if a judge orders you remove, you're going to go home and we're going to make sure you go home and Central America needs to see those planes coming home.</p><p>DOBBS: You know, the president talked about Interior (ph) Enforcement, you've been talking about it. I -- Mark Morgan, the acting head of Border Protection Customs and Border Protection. It just isn't happening. What's the reason it's not happening? Because as you mentioned Congress, you and I and everyone watching this broadcast knows that this Democratic Congress isn't going to lift a finger to help Donald Trump secure the border and enforce immigration law. So they've got to do it on their own.</p><p>HOMAN: Yes, and you and I have talked about it many times, the courts aren't helping them except very rarely.</p><p>DOBBS: Right.</p><p>HOMAN: And certainly Congress doesn't want to help them, so we need to do everything we can within the -- within the boundaries of the law. Ken Cuccinelli is doing exactly that, we just open this segment with. He's going back and he's going to force all the laws he can within CIS. And that's the same thing the Border Patrol needs to do and ICE needs to do. ICE needs to gather national operation. I know ICE is hurting for resources because you're dealing with the crisis on the border. But you know what, they got 218,000 special agents and I saw so they have title eight authority.</p><p>So bring some of them over to do this operation, we have to do it. It worked for me in FY15, Lou, the consequence deterrence works, we need to have it. We need to have it. It needs to be large-scale not a little bit here, a lot of bit there across the country.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, let me -- let me return to the -- to my question, why isn't it happening? The president wants it to happen. Cuccinelli, Morgan, they wanted to happen. What's the reason it's not happening?</p><p>HOMAN: I do not know. I mean, when I was ICE director I just did it. I didn't look for approval from the department, I didn't look for the approval of the White House, I did my job. There's 7,000 deportation officers in ICE, deportation officers.</p><p>DOBBS: Right.</p><p>HOMAN: Their job is to execute --</p><p>DOBBS: What are they doing right now, just out of curiosity? 7,000 people filling jobs that by the way, I know full well, that just isn't happening. So what are they doing?</p><p>HOMAN: Well, I know they're working hard, Lou. You know, they got -A- they got over 4,000 jails that you respond to the restless criminals before they hit -- they hit the streets for sanctuary cities.</p><p>We've lost that efficiency in the jail so to release the criminal alien. No one agent gets sit in account of jail Lou, and process 10 criminals in one shift. But when that sanctuary jail releases them, now whole team needs to go out into the community and find that criminal alien. So sanctuary cities that really hurt the efficiency of ICE operations.</p><p>DOBBS: All right, Tom Homan, always good to have you with us. We appreciate it, thank you.</p><p>HOMAN: Good to see you, sir.</p><p>DOBBS: President Trump taking the stage at U.S. Bank Arena in CincinnatiOhio among a number of other things. There he is, waving to the crowd. Again, over a hundred thousand people looking for tickets in the U.S. Bank Arena. There are only 18,000 seats available. I have been told reliably that the president has never talked to a group, a rally in which there was a vacant seat, can you imagine?</p><p>We expect President Trump to be taking up the 2020 radical Dem presidential hopefuls and his assessment of their two nights of debates and the disastrous Fed debacle of yesterday and what it means for the economy, for the American consumer and family. And we'll be talking about -- he will be talking about certainly his announcement of 10 percent tariffs on an additional $300 billion of Chinese goods and exports to this country.</p><p>The supporters by the way started lining up early this morning and by early, I mean, before 06:00 in the morning outside the arena of the president's trip to Ohio highlighting his plan to win the state again in 2020. You'll remember in 2016, he won Ohio by eight points over Hillary Clinton. The victory surprising many including that state's former governor, the (INAUDIBLE) irascible and never Trumper, John Kasich. Where's John Kasich these days? I want to find out.</p><p>What is unsurprising of course is the success that Ohioans are enjoying since the president took office and Cincinnati alone, the unemployment rate recently hit an 18-year low. And we'll have the president as he begins his address right after this quick handshake and this break. Stay with us.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, there is President Trump addressing his supporters at the U.S. Bank Arena in CincinnatiOhio, let's listen it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Trump banners and Trump hats and Trump buttons that I've never seen. True.</p><p>And this great congressman said, I don't know, sir, but I can tell you one thing, if the rest of the country is voting like Tennessee is voting, you're going to win by a lot and we won and we won by a lot -- we won by a lot.</p><p>Our nation is stronger today than ever before. We have the number one economy on earth, no economy is social.</p><p>We're rebuilding the awesome might of the United States military and soon it will be stronger relatively speaking than at any time in our history, and when we took over it was depleted. We took over a depleted military. It's not depleted anymore, I can tell you that.</p><p>Our spirit is strong, our stride is back and our stand is clear. We are finally putting America first, it's about time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: Joining me now Tammy Bruce and Todd Starnes. Washington Times columnist Tammy Bruce as well as Fox Business contributor conservative columnist and best-selling author of the Culture Jihad right here. The book to be out quickly and we recommend it to you highly.</p><p>The president talking about all that has been achieved. It isn't as they say brag, it's fact.</p><p>TAMMY BRUCE, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, this -- it's remarkable, the president --</p><p>DOBBS: It is brag and a fact.</p><p>BRUCE: And he's -- and he's allowed to do so. It's been hard work considering what he's faced.</p><p>Last night we saw a bunch of Democrats who are being one way and we know that they're going to try to shift during a general election. Donald Trump showed everyone what Americans want. He's been himself from the start from coming down that golden escalator to tonight. Every day he's the same guy. He's made promises, he talked about issues and policies, he went into the office, he didn't change, he didn't have to adjust himself for the general election and he has been delivering.</p><p>This is the potential of the American presidency. It is the nature of the kinds of people that America delivers and raises and it's an exciting time.</p><p>DOBBS: What he's delivered Todd is also record low unemployment and that's what he's talking about right now in Cincinnati where they've benefited immensely from their decision to give an eight percent margin to the man who ultimately became president in 2016.</p><p>TODD STARNES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR: Lou, I come from a blue- collar family and I understand that at the end of the day, there are Republicans certainly Democrats who just don't really care about those kinds of workers, but President Trump does.</p><p>One of the things that I really appreciate about this president is the fact that he's stood up for those people who don't necessarily want to go to college. They want to be the construction workers, they want to be the mechanics. These are people who are taking on good and noble jobs and this president is affirming them. And that's one of the things I write about in this book is that this president is protecting the backbone of the -- of the country.</p><p>DOBBS: Let's listen to the president and catch up with where he is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: No more left wing extremist to reject everything that we hold dear. No one has paid a higher price for the far-left destructive agenda than Americans living in our nation's inner cities, they have paid a dear price, you see what's happening. You see our inner cities. We spend billions and billions and billions for years and years and years and it's stolen money and it's wasted money and it's a shame.</p><p>For decades these communities have been run exclusively by Democrat politicians and it's been total one party control of the inner cities. For a hundred years has been one-party control and look at them, we can name one after another but I won't do that, because I don't want to be controversial. We want no controversy.</p><p>The Democrat record is one of neglect and corruption and decay, total decay. The Democrats have taxed and regulated jobs and opportunity out of these cities and out of existence, they've squeezed the blood out of them. Left-wing mayors and city --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: Concerns, the president doesn't want to be controversial and he is actually -- he is being ironic here. But at the same time, following that suggestion that he is somewhat constrained but getting his point across. He's not backing off about Baltimore. He's not backing off about the --</p><p>STARNES: That's right.</p><p>DOBBS: -- failed leadership in dozens of American cities, failed Democratic leadership and the need for them to make a change.</p><p>STARNES: You know, I wrote about this in my column on foxnews.com Lou, that at the end of the day, you have these cities, Los Angeles, where they're dealing with disease that goes back to the Middle Ages. You have San Francisco that has been turned into a cesspool of human waste. And now of course Baltimore, more than 50 years the Democrats have controlled, more than 50 years Democrats have controlled Baltimore.</p><p>DOBBS: Right.</p><p>STARNES: And what does it resulted in? It's a third world -- it's a third world situation.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, the president is taking up immigration here. Let's catch up with it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: 21,000 soldiers on the border right now. I'm starting to like Mexico a lot. They do a lot more for us than the Democrats do, right? And the numbers are way down, you'll see that, way, way down. Democrat lawmakers care more about illegal aliens, than they care about their own constituents. They put foreign citizens before American citizens. We're not going to do that. 572 people were murdered in Chicago last year.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: That was one of the money lines when he talks about Democrats doing more for Americans -- I mean, the Mexican government doing more for Americans than Democrats.</p><p>BRUCE: Yes.</p><p>DOBBS: Stunning stuff, and it's --</p><p>BRUCE: Well, it's true.</p><p>DOBBS: And it's -- by the way, it's true right now. It's true.</p><p>BRUCE: See, that's it. This is a man who did not get the memo or refused to take the memo that forbids you from talking about the failed Democratic policies. Because that when he says that they don't care about their own constituency or their own base, look at Baltimore, and Chicago, and Los Angeles, and San Francisco, and Denver now, these cities, Detroit, etcetera. You've got people --</p><p>DOBBS: Let me interrupted just very quickly. The President is waiting. Apparently, there is a demonstrator in the crowd and they are chanting their way through this and the president taking it in stride, or pacing, depending on how you want to construct it. Go ahead, Tammy.</p><p>BRUCE: So that's, of course, what they've been reduced to, it's just yelling at him. In the meantime, he's changing everyone's lives for the better. But this is now -- finally, we have a president who is telling the political establishment and the media establishment, that no talking about the destruction of the inner city is the problem, not talking about how these individuals lives are more and more hopeless because of liberal policies.</p><p>The racism is in allowing that to continue. And in looking away, he doesn't look away. And that, of course, is part of his crime. The Democrats don't like that but this is also part of what he represents, the Forgotten man and woman. If there was ever forgotten man and woman, it's the people in Baltimore and the people in Chicago, people of New York and Los Angeles.</p><p>DOBBS: The President today speaking earlier -- let's listen in to that as we wait for the protester to, to perhaps exit the arena.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: The rage-filled Democratic Party is trying to tear America apart. The Democrat Party is now being led by four left-wing extremists to reject everything that we hold dear. No one is paid a higher price for the far left destructive agenda that Americans living in our nation's inner cities, they have paid a dear price. You see what's happening.</p><p>You see our inner cities. We spend billions and billions and billions for years and years and years. And it's stolen money, and it's wasted money. And it's a shame.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: And last year, it was $16 billion from the federal government for Baltimore. And Todd, this is -- this is failed leadership. It is empirical. It is absolutely in the face of everyone to look at this, what has happened to once a once-great city, Baltimore, but it's also happening in cities all across the country.</p><p>STARNES: Well, it certainly is. My hometown, Memphis, Tennessee, suffering the same fate as many of these other communities. And what is the common denominator? Memphis, Tennessee is run by Democrats. And we've been hearing from a lot of the residents of these communities who say they appreciate President Trump calling all of this out and shining a light on something that needs to be discussed.</p><p>DOBBS: You know, it's -- to me, it's stunning, Tam, that we have to have a light on this that the President had to focus on this. We've had a war on poverty in this country for the past 54 years, a half-century.</p><p>BRUCE: You know --</p><p>DOBBS: And we have cities like Baltimore in devastating.</p><p>BRUCE: You know, and that tells you something does, it's a little concerning to have to think about it, but maybe that was just a distraction. How much money has been spent on the war on poverty while everybody was looking away and not discussing its inherent failure perhaps? That's --</p><p>DOBBS: Well, not everybody is looking away. Let's be very clear. It is the leftist national media that has refused to look at what is before them --</p><p>BRUCE: Correct.</p><p>DOBBS: -- and to support a false narrative or the President puts it, fake news. Let's listen to the president here for a minute.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TRUMP: It broke the all-time record. The homicide rate in Baltimore is significantly higher than El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala. I believe it's higher than give me a -- give me a place that you think is pretty bad. Give me a place. The guy says Afghanistan, I believe it's higher than Afghanistan. In our country, think of that.</p><p>I believe -- we'll check the numbers and if we're wrong, they will tell us tomorrow. It'll be headlines. Trump exaggerated. I do believe the rate is higher than Afghanistan. Yet democrats and they've run it for many years want to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on illegal migrants instead of supporting their own struggling communities. No good. No good.</p><p>The conditions and Nancy Pelosi's once-great city of San Francisco are deplorable. They are deplorable. To remember the word deplorable, you remember when Hillary used the word deplorable? She used two words. She used deplorable and irredeemable, right?</p><p>And only being a politician for a few years. I said, what a terrible mistake that she used the word irredeemable. But it turned out to be deplorable. Deplorable was not a good day for Hillary. Crooked Hillary, she is a crooked one. She is crooked.</p><p>AMERICAN CROWD: Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!</p><p>TRUMP: Nearly half of all the homeless people living in the streets in America happened to live in the state of California. What they are doing to our beautiful California is a disgrace to our country. It's a shame. The world is looking at it. Look at Los Angeles with the tents and the horrible, horrible, disgusting conditions.</p><p>Look at San Francisco, look at some of your other cities. And then you have a governor, you have a governor, that invites the whole world to come into California, we'll pay for your health care, we'll pay for it. And then you wonder why so many people are coming up.</p><p>They're coming up, because we're the hottest economic country in the world, but they're also coming up because you have people like that Governor, say come on up, we'll give you a healthcare. Come on. Who wouldn't come up? Who wouldn't come up? How crazy is this? How crazy is this, schools healthcare.</p><p>Today I have a simple proposal for Democrat leaders to support legislation to end illegal migration. And we will use the vast savings to rebuild our inner cities. That's the way we should be doing. That's the way we should be doing.</p><p>And by the way, you know, they keep talking about oh, the voters, the voters, the voters, they want all sorts of security. What about a thing called voter I.D., voter identification?</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DOBBS: By the way, for a fact-checkers among you. Let me tell you, my fact-checkers in the control room tell me that Afghanistan murders six per 100,000. In Baltimore, 56 -- wow -- per 100,000. Back to the President.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Voter I.D. They give you everything they can give you except like voter I.D. and the things that matter. Republicans believe that a nation was care for its own citizens first. Our pledge to America's workers has secured commitments to train more than 12 million Americans for the jobs of tomorrow.</p><p>You know, he's working very hard on that? You probably never heard of her, Ivanka Trump. She's working very hard. She gave up a lot. She had a very easy life but she loves doing it. She's got over I think now 12 million people. They're teaching them, the great companies of our country, they're teaching people how to do it and it's an incredible thing to watch.</p><p>To give former prisoners a second chance at life, we pass groundbreaking criminal justice reform that nobody could have passed except us. President Obama tried, a lot of them tried, they couldn't get it passed. I got it passed with a lot of help from liberals and conservatives and a lot of help. And the biggest beneficiary is the African American community, biggest beneficiary.</p><p>And something which a lot of people don't talk about, but we doubled the child tax credit, doubled it. And our tax plan also created nearly 9,000 opportunity zones, hottest thing going providing massive new incentives for investment in job creation in distressed communities. Are you OK. Take your time. Take your time. Doctor, doctor in the house please.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DOBBS: Someone apparently having a medical issue and the President calling for medical attention, a doctor. It is -- it is a stunning performance by this president to focus on all that is happening in this country. And I think amongst the developments of the day will be the joining of Chuck Schumer, in alignment with the president against China.</p><p>And by the way, the President aligned with the government of Mexico, this fellow can't be too much of \"racist\" in point of fact, bracing Mexico, its president, its government, because of all of the help their providing America, acknowledging it and doing so warmly, Because this President's against illegality. He is for Law and Order for America, and sovereignty, and borders that matter. What do you think?</p><p>BRUCE: Well, you know, what's interesting is, especially with Schumer's action, is that after the debates, we see this pulling away from the values of the American people, maybe his reaction is that maybe they need to find some kind of common ground with the president, because that's where America is. I think that's a good combination there.</p><p>DOBBS: I think the President is leading us -- we couldn't -- we couldn't ask a leader to do more than what this President is doing now to bring people together in point of fact.</p><p>STARNES: Well, you're absolutely right, Lou. And I suspect that the Democrats are looking at their numbers, and they're seeing that this President is making inroads into minority communities. And black voters are beginning to understand that this President truly does care about the plight of minorities and does care about these inner-city areas. He wants to get jobs back into those communities, and he wants to do something about education.</p><p>And again, the President is shining a very bright light on this. I think it terrifies to these Democrats because they know, they know that they have abandoned these communities.</p><p>DOBBS: The reality is that this President has always asserted a leadership that was not Republican in point of fact. He is not a conservative in the traditional sense. But he is an American in a very strong, traditional sense of keenly supportive and protective of our heritage, our values, indeed our nation and what it means to be an American.</p><p>There is an opportunity here for the Democrats, whether any of the 24 candidates who would like to oppose them in 2020 will embrace the opportunity. They might consider what happens is we watch as a result of Chuck Schumer lining up with the President on the issue of China. Tammy Bruce, Todd Starnes, thank you both. We thank you for being with us through this hour. We'll see you tomorrow night. Good night from New York.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

La interpelaci\u00f3n del Congreso a las firmas tecnol\u00f3gicas indica que el sector tecnol\u00f3gico no podr\u00e1 m\u00e1s hacer lo que quiere.    Ayer los individuos m\u00e1s influyentes del planeta \u2013 Jim Cook de Apple, Sundar Pichai de Alphabet/Google y Mark Zuckerberg de Facebook testificaron ante la Subcomisi\u00f3n Judiciaria Antimonop\u00f3lica de la Casa de Representantes.    La audiencia se concentr\u00f3 \u2013 aparte de algunas distracciones pol\u00edticas \u2013 en temas antimonop\u00f3licos y pol\u00edtica de competencia. Cada CEO defendi\u00f3 los productos y pr\u00e1cticas de su compa\u00f1\u00eda, subrayando los beneficios para los consumidores y la competencia que sufren de otras firmas.-    Pero fue evidente que a muchos legisladores no les convencieron pos las justificaciones. El presidente de la Subcomisi\u00f3n, David Cicilline, acus\u00f3 a los cuatro de aplastar competidores e implementar pr\u00e1cticas desleales. Dijo que son \u201cemperadores de la econom\u00eda online\u201d y pidi\u00f3 m\u00e1s controles y m\u00e1s regulaci\u00f3n . agreg\u00f3 que \u201cel poder econ\u00f3mico concentrado\u201d tambi\u00e9n conduce al \u201cpoder pol\u00edtico concentrado\u201d. Para concluir preguntando si \u201cdebemos permitir que nos gobiernen monopolios privados\u201d.    Los republicanos compartieron partes de la cr\u00edtica tecnol\u00f3gica pero se concentraron m\u00e1s en la censura de los puntos de vista conservadores y las preocupaciones sobre prejuicios pol\u00edticos. Jim Jordan dijo que \u201c Big Tech sale a cazar conservadores\u201d. Le exigi\u00f3 a Pichai la promesa p\u00fablica de que Google no va a dise\u00f1ar productos y pr\u00e1cticas que beneficien a Joe Biden en la campa\u00f1a presidencial de 2020.    Sobre la base de esta audiencia y de los cambios en el sentimiento de la gente, Darrell West de la Brookings Institution cree que es probable que de ahora en m\u00e1s se abra una nueva era tecnol\u00f3gica con mayor control del p\u00fablico y mayor alcance regulatorio y medidas con m\u00e1s capacidad para hacer cumplir las directivas al sector tecnol\u00f3gico. Si los dem\u00f3cratas recuperan la presidencia, dice, y controlan el Senado, 2021 ser\u00e1 un a\u00f1o en que la legislaci\u00f3n nacional podr\u00eda orientarse hacia temas como privacidad, competencia, c\u00edber-seguridad y pol\u00edtica fiscal., reforma de la Secci\u00f3n 230 y lenguaje de odio en Internet. Por eso las discusiones legislativas de esta semana son ilustrativas del marco pol\u00edtico y regulatorio que gobernar\u00e1 la futura innovaci\u00f3n tecnol\u00f3gica.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNES-42723830445</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNES2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GF-DDH1-F07F-834K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398831</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"427\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Mercado Digital</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - Spanish</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>30 Julio 2020 Jueves</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>SPANISH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.native\"><className>ESPA\u00d1OL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Argentina</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Americas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>South America</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>STX000649</classCode><className>Espionage</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>STX000954</classCode><className>Internet + WWW</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>STX001693</classCode><className>Telecommunications</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

These experiments will also explore integrating central bank digital currency (CBDC) into the clearing and settlement of tokenized financial assets.Such prototypes could bring CBDC to the heart of payment versus delivery in conventional equity, bond and other listed and unlisted securities markets in the eurozone and test payment of one country's CBDC against another's.Blockchain pioneers have been making the case for real-time payment by moving fiat currency in tokenized form since 2015. It may now be close to happening. Central banks that dismissed Bitcoin and attacked Facebook's Libra are starting to embrace the underlying technology. A wholesale CBDC, restricted to a limited group of financial counterparties, would be largely business as usual. However, a retail CBDC, accessible to all, would be a game changer\u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0Yves Mersch, ECB In May, a large component of the Italian banking system adopted a new application to reconcile discrepancies in the separate ledgers for the nostro and vostro accounts that Italian banks hold for each other. It operates as a permissioned network on R3's Corda blockchain platform.Behind the scenes the Banca d'Italia, long concerned by difficulties in reconciling interbank transfers, encouraged the project. By November, it is set to encompass the entire Italian banking system.Far more radical would be widespread adoption of retail CBDC as an alternative to notes and coins. <table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_2\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Kenneth Bok,</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Zilliqa</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>\"Many central banks have already run pilots on wholesale payment systems between commercial banks,\" Kenneth Bok, head of growth and strategy at Zilliqa, a blockchain platform business in Singapore, tells Euromoney. \"The Monetary Authority of Singapore [MAS] tested real-time gross settlement in 2017 with project Ubin phase 2; that then moved onto cross-border payments in phase 4 and is now in phase 6.\"Can distributed-ledger technology [DLT] increase efficiencies in RTGS [real-time gross settlement] systems? Yes, it can. But that is a technical solution for the most part.\"Retail CBDC is much more complex,\" he continues. \"If a central bank looks to augment M0 \"\" what counts as cash and a promise to pay the bearer on demand \"\" it will require a vast network of users and intermediaries to operate on the same new protocol.\"That is a much bigger question of monetary mechanics beyond the commercial bank level. It requires the consultation of many more stakeholders in the financial ecosystem.\"The first phase of the Covid-19 crisis \"\" panic, lockdowns, job losses and government transfer of emergency support payments \"\" saw a form of this consultation playing out. People are much more likely to want digital currency now than at the start of the year.In a speech in May, Yves Mersch, member of the executive board of the European Central Bank (ECB) and vice-chair of its supervisory board, made clear that the bank will be prepared if populations express a clear preference for digital cash over physical.     The ECB is looking far beyond the experiments the Banque de France is about to conduct. <table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_3\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Yves Mersch,</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">ECB</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>\"A wholesale CBDC, restricted to a limited group of financial counterparties, would be largely business as usual. However, a retail CBDC, accessible to all, would be a game changer,\" says Mersch.And he makes clear: \"A retail CBDC is now our main focus.\"There would be important design choices.\"A retail CBDC could be based on digital tokens, which would circulate in a decentralized manner \"\" that is without a central ledger \"\" and allow for anonymity towards the central bank, similar to cash,\" says Mersch.This is a central bank-blessed version of fiat currency on blockchain. That sounds radical, but it could be the best choice.\"Alternatively, a retail CBDC could be based on deposit accounts with the central bank,\" adds Mersch.This would not be particularly innovative from a technological viewpoint, but it would be an enormous undertaking and a dramatic change to the financial system.\"For the euro area, it would basically mean increasing the number of current deposit accounts offered [by the ECB] from around 10,000 to between 300 and 500 million,\" says Mersch.In the process it just might disintermediate the entire banking industry. Instead of only the banks having accounts with the ECB, all their customers would.Why are central banks pushing ahead with CBDC now, amid a health and economic crisis when they, world governments and established banking systems have been pre-occupied with channelling financial support in the form of cash grants and subsidized loans to individuals and businesses? Interest rates applied to a digital currency may improve a central bank's ability to stabilize across business cycles and reduce reliance on tools such as quantitative easing\u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0Dixit Joshi, Deutsche Bank There are two reasons. First, the crisis has renewed long-standing concerns over the efficiency of the existing financial system and its payment rails.\"Watching the Small Business Administration try to distribute Paycheck Protection Program loans to the small businesses for which they were intended has been like witnessing a slow-motion train wreck,\" one US banker tells Euromoney. \"Meanwhile, some individuals are still waiting for cheques in the post.\"Similarly, a UK banker described the first month of operating the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS) to Euromoney in four short words: \"It's been a nightmare.\"Policymakers are asking why moving money in an emergency has been so painful.\"Retail CBDC certainly has the potential to make the distribution of financial support much more efficient,\" says Bok.Early drafts of what eventually became the US Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (Cares) Act had plenty of mentions of a digital dollar.\"There was an enormous amount of lobbying on the Hill and a lot of talk that technology companies might get money into consumers' digital wallets faster than the banks could into their bank accounts,\" another source tells Euromoney. \"A lot of people were saying: \"~Let's get Venmo and Square to do this'.\"That didn't happen. But those early draft bills drew further attention to the potential for digital forms of central bank currency, not just as numbers in bank accounts, but as value that can be transferred immediately \u00ad\"\" from government to citizen, from peer to peer \"\" and received instantly in an e-wallet on a mobile phone.<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_4\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Dixit Joshi,</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Deutsche Bank</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>\"Digital currencies may reduce the cost of friction in the current financial system \"\" the logistics and security apparatus which surround conventional forms of money transmission,\" says Dixit Joshi, treasurer at Deutsche Bank. \"The cost of this friction sometimes hits hardest those who are most disadvantaged, for example, high charges on low-value payments back home for migrant workers.\"None of this payment innovation is going away, even though some established financial intermediaries may wish it would. Rather, it is accelerating.The case for digital cash is becoming urgent in troubling ways.As the initial panic over the new coronavirus intensified in the early months of 2020, fears quickly grew that it might survive for days on banknotes and coins that had passed through many hands. Could the deadly illness be transmitted through cash?Back in February, the Peoples Bank of China began to take banknotes out of circulation in Wuhan, saying that it would destroy some and sterilize others. On March 6, the US Federal Reserve confirmed that it too had been quarantining dollar bills returning from Asia for seven to 10 days before releasing them back into circulation.Central banks around the world began to announce a variety of inventive ways to disinfect banknotes, some exposing them to ultraviolet light, others to intense heat. Newspapers ran the inevitable comedy stories about people accidentally incinerating their cash in ovens and microwaves.But nobody was laughing terribly hard. Assurances that notes are free of pathogens when they leave the central banks hardly inspire confidence.The Bank of England rather sniffily announced in mid April that: \"The risk posed by handling a banknote is no greater than touching any other common surface, such as handrails, doorknobs or credit cards.\"Maybe they still had sterilizing wipes and hand sanitizer in Threadneedle Street. In April, UK supermarkets had neither and were limiting how many bars of soap shoppers could buy. Handrails and shop doorways are precisely what everyone tries to avoid touching.\"Today, as social distancing measures become increasingly vital in the fight against a pandemic, the limitations of cash as a means of exchange become clear,\" says Joshi.Banks increased the limits on contactless payments, and although central banks pointed out that touching cards onto merchants' payment devices and pressing PIN numbers into keypads might be just as dangerous as handling paper money, the notion quickly took hold that physical cash itself will be a victim of this pandemic.By mid April certain central banks began to worry that things were going too far. The Bank of Canada, for example, urged retailers to continue to accept cash from those without debit or credit cards, wheeling out a medical expert to make its case.\u00a0 He or she walks into Starbucks and pays for a coffee while automatically splitting out the local sales tax. You can see why governments and central banks would love that\u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0Kenneth Bok, Zilliqa \"We know that SARS-CoV-2 [Covid-19] can stick to surfaces for a few hours to a few days and this may include hard currency,\" said Dr Isaac Bogoch, an infectious diseases physician and scientist at the Toronto General Hospital Research Institute. \"Still, we can find ways to ensure that all Canadians have access to essential goods and services, even if they are using cash. Risk can be mitigated in retail settings using a variety of methods, including ensuring access to hand hygiene for all employees.\"Presumably the Bank of Canada has been sharing best practice with the Bank of England. It helpfully added that anyone still wishing to take additional precautions might apply a little soap and water to its new polymer banknotes, although it cautioned Canadians against this approach with the older, paper ones.The Bank for International Settlements points out that \"\" irrespective of whether such concerns are justified or not \"\" perceptions that cash could spread the disease may change behaviour.The pandemic thus brings recent and growing calls for CBDC to the fore.Central banks were already increasing experiments with digital currencies in 2020, even before the pandemic took hold, spurred on by Facebook's announcement last year of its Libra stablecoin.That threatened their role at the heart of the monetary system, making it more urgent for central banks to get on top of both the technology and the attendant practical, legal and political issues relating to a potential restructuring of financial systems.Pilot schemes had already gone beyond just emerging market central banks to include developed markets such as Sweden. And activity continues to intensify now as central banks look to get money to those usually paid in hard cash, who still make up a large part of the grey economy in, for example, southern Europe.The BIS points out that \"in the context of the current crisis, CBDC would in particular have to be designed allowing for access options for the unbanked and (contact-free) technical interfaces suitable for the whole population.\" <table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_5\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">August\u00c3\u00adn Carstens,</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">BIS</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>August\u00c3\u00adn Carstens, general manager of the BIS, noted in March that \"the most transformative option for improving payments is a peer-to-peer arrangement that links payers and payees directly and minimizes the number of intermediaries. Many peer-to-peer arrangements use distributed-ledger technology.\"To become a trusted and widely usable medium for retail payments, any such systems require scalability, accessibility, convenience, resilience and privacy.\"The challenge,\" says Carstens, \"is to design a CBDC that combines the virtues of a direct claim on the central bank with the convenience offered by intermediaries.\"Where does this leave us?\"We first started thinking about central bank digital currency back in 2016, and it is still one of the top use cases for distributed-ledger technology that we have identified,\" Todd McDonald, co-founder and chief product officer of R3, tells Euromoney.He sees three groups that need to be engaged: issuers, users and intermediaries.\"On the one side, central banks are looking to update their tool kits to address the digital world. Some prominent figures who were politely dismissing digital currency three years ago are now starting to get serious about it. Bitcoin and Libra were a threat. But central bank digital currency is an opportunity. It potentially gives them powerful new tools to do their job.\"Of course, central banks have to move at the right pace on digital currency. This should not and cannot be rushed. But central bankers who were saying this might be something they could look to do in five years' time are now stepping up the urgency significantly.\"Joshi points out other attractions for a centrally issued digital currency.\"Changes in interest rates can pass through immediately into the economy, reducing the dampening effect of cash hoarding. Interest rates applied to a digital currency may improve a central bank's ability to stabilize across business cycles and reduce reliance on tools such as quantitative easing,\" he says.And there are more futuristic possibilities as new technology for money seems to take on a life of its own.\"Programmable money is now possible with smart contracts: money that is smart and knows how to distribute itself,\" says Bok. \"It is now technically possible for consumers to have accounts with the central bank directly with an app. This has already been implemented in Cambodia with \"~Project Bakong'.\"He or she walks into Starbucks and pays for a coffee while automatically splitting out the local sales tax. You can see why governments and central banks would love that,\" Bok adds.\"We are seeing fundamental changes in how central banks look to manage economies. By tightening the feedback loops between economic data and monetary policy, as well as coordinating monetary and fiscal policy, central bank digital currencies can add an enormous degree of insight to the management of the economy.\" <table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_6\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Todd McDonald,</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">R3</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>McDonald, looking beyond central banks to the next key group, explains: \"On the other side, digital wallets might have helped those who have been particularly hard hit by this crisis \"\" individuals, sole traders and small business owners, for example \"\" to receive the government assistance they desperately need more efficiently and swiftly.\"Potential usage of a digital dollar is now in the public record as a consideration for early versions of the Cares Act. And that has increased the conversation about central bank digital currencies.\"In between the central banks that control the supply of fiat currency and the individuals and merchants who use it stand the intermediaries \"\" banks, payments service providers and, potentially, big technology companies.\"For the service providers, it is both a threat and an opportunity,\" says McDonald. \"A financial system that transfers fiat currency in tokenized form will still have bank-shaped holes within it that need filling. This creates an exciting and diverse playing field. To become a digital-wallet provider you might be an existing bank, but you certainly don't have to be.\"Gavin Smith, chief executive of Panxora, a group that includes a fund investing in cryptocurrencies and an exchange, says: \"There is one school of thought that central bank digital currency might move within the existing banking model, with customers having wallets instead of accounts, but deposits sitting on intermediary balance sheets and retaining government protection, with it all operating rather like Apple Pay.\"But there is another, more revolutionary school where my assets would remain in my wallet and not go to a bank intermediary with deposit insurance. That would remove exposure to bank failure.\"In this model, the intermediaries might not be banks but they would still perform key functions, such as KYC [know-your-customer] and AML [anti-money laundering] checks to ascertain that a customer is a good actor.\"It would be a game changer if, instead of being aggregators of assets, banks became specialist service providers.\" Some in the banking industry seem to think they are being pushed towards a technology cliff edge and urged to leap off. When they get there, they will likely find it is smaller than stepping off a curbstone\u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0Neil Sheppard, Diginex The debate that Mersch identifies between token-based and account-based versions of CBDC will continue to run.A system where corporations and individuals have accounts at central banks, instead of, or as well as, accounts at commercial banks, raises big worries of massive and immediate runs in a crisis tipping banks over.Central banks could charge negative returns to customers depositing CBDC with them in order to keep banks in business during normal times. Central banks don't want to handle hundreds of millions of retail and business accounts, let alone perform credit underwriting to extend loans. A banking system has evolved over centuries to do this.Central banks are the wholesale distributor of money, but banks are more than just the retail store front and account managers. They are also outsourced creators of money.The present crisis has only emphasized this. All those companies that drew down their revolving credit facilities in March and April and deposited the proceeds back into their business accounts are now pointing to cash on hand. That is cash the banks simply created for them.This is the core of fractional reserve banking; creating money through credit extension in a system backed-stopped and overseen by central banks but not operated by them.It may be costly and inefficient. It may have too many rent-seeking intermediaries that offer no value. But we disrupt it at our peril.So do we really need to fix it?An account-based retail CBDC could overthrow the banking system. That is an enormous risk, of the type that governments and central banks do not usually take. <table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_7\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Gavin Smith,</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Panxora</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>\"Banks could still offer a service to lend money, if owners move some of their CBDC into a central pool that banks lend out,\" says Smith. \"Margins would become much more transparent. Lending would become a service.\"But it would also bring new and direct risk exposure for depositors to debtors. The present system offers savers zero return but also zero risk.And then there are privacy issues. Yes, criminals use large denomination bank notes. But law-abiding citizens may not wish central authorities to see every detail of what they spend their money on or who with.\"If a central bank digital currency needs to resemble as closely as possible physical cash in your wallet, that probably means it should be token-based,\" McDonald says. \"And distributed-ledger technology, which is designed to prevent double spending, is well suited to that.\"Bankers are not opposed to CBDC, even though it has obvious risks for them.\"Failure to explore the option is the greatest risk of all,\" says Joshi.Over 400 banks have signed letters of intent to join JPMorgan's Interbank Information Network (IIN), a platform on the Quorum blockchain for sharing information on cross-border payments, which participant banks can use to reconcile mismatches and chase down missing identifiers that prevent completion.Those 400 include 28 of the 50 largest banks in the world.It is not a network for moving money, although the possibility that it might become one has lurked in the background ever since JPMorgan announced its dollar stablecoin in February 2019.\"Moving money between JPMorgan branches was one of the first things we thought of for blockchain back in 2015 and 2016,\" says John Hunter, global head of IIN at JPMorgan. \"Even without going that far, the IIN network is highly valuable.\"There is a lot of talk about central bank digital currency right now. I am not sure the world banking system is ready to dismantle a pretty effective book transfer network and move onto a decentralized ledger system. But we do have JPM Coin, which provides the ability to move tokenized money if use cases emerge that require a settlement token.\"Stablecoins pegged to fiat currency and backed by deposits but moving swiftly over new rails are a potential intermediate step towards CBDC. Bankers say that Tether, a US dollar stablecoin, is increasingly being used by companies in southeast Asia, for example.The worry for central banks is that they can't see this activity clearly. They need to keep on top of payments technology as it evolves.Zilliqa is a partner in Xfers, a regulated e-money and e-payments provider in Singapore whose digital wallet is approved by MAS. Xfers runs a stablecoin called StraitsX, pegged 1:1 to the Singapore dollar, that runs on the Zilliqa blockchain. MAS has taken close interest.\"The StraitsX team has had several consultations with MAS on many aspects of the XSGD project, including stringent cybersecurity and operational protocols,\" says Bok. \"There are currently certain limits with e-money as defined in the newly enacted Payment Services Act.\"For example, you might buy a coffee with your stablecoins or groceries but not a house or a car.\"The MAS is a very forward-thinking and technologically sophisticated regulator,\" continues Bok. \"It wants a robust framework around e-money and stablecoins but not at the expense of stifling innovation. Stablecoins hold the promise of disintermediating legacy financial infrastructure and, by demonstrating adoption, could well be the way CBDCs eventually take off.\"However, stablecoins have not won over everybody, even in the crypto world.\"I don't like them. They are opaque,\" says Smith at Panxora. \"They may claim to be fully asset backed, but actually they may not be. You will see stablecoins break the buck. I would much rather transact into a central bank-issued digital currency. In fact, I can't wait for the central banks to do it.\"Banks are constantly telling us that in the Covid-19 emergency they have been part of the solution, not part of the problem. However, the slow pace and inefficiency in payments distribution raises questions over that claim.Is there a better way? Could big tech have distributed money more efficiently to more people in a shorter time? The time may come when central banks have to decide whether or not their prime responsibility to citizens overrides their mandates to maintain the current financial system and the banks.<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_8\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Neil Sheppard,</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Diginex</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>\"Crises are drivers of innovation and change,\" says Neil Sheppard, a former Nomura banker and now chief operating officer of financial services at Diginex, a digital financial service and blockchain solutions company. \"More and more pilots for central bank digital currency force many more people operating within financial services to recognize the emergence of a new financial infrastructure.</p><p>\"Now, the thought of unplugging legacy infrastructure is daunting.

Tonight, one shady stock broker may have orchestrated a billion-dollar fraud out of his sprawling mansion.  How he did it , and who he caught in his net.</p><p>ANNOUNCER: This is the MONEYLINE NEWS HOUR.  Reporting tonight from New York, Tony Guida.</p><p>GUIDA: Good evening.  After 79 days of bitter war over Kosovo, President Clinton swept through the shattered region to sweet applause today.  From refugees packed into a Macedonian camp to air crews who waged the fight for NATO, they cheered the president and his allies. Behind the celebration, a deadly serious message: The war for Kosovo is over, but the fight to make it safe is only beginning.</p><p>Wolf Blitzer reports from the president's final stop, Aviano Air Base in Italy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WOLF BLITZER, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The last stop on President Clinton's week-long European journey, the NATO air base at Aviano, Italy, turned out to be his victory lap.</p><p>WILLIAM J. CLINTON, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I did not want to leave without having a chance to thank those of you who protect our freedom every single day, who fought for human dignity and won its cause in Kosovo.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.</p><p>(CHEERING)</p><p>BLITZER: But the most moving moments of his journey were at the Stenkovec refugee camp in Macedonia, where he met children who lost parents, wives who lost husbands and families still searching for missing relatives.  Only weeks ago, there were 30,000 refugees at this camp; now, fewer than 10,000 remain, and that number is dwindling rapidly.</p><p>(on camera): This refugee camp basically will be empty within a week or two.  The Kosovars say they can't wait to get back to their homes, despite the dangers that await them.</p><p>(voice-over): President Clinton spelled out those dangers.</p><p>CLINTON: But you know there are still a lot of land mines in the ground on the routes into Kosovo and in many of the communities.  We are bringing in the best people in the world to take those mines up. Every year, the United States does more than half that work all around the world.  It is hard work.  It is dangerous work.  You have suffered enough.</p><p>BLITZER: Humanitarian relief workers say that plea won't be heard.  Nothing, not even the president of the United States, will hold these people back.</p><p>The 79 day air war ended with no NATO combat casualties.  The irony is that NATO's peacekeeping mission already has suffered two dead, with prospects of more to come.  Mr. Clinton stressed that point when he met with NATO peacekeepers in Macedonia about to move into Kosovo.</p><p>CLINTON: So you've got a big, big job left.  It is not free of danger.  It will not be free of difficulty.</p><p>BLITZER: The difficulty for President Clinton and his allies will be to bring a lasting peace to Kosovo.</p><p>Wolf Blitzer, CNN, at the Aviano Air Base, in Italy.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GUIDA: With NATO's air campaign over, its troops on the ground are trying to enforce the peace in a province devastated by war. Fifty-thousand NATO troops are assigned to Kosovo, including units from the U.S. Marines.  Their job: part police officer, part soldier.</p><p>Christiane Amanpour went to eastern Kosovo, where KFOR is in control.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): A week since U.S. Marines are in Gnjilane and they report a marked decrease in the tension here. Most days, Capt. Dan Sullivan and teams deal with petty property crime and some looting.  They are always on the street, either on foot patrols or driving around.  There have been three sniper attacks and they have caught one of them, but they say they've established a sense of normalcy now.</p><p>CAPT. DAN SULLIVAN, KFOR: I think, by American standards, there is still periodic sniper attacks, it's not normalcy but I think relative to what's been going on here for the last few months and years, it is, actually, quite a bit improved.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Still, danger does lurks from Serbs who still have guns.  This patrol is preparing to search and seize a weapons cache.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Your main job is to cover this avenue of approach right here.  Sector, sector, sector, that's how I want it.</p><p>AMANPOUR: But after mounting up, this operation is called off. They want to wait to establish better intelligence on the situation. Later, the Marines are called to the city hospital.  After searching every room and breaking down locked doors, they now say they've confiscated all the weapons here and they are no longer just reacting to danger, they are now trying to prevent it.</p><p>SULLIVAN: There are risks associated with any operation but I think that it's more risky to stay hunkered down and lose your situational awareness, get into a bunker mentality, than going out and aggressively patrolling and doing vehicle searches.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Lt. Marsenick (ph) says it's made a difference.  Now both Serbs and Albanians in this town know only KFOR's the boss.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Much better.  The local population is out and about and they stay out after dark now.  The kids tell us it's the first time in three months that they have been able to come out and, basically, be kids.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Kids who have never known anything but fear of soldiers and police.</p><p>(on camera): American officers say the KLA are disarming and disbanding on schedule, even though they risk attack by some of the Serbs who still have weapons here.  The Americans also say there have been relatively few acts of retribution against Serbs by returning Albanians.</p><p>Christiane Amanpour, CNN, Gnjilane, Kosovo.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GUIDA: Turning now from the news in Kosovo to today's action on Wall Street, Terry Keenan is here with a quick look at today's business headlines -- Terry.</p><p>TERRY KEENAN, CNN ANCHOR: Tony, not a good day for stock investors.  It was an abrupt end to a winning streak for the tech stocks today on Wall Street.  The Nasdaq tumbled 50 points after five straight days of gains.  The Dow didn't fare much better.  We will have all the numbers at the top of the hour.</p><p>Also, a late day profit report from 3com.  We'll tell you how the computer networking giant did, a panel of government officials and business leaders begin to look at whether cyberspace should remain a tax free zone and our MONEYLINE investigation continues, with a look at how a suspected con artist used celebrity names to scam possibly a billion dollars -- Tony.</p><p>GUIDA: All right, Terry, see you at the top of the hour.</p><p>And up next right here: the \"railway killer,\" a suspected serial murderer on the loose; the latest on the manhunt.  And later: the Energy Department under fire.  I'll ask Energy Secretary Bill Richardson what he is finally doing to protect America's nuclear secrets from theft.  And in Belgium, why Coke, is very, very sorry.  A sickness scare has the company on the ropes in Europe.</p><p>We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GUIDA: News tonight in the case of the so-called \"railway killer\" -- investigators in Illinois continue to comb the state, hunting for suspected serial killer Rafael Resendez-Ramirez.  Federal investigators fear the fugitive is on a killing spree that began nearly two years ago in Lexington, Kentucky, and then moved on to Lulling, Texas, then to Houston and to Weimar, Texas and then to southern Illinois.</p><p>With Ramirez still on the run, the residents of Weimar, where three people were murdered, are fearing for their lives.</p><p>Charles Zewe reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHARLES ZEWE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Thirty times a day, freight trains rumble through Weimar, Texas, population: 2,000. Police say alleged serial killer Rafael Resendez-Ramirez last month rode one of those freights into this farm community midway between Houston and San Antonio, and bludgeoned Church of Christ minister Skip Sirnic and his wife, Karen, with a sledgehammer as they slept in their parsonage, which borders the railroad tracks.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We were just all shocked about it because Weimar has never had a murder before.</p><p>ZEWE: A few miles down the road, an elderly woman was pickaxed in her home, also next to the tracks.</p><p>DON CLARK, FBI AGENT IN CHARGE: This is a very violent individual, an individual that clearly has no mercy for his killing.</p><p>ZEWE: Fear grips Weimar.  There's been a run on locks, alarms, knives and guns.</p><p>Larry Wick normally sells two handguns a week.  Since the murders, he's sold 50.</p><p>LARRY WICK, M&amp;G FARM SERVICE CENTER: We've been selling handguns to folks who've never owned a firearm in their lives, but they're scared.</p><p>This is a stainless .38.</p><p>ZEWE: Ruby Prasatik, for instance, bought a .38 special.</p><p>RUBY PRASATIK, WEIMAR, TEXAS RESIDENT: Well, you're just scared to death.  It's hard to sleep, you know.  You lock up.</p><p>ZEWE: After sunset, streets are deserted, porch lights left on.</p><p>WILLYNE DUNN (ph), TEACHER: Everybody's living in fear.</p><p>ZEWE: Willyne Dunn teaches at the church school where slain minister Skip Sirnic was pastor.  The killings were so brutal, she says, time may not heal.</p><p>DUNN: I don't know if it will ever be the same.</p><p>ZEWE: Charles Zewe, CNN, Weimar, Texas.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GUIDA: Tracking a serial killer is part futuristic science, part good old-fashioned police work.</p><p>Susan Candiotti reports now on the growing arsenal of techniques investigators use to connect the crimes to the criminal.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SUSAN CANDIOTTI, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Ted Bundy, Son of Sam David Berkowitz, Andrew Cunanan: The list goes on and on. Experts say a serial killer's motives are hard to pin down, other than sharing an inexplicable need to kill.</p><p>Wesley Alan Dodd, executed in 1993 for sexually abusing and killing three boys in Washington State, kept a diary documenting his evil.</p><p>WESLEY ALAN DODD, CONVICTED KILLER: Things kept progressing.  I kept getting away with all these things.  Well, I was just going to try to do a little bit more.  I was enjoying what I was doing.</p><p>CANDIOTTI: Forensic psychiatrist Helen Morrison has interviewed 57 convicted serial killers.</p><p>HELEN MORISSON, FORENSIC PSYCHIATRIST: It's very similar to an addiction, someone who takes a little bit of a drug and then likes it, and then takes more of a drug, and then all of a sudden needs more and more and more in order to get the same effect, physical or emotional.</p><p>CANDIOTTI: If authorities are lucky, killers will leave behind physical evidence at crime scenes.  Crime-solving technology, including DNA analysis, has come a long way, already being used to track railway killer suspect Rafael Ramirez.</p><p>JOHN DOUGLASS, FORMER FBI PROFILER: He has been linked to several of these cases because he's been very careless, very sloppy. He's left his prints behind at many of these scenes.</p><p>CANDIOTTI: Computer technology helped track down Christopher Wilder who in just two months in 1984 murdered nine women and kidnapped four more in 11 states.  But the man who led the case, now retired FBI agent John Hanlon, says there's no substitute for legwork.</p><p>JOHN HANLON, FORMER FBI AGENT: It's been my experience that's it's hard grunt work, leaving nothing to chance.  Names come up; you go interview.  You don't do these things over the telephone.</p><p>CANDIOTTI (on camera): \"And as sad as it is,\" in Hanlon's words, \"each time a serial killer strikes it gives police more evidence and another opportunity to catch him.\"</p><p>Susan Candiotti, CNN, Miami.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GUIDA: Later on the NEWS HOUR, hard times for steel.  A battered industry fights for a future and for thousands of jobs, but this time, foreign competition isn't the only problem.  The American government is also getting in the way.</p><p>But next, plugging leaks at Energy.  I'm going to talk with the man at the wrong end of the nuclear espionage scandal, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson.  Are America's nuclear secrets finally safe?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GUIDA: Now to the continuing congressional investigation into why China could steel U.S. nuclear secrets with such apparent ease. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson told a Senate committee today he agrees with the vast majority of recommendations in a scathing new analysis of his agency.  But the question is whether even that will make a difference in a department labeled \"badly broken.\"</p><p>Bill Dorman reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BILL DORMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): \"A department saturated with cynicism with an arrogant disregard for authority and a staggering pattern of denial.\" That's only part of what the president's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board says about the Energy Department. RUDMAN: How can it be it took less than three years for this country to construct the first atomic bomb at Los Alamos, but it took in the last several years, four years, for someone to fix a lock on a door protecting nuclear secrets?  I mean, it's just -- it's pathetic.</p><p>DORMAN: At President Clinton's request, former Senator Warren Rudman led a three-month review of security at the national laboratories.</p><p>RUDMAN: One employee said the DOE was about as well-organized as the Titanic in the 11th hour.</p><p>DORMAN: Rudman spoke of a \"dysfunctional bureaucracy, incapable of reforming itself.\"</p><p>RUDMAN: Top-level bureaucrats who could not tell us to whom they were accountable, which I found remarkable.</p><p>DORMAN: And despite congressional reports alleging Chinese espionage and sweeping changes announced by a new energy secretary, the department's culture has been slow to evolve.</p><p>RUDMAN: As late as last week, business as usual at some level at the labs.</p><p>DORMAN: Congressional committees in both the Senate and the House want to know what Energy Secretary Bill Richardson plans to do about the panel's findings.</p><p>BILL RICHARDSON, U.S. SECRETARY OF ENERGY: We are prepared to accept close to 90 percent of its recommendations right away.</p><p>DORMAN: Many of those concern reorganization, making lines of authority and accountability more clear within the Department of Energy.  But Secretary Richardson is resisting the biggest change -- calls for a separate agency to oversee all nuclear weapons-related matters.  Richardson warns that arrangement could put too much power in the hands of a future undersecretary, even if the agency is part of the Energy Department.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>This is where the next set of arguments is likely.  Restructuring is already under way at the Energy Department.  Look for Congress to pick up the pace with legislation starting later this week.</p><p>Tony.</p><p>GUIDA: All right, Bill Dorman in Washington.  And also in Washington tonight is Energy Secretary Bill Richardson.  Mr. Secretary, thank you for being with us tonight.</p><p>You said at that hearing today that you agreed with about 90 percent of the Rudman panel's recommendations.  Does that mean you also agree with the conclusion that your department is badly broken, as he phrased it? RICHARDSON: Yes, I do agree with that, that the department security is badly broken, but I believe it's fixable, and I am fixing the problem.  I have had the most dramatic counterintelligence and security upgrades.  I do believe it's fixable, but I think we've got to do it together with the Congress.  I'm ready to accept a large part of the Rudman Commission reports.</p><p>There are some good, sound recommendations.  But to give up and say that the department is unfixable, dysfunctional, and we should just throw up our hands, I don't quite agree with that.</p><p>GUIDA: Mr. Secretary, there have been more than a hundred reports over the past 20 years concerning security at those labs and recommending changes, and yet here we are tonight virtually in the same place we were 20 years ago.  Why should the American people believe this time it's going to be any different?</p><p>RICHARDSON: Well, because I have already instituted a number of reforms.  I have changed the lines of authority at the Department of Energy so that there's stronger reporting, more accessibility, more accountability.  I'm the one that's proposing a security czar to consolidate all security at our entire weapon's complex.  I've approved the counterintelligence program of the president, pushed it very hard, more counterintelligence money, polygraphs, back-ground checks on scientists from sensitive countries.  I've also ordered stand downs, computer, cybersecurity stand downs at the labs, in other words, stopping all activity at this very moment at our nuclear weapons lab to make sure that all security is in account. Counterintelligence measures are in place.</p><p>I'm not perfect, but we have taken some dramatic steps.  I just want that to be acknowledged and not throw up our hands and say that it's impossible to reform.  I disagree with that, and what I need is, not everybody to overreact and create another bureaucracy within the Energy Department that will even be harder to manage.  But I think we're very close on a compromise that satisfies both sides.</p><p>GUIDA: Mr. Secretary, let me ask you if you can say with confidence to the American people tonight that America's nuclear secrets are now safe?</p><p>RICHARDSON: I can tell the American people that we have taken the strongest security and counterintelligence measures; that we're fixing the problem; that espionage, I can't stop espionage from taking place, but I can put the strongest measures to prevent it.  I can tell the American people we're making a lot of progress on the problem.</p><p>GUIDA: All right.  Energy Secretary, Bill Richardson, thank you for being with us tonight.</p><p>In tonight's look at the news at the leading edge, the far- reaching power of the Internet is our subject tonight.  According to a Commerce Department study out today, the economy is being transformed by electronic commerce and the technology that enables it.  According to that report, e-commerce is responsible for more than a third of the nation's real economic growth.  And this prediction: by 2006, almost half of the U.S. work force will be employed in industries that are somehow related to the Internet.</p><p>When we come back: steel workers beg for help, but the U.S. government says, no.  We'll tell you what a big setback means for thousands in the heartland of America.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GUIDA: The Supreme Court issued two major decisions today with far reaching implications for businesses both good and bad.  The first, limits who can sue under the Americans With Disabilities Act, the law that makes it illegal to discriminate against the disabled. The high court ruled it does not apply to people with easily corrected impairments like poor eyesight.  But the court also gave a boost to victims of on-the-job discrimination.  The court made it easier for victims of sexual bias to collect extra monetary damages from their employer.</p><p>Finally, this half hour: nervous steel workers rallied today at the Capitol, hoping to convince Congress their battered industry and their jobs need protection from foreign competition.  It didn't work.</p><p>Kelli Arena has more from Washington.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KELLI ARENA, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Nearly 1,000 steel workers descended on Washington, a last-ditch attempt to convince senators to impose quotas on foreign steel.</p><p>GEORGE BECKER, UNITED STEELWORKERS OF AMERICA: Within the steel workers union, we lost 10,000 jobs last year that directly are related to the illegal dumping of steel in the United States, and we can't get anybody to take a position on that.</p><p>ARENA: Steel supporters failed to muster enough votes to limit debate on the bill, in effect, killing any chance the quota bill had of passing.</p><p>SEN. TRENT LOTT (R-MS), MAJORITY LEADER: We do care about steel in America, but the administration has a lot of laws on the books that they can use.  And frankly, they have been doing some thing to try to stop dumping that we had earlier in the year or late last year.  So, I think that probably will be the end of the steel quota idea.</p><p>ARENA: Republican leaders and the administration argued, quotas violate international trade laws and would hurt the economy by raising steel prices.  Once more, they point out that imports of hot-rolled steel used in everything from cars to buildings are actually down 72 percent from a recent peak in November.</p><p>WILLIAM DALEY, U.S. SECRETARY OF COMMERCE: We are committed to enforcing our trade laws, and that message should be heard loud and clear by those around the world who may think to read into this vote some other message.</p><p>ARENA: While the industry lost this vote, it did win an important victory last week.</p><p>(on camera): The Senate voted to provide federal guarantees for $1 billion in loans to steel makers hurt by falling prices.</p><p>Kelli Arena, CNN financial news, Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GUIDA: There's plenty more business and market news ahead. Terry Keenan is here with a preview -- Terry.</p><p>KEENAN: Well, thank you, Tony.</p><p>Next on MONEYLINE: the markets tumble.  We'll tell you what had Wall Street on edge all day, I'll talk with one of the brightest minds on the street: James Grant.</p><p>And how do you say sorry, in Belgium?  As Coke tries to figure that out, we'll tell you how the sickness scare is playing-out.</p><p>Plus an inside look at alleged fraud, how he did it.  This man may have bilked a billion dollars out of people just like you and it's easier than you think.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>KEENAN: Tonight on MONEYLINE: stocks sell-off and technology ends a five-day winning streak: the culprit, another spike in interest rates.  Coca-Cola apologizes for the first contamination scare in its history, but is it too little too late?  And MONEYLINE's special investigation continues: A Disappearing Act; a little-known stock broker allegedly steals off with nearly $1 billion.  His secret: being a masterful name-dropper.</p><p>But first tonight, our top story: a swift and stunning reversal on Wall Street.  This morning Nasdaq stocks were eyeing new record territory; by this afternoon they had erased all of their gains and much more.  In fact, investors dumped stocks across the board, disturbed by another spike in long-term bond yields.</p><p>Rhonda Schaffler reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RHONDA SCHAFFLER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Interest rate obsessions possessed stock traders today.  Investors shrugged off news of a big drug merger and upbeat earnings news, and fixated on the selling in the bond market, where long-term interest rates remain above 6 percent.</p><p>ANTHONY CRESCENZI, MILLER, TABAK &amp; CO.: The bond market's rethinking the thoughts it had last Thursday after Greenspan spoke. The market came off -- out of that speech thinking that the Fed would raise rates perhaps just once.  The thinking now is that once won't be enough to slow growth. SCHAFFLER: And all that second guessing sent the Dow Jones industrial average tumbling 94 points.  The selling was worse at the Nasdaq, which at one point traded within 10 points of its record high before losing 2 percent.</p><p>Financials stocks sunk, too.  Even a wildly bullish earnings report from Lehman Brothers wasn't good enough for brokerage stocks. Schwab, Lehman, Morgan Stanley, Merrill and DLJ all dipped.</p><p>DEAN EBERLING, PUTNAM, LOVELL, DE GUARDIOLA: Investors bid them up fairly aggressively, but, as we've seen, typically they tend to sell them off too because they debate, \"Well how much better can they get?\" So we're in that classic tug of war between, you know, the earnings outlook relative to investors' expectations.</p><p>SCHAFFLER: As far as what investors should expect next, some analysts see some fast moves but no real short-term direction for the market until after the Fed meeting.</p><p>BRIAN FINNERTY, C.E. UNTERBERG, TOWBIN: It's almost this game going on between sectors.  It's very fast, quick, group rotation.  You know, we love the cyclicals when we think rates are going higher, and we don't think that those big earnings coming out of the big-tech stocks are going to be worth as much with high rates so we sell the techs.</p><p>SCHAFFLER: Even after today's sell-off, the Nasdaq composite is up better than 17 percent on the year, and the Dow is holding its own -- it's up more than 16 percent.  And that's one reason why investors are so jumpy: even before rates started to move higher, many thought the market was already overvalued.</p><p>Rhonda Schaffler, CNN Financial News, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KEENAN: The stock of Chevron under pressure after the oil producer warned that second-quarter earnings would be disappointing. The company says severance costs and a recent refinery fire will cut earnings by about $100 million.  The severance will cover 2,500 job cuts -- part of a previously announced cost savings plan.  Chevron stock lost 9/16.</p><p>Chevron just one loser on a day when declining issues outpaced advancers by a margin of four to three on the Big Board.  Fifty-two stocks fell to new 52-week lows, 85 rose to 52-week highs, including Best Buy.</p><p>Other movers today: Compaq Computer, up 1 11/16 on rumors that it is selling its Internet holdings, including the Altavista search engine to CMGI.  Compaq not commenting.  CMGI shares fell $8.  America Online lost 5 7/8.  A big disappointment for the Internet IPO Salon.com; it lost 50 cents from its already reduced offering price. Salon was the second company to go public using the so-called Dutch Auction format. And it was that rise in long-term interest rates that pressured stocks overall.  The yield on the 30-year bond rose to 6.05 percent, as that bond fell almost a half-point in price.</p><p>And joining me now to talk more about interest rates, the most articulate observer of the world of bonds.  He, of course, is James Grant, of \"Grant's Interest Rate Observer.\" And Jim, welcome, nice to have you with us.</p><p>JAMES GRANT, \"GRANT'S INTEREST RATE OBSERVER\": Thank you, Terry. Nice to be here.</p><p>KEENAN: The stock market seems caught here between the inflation hawks and the true believers in the new economy; in your opinion, which side will prevail?</p><p>GRANT: Reality, a length.  I think the trouble is not so much the new economy as the old level of interest rates.  Rates had been sized globally for a world that was stagnating in its own juices, and lo and behold there was this terror before the bond market, that is the menace of prosperity.  Japan has turned up, and Germany today indicated that perhaps its economy is not, after all, comatose.  So when rates have been as low as they are, they can go up.</p><p>KEENAN: And can they go higher from 6 percent and higher from the level of mortgage rates, which are now at two-year highs -- in the high 7 percent range?</p><p>GRANT: Sure they can.  In the scheme of things, 6 percent is not to be despised.  I mean, your money doubles in 12 years and they give it back to you, so it's not such a terrible investment these days. But the U.S. is the world's high-interest-rate country, and insofar as we've entered a global bond market then our rates may go up just because others are going up.</p><p>KEENAN: it's been assumed as a virtual fact that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next week.  If indeed they do, should investors be cautious about buying stocks?</p><p>GRANT: Well I think investors ought to be -- I mean, generalized cosmically, investors ought to be cautious about buying stocks -- many stocks, I don't know about all of them.  But yes, I mean the stock market is priced for more or less perfection, and a Fed rate rise would introduce imperfection into this Garden of Eden.  The first rate rise typically is followed by anxiety about the second through N.</p><p>KEENAN: And that anxiety abated a bit last week -- a lot of relief that this might be the only rate increase.</p><p>GRANT: Right.</p><p>KEENAN: Do you think there could be more to come?</p><p>GRANT: Sure, I mean, for example, Japanese two-year yields have tripled in the space of about three weeks.  To be sure, they've gone from 7 basis points to 25, but you get a sense that, in the world of interest rates, there is a great deal of spring to the upside.</p><p>KEENAN: All right, on that cautionary note we'll leave it there. Thanks Jim.</p><p>GRANT: Thank you Terry.</p><p>KEENAN: Jim Grant, \"Grant's Interest Rate Observer.\"</p><p>In Washington today, Lawrence Summers moved one step closer to becoming the next Treasury secretary.  The Senate Finance Committee unanimously approving Summers' nomination to succeed Robert Rubin. There was no debate about Summers today, but last week Republicans criticized him for opposing across-the-board tax cuts.  Today he said his focus instead is savings.  The full Senate vote on the Summers nomination could come as early as next week.</p><p>Still to come: a MONEYLINE special investigation continues: disappearing act.  What do these two men have to do with missing money, and a missing money manager?  We'll have the inside scoop from Wall Street.  Our new contributor Andy Serwer takes on the sorry side of Coca-Cola.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>KEENAN: After the closing bell today, 3Com reported earnings that were right on target.  The networking company says that profits rose more than 30 percent to $88 million in the latest quarter.  After rising more than a half today, 3Com shares fell over $1 in after-hours trading.</p><p>And a major overhaul of one of Hollywood's oldest and most troubled movie studios.  MGM is restructuring its film and TV operations, which will result in a second-quarter loss.</p><p>Topping tonight's MONEYLINE Movers: Earthlink.  That stock rocketing 9 5/8 on speculation that Gateway will make a takeover bid for the Internet service provider.  No comment from Earthlink.  Alza rallied 1 1/2 after Abbott Laboratories late yesterday said it would buy the drug maker for $7.3 billion.  Albertson's shares down 1 9/16 -- the supermarket chain has agreed to sell 144 stores to win regulatory approval of its planned $11.7 billion of American stores. And Ramp Networks shares up 5 3/4 in its market debut; the networking equipment maker went public today at $11 a share.</p><p>Another winner in today's down market: Coca-Cola -- that stock up 1 1/16.  Coke today issued a blanket apology to the people of Belgium, trying to stem a public relations disaster and restore confidence in one of the world's most ubiquitous brands.</p><p>Peter Viles has the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PETER VILES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Coke became the global leader in corporate contrition today, apologizing twice to the people of Belgium for the breakdown in its bottling system.  But first, it apologized for not apologizing sooner.</p><p>In truth, Coke did speak sooner.  A week ago it said the problems were, quote: \"an off taste, and an \"offensive odor,\" and concluded, quote: \"after a thorough investigation, no health or safety issues were found.\"</p><p>But the Coke crisis is still in the headlines, stories still circulate about the people who were sickened and some Coke products are still banned.</p><p>ROBERT DILENSCHNEIDER, CEO, THE DILENSCHNEIDER GROUP: The challenge they now face is that, every politician who has something to gain out of this, every regulator who has something to gain out of this, is slowing the process down and making it seem as if Coke hasn't yet solved the problem, when in fact they have.</p><p>VILES: So in Tuesday's apology, Coke's chairman struck a new tone, saying -- quote -- \"to those who suffered, especially the children, my colleagues and I want to express a very sincere apology.</p><p>Coke shares bounced back a bit, after falling since the problem surfaced.  Shares of Coke's bottling company have also sagged.</p><p>BILL PECORIELLO, SANFORD C. BERNSTEIN: I don't think we'll see a material impact; I think, on the margin, we're looking for global volume growth to be flat in the second quarter.  On the margin, maybe it comes in at negative 1 percent.  And there's going to be some spending, in terms of marketing and promotion, in Europe.  But all in all, you're talking about a penny in share of earnings.</p><p>VILES (on camera): The Coca-Cola contrition campaign will probably continue.  A company spokesman says Coke is likely to roll out yet another advertising campaign in Belgium, as soon as that country lifts its ban on Coke products.</p><p>Peter Viles, CNN Financial News, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KEENAN: For a closer look now at Coke's campaign of contrition, Andy Serwer, \"Fortune\" magazine's \"Street Life\" columnist.</p><p>Andy, welcome to MONEYLINE, nice to have you with us.</p><p>KEENAN: What do you make of this Coke mea culpa?</p><p>ANDREW SERWER, \"FORTUNE\": Well you know, Terry, I have to say it's too little, too late.  I mean, let's take a look at this.  It is mishandled, bungled, bumbled?  I'd have to say all of the above.  I mean, this is -- Coke is one of the great global consumer franchises in the world.  So what happens?  They have a global customer problem. June 8, the Belgians started getting sick.  Ivester, sitting in Atlanta, does nothing.  Europe is 26 percent of it's sales, so it's a big deal.</p><p>France, there are problems coming in there now, and nothing happens.  The stock starts to tank.  I think we have the stock up there.  You can see it sank about six points, $2.5 billion of market share for every point.  So, it's a big deal.</p><p>KEENAN: Fifteen billion dollars wiped away.</p><p>SERWER: I'm not saying the stock won't come back -- it will -- but you know I think Ivester should wake up and smell the soda.</p><p>KEENAN: All right, new management there -- does it concern you?</p><p>SERWER: Well, you know, he's got very big shoes to fill.  I mean, Roberto Goizueta was one of the giants of the business world and Ivester has been there for a while.  I think it's tough to measure up. I do not think this was his finest hour at all.</p><p>KEENAN: All right, we want to talk about one stock that you're following, and the stock that is obviously being followed by a top technology investor, Jeff Vinic (ph), who now runs his own hedge fund. What stock is it?</p><p>SERWER: Well, Rambis is a very interesting stock right now. It's a maker of next generation DRAMs, and the stock has been on an incredible run, Terry.  I mean, this thing has gone from 50 to 100 sine the middle of April.  It's a great company, has great prospects, but some people are saying this thing has gotten way ahead of it.</p><p>And the sources told me on Wall Street that Jeff Vinic has been -- the hedge fund manager, Jeff Vinic -- has been buying the stock and trying to squeeze the shorts.  In fact, this stock is up about 10 points in the last trading session or so.</p><p>KEENAN: All right, you might see that squeezed right there at the top.</p><p>Finally, you want to talk about Maxxam?</p><p>SERWER: Maxxam, very interesting stock right now.  I know some hedge fund people are getting into this.  This is a company that owns an outfit called Pacific Lumber.  You might be familiar with them. They own that big tract of redwoods in northern California and Uncle Sam paid them $450 not to chop down the trees, OK.  Maxxam also owns 65 percent of Kaiser Aluminum.  You put the those two assets together and it's worth way more the market capitalization of Maxxam.</p><p>I talked to Nell Minnow (ph) recently, who is a shareholder activist.  She owns a lot of the stock, and everyone is looking for something to happen -- maybe a buyback, maybe a breakup, an undervalued asset play.</p><p>KEENAN: All right -- and there is that stock chart, as well -- thank you very much, Andy.</p><p>Andy Serwer -- he writes the \"Street Life\" column for \"Fortune\" magazine.</p><p>Shares of Aetna sliding 3 3/4 today.  Aetna's planned takeover of Prudential Health Care is coming under fire from virtually every corner of the medical community.  The Justice Department late yesterday approved the billion-dollar buy out, with strings attached. But critics say not enough strings to keep that deal from hurting competition in the HMO business.</p><p>Allan Dodds Frank has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ALLAN DODDS FRANK, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): From the American Medical Association, a battle cry about the Justice Department's approval of Aetna's $1 billion takeover and Prudential's health care operations.</p><p>The Justice Department is requiring Aetna to give up about 425,000 Prudential HMO patients from Houston and the Dallas-Fort Worth area.</p><p>The AMA praised the Justice Department move, but promises to keep campaigning for more scrutiny of health care mergers.</p><p>DR. NANCY DICKEY, PRESIDENT, AMA: Any place that current insurers get together and plan to merge their particular markets, we're going to look at how much of the market that's going to give them, and how much impact such a merger would have on competition.</p><p>DODDS FRANK: Aetna will still have nearly one patient in 11 in the country.</p><p>Some consumer health groups argue the government did not do enough.</p><p>JAMIE COURT, DIRECTOR, CONSUMERS FOR QUALITY CARE: It really is too little too late.  This company is now in a position to dominate this market, which is made up of maybe six or seven big companies right now who are going to be in a position to further erode both competitiveness and the quality of health care for the patients around the country.</p><p>DODDS FRANK: But one Wall Street analyst says the Justice Department action is sufficient.</p><p>JOHN AREGE, STANDARD &amp; POOR'S: If you consider Prudential-Aetna and their position in any given market, they're not going to have fifty percent of the market; they're going to have something a lot less than that and they're going to face significant competition.  I think that's the Department of Justice probably looked at it.</p><p>DODDS FRANK (on camera): Several states, including New Jersey, are still reviewing the Aetna deal for possible anti-competitiveness. But on Wall Street, the Justice Department approval was viewed as a green light for other possible mergers of health maintenance organizations.</p><p>Allan Dodds Frank, CNN Financial News, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KEENAN: And coming up next, a special MONEYLINE investigation: disappearing act, a missing fund manager and a missing fortune.  We will show you how he may have used the power of celebrity to steal.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>KEENAN: Following up on a MONEYLINE special investigation: disappearing act.  Last night, we told you about an investment manager named Martin Frankel, who allegedly bilked insurance firms of millions of dollars before vanishing.</p><p>In tonight's \"MONEYLINE Focus,\" Christine Romans takes a closer look at how Frankel used celebrities and the credibility of others to further his enterprise.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): People who know Martin Frankel -- shown here in a 1970 high school year book photo -- tell MONEYLINE he always guarded his privacy and never liked to be photographed.  His mansion in Greenwich, Connecticut is surrounded by an eight-foot fence.  A guard booth flanks the driveway. But the very private Martin Frankel, who investigators say used the aliases \"Eric Stevens\" and \"David Rosse,\" apparently knew the value of cloaking his operation in celebrity and credibility.</p><p>JOHN KELLY, KELLY AND MURRAY: It was a pyramid scam of celebrity, I mean, he built names upon names.  No one actually got involved, nobody knew what he was doing, but it was a lot of big names that peripherally had their name bandied around and, all of the sudden, the dream became a reality, that he was representing to people -- that some major players were actually involved in participating in his operations, which was supposed to be a charitable one.</p><p>ROMANS: Kelly represents a trustee for the Saint Francis of Assisi Foundation, a key part of Frankel's far-reaching enterprise, which the FBI says was set up to launder money.  Frankel organized the offshore foundation last August, and made it all the more credible by a roster of respected names laid out in its business plan.</p><p>The foundation's lawyer, former ambassador to the Soviet Union Robert Strauss of Washington, D.C.-based Akin, Gump, Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld.  Akin Gump says Strauss knew of the account but never himself represented the foundation.  The firm no longer represents the foundation and says it is cooperating with investigators.</p><p>The foundation's accountant: Ernst &amp; Young.  The company tells MONEYLINE it did limited due diligence work for the foundation earlier this year.</p><p>A trustee: a jet-setting Catholic priest named Father Peter Jacobs, shown here in the early '80s with Princess Grace and Prince Rainier of Monaco.  Father Jacobs says he was brought in to help direct money to charities. Listed on the foundation's advisory board: Walter Cronkite and Lee Iacocca.  Cronkite told MONEYLINE Father Peter Jacobs approached him last year, saying a benefactor was donating a billion dollars to charity.  Cronkite says he agreed to offer advice from time to time but said his name was used without his consent in the Saint Francis documents.</p><p>Iacocca did not return MONEYLINE's\" calls but has reportedly denied any affiliation with the foundation.</p><p>TIM BROAS, WINSTON AND STRAWN: People and companies who engage in these kinds of fraudulent schemes are able sometimes to fool even the most sophisticated investors, regulators and prosecutors by putting together an organization or organizations that are, and appear to be, credible.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROMANS: Perhaps the biggest example of how Frankel tried to establish credibility, Frankel convinced a Vatican-affiliated organization to provide start-up support for the Saint Francis of Assisi Foundation, something, one investigator said, Frankel used to assure people of the legitimacy of his operation -- Terry.</p><p>KEENAN: And Christine, any idea where he may have gone?  Does he have family abroad or anything?</p><p>ROMANS; Investigators are looking far and wide.  Friends say he was a very reclusive man who didn't like to have his picture taken. They haven't heard from him, and there's no clue at this point where he could be.  But it is a multi-jurisdictional investigation going on right now.  So we'll just have to wait and see.</p><p>KEENAN: All right.  Thank you, Christine.  Christine Romans.</p><p>Well, still to come, \"Ahead of the Curve: News That You Need to Know Tomorrow.\" And e-taxes: The government considers the riches of cyberspace.  Will it cost you?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>KEENAN: Here's a look at what's happening tomorrow: Goldman Sachs will release its first earnings report as a publicly traded company.  Analysts predict the investment bank earned $1.06 a share. And it is shaping up to be the busiest week of the year in the initial public offering market.</p><p>Tomorrow, TD Waterhouse will make its stock market debut.  The discount and online broker is expected to raise a billion dollars in what could be the biggest Internet IPO ever.</p><p>Well, traffic slowed last month on some of the Internet's most popular Web sites.  Media Metrix, an Internet research firm, says American Online sites saw fewer visitors in May, but AOL was still the most visited Web destination, and for the first time ever, Amazon.com cracked the top 10 most popular sites. Well, lately it seems as if almost everyone is trying to make money on the Internet, including the U.S. government.  State and local leaders are now trying to figure out how to tax the Internet economy.</p><p>As Bruce Francis reports, it could mean then end of virtual tax freedom on the Web.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BRUCE FRANCIS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): In Williamsburg, Virginia, where the American Revolution was debated, tough questions about the course of the Internet revolution and taxes.</p><p>GOV. JAMES GILMORE (R), VIRGINIA: Our work will impact every online American citizen that ever buys, sells or trades anything on the Internet.  And we have to remember that it is the future of commerce in America, but also affects everything around the globe.</p><p>FRANCIS: Two days of meetings of the Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce drew few conclusions, but many battle lines.  Some states fear losing out on $17 billion in sales taxes, 37 percent of state revenue.  And some companies are worried people won't shop online anymore or might spend less.  Many corporations recognize that Internet taxes may be inevitable, but they are adamant that they be fundamentally the same as offline taxes.</p><p>DAVID POTTRUCK, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, CHARLES SCHWAB: We have the opportunity to grab this in the early stage and come up with something that's thoughtful and effective that can be a model for other countries in the world as well.</p><p>FRANCIS: The commission is made up of local and state officials and representatives from the federal government, including Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin.  Also on the panel, leading Internet companies like AOL, AT&amp;T and Time Warner, parent of this network.</p><p>The commission was created by the Internet Tax Freedom Act, which declared a moratorium on Internet taxes until 200.  The commission must recommend a policy by next April.</p><p>Some companies aren't waiting.  Amazon.com and CDNOW already charge taxes on sales.  So far, the Internet hasn't been much of a drain on state coffers: 80 percent of e-commerce is business to business, which doesn't generate sales taxes.  And 63 percent of the remaining consumer revenue is nontaxable travel and financial services.</p><p>(on camera): The commission will now take its show on the road to high tech centers Austin, Texas, Silicon Valley and New York City.</p><p>Bruce Francis, CNN Financial News, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KEENAN: And that is MONEYLINE for this Tuesday.

Chairman Ajit Pai said the agency will review all comments in the record and make a decision based on the law and other facts. The raw number of comments isn't as important as the substantive ones, he said at Thursday's news conference after the commission meeting. He declined to provide a timetable for action and said he didn't have any DOA conversations with participants. </p><p>Commissioner Mignon Clyburn said it would be \"short-sighted\" and \"problematic\" to ignore or discount individuals' comments. Docket 17-108 had 493,462 filings by late Thursday, bringing the cumulative total to 7,382,933 (after 797,577 were posted Wednesday, and over 400,000 both Monday and Tuesday). Pai said the agency's electronic comment filing system seemed to be holding up despite the crush of comments. Demand Progress, a DOA organizer, called the protest against FCC-proposed rollback of Title II net neutrality regulation a \"historic day\" that \"broke records.\" It said Thursday that DOA sparked at least 2 million comments to the FCC (some of them apparently not yet posted) and over 5 million emails and phone calls to Congress, with \"tens of millions\" of people seeing protest messages online. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said his office joined the DOA \"to sound the alarm about the FCC's attack on net neutrality\" and ask for people's support. But FreedomWorks said: \"The response, largely from companies greatly benefiting from so-called net neutrality, was unimpressive. The fundamental problem with their message is that it is laughable. The average user's Internet experience today is no different than in 2014. ... Net neutrality is a solution without a problem.\" NCTA CEO Michael Powell said in a piece also distributed on Medium, which took part in DOA, \"the duplicity of big tech's call to action is revealed by asking are they willing to subject themselves to government regulation to ensure the internet is neutral rather than skewed in favor of their pocketbooks.\" The Phoenix Center said broadband and telecom capital spending \"is down significantly in 2016.\" Incompas unveiled a poll saying Republicans and supporters of President Donald Trump back current net neutrality protections by a 3 to 1 margin.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMDLY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMDLY2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5P11-4581-DYRJ-00CX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6944</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"404\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Communications Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"07\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>July 14, 2017 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Decision-makers should think of these trends as waves, which, especially if they occur simultaneously, could feel like a tsunami for those who fail to adapt their thinking and practices in a timely manner. CLIMATE CHANGE The first and most important trend is climate change, which has evolved from a relatively distant concern, on which there is ample time to take remedial action, to an imminent and increasingly urgent threat. The mobilisation of various concerned segments of society, owing partly to unusual climatic disruptions in recent years, has greatly increased the pressure on companies to act now. </p><p>READ: Commentary: Reaching net-zero emissions will be 'very challenging'. But watch Singapore try anyway READ: Commentary: Electric vehicles will take over Singapore. But here's what must happen first BP's recent announcement that it intends to achieve \"net-zero\" carbon emissions by 2050 - a notable promise by an energy company that operates in several highly challenging settings - is the latest example of business responding to such calls. It is only a matter of time until this pressure also prompts governments to take further steps, not only to encourage green activities, but also to tax and regulate those that cause pollution. CONCERNS AROUND PRIVACY Second, privacy concerns have grown alongside technical innovations involving artificial intelligence and big data. Society is increasingly recognising that recent technological advances allow not only for more efficient compilation of huge amounts of personal data, but also for using this information to monitor and alter behaviours. READ: Commentary: How to make Singapore smile for the facial recognition camera Broadly speaking, data are controlled and exploited either by governments (particularly in China), Big Tech companies (as in the United States), or by users (as in Europe). But none of these three general operating paradigms seems to provide sufficient comfort and assurance to most people. DISRUPTIONS TO GLOBALISATION The third secular force involves disruptions to the multi-decade process of economic and financial globalisation. The initial trigger for this was the trade-policy pivot by US President Donald Trump's administration - from cooperative conflict resolution to explicit confrontation, from multilateralism to bilateralism (or even unilateralism), and from rule-based to more ad hoc arrangements - aimed at creating a still-free but fairer trading system. READ: Commentary: Why China signed an unequal trade deal with the US READ: Commentary: The brewing discontent with trade and one step to restoring faith in globalisation But de-globalisation has been turbocharged by the outbreak of the deadly COVID-19, which has disrupted the flow of goods and services in China and beyond. These challenges to globalisation have opened the door for governments to weaponise economic tools to meet objectives that transcend economics, such as national security. This, in turn, is calling into question conventional wisdom about cross-border supply chains, just-in-time inventory management, and reliance on external demand to boost domestic growth. AGEING AND MILLENIAL EXPECTATIONS The final trend is demographic and concerns more than the ageing of societies in Europe and Asia and this trend's economic and political implications. It also goes beyond the growing realisation that millennials' starkly different expectations - regarding professional careers, personal engagement, political action, and the delivery of goods and services - will persist and deepen. For starters, businesses need to be smarter about \"anywhere, any place, any time\" delivery. Furthermore, job loyalty and tenure are decreasing, while expectations of comprehensive job fulfillment and engagement are rising. Self-mobilisation for political and other causes, often with no visible leadership structure, has become a lot easier, yet often is less durable and raises tricky questions about what comes afterward. And all of this is taking place amid the continued migration of an ever-expanding range of interactions from physical to virtual spaces. NAVIGATING THE FOUR TRENDS Each of these secular forces will have an important impact on the effectiveness and success of companies and governments alike. While being challenging overall, the four trends involve a diverse and geographically dispersed set of winners and losers. Executives and policymakers therefore must make timely revisions (including pre-emptive changes) not only to their business models and operational approaches, but also to both their tactical and strategic mindsets. Getting this right will require cognitive diversity, openness to constructive criticism, repeated scenario analyses, and multi-disciplinary approaches. Moreover, because each of the secular forces involves a considerable degree of uncertainty (with lots of known unknowns, and probably more than a few unknown unknowns behind them), a combination of resilience, optionality, and agility also is important. And this is even before one considers unanticipated periodic shocks such as the COVID-19 outbreak. READ: Commentary: COVID-19 could redefine Singapore's place in the global economy The challenges to sound decision-making and leadership in both business and government are not limited to mapping each of the four secular forces and the required adaptation. Decision-makers also must consider correlations and causalities between these trends that can make their total impact multiplicative rather than merely additive. As a quick illustration, consider another aspect of demographic change: Migration and the humanitarian challenges that often come with it. Climate change confronts countries with the possibility of waves of migratory human flows that they will find hard to accept and inhumane to refuse. The combination of de-globalisation and the misuse of artificial intelligence and big data to infringe individual privacy is similarly troubling. This could lead to questionable behaviour by some governments and encourage malicious non-state actors to disrupt societies and economies. READ: Commentary: Weaker growth prospects herald bad news for businesses and financial markets READ: Commentary: The Singapore economy in 2020 - stabilisation or more uncertainties on the horizon? The world is in a period of accelerating change, the leading edge of which is the ever-growing list of developments that have gone from impossible to inevitable. Many (though by no means all) of the challenges facing business and political leaders may be broken down into four secular changes that can help anchor the timely formulation of required responses at the local, national, regional, and global levels. The faster that companies and governments recognise this, the likelier they will be to alter the balance of benefits, costs, and risks in their favour.

Some even say they should be broken up. Most recently, US lawmakers launched a sweeping review to determine if these companies have become so big and powerful that they are stifling competition and harming consumers, while US regulators are also gearing up to take action. But, when it comes to whether Silicon Valley giants are abusing their market power, size is only part of the problem. </p><p>READ: Antitrust law should change Facebook and Instagram's relationship status, a commentary THE PRICE OF 'FREE' Traditionally, a company's size attracts the most antitrust scrutiny because being big often translates into market power that it uses to prevent competitors from developing. A company's ability to raise prices is the main test regulators have used to determine whether it possesses such market power. A growing body of analysis, that takes into account some of the different features of these companies, shows that relying so heavily on price obscures other potential harms. Today the biggest tech companies allow \"free\" consumer access to most if not all of their products. Consumers don't have to pay a dime to chat with friends on Facebook, search for the best route using Google Maps, exchange emails, comb the internet for facts and figures or engage in countless other activities. So an antitrust policy that focuses on consumer price doesn't see a problem. But the data about what consumers do, where they go, who they know and what they buy has great value to companies like Google and Facebook. And we're required to give up that data in exchange for free use of their products. READ: If only privacy agreements were readable. Most aren't. A commentary What's more, this data gives these companies an extraordinary market advantage. It allows them to identify untapped and underserved markets, spot potential competitors and prevent them from developing - the kind of edge that antitrust law is meant to thwart. NETWORK AND MONOPOLIES Large companies are also a primary antitrust concern because they can lead to monopolies that limit competition, discourage innovation and harm consumers. But in some industries, such as utilities and communications, competition can at times be impractical, leading to so-called natural monopolies. In the past, a few companies were allowed to exist as natural monopolies because of the high fixed costs and inefficiencies of competition - such as in the utilities sector. Antitrust regulators have allowed them to exist but only with additional scrutiny - such as price controls and oversight boards - to compensate for the lack of market monitoring. Antitrust law is now facing the question of whether \"network effects\" might also justify regarding a company such as Facebook and its massive social media network as a natural monopoly. Network effects occur when something increases in value as more people use it. READ: Help, I love tech monopolies! A commentary Launching a new social media service doesn't require costly infrastructure, but it is made difficult by the hurdle of creating a network that people want to join. For example, Google+ failed to become a meaningful competitor for Facebook because people stuck with the social network where all their friends were. Instagram may have been on its way to providing such competition, which is why many now regret that Facebook was allowed to buy it. A competing service might offer better features than Facebook but can't establish itself because it doesn't have the network of friends already in place. READ: Instagram tests hiding likes but this won't bring back happiness, a commentary Antitrust law does have ways of dealing with natural monopolies. It would be a significant adjustment to approach social networks in this way, but these are also industries with features unlike those that regulators have dealt with previously. 'BIG TECH' CAN BE MISLEADING A common retort heard from these companies is that they shouldn't be subject to antitrust scrutiny because they are all in competition with one another. Indeed, we've been talking about Big Tech for so long now that it's easy to see it as one industry. But, as I've learned in my research on the changing competitive landscape of television, these companies are actually quite different and shouldn't be seen as competing against one another in one big tech market. Nor do they present precisely the same anti-competitive behavior and concerns. Facebook is a social media company supported by advertising. It also owns WhatsApp and Instagram, two other popular communication services, and is able to collect data across all three services. Facebook has extraordinary data power and its pervasiveness as a social network leads to an expanding role as a communication utility with incomparable reach. READ: Someone needs to do something about Facebook - but what? A commentary Google offers a host of services but earns 85 per cent of its revenue from advertising - mostly from ads placed in its search engine. The lack of competition in search leads to concern about its power in delivering search results. The amount of digital advertising controlled by Google and Facebook is also an area of competitive concern. Amazon also has multiple endeavours and earns a sizable part of revenue from its online retail business, which accounts for a little less than half of US e-commerce. Antitrust concerns involve the advantage it achieves from using information it gains from the marketplace to create and sell products that compete with existing vendors at lower prices - or to exclude competing goods. RETHINKING ANTITRUST US policymakers finally seem to be catching up with the rest of the world and are beginning to acknowledge the antitrust challenges presented by these companies. Regulators in Europe and Australia, for example, were quicker to identify the social and economic costs of the data collected by these massive tech companies and their use of market power. The likes of Amazon and Google have reshaped many facets of daily life. Let's see if they lead to a rethinking of US antitrust policy as well.

Amazon looks like one. The giant e-commerce platform, which is benefiting from the closure of so many brick-and-mortar stores, has seen its global sales surge to US$11,000 a second and is scrambling to hire 175,000 employees to cope with the extra demand. Metaphorically speaking, it helps to sell chopsticks when the world wants to eat noodles. </p><p>In spite of the stock market collapse, Amazon shares have climbed 30 per cent this year, boosting the company's market value to US$1.2 trillion. What is Amazon doing right - and wrong - in crisis times? READ: Commentary: Has COVID-19 made e-commerce and online shopping the new normal? READ: Commentary: The cull of retail businesses spells the end for mediocre malls EARTH'S MOST CUSTOMER-CENTRIC COMPANY Arguably, the most exceptional thing about Amazon is its corporate culture. Even though it has grown into a massive multinational with close to 1 million employees, it sticks religiously to the founding dogma outlined by Jeff Bezos in 1997 when he took his internet company public. In his first shareholder letter, reprinted in every annual report since, Mr Bezos laid out Amazon's mission: Obsess about the customer; innovate like crazy and learn from your inevitable failures; invest big to secure market leadership; prioritise long-term capital growth over short-term profit; hire the smartest employees and reward them like owners; and maintain a sense of urgency, a start-up \"Day 1\" mentality. LISTEN: Disruption 101: How COVID-19 is revolutionising work To say all this is simple. But, as many corporate managers know, there is nothing harder than delivering the simple every hour of every day. The \"earth's most customer-centric company\", as Amazon likes to call itself, now offers \"free shipping\" on more than 100 million items to its paying Amazon Prime members. Its delivery operations have come under extreme strain in the latest crisis, causing delays and consumer and vendor frustration, but it is proving adaptable, as its hiring spree shows. \"Even in these circumstances, it remains Day 1,\" Mr Bezos wrote in his latest shareholder letter. READ: Commentary: If we can share or hitch rides, why not food delivery? READ: Commentary: Maybe it's time to pay more for grocery and food deliveries A DIFFERENT CAPITAL GAME Mr Bezos was one of the first to understand the dynamics of the digital economy and has built the company accordingly. The Internet enables suppliers to interact directly with consumers at massive scale, disintermediating most distributors. The billions of transactions Amazon processes every year give it unique insight into consumer demand. It now boasts 110 million Prime members in the US. It employs 150 PhD economists to analyse consumer data and market dynamics. True to his original word, Mr Bezos has played a different capital game to most of his listed competitors. Amazon is still run as a start-up that prioritises long-term reach over short-term return and does not pay a dividend. Last year, Amazon spent US$35.9 billion on technology and content, very loosely defined as research and development. The comparisons are inexact, but to give a sense of scale the UK public and private sectors spent a total of US$46.4 billion on R&amp;D in 2018. Amazon uses its financial war chest to attack any sector where it thinks it can gain market dominance, whether it is books, entertainment, cloud computing, digital assistants or, increasingly, healthcare. It makes costly mistakes (it blew hundreds of millions of dollars on the failed Fire Phone, for example) but learns from its failings. It has diversified into complementary business streams. Its cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Marketplace enable third parties to access its technology and e-commerce platform. In the most profitable parts of its business, it is running the casino rather than slapping down its own chips. READ: Commentary: Amazon, Google and Facebook warrant antitrust scrutiny - and not just because they're large READ: Commentary: In the time of COVID-19, China is revolutionising deliveries and e-commerce RISKS TO AMAZON'S BUSINESS Like every business, Amazon has been hit by the global slump in consumer demand and the difficulties of running a complex supply chain in an emergency. Those consumers who have switched to alternative e-commerce platforms may never return. The longer-term strategic risks to Amazon are spelt out in its annual report. Roughly summarised, Amazon most fears smarter competition. It worries about key person dependency. What happens if Mr Bezos were hit by a space rocket? It is concerned that scale brings unmanageable complexity. It highlights the dangers of more aggressive tax treatment and a regulatory backlash. After all, if the company has built a position as a systemically important utility, why should it not be regulated like one? READ: Commentary: Big Tech is showing some love to the US government - which comes as no surprise But perhaps the biggest threat is the one it least acknowledges. In spite of all of its technological efficiency, the business critically depends on an army of low-paid service workers. In spite of temporarily lifting minimum employee pay globally by US$2 an hour, it faces employee unrest about unsafe working conditions. Its business model will suffer if the pendulum swings back from capital to labour after the crisis. If history is predictive, it is certain that a competitor will one day displace Amazon. Yet, for the moment, it is hard to see who that competitor will be. The one certainty is that any Amazon slayer will have to improve on the company's not-so-secret sauce. Start with the user need and work backwards. Innovate fast and scale up on success. Forgo short-term profits to build long-term market dominance. Rinse and repeat, relentlessly.

Big Tech companies like Google and Facebook use AI to obtain insights on their gargantuan trove of detailed customer data. This allows them to monetise users' collective preferences through practices such as micro-targeting, a strategy used by advertisers to narrowly target specific sets of users. In parallel, many people now trust platforms and algorithms more than their own governments and civic society. An October 2018 study suggested that people demonstrate \"algorithm appreciation,\" to the extent that they would rely on advice more when they think it is from an algorithm than from a human. </p><p>In the past, technology experts have worried about a \"digital divide\" between those who could access computers and the internet and those who could not. Households with less access to digital technologies are at a disadvantage in their ability to earn money and accumulate skills. But, as digital devices proliferate, the divide is no longer just about access. How do people deal with information overload and the plethora of algorithmic decisions that permeate every aspect of their lives? The savvier users are navigating away from devices and becoming aware about how algorithms affect their lives. Meanwhile, consumers who have less information are relying even more on algorithms to guide their decisions. LISTEN: That awkward conversation about Facebook we need to have, an episode on The Pulse podcast THE SECRET SAUCE BEHIND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE The main reason for the new digital divide is that so few people understand how algorithms work. For a majority of users, algorithms are seen as a black box. AI algorithms take in data, fit them to a mathematical model and put out a prediction, ranging from what songs you might enjoy to how many years someone should spend in jail. These models are developed and tweaked based on past data and the success of previous models. Most people - even sometimes the algorithm designers themselves - do not really know what goes inside the model. Researchers have long been concerned about algorithmic fairness. For instance, Amazon's AI-based recruiting tool turned out to dismiss female candidates. Amazon's system was selectively extracting implicitly gendered words - words that men are more likely to use in everyday speech, such as \"executed\" and \"captured.\" READ: Bad news. Artificial intelligence is biased, a commentary Other studies have shown that judicial algorithms are racially biased, sentencing poor black defendants for longer than others. As part of the recently approved General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union, people have \"a right to explanation\" of the criteria that algorithms use in their decisions. This legislation treats the process of algorithmic decision-making like a recipe book. The thinking goes that if you understand the recipe, you can understand how the algorithm affects your life. Meanwhile, some AI researchers have pushed for algorithms that are fair, accountable and transparent, as well as interpretable, meaning that they should arrive at their decisions through processes that humans can understand and trust. WHAT TRANSPARENCY OFFERS What effect will transparency have? In one study, students were graded by an algorithm and offered different levels of explanation about how their peers' scores were adjusted to to get to a final grade. The students with more transparent explanations actually trusted the algorithm less. This, again, suggests a digital divide: Algorithmic awareness does not lead to more confidence in the system. But transparency is not a panacea. Even when an algorithm's overall process is sketched out, the details may still be too complex for users to comprehend. Transparency will help only users who are sophisticated enough to grasp the intricacies of algorithms. For example, in 2014, Ben Bernanke, the former chair of the Federal Reserve, was initially denied a mortgage refinance by an automated system. Most individuals who are applying for such a mortgage refinance would not understand how algorithms might determine their creditworthiness. FEW ENGAGE EVEN WHEN THEY KNOW HOW ALGORITHMS AFFECT THEM While algorithms influence so much of people's lives, only a tiny fraction of participants are sophisticated enough to fully engage in how algorithms affect their life. There are not many statistics about the number of people who are algorithm aware. Studies have found evidence of algorithmic anxiety, leading to a deep imbalance of power between platforms that deploy algorithms and the users who depend on them. A study of Facebook usage found that when participants were made aware of Facebook's algorithm for curating news feeds, about 83 per cent of participants modified their behaviour to try to take advantage of the algorithm, while around 10 per cent decreased their usage of Facebook. A November 2018 report from the Pew Research Center found that a broad majority of the public had significant concerns about the use of algorithms for particular uses. It found that 66 per cent thought it would not be fair for algorithms to calculate personal finance scores, while 57 per cent said the same about automated resume screening. A small fraction of individuals exercise some control over how algorithms use their personal data. For example, the Hu-Manity platform allows users an option to control how much of their data is collected. Online encyclopedia Everipedia offers users the ability to be a stakeholder in the process of curation, which means that users can also control how information is aggregated and presented to them. However, a vast majority of platforms do not provide either such flexibility to their end users or the right to choose how the algorithm uses their preferences in curating their news feed or in recommending them content. If there are options, users may not know about them. About 74 per cent of Facebook's users said in a survey that they were not aware of how the platform characterises their personal interests. OPTING OUT In my view, the new digital literacy is not using a computer or being on the internet, but understanding and evaluating the consequences of an always-plugged-in lifestyle. This lifestyle has a meaningful impact on how people interact with others; on their ability to pay attention to new information; and on the complexity of their decision-making processes. READ: A digital detox is a solution looking for a problem, a commentary Increasing algorithmic anxiety may also be mirrored by parallel shifts in the economy. A small group of individuals are capturing the gains from automation, while many workers are in a precarious position. Opting out from algorithmic curation is a luxury - and could one day be a symbol of affluence available to only a select few. The question is then what the measurable harms will be for those on the wrong side of the digital divide. Anjana Susarla is Associate Professor of Information Systems at Michigan State University.

If not repaid, then tech debt, like the monetary kind, can incur \"interest\", making change even more expensive to implement later. Cultural debt may be a similar phenomenon in many businesses, particularly in the tech sector. The fast-moving, risk-taking, win-at-all costs corporate culture that enabled a start-up like Uber to succeed is too buggy for a global public company and has to be updated. </p><p>One intriguing question is whether Apple will have to repay its cultural debt as it squares up for a fist-fight with regulators. Will the monomaniacal culture that allowed it to become one of the most successful and profitable businesses in history need to be reimagined? READ: Commentary: 2020 is shaping up to be a rough year for Huawei CASES FILED Last month, the European Union (EU) launched two antitrust cases against Apple. The first concerns the operations of Apple's App Store following complaints from Spotify, the music-streaming service, and Kobo, the ebook business. Each has attacked the company for demanding an initial 30 per cent cut of the subscription fee from all customers who sign up via the App Store, while promoting its own rival music and books services. Margrethe Vestager, EU vice-president in charge of competition policy, said Apple appeared to be acting as a discriminatory \"gatekeeper\" controlling the distribution of apps while keeping most of the data derived from them. \"We need to ensure that Apple's rules do not distort competition in markets where Apple is competing with other app developers,\" she said. The second investigation focuses on whether Apple unfairly denies Apple Pay's \"tap and go\" functionality on iPhones to rival payments companies. Both cases are likely to be argued for many years by teams of high-powered lawyers. Apple's response to the probes has been predictably furious. The company argues that it invented and built the App Store that now reaches 1.5 billion device users. If developers do not like its rules then they do not have to play. Millions of developers, who have made a lot of money from the App Store, are happy with the way it operates and comforted by the security it offers. Besides, Apple charges no fees on the 85 per cent of apps that are free to users. READ: Commentary: India's legion of TikTok users are collateral damage in Chinese app ban This reflects the uncompromising attitude of the company's founder, Steve Jobs, who acknowledged that the introduction of the 30 per cent charge in 2011 might result in some \"roadkill\" among developers. Apple has denounced the latest complainants as \"free-riders\" and signalled its determination to fight. It will be fascinating to see whether Apple maintains its aggressive stance as the regulatory pressure increases. The EU's scrutiny seems to have emboldened other developers. Base camp, which runs the Hey premium email service, has even accused Apple of running a mafia-style protection racket. READ: Commentary: iPhone SE is Apple's cheapest yet but there's more than meets the eye Such complaints are increasingly attracting the attention of US legislators, who have summoned the bosses of the big tech companies to Washington later this month. David Cicilline, the Democratic congressman who chairs the antitrust subcommittee of the House judiciary committee, has described Apple's bullying of developers into paying the 30 per cent fee as \"highway robbery\". He has threatened to legislate to curb Apple's monopoly powers. \"It's contrary to our laws. It's unfair to new developers, new start-ups, and it hurts consumers,\" he said. APPLE HAS TWO CHOICES Apple has an interesting choice to make. It can simply tough out this regulatory scrutiny while it continues to generate an estimated US$1 billion of revenue a month from the App Store. It can count on the EU taking years to reach a ruling while the US Congress may never legislate. For some big tech companies, fines have become no more than the cost of doing business. Yet Apple may also see virtue in defanging the most critical of its 23 million developers by modifying the way the App Store operates to benefit all parties. The history of Microsoft in the 1990s is instructive. While Bill Gates was running the company, Microsoft was contemptuous of complainants and regulators, and ended up entangled in distracting legal fights for 16 years before finally rebooting its own culture. Led by the more consensual Satya Nadella, it has vaulted back to rival Apple as the top US companies by market capitalisation. READ: Commentary: Facebook's decision to resist advertiser boycott could pay off in the long run It is pretty certain that Jobs would have adopted Mr Gates's combative approach. But that does not make it right for Apple today. It may make more sense, and may ultimately make Apple more money, for it to repay its cultural debt and negotiate more flexible terms with disgruntled developers.

Goldman Sachs recently predicted that most cryptocurrencies will inevitably crash to zero and the head of the World Bank has warned that most resemble Ponzi schemes. Meanwhile internet entrepreneurs turned venture capitalists the Winklevoss twins have said they expect Bitcoin to soar to 40 times its current value. But such feverish debate over valuations of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin has obscured the real story: That blockchain - the underlying technology behind Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies - is poised to revolutionise the way the world does business in much the same way email and the internet did. But the trouble is there hasn  t been a high-profile use case that has shown how blockchain can fundamentally alter the way companies do business or touch a facet of life the man on the street can relate to. </p><p>THE POWER OF BLOCKCHAIN The innovative power of blockchain is that it creates a platform allowing any two parties to digitally transact with each other using an immutable, continuously-updated, distributed ledger. In the case of Bitcoin, with no central authority overseeing the system, the task of updating the ledger relies on miners (  competitive bookkeepers ) who verify transactions and get rewarded with Bitcoins. On average, a new block on a blockchain gets verified every 10 minutes and carries a reward of 12.5 newly created Bitcoins as a form of incentive. The entire supply of Bitcoins  \" which will peak at 21 million in 2140  \" is pre-programmed by Bitcoin  s original developers. Just as the invention of the underlying technology behind email enabled the transfer of information from one user to another, blockchain enables the transfer of value from one user to another without the need for an intermediary like a bank. This has huge implications for traditional intermediaries such as auditors, lawyers or public notaries, and without radical transformation, entire industries face a very real existential threat. For example, most e-commerce currently relies almost exclusively on third parties such as Visa or PayPal to process electronic payments, charging transaction fees of up to 5 per cent. Overseas money transfer firms like Western Union and MoneyGram charge even more  \" often over 10 per cent. These industries seem ripe for disruption and with the growth of blockchain the fate of financial remittance companies may resemble the demise of travel agents in the 1990s. At a national level meanwhile, a growing number of countries are exploring how to put their currencies on blockchain. For example, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) recently partnered with a consortium of banks to develop Project Ubin, a pilot tokenised version of the Singapore dollar that replicated the existing financial payment system without a centralised clearing system. It is now working on similar projects focused on fixed income securities trading and cross border payments. It seems that certain banking functions, for instance payments and cross-border transactions may be put on a blockchain going forward, reducing infrastructure costs while enhancing transparency, traceability and security in the financial services sector. But blockchain technology has applications well beyond the finance industry. Indeed a recent Harvard Business Review article said blockchain   could change the very nature of economic, social, and political systems.  The article  s authors, both Harvard professors, said they foresee a world where   every agreement, every process, every task, and every payment would have a digital record and signature that could be identified, validated, stored and shared . By allowing businesses to control their own data, ensuring immutability and transparency, it offers transformational potential in areas such as inventory control, food safety and record management, including medical records. In January, IBM and Danish shipping giant Maersk announced a joint venture to use blockchain in shipping supply chain. In a sector which handles around U$4 trillion of goods per year, the firms said they expected savings of up to 15 per cent of this amount, mostly by eliminating the bureaucracy and corruption risk in manual procedures. Another area where blockchain shows significant promise is food safety. Recently Walmart launched a pilot in China using blockchain to track and trace shipments of pork. Making food supply chains transparent and traceable brings a range of potential benefits  \" for example, while it normally takes days to recall a food product, blockchain can do it in seconds. MINING INVOLVES A LOT OF ELECTRICITY Before we become swept up in the excitement, it  s important to also bear in mind the challenges. One often underreported downside of blockchain is the power consumption it accounts for. Mining Bitcoin alone, for example, has been estimated to account for 42 terawatt-hours per year  \" similar to the annual consumption of Hong Kong or New Zealand. This may potentially be alleviated by different mining processes, but these will likely raise different issues and challenges. Another critical issue is security. Bitcoin is safe as long as honest nodes control more power than potential collaborating attackers. However, this can be undermined by the formation of mining syndicates since collusion among groups with more than 50 per cent of mining power could enable hacking of the system. Scalability likewise needs to be urgently addressed as the reach and use of cryptocurrencies continue to grow. Bitcoin, for example, can currently only process roughly seven transactions per second whereas in contrast Visa can process more than 50,000 per second. The most critical risk however comes from regulatory bodies and the response they take to this growing phenomenon. Several governments including Bangladesh, Nepal and Vietnam have banned Bitcoin transactions outright. China and South Korea meanwhile have recently introduced strong regulatory measures such as restricting trading in cryptocurrencies. Others like Hong Kong and Singapore have adopted a more measured approach  \" Singapore  s MAS announced that while it had no plans to regulate cryptocurrencies, it would come down hard on any money laundering and terrorist financing risks. Perhaps one particularly significant sign came in recent testimony to a US Senate by J Christopher Giancarlo, Chairman of Commodity Futures Trading Commission. His view, he told the panel, was that   distributed ledgers have the potential to enhance economic efficiency, mitigate centralised systemic risk, defend against fraudulent activity and improve data quality and governance.  As such, he added, the right regulatory approach to blockchain technology would be to   do no harm . This statement may go down as the moment that blockchain entered the mainstream. Just like how people didn  t foresee the impact of e-commerce before Amazon arrived or that of social media before Facebook, it  s conceivable that blockchain may become the next big tech. In fact, blockchain may have the potential to underwrite the very systems we depend on today for any sort of transaction. So what does this mean for those investing in cryptocurrencies? Given their wild swings in price, the highly speculative environment and lack of pricing models, investing in specific cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ether remains a highly risky prospect for the vast majority of retail investors. However, for a lot of businesses, investing in blockchain may be a prudent strategic investment. Indeed, as the technology  s potential continues to grow, we will see the emergence of innovative companies with creative and disruptive applications that existing firms and industries cannot afford to ignore.

Instead, we've got the new Robber Barons: Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google, with Uber and a few others trying to join this profitable circle of global oligopolies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the United States, Amazon increasingly dominates the retail landscape. It handles about 40 percent of all book sales. For online sales of all merchandise, Amazon's market share keeps increasing. It's estimated that, for each additional dollar Americans spend online this year, about 50 cents will be spent with Amazon. Its market value is now about $300 billion.</p><p>As with Amazon, Facebook has immense power over suppliers who reach customers using its platform. Facebook's market value is $300 billion. It has 1.5 billion users worldwide and an estimated 40 percent share of the social media market. On average, users spend almost an hour per day on Facebook. And about 40 percent of Americans get at least some of their news via the social network.</p><p>The statistics for Google and Apple are equally impressive. Each of these companies benefits from some combination of large upfront investment costs, low marginal costs and network effects - the traditional recipe for a monopoly or oligopoly. At this stage, it would be immensely difficult financially for a new entrant to compete.</p><p>These factors provide the new Robber Barons with the ability to take advantage of their suppliers, employees and customers. This isn't just an abstract concern about what could possibly happen in the future - Apple and Google have already admitted to colluding to depress employee wages. And working conditions in Amazon's warehouses seem, at times, a throwback to 19th century capitalism.</p><p>Market power of this magnitude isn't unprecedented. We've faced similar challenges in the past.</p><p>Before the rise of cable, TV was only distributed via airwaves. Under the best circumstances, broadcasting companies were going to have oligopoly power: There was only a limited electromagnetic spectrum. But the government prevented monopolies by limiting the number of broadcast licenses any one company could own, either nationally or in a local market. It also dealt with the possibility that station owners would use their broadcasting power to manipulate political events by imposing the Equal Time Rule (broadcasters must provide equivalent opportunities to all political candidates) and the Fairness Doctrine ( broadcasters must present both sides of controversies of public importance in an honest and balanced manner).</p><p>Similarly, the old Bell System had a monopoly on the telephone industry for most of the 20th century. If you wanted to contact someone by phone, you had to use the Bell System. The government first addressed Bell's position through price regulation. Then in 1982, it broke up the company as part of a courtordered settlement, setting the stage for actual competition, new technologies and, indirectly, our current telecommunications revolution.</p><p>Government antitrust interventions have promoted innovation in the past and should again be employed to make conditions more favorable for competitors and consumers.</p><p>Let me offer a few suggestions: - Break up companies with excessive market share. Broadcast TV, as noted above, was a natural oligopoly because of limited spectrum. Absent a compelling technological reason for a monopoly or oligopoly, the government should move to split up large companies. Amazon, for instance, could be split along product lines (a separate company for books, housewares, etc.), geographically (by regions), or vertically (with fulfillment centers separated from the rest of the company).</p><p>- Prevent large companies from using their significant market share to extract monopolistic rent. When the book publisher Hachette wouldn't agree to Amazon's terms, Amazon made it difficult for consumers to buy Hachette books. Giants shouldn't be allowed to arbitrarily crush parts of their supply chain.</p><p>- Impose clear, fair and nonarbitrary rules concerning when monopolies and oligopolies can refuse to serve customers. Social media is an increasingly key part of how we communicate. Yet legally, nothing stops Facebook from simply banning users from its platform, for any reason it wishes.</p><p>This isn't a moot concern. When Facebook objected to some material the American Civil Liberties Union posted on its pages, Facebook suspended its account. The ACLU was able to get its account turned on again, but who knows how many less prominent advocacy groups have been prevented from communicating via the network.</p><p>Regulating or breaking up large digital companies won't be easy. In the late 19th century, the old Standard Oil Trust controlled an estimated 90 percent of the refined petroleum industry. Although the trust was first sued on antitrust grounds in the 1890s, it successfully resisted breakup until 1911.</p><p>The original Robber Barons fought, on all fronts, to maintain their monopolistic advantage: in the courts with armies of lawyers; politically with campaign donations ( one senator was only half-jokingly referred to as the Senator from Standard Oil); and through public relations campaigns, arguing that their size served the public interest, or that their power wasn't as extensive as it appeared.</p><p>Our new Robber Barons will likely react the same way to any threat to their profits. But if we don't act, we risk stifling future innovation and being crushed by these new corporate giants.</p><p>Strauss is a visiting professor at Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs.

At Davos last month, tech company Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff made his views on how to regulate Facebook plain: I think that you do it exactly the same way that you regulated the cigarette industry. \"Here\u00e2  s a product: Cigarettes. </p><p>They\u00e2  re addictive, they\u00e2  re not good for you \u00e2 \u00a6 there\u00e2  s a lot of parallels \u00e2 \u00a6 technology has addictive qualities that we have to address ... product designers are working to make those products more addictive and we need to rein that back,\" he added. As did George Soros: (Social media companies) deliberately engineer addiction into the services they provide. This can be very harmful, particularly for adolescents. NEITHER THE WILL NOR THE INCLINATION TO PROTECT SOCIETY The internet monopolies have neither the will nor the inclination to protect society against the consequences of their actions. That turns them into a menace and it falls to the regulatory authorities to protect society against them. In the US, the regulators are not strong enough to stand up against their political influence. The European Union is better situated because it doesn\u00e2  t have any platform giants of its own. The connection between tech usage and health risks is not new, but has recently gathered steam. In November, former Facebook executive Chamath Palihapitiya and founding president Sean Parker both characterised the network as a detriment to society. In the words of the latter: God only knows what it\u00e2  s doing to our children\u00e2  s brains. Earlier this week, former employees of both Google and Facebook launched a lobbying campaign to combat tech addiction among children. If it was difficult to parse actual public distaste from the occasionally frenzied commentary, the damage is now clear. According to the 2018 Edelman Trust Barometer, trust in social media and search engines is significantly down: Among the 28 countries surveyed, only Sweden and Ireland had lower levels of trust than Australia. Conversely, global trust in traditional and online media has risen from 2017 globally. While faith in platforms has declined, attitudes towards technology and telecommunications companies themselves have remained broadly positive over the past four years, according to the Edelman report. But, as a Verge survey of Americans showed in October 2017, goodwill towards tech giants is not evenly spread. In comparison to Apple, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, a greater share of respondents say Facebook and Twitter have a negative impact on society and that they dislike using their services. DESIRE TO AMELIORATE RESPONSIBILITIES Perhaps with this dynamic in mind, in January Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that the company would begin prioritising content shared by friends, family and groups over that shared by pages. Although it\u00e2  s not quite the same as last year\u00e2  s test that saw the removal of all organic page content from news feeds in six countries, the changes do indicate a desire to ameliorate the responsibilities that accompany news publishing. Almost half of all American adults get news from the platform \u00e2 \" as Facebook tightens the spigot, whether these users seek out additional sources of news or just end up consuming less of it remains to be seen. Of course, there\u00e2  s nothing to prevent friends and family from spouting conspiracy theories. But perhaps users are better-placed to assess the veracity of the sources they\u00e2  re related to \u00e2 \" better the fake news you know than the fake news you don\u00e2  t. Or perhaps the changes will only reinforce existing echo chambers, as users increasingly encounter the same type of news and views. In December the company acknowledged the mental health problems posed by Facebook, but also argued that the problem comes down to whether users spend time actively interacting with other users, or passively consuming content. After spending US$50 million in 2016 promoting live videos among publishers, Facebook has now adjusted its algorithm to show fewer viral clips. As a result, total Facebook usage has dropped by 50 million hours a day. These changes are driven by the idea that the future of the company lies in \u00e2  meaningful connections between people rather than passive consumption of content\u00e2 , and were foreshadowed in December by a blog post admitting the mental health risks posed by using the service. (Read: A commentary on whether users benefitted from the changes to Facebook's algorithm.) BUT WILL FACEBOOK GET PEOPLE TO SPEND LESS TIME ON THE SITE? It\u00e2  s difficult, however, to imagine Facebook countenancing less time spent on the site per user as the way of the future. Facebook is a public company, and there are just not enough humans left on the planet to sustain less user engagement and still post growth, except perhaps through increasing the appeal of their user data to advertisers. Last February, Zuckerberg outlined Facebook\u00e2  s future as a supranational social infrastructure underpinning a global community of communities, and there is no reason to suspect that goal has changed. Deeper engagement is still part of the plan. But no matter how communitarian in ethos, a ubiquitous service is an inescapable service. There may be ways for Facebook to address or avoid the problems of fake news, hate speech, radicalisation and foreign interference in elections. But if a popular narrative emerges equating deeper engagement with unhealthy tech addiction, Facebook will not be able to avoid confronting it. As Soros notes, a concerted US regulatory push is doubtful. The current state of social media both assisted Donald Trump\u00e2  s presidential victory and continues to sustain his core support. But without some truly substantive self-reform on the part of tech companies, this narrative of social media as a health risk will only fester.

This week, Bloomberg News wrote about the irony of the last decade of flourishing technology startups. Many of the upstarts might not exist without the computing horsepower of Amazon Web Services, the vehicle-routing backbone of Google Maps or customer acquisition through ads on Facebook. Younger companies such as Lyft are both a challenge to supremacy of the U.S. tech powers and heavily reliant on their products. </p><p>The word \"moat\" is overused jargon for companies' unique advantages that let them stay ahead of competitors. But the article was a reminder that the five biggest U.S. technology companies have a heck of a moat in the form of their physical infrastructure \u2014 everything from Amazon's package centers and delivery airplanes to Google's sophisticated computer data centers and privately built undersea internet cables. Also this week, Recode offered a glimpse of anxiety inside Walmart Inc. about its e-commerce business and the costs of keeping up with Amazon. The news outlet reported that Walmart's e-commerce chief has pressed to spend more to expand what is at most 20 U.S. warehouses that handle the company's online orders, compared with Amazon's more than 100 U.S. package centers. If a company the size of Walmart \u2014 which sells about half a trillion dollars worth of merchandise globally each year compared with Amazon's roughly $300 billion \u2014 has trouble justifying bulking up its warehouse network to Amazon's scale, then what competitor can possibly do so? For all the claims that Amazon copies hot-selling products sold on its websites, or unfairly uses data about shoppers' purchases and searches for its own ends, it is Amazon's network of warehouses and its ever-expanding logistics machine that give it an advantage few competitors can match. It's not only the size and scope of Amazon's logistics operation that gives it a leg up. Amazon is not shy about trumpeting what it says is the technological supremacy of its package stowing and sorting centers. An executive recently told the Financial Times that computerized scanners and cameras in more than 20 Amazon warehouses are making it easier to track and retrieve items. Amazon isn't alone in widening its moat. Last week, Alphabet's Google announced the latest privately funded undersea cable between Europe and Africa. That kind of infrastructure used to be built by consortia of telecommunications providers, but it has become common for Facebook, Microsoft and Google to go their own way. This year, Google has said it will spend more than $13 billion just in the U.S. on data centers and other real estate. (All that sophisticated computing infrastructure isn't infallible. Facebook confirmed on Wednesday that people were having problem with videos and photos on Facebook and Instagram.) In the last 12 months, the five biggest U.S. technology companies recorded nearly $90 billion of combined capital spending \u2014 big-ticket item such as computer data centers, internet cables, specialized equipment to build computer chips, warehouses and other real estate. The figure has more than doubled since 2015, Bloomberg data show. It's fair to say that $90 billion buys a lot of moats. There's probably an Alphabet \"moonshot\" project somewhere to dig literal moats. This kind of advantage for the tech giants is hard to grasp for someone surfing YouTube or placing her third order this month from Amazon. But all those built-up moats give the companies the kind of lead that is far beyond the reach of antitrust cops. \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Ovide is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>The U.S. Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are moving to investigate Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple over their aggressive business practices, and the House Judiciary Committee has announced an antitrust probe of unidentified technology companies.

These include the five American tech giants - Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft - who are spending big money on advocacy and hiring people in front-facing public policy, government relations and public relations roles. PERSONNEL TOUCH Facebook, for example, has brought in Joel Kaplan, former deputy chief of staff to George W Bush, who is now its vice-president of global public policy. Facebook's former general counsel, Ted Ullyot, was also a key aide to Bush. Apple has hired Lisa Jackson, Barack Obama's former Environmental Protection Agency administrator, to be its vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives. </p><p>Apple also has former US vice president Al Gore on its board of directors. Obama's former press secretary James Carney is senior vice-president of global corporate affairs at Amazon. Microsoft had hired Hillary Clinton's chief strategist for her 2008 presidential campaign, Mark Penn, as its corporate vice-president for strategic and special projects. Google too had its share of former policy-makers on their staff list - Caroline Atkinson, who had served as Obama's deputy national security adviser for international economics, was its head of global policy, while its former vice-president for public policy Susan Molinari was a three-term member of the US House of Representatives. READ: Commentary: We have entered the age of stakeholder capitalism. The role of business has changed And it is not just in the US that tech companies have signed on former bureaucrats. Nick Clegg, the former British deputy prime minister, is now Facebook's vice-president for global affairs and communications. Last week, news broke that Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's executive director of communications and planning Kate Purchase has resigned to work as a senior director in Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella's office on communications. Looks like increasingly, Silicon Valley is swapping some of its jeans-clad aloof techies for politically-savvy, grey-suited bureaucrats. ADVOCACY SPENDING If that is not enough, the Big Five have reportedly spent more than half a billion from 2005 to 2018 on advocacy and government relations in a bid to get their voices heard in the formulation of legislation. And this spending isn't slowing down, with Google leading the way. Reports indicate that, at more than US$64 million, the Big Five spent more money in 2018 on engaging governments than before. Out of this, Google has poured in US$21.2 million, 38 per cent more than two years ago and the most in corporate America. Facebook saw record spending at US$12.6 million, while Amazon and Microsoft also invested more in 2018 at US$14 million and US$9.52 million respectively. Apple spent U$6.62 million. There are compelling reasons why big tech companies are hiring former policy wonks and spending all this money in gaining more traction on Capitol Hill. BIG GOVERNMENT BUSINESS First, an obvious reason to cosy up to governments is the lure of lucrative contracts. The advent of artificial intelligence along with new emerging risks such as cyber threats and a developing tech race between the US and China means that many governments are spending big on technology products and services to stay updated. READ: Commentary: A year of reckoning for tech unicorns but it doesn't mean investments are slowing READ: Commentary: If you had to pick - Facebook's Libra or another country's cryptocurrency? In the US, the Trump administration budgeted US$95.7 billion for federal IT in 2018, up from US$90 billion in 2016 with the bulk of the spending going to the defence department. Microsoft, for instance, won a 10-year project worth US$7.6 billion to migrate the US defence department's office IT systems to its Microsoft 365 office solutions system. The company also secured a US$10 billion deal for the JEDI project from the defence department. Clinching government business can be a function of personal relationships with key government leaders. These could end up as deal-breakers. The JEDI project - which is a contract to host data of US' military missions on a cloud platform - reflects this. During the tender process, it was widely reported and expected that Amazon, which had won many other earlier projects from the US government including in defence and national security, would be awarded the contract. Still, other tech companies like IBM and Oracle hoped that the project would be shared between a few companies. They cried foul saying that the contract specifications were made to suit one vendor - Amazon Web Services (AWS). A TRUMP CARD Enter US President Donald Trump, who in July publicly stated he had received complaints about the bidding process and wanted the Pentagon to re-examine the bid. \"I will be asking them to take a look at it very closely to see what's going on because I have had very few things where there's been such complaining,\" Trump said. Amazon has now accused Trump of unfairly interfering with the selection process. READ: Commentary: US Senate has huge powers and responsibilities in impeachment trial Amazon filed an appeal in the federal court in September arguing that it lost the bid to Microsoft as \"the result of improper pressure from Trump, who launched repeated public and behind-the-scenes attacks to steer the JEDI contract away from AWS to harm his perceived political enemy\". Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos also owns the Washington Post, which is at the heart of his public spat with the President, who has often referred to the newspaper as \"fake news\" whenever unfavourable stories are published about him. Amazon knows it has much more to lose than this contract. The AWS, the world's biggest cloud platform, is Amazon's largest revenue generator and has already earned US$25 billion in sales in 2019. Thus, the US$10 billion in 10 years it could earn from the JEDI contract is substantial but not crucial to its bottom-line. At stake is future government contracts as other agencies could follow the Pentagon's lead and look to balance Amazon's market dominance in awarding their own projects in the future. It also gives its competitor, Microsoft, which controls 17 per cent of the cloud market, a bigger runway for future market expansion. With such massive sums of government money at stake, it's not surprising that tech companies are having to work hard to ensure politicians and officials are kept on their side. CULTURE VULTURE Second, Big Tech firms are also increasingly finding out that their relationships with governments are negatively affecting the overall perception of their companies, staff morale and organisational culture in the US. In an annual ranking released by jobs site Glassdoor recently, Google and Facebook saw a downturn in their status as a desirable place to work in the US. READ: Commentary: Workers in the gig economy feel lonely, anxious and powerless Both companies, which had consistently ranked among the top in the Best Places to Work For list, now find themselves outside the top 10, despite climbing to the top of these same rankings in many parts of Asia. Among US employees, Google ranked 11th in 2020 whereas Facebook slid to 23rd spot. This is significant considering that both companies had, in various years, been ranked first. According to anonymous reviews and ratings written by employees on the Glassdoor site, staff at some of these companies are frustrated that their employers run into trouble with the law and lack the leadership to manage these situations effectively. \"Several high-level execs seem to have a pretty weak ethical compass. Increasing number of ethical scandals, antitrust fines etc.,\" one software engineer working at Google in the US for three years said of his employer. TROUBLE IN THE VALLEY Third, as they grow bigger and more powerful, the Silicon Valley giants are getting more attention from regulators and are subjects of federal and state antitrust investigations in the US. Commentary: The US govt is getting closer to a plan to tame Big Tech In the US, Big Tech bashing has become commonplace among politicians, especially in the run up to the 2020 presidential elections. Democratic hopefuls Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have called for the dismantling of these Big Tech companies. The \"techlash\" has also seen governments come down hard on these companies for how they collect, store and manage data. Already coping with a newly-implemented regulatory framework in Europe, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), they are now facing a complicated data protection system in the US where some states are legislating their own privacy acts in the absence of federal oversight. READ: Commentary: Why having access to your Google and Facebook data can be life-changing This increasing regulatory oversight is also true for Big Tech outside of the US. Australia too, for instance, has introduced new legislation of data privacy and ownership. Governments are also exploring how they can get a slice of the Big Tech pie as countries such as Indonesia roll out taxes on digital services. READ: Commentary: MNCs have gotten away with paying less taxes. That must change It appears that the honeymoon period for Big Tech is now over as far as government scrutiny and regulatory oversight go. They have now become a key component of the mainstream political agenda in the US and other parts of the world. They now have to delicately walk a fine line of staying below the radar as far as government scrutiny is concerned while still chasing after those lucrative public sector projects. The need for such guile means that the money being spent on advocacy and government relations is likely just the beginning.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-12197166</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XTR-PPM1-JCDN-13TS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1637\"/><timeReceived>10:42 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MCN International Pte Ltd.

Seed and crop protection companies have been the subject of multiple conspiracy theories claiming world domination of the food supply. The term factory farming has been used on any farm larger than 500 acres. CAFOs have become synonymous with industrial polluters. GMOs and BGH are carcinogens in the minds of consumers, even though science does not back that up. But now, big ag and ag tech are being pushed aside as the fickle finger public opinion points at big technology companies.</p><p> During the pandemic and subsequent shut down of the U.S. economy, certain industries have flourished. One of these is technology. With millions of people shopping on-line, working from home, and doing school remotely, several technology companies have done quite well. Their profits have reached into the hundreds of millions of dollars and, in a few cases, into the billions. As the stock prices of these firms have skyrocketed, the net worth of their CEOs and top management has also increased by hundreds of millions and, in at least one case, over a billion dollars.  Public reaction to this has been negative.</p><p> Even the technology darling Apple lost some of its luster when it revealed it was sitting on a pile of cash on hand of $207.06 billion. This when millions of people had just shelled out over $1000 each for the latest iPhone. Jeff Bezos, owner of Amazon, is the first person in modern history to accumulate a personal fortune of over $100 billion \u2014 and he currently has a net worth of $178 billion, making him the richest man in the world. Other tech giants, including Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and Twitter, are coming in for harsh criticism.</p><p> Democratic politicians are calling for more regulation of these big tech firms. The progressive movement is not happy with this kind of wealth being amassed by private industry. Conservatives are calling for restrictions on social media alleging censorship on conservative opinions. Not to be left out, Congress recently called the heads of big tech to Washington for a tongue lashing. Regardless of who occupies the White House in 2021, anti-trust sentiment will likely be strong in Washington.</p><p> There is something in the American psyche that just distrusts things that are big. In some cases, there is good reason; but, sometimes, there is nothing wrong with being big. In fact, in an ever increasing worldwide and technology-driven economy, being big helps foster innovation. It was innovation that created Apple, Amazon, and the like. It was the drive for innovation that fostered the consolidation in the ag tech area that resulted in global leaders such as Bayer, BASF, and Corteva. While guarding against monopolistic market manipulation is important, breaking up everything that is big can also hurt innovation and advancement.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKIN-6db670c361bab63579ebf992ac43658ca6a66fd6</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289AEBD1C9DDC2 NWBKIN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60M4-C261-JBCN-425V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401917</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"481\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Findlay Publishing Co.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

These are just a few of the technologies being deployed to help fight the COVID-19 pandemic. Surveillance capitalism was a dirty phrase before coronavirus hit. Now, it seems to be business as usual, something investors are pricing into share valuations, as information technology has grown to represent one-quarter of the value of the S&amp;P 500. READ: Commentary: Alibaba makes a whopping US$28 billion bet on its next breakthrough act READ: Commentary: COVID-19 has stripped work to bare bones - was all that excess needed anyway?</p><p> But although the \"techlash\" now seems a thing of the past, the very success of the digital giants and their role in virus fighting may eventually prove their undoing. BIG TECH WILL BECOME MORE POWERFUL AFTER COVID-19 The conventional wisdom is that Big Tech will emerge far bigger and more powerful than ever once the pandemic is over. Amazon is unquestionably the world's most essential retailer, hiring 100,000 extra staff to manage its quarantine-related demand surge. READ: Commentary: If we can share or hitch rides, why not food delivery? READ: Commentary: If we can share or hitch rides, why not food delivery? New York governor Andrew Cuomo has invited former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt to help lay out how to reopen the state. Google and Apple have teamed up to develop a contact tracing system being adopted by numerous governments. Uber is capitalising on lockdown demand for takeout food with a bid for rival Grubhub. Big Tech may seem unstoppable, but that is exactly why it will ultimately be curbed. THE PUSHBACK ON PRIVACY The first post Covid-19 regulatory push is already happening around privacy. Data are being created at the fastest ever rate since the virus made our lives largely virtual. A Bank of America report notes that the volume of data creation is up 50 per cent since the pandemic began in many parts of the west. Tech companies are helping dozens of governments track their citizens. Many of them hope to hang on to the data they are accumulating and, ultimately, to monetise it, particularly in areas such as healthcare. LISTEN: Disruption 101: How COVID-19 is revolutionising work READ: Commentary: Big Tech is showing some love to the US government - which comes as no surprise Google, Amazon, Facebook and Oracle were already trying to make inroads in the sector before COVID-19 hit. Contact tracing is moving ahead all too quickly, although information about the efficacy of surveillance as a public health tool is limited and questioned by some academics. In the UK, there is public scepticism about whether the IT industry can be trusted to design such products in the public interest. In the US, a recent survey showed that only half of Americans would participate in contact tracing, only one-third of them would be willing to share flight and other biometric information to fight the virus, and even fewer would want their wireless location tracked. No wonder both Democrats and Republicans are pushing bills to ensure that any data collected for virus fighting cannot be used for other means. Some European politicians and regulators, including the EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager, are calling for stringent rules and transparency. THE SPOTLIGHT ON CONTENT MODERATION Content moderation is another area ripe for regulatory action. Big Tech companies have been reluctant to police disinformation online, in part because of civil liberty concerns. They also do not want to lose the legal protection that exempts them from responsibility for what users say or do online. But the rapid spread of coronavirus has forced them to take action to delete inaccurate public health information. As one high-level European regulator recently pointed out to me, this makes it hard for these companies to argue that they cannot police misinformation in other areas. The consequence could be that they are forced by law to do so. That would pose a threat to the targeted advertising business model crucial to companies such as Google, Facebook and even Amazon. READ: Commentary: Forwarding a WhatsApp message on COVID-19 news? How to make sure you don't spread misinformation READ: Commentary: Amazon is thriving in a time of COVID-19 THE GROWING ANTI-TRUST CONCERNS The third push will be around antitrust. Amazon may be delivering most of our essential goods, but its incredible size and power also make it much easier for activists to argue it is a monopoly. Critics will seek to have it broken up, forced to pay higher wages to its workers (a number of whom have contracted the virus), provide them with better benefits, or even be turned into a publicly-owned utility. As Pramila Jayapal, a congresswoman from Seattle, put it recently: \"Two things can be true at the same time. A company can be doing tremendous work that is incredibly valued and essential, and it can be treating workers badly.\" That is not a good look as the big companies get bigger and start to gobble up weaker competitors. Senator Amy Klobuchar, the ranking member of the subcommittee on antitrust, said last week that Uber's potential acquisition of Grubhub raised \"serious concerns\" given that consumers and restaurants are now dependent on such services. \"The last thing they need is an increase in the extremely high fees already paid to these companies,\" she said. Senator Elizabeth Warren has already teamed up with Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to call for a moratorium on \"risky\" mergers and acquisitions for the duration of the pandemic. THE NEW TECHLASH Beyond all this, the different ways countries are dealing with trade-offs between public health and economic recovery - as well as surveillance and civil liberty - pose another challenge. We will probably see an evermore nationalistic technology sector, with different rules emerging for different regions. The shift will limit global growth opportunities for some platforms. Last year's techlash may be gone, but it is certainly not forgotten.

Still reasonably youthful but old enough to have spawned an entire new generation of internet wunderkinder. The young start-ups include ride-hailing app Didi Chuxing, smartphone maker Xiaomi and Meituan Dianping, which delivers food and other services, and are valued at a combined US$132 billion, according to CB Insights. But as these companies diversify and command ever-higher valuations could they dislodge the leaders?</p><p> READ: A commentary on the valuation problem facing China's tech darlings. NO BREADTH The consensus, much of it with vested interests, believes not. The more established start-ups such as Didi lack their predecessors   breadth and, hence, ability to tie users in to anything like the same extent as either Tencent or Alibaba, both of which are also investors in Didi. Where Didi is branching out, into areas such as autonomous driving, it is doing so within its core business. Xiaomi, which is due to launch an initial public offering in Hong Kong in July, has sought to create a similar ecosystem to the Chinese behemoths  \" but it is far smaller. Tencent-backed Meituan is the closest contender, having recently added ride-hailing services to its suite of offerings, but it too is on a much smaller scale. More interesting perhaps are the newest challengers: The next generation of start-ups that are snipping at specific areas of relative weakness at the big tech conglomerates. E-commerce company Pinduoduo spotted a niche in value-focused shopping and rushed in, elbowing out JD.com to become the number two player in the country in terms of transactions. It has done so by finding under-served niches and meeting their needs  \" in this case, bargain-basement priced goods for rural residents and those in smaller cities. Tech company Bytedance first grabbed attention with Toutiao, the country  s biggest news aggregator. Its video app Douyin has also taken China by storm, capturing 124 million monthly users since it was launched 18 months ago. That success has nudged Alibaba and Tencent into raising their stakes in the short-video streaming service. OLD ORDER REMAINS But not even these are seen as upsetting the old order: rather, one industry player dubs this third generation   roman candles , a reference to the fireworks that flare brightly before quickly fizzling out. There are several reasons. First, Tencent and Alibaba have assiduously invested in the next generation of technology companies: Tencent has a portfolio of more than 600 stakes and holdings across a range of sectors and industries. Second, the giant tech groups have built not just conglomerates but ecosystems. Whether your app is selling music or restaurant reviews, you need traffic, which means plenty of start-ups are perfectly happy to work on their platforms. This symbiotic relationship is key to keeping start-ups on side, and turning them into revenue-spinners as well as investments. Ultimately, both Alibaba and Tencent want to keep users on their platforms as long as possible  \" and the more entertaining apps they have, the easier that is to achieve. BEIJING PREFERS A FEW BIG PLAYERS Third, it is political. Beijing prefers to regulate a few big players rather than shoals of unruly ones. Peer-to-peer lending, for example, offers a graphic illustration of what can happen when multiple players are unleashed. The sector has been hit by Ponzi schemes, evaporating funds and angry investors. Hence, the People  s Bank of China, the country  s central bank, continues to clamp down on the financial technology sector, moving last week to require balances held in customers   electronic wallets to be lodged in a central custody account. The same is true of content platforms. Censorship against information labelled   subversive  has ramped up this year. It even ensnared the children  s cartoon character Peppa Pig, which was banned from Douyin after authorities declared that it was being used subversively in user-generated content. Beijing also prefers a tight band of champions so that the country can forge ahead in areas prioritised by the state, such as artificial intelligence. Of course, politics cuts both ways. As plenty of one-time high-flying companies have discovered, a change in the political winds can quickly clip corporate wings. Tencent and Alibaba have both had brushes with the state, despite treading a careful line. But that wild card apart, the duo look sufficiently entrenched to celebrate a few more birthdays as leaders of the Chinese internet. B) 2018 The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

I don't mean this as a criticism, just a statement of fact.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One of the great things about America is that politics - never mind political philosophy - isn't a big part of most people's lives. Associating a body of ideas with the institutions (political parties) that are directly charged with putting ideas into action is a pragmatic way to cut to the chase. Paying attention to what the eggheads and theorists of the left and right want the parties to do is worthwhile only if you're especially interested in politics.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The challenge for conservatives these days is that the Republican Party really doesn't know what it's for, beyond defending President Trump and opposing Democrats and socialism. While the fight over impeachment sucks up all of the oxygen in public, there's a robust battle behind the scenes about what it means to be a conservative.</p><p>Some of it has spilled out into public view, usually centering on nationalism - what it means, what it requires in terms of policy, how it differs from traditional conservatism or whether it differs at all. Sens. Josh Hawley and Marco Rubio, for example, have offered thoughtful versions of \"economic nationalism,\" pitting it against libertarianism (both real and imagined).</p><p>There are many different schools of thought here, but a common theme is the idea that government should be more interventionist in the economy: Policymakers should be more willing to overrule the marketplace on everything from big tech to child care to trade.</p><p>Republicans were outraged by the way the Obama administration \"picked winners and losers\" in the economy. Some were appalled when Obama bailed out automakers with a massive handout. Trump has now given more aid to farmers than Obama ever gave Detroit, and if an elected Republican has complained about it, I missed it. In fairness, the farmer bailouts were necessitated by the president's trade wars. But that just demonstrates Republicans' willingness to substitute their judgment for the market's.</p><p>There's a cultural version of the nationalist project as well. Some conservative intellectuals - mostly, but not exclusively, Catholic - believe the state has a role in imposing its judgment in the marketplace of ideas.</p><p>I have strong views about all of this, but I thought it might be helpful to offer a few humble suggestions about how to think about such things as these debates heat up.</p><p>First, the root of conservatism is conservation. The great conservative philosopher Roger Scruton, who died earlier this month, said, \"Conservatism starts from a sentiment that all mature people can readily share: the sentiment that good things are easily destroyed, but not easily created.\" This sentiment is at the heart of conservatism, but it's not constrained by ideology or partisanship. Many liberals (and even some socialists) have displayed this temperament.</p><p>Second, with the great divide in conservative theory, there are those who are anti-left and those who are anti-state. For a crude illustration, some people are opposed to public schools because they don't think education is a proper task for the state. (Milton Friedman called them \"government schools.\") Others on the right think public schools are fine; they just object to how progressives operate them, filling kids' heads with objectionable ideas.</p><p>Obviously, most libertarian purists are in the anti-state camp, but for most conservatives it's a balancing act. A consistent conservative can be libertarian on nearly all policy questions and still favor regulating or banning pornography.</p><p>Outside of foreign policy, I'm very libertarian at the national level, mostly libertarian at the state level and pretty communitarian at the local level. Letting people live the way they want to live, so long as basic civil rights are respected, has always struck me as the best way to maximize happiness and democratic accountability.</p><p>This raises a final question: Can the state actually do what you want it to do?</p><p>At the core of the conservative critique of the left has always been a basic skepticism that top-down planning from Washington can work. It used to be that the champions of such planning were mostly on the left. That's not true any longer. It remains to be seen whether top-down planning from the right works any better than it does from the left.</p><p>Jonah Goldberg is a fellow with the American Enterprise Institute and editor-in-chief of The Dispatch.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PSTCUR-ad0034d2c4cf54bfb0de45bbea6d7d56</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PSTCUR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y2C-35W1-JCB8-W2KG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">146816</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"753\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Post and Courier All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Post &amp;

They have so far proven to be resilient, mostly as a result of the stricter capital and liquidity requirements imposed on them following the global financial crisis. Today, many governments are using banks to channel funds to households and firms hit by the pandemic's economic fallout. Furthermore, governments have granted banks a temporary moratorium on implementing tougher regulatory and supervisory standards, in order to reduce the potential pro-cyclicality of measures introduced in the last two decades and avert a credit crunch. </p><p>As a result, banks now have an opportunity to reverse the reputational damage they suffered in the financial crisis. NOT OUT OF THE WOODS YET But they are not out of trouble, in part because the crisis will sharply increase the volume of non-performing loans. Moreover, the pandemic will accentuate pre-existing pressures - in particular, low interest rates and digital disruption - on bank profitability. Digitalisation will now advance rapidly, because both banks and customers have realized that they can work and operate remotely in a safe and efficient way. READ: Commentary: Artificial intelligence and automation would actually benefit Singapore READ: Commentary: The biggest restructuring exercise facing Singapore businesses has just begun The resulting increase in information-technology investments will render many banks' overextended branch networks obsolete sooner than they expected, particularly in Europe. That will necessitate a deep restructuring of the sector. Medium-size banks will suffer because they will find it difficult to generate the cost efficiencies and IT investment needed in the new environment. Although consolidation could offer stressed banks a way out, political obstacles to cross-border mergers will likely arise in several jurisdictions as governments become more protective of national banking systems. In Europe, for example, where banking nationalism has been running high (with the exception of the United Kingdom), domestic consolidation seems more likely. STIFFER COMPETITION In addition, banks may face renewed competition from shadow banks and new digital entrants that were already challenging the traditional bank business model before the pandemic. In the United States, financial-technology firms, or fintechs, have made important inroads in mortgages and personal loans. And in emerging markets, \"Big Tech\" - large digital platforms, such as Alipay in China - have come to dominate some market segments such as payment systems. The rapid digital shift resulting from lockdown measures to combat COVID-19 suggests that the pace of change in the banking sector may take everyone by surprise. That acceleration may in turn also hasten the adoption of different forms of digital currencies, including by central banks. By further reducing entry and exit barriers in the financial-services market, digitalisation will increase competitive pressures and constrain incumbent banks' profitability in the short run. READ: Commentary: Support for mid-career jobseekers is welcomed. But expectations need to be managed READ: Commentary: Annual performance reviews - an archaic HR practice we must disrupt But its long-term impact is more uncertain, and will depend on the market structure that eventually prevails. One possible outcome is that a few dominant platforms - perhaps some of the current digital giants, plus some transformed incumbents - control access to a fragmented customer base that inhabits different financial ecosystems. In this case, customers would register their demands on a platform, and financial-services providers would compete to supply them. The degree of platform rivalry and level of customer service would depend on the costs of switching from one ecosystem to another: the higher they are, the less competitive the market will be. A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD Bank regulators have already adapted to the post-pandemic world by relaxing the implementation timetable for capital requirements. In addition, digital disruption will require them to balance fostering competition and innovation with the need to safeguard financial stability. In order to do so, regulators must ensure a level playing field, and coordinate prudential regulation and competition policy with data policies. This will require navigating complex tradeoffs among the system's stability and integrity, efficiency and competitiveness, and privacy. The pandemic and its fallout will test the resilience of the financial system and of the regulatory reforms introduced after the global financial crisis. The first report by IESE Business School's Banking Initiative last year concluded that these measures had made banking sounder, but that some work remained to be done, particularly concerning shadow banking. The response to the current crisis will stretch the limits of central-bank intervention - especially in Europe, where sovereign-debt sustainability may become a more salient issue over the medium term. Furthermore, the crisis will test the eurozone's banking union, which remains incomplete without common deposit insurance. Banks have a chance to improve their battered public image by playing a constructive role in mitigating the current economic crisis. But with COVID-19 set to accelerate the sector's digitalisation and restructuring, their future could soon become more uncertain. READ: Commentary: Were you fired or retrenched?

For free speech advocates, Facebook's about-face is progress. It is finally taking action but resisting calls to censor polititians. American voters will continue to see Trump's ugliest utterances, along with Facebook's labels that call him out. And that will help any of us who have not already made up our minds decide whether we can take another four years. </p><p>READ: Commentary: Is Facebook cosying up to US President Donald Trump? READ: Commentary: Ticket against Donald Trump in White House race missing boldest choice WHAT A DIFFERENCE A MONTH MAKES Facebook employees staged a virtual walkout of work when the platform did nothing about a Trump post about protests following the police killing of George Floyd in May. Trump had posted \"when the looting starts, the shooting starts\", echoing threats of police against civil rights protesters in the 1960s. Twitter flagged the tweet with a warning label. Facebook said the corresponding post did not qualify as incitement that violates its rules, although CEO Mark Zuckerberg promised to review guidelines. READ: Commentary: Twitter may have just helped Trump get re-elected Then came the boycott. On Jun 17, the Anti-Defamation League, an organisation that has long stood against anti-Semitism, partnered with the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People and other civil rights groups. They launched a campaign, \"Stop Hate for Profit\", asking advertisers to boycott Facebook and Instagram during July. Activists criticised Facebook for the \"vast proliferation of hate\" on its platforms and for allowing what they consider incitement to violence against protesters. Their campaign calls for removal of private groups peddling hate, misinformation or conspiracies. It asks Facebook to provide support for individual victims of hate and harassment and to submit to reports from independent auditors on action taken. Popular American brands joined the boycott campaign, including Ben &amp; Jerry's, Patagonia, The North Face and REI. The Wall Street Journal reported that Facebook emailed advertisers saying, \"We do not make policy changes tied to revenue pressure\". READ: Commentary: Big Tech's coronavirus boom could be its undoing READ: Commentary: The world's most powerful teenager? Facebook But on Friday, Unilever said it is going further by suspending advertising on Facebook platforms and Twitter for the rest of 2020. The British-Dutch conglomerate is one of the world's largest advertisers. It spent US$42 million last year on Facebook ads for its brands, including Dove and Lipton. Facebook's stock price plunged - over 8 per cent by Friday's close, representing US$56 billion of market value. Suddenly Facebook's policy review was done. Zuckerberg announced it will start labelling content that violates policies. He also said it will ban ads that claim that immigrants or racial or religious groups threaten the physical safety or health of others. THIS TIME IS DIFFERENT Does anyone remember that Tesla, Mozilla and other advertisers boycotted Facebook in April 2018? Revelations emerged that it failed to prevent Cambridge Analytica from exploiting Facebook users' data. The political consulting firm targeted propaganda to voters during the 2016 US presidential election and the UK's Brexit referendum. Some users even initiated a \"Delete Facebook\" campaign. READ: Commentary: Facebook's fake news crisis is a product of Silicon Valley culture But the efforts fizzled out as advertisers and users alike eventually returned. Facebook's digital advertising network is second only to Google's. They need Facebook as much as it needs them because the platform can micro-target advertising to billions of users. Users found it would be difficult to move their whole network to another social media platform, and few choices were available besides Instagram - which Facebook owns. Today, Facebook stock is worth some 50 per cent more than it was after the 2018 revelations. Some industry observers predict that the new boycott's impact on the bottom line would be likewise negligible. Facebook has some 8 million advertisers and generated US$70 billion in revenue in 2019. Investor Roger McNamee pointed out that no advertiser represents even 1 per cent of its revenue. READ: Commentary: Big Tech is showing some love to the US government - which comes as no surprise But this boycott demands Facebook's response. The 2018 boycott was about data privacy and allowing election interference with uncertain effects. Outrage about those issues can't compare to the reckoning with racism in America and around the world since Floyd's death. Demonstrators have taken to the streets for a month. Polls found a majority of Americans support the protests and disapprove of the president's response. Brands, incensed at seeing their ads appear next to nasty content, see an opportunity to take a stand. Even if Facebook is confident that most advertisers will return and users will stay, it is in the spotlight. It can't risk appearing unresponsive during a watershed moment. Participants in the boycott deserve praise for using their brands' clout, even if pausing ads for a month is a modest gesture at a convenient time, with ad budgets cut during the pandemic. READ: Commentary: George Floyd's death and the rising spectre of a race-based US election FACEBOOK'S COMPROMISE: A LITTLE BIT FOR EVERYONE This time, Facebook has appeared to relent by giving boycotters something: Labels. But it is holding on to its espoused free speech principles, and may even avoid Trump's fury. Facebook is free to censor users under US law, but Zuckerberg has long stressed the need even for falsehoods and offensive views to circulate, including those of elected officials. He has a point. Keeping up the looting-shooting post, along with countless others, serves the public interest. We can debate, support or condemn it, and use it to judge the source. Zuckerberg stands by the time-honoured maxim of free expression: The answer to noxious speech is almost always more speech, not censorship. Whether he supports that principle because controversy attracts eyeballs or because he sincerely believes it, he shouldn't abandon it lightly. Putting a label on a rule-breaking post is an ideal compromise. The post circulates along with more speech - the platform's warning. READ: Commentary: Why George Floyd's death could tilt the US election - in Trump's favour READ: Commentary: Could Donald Trump not run for re-election? And Facebook still reserves the right to take down the most extreme content. Zuckerberg said on Friday that posts determined to \"lead to violence or deprive people of their right to vote\" won't be tolerated, even if made by politicians. Some have suggested that Facebook's fear of alienating Trump and his ultra-loyal base explains Facebook's previous reluctance to touch Trump's posts. The stakes are high: Trump could take his posts to Parler, a Twitter-like platform gaining traction among conservatives. Deleting his posts might provoke Trump to repeat threats of regulation. By contrast, a few more warning flags may not please the president, but he and his campaign can work with them. His supporters may see those flags as further evidence that their straight-talking hero is telling it like it is, and proof of Big Tech's bias against him. FAR ENOUGH? Labels don't go far enough for the Stop Hate campaign. Among their updated recommendations, they want Facebook to prohibit falsehoods in political ads, which it has previously resisted. Nor are labels enough for other brands that have paused social media advertising since Zuckerberg's announcement: Coca-Cola, Starbucks, Pepsi, Ford and Microsoft. The campaigners hope more global brands are next. On Monday, Facebook went a bit further, agreeing to the independent audits that the boycott demanded and a ban on groups that are part of the far-right \"boogaloo\" movement. With the boycott growing, more measures will probably be necessary - but, free speech advocates hope, not aggressive censorship. As the day approaches when voters decide the president's political fate, social media should allow us to continue to see him for who he is through his offensive outpourings on their platforms.

Cohen, in fact, said she has personally recommended this to the Trump administration.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Cohen believes that, as a supplement to President Donald Trump\u2019s prolific tweeting, the White House should create an internet radio station to carry the president\u2019s speeches and staff interviews, and set up a news app, which would cost users $1, to fund programs for military veterans.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Cohen, like many of her fellow conservatives, is frustrated by the national media not giving Trump a fair shake \u2014 a problem compounded by Big Tech\u2019s biased masking of right-wing content.</p><p> I get where Cohen is coming from. But the last thing Americans should desire, regardless of who holds power, is for the government to set up anything that could be construed as a \"news\" outlet. Think Izvestia. Minju Choson. Granma. The Washington Post (when a Democrat occupies the Oval Office).</p><p> Yet worse than what Cohen wants is Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 proposal to \"save\" journalism, should he become president, as outlined in a lengthy op-ed he published in August in the Columbia Journalism Review.</p><p> Naturally, Sanders cites Trump\u2019s \"authoritarian bullying\" of the media as one cause of journalism\u2019s current woes. Yeah, the media is so bullied by Trump that it calls him a racist, sexist tyrant just 23 hours out of every day instead of 24.</p><p> But, if he becomes president, the Vermont Independent promises to unleash battalions of Sandersnista regulatory agents to intervene in newsrooms to a degree that should send shudders down the spines of reporters, editors, publishers and broadcasters everywhere.</p><p> Bernie\u2019s mission is to take the fight to those who seek \"further expansion of oligarchic business models\" that can only \"make matters worse\" for journalists, and by extension the public.</p><p> That entails, for instance, blocking media mergers until his regulators can deem them safe for \"democracy,\" or are convinced such deals won\u2019t \"adversely affect people of color and women.\" How that gets measured or determined is anyone\u2019s guess.</p><p> The Sanders regime also would mandate WARN notices if \"corporate transactions and merger proposals\" mean \"significant\" layoffs. And his administration would require employees be granted right of first refusal to buy their newspapers or news stations if the owner intends to sell.</p><p> Bernie maintains that Trump\u2019s green-lighting of ownership of multiple news outlets in the same market could turn \"your community into a one-newsroom town.\" Some of us might argue that\u2019s better than a no-newsroom town. Still, Bernie promises \"new, progressive leadership\" to overturn Team Trump\u2019s reforms that facilitated cross-pollination of holdings by media company owners in a single market.</p><p> Bernie\u2019s bro-euacrats would put media consolidation ventures under the antitrust microscope, as would the Zuckerbergs and Pichais of the online world \"to prevent them from using their enormous market power to cannibalize, bilk and defund news organizations.\"</p><p> Moreover, Sanders would enact a \"Workplace Democracy Plan\" that would \"boost media workers\" laudable efforts\" to unionize. Union workers comprise 6.4% of the private-sector workforce, and union membership overall has been halved in the last 35 years. Yet newsrooms, Detroit and professional sports seem to be the last bastions for organized labor in corporate America. So Bernie may find allies on this one.</p><p> And speaking of collective bargaining, Sanders seeks to empower media organizations to do that with Big Tech to protect smaller media operations. He also promotes a tax on Silicon Valley\u2019s targeted ads to raise money \"to fund nonprofit civic-minded media,\" just as \"other countries already fund independent public media.\"</p><p> Journalism may be suffering. But its contemporary woes are not the fault of Trump or the billionaire CEOs Bernie loves to hate, and tax. So, his rescue plan reveals the mindset of an idealistic, Maoist campus hippy from the \u201970s who has never had to make a payroll.</p><p> \"Legacy media\" at all levels is transitioning, and struggling to figure out the next step while being buffeted by changing consumer tastes, reduced public trust and web-oriented technological shifts that have expanded the universe of those who gather, disseminate and profit from the news.</p><p> Bernie maintains he is for \"independent\" media, but no media outlet owner in their right mind who hopes to survive would dare assert independence in the face of this regulatory onslaught. If Bernie wins next year, we might not get the state-run alternative that Adriana Cohen wants for Trump. But we will get government infringement on media operations in a way such that we won\u2019t be able to tell the difference.</p><p>     Bill Thompson (<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:bill.thompson@theledger.com\">bill.thompson@theledger.com</email>) is the editorial page editor of The Ledger in Lakeland, Florida.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKNY-5728700</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289A18A10ADB99 NWBKNY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X5M-3K41-DXVP-V1Y2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399552</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"807\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Evening Telegram<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

And with the UK set to hold a crucial parliamentary election on Dec 12, it still is not clear whether, when, and how Brexit will happen. But assuming the UK does leave the EU, its next government will need to begin the long, difficult process of negotiating new relationships with the rest of the world. That will involve tough choices, one of the thorniest of which is whether the UK should align its regulations in key economic sectors with those of the EU or the United States. Where, then, is Britain headed?</p><p> SIDLING UP TO THE US Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants the UK to reach a trade and investment agreement with the US after Brexit. After all, America is the UK's largest single-country trade partner and its biggest source (and destination) of foreign direct investment. In seeking such a deal, however, the UK would have to decide how far it is willing to realign its regulatory regimes with those of the US. Closer alignment with the US would create new barriers to trade with the EU, which is a much larger market for UK exports. READ:Commentary: Looks like Boris Johnson's scorch-earth no-deal Brexit may be Britain's endgame READ: UK defends Brexit deal after Trump trade warning Moreover, the prospect of adopting US standards - on drug pricing, the environment, food standards, and animal welfare, for example - is already creating a public backlash in Britain. As the UK prepares for life after Brexit, regulatory tensions with the US and EU could potentially flare up in two other important sectors. REGULATING BANKS AND FINANCE The first is banking and finance. In 2018, the UK's financial services sector contributed US$170 billion to the economy, or 6.9 per cent of total output, provided 1.1 million jobs (3.1 per cent of the total), and paid some US$37 billion in tax in the UK tax year from 2017 to 2018. The sector also generated US$77 billion worth of exports in 2017, against US$19 billion in imports. But the financial services sector poses huge risks if it is not adequately regulated. The 2008 financial crisis reduced UK national output by 7 per cent, wiped out one million jobs, caused wages to fall by 5 per cent below 2007 levels, and brought bank lending to a halt. All parts of the UK and much of the world felt the catastrophic impact. After the crisis, an independent commission made a clear case for regulatory reform to protect the British public and the public purse from reckless bank lending. Policymakers in the EU and the US also accepted the need for robust regulation. READ: Commentary: Why are we playing chicken with global recession risks? Today, however, America and Europe are pursuing sharply divergent approaches. EU regulators continue to strengthen prudential rules and capital requirements, especially for very large banks, and are widening the ambit of regulation to cover every asset and profession in the financial services industry. The US, by contrast, has reversed course under President Donald Trump, whose administration has set about undoing core elements of the regulations implemented after the financial crisis. The US government's agenda now includes lowering capital requirements, weakening stress testing and \"living wills\" for banks, and allowing more proprietary trading and unregulated derivatives dealing. READ: Fears of a financial crisis around corner drive US Fed's rate cuts It is also intent on rolling back consumer and investor protections, reducing prudential regulation of systemically significant banks, undermining the regulation of non-banks and the shadow banking system, reducing funding for research and monitoring of the financial industry, and taking a hands-off approach to enforcing securities laws. Some investors would benefit hugely from US-style financial deregulation in the UK, and will continue to push for it. But their quest for profits over systemic safety would jeopardise the hard-won regulatory measures that currently protect the UK public from a repeat of the 2008 crisis. It would also damage the City of London's place at the heart of European finance. READ: Commentary: The depressing costs of Brexit to Britain To date, the UK has taken a robust approach to financial regulation and implemented measures that go beyond those introduced by EU regulators. These include a new regime aimed at holding senior bankers accountable for their decisions, and ring-fencing large banks' retail operations to protect customers' deposits from shocks to the wider financial system. And because the UK public broadly supports these measures, the post-Brexit government will presumably be hesitant to weaken them. REGULATING BIG TECH The second challenge for the UK after Brexit will be handling the big US technology companies. Earlier this year, a UK Parliament report found that Facebook \"intentionally and knowingly violated both data privacy and anti-competition laws\". Yet the size and global reach of the big tech firms make it hard for any non-US government to regulate or influence them. Instead, the EU has led the way in enshrining citizens' rights to data privacy, through its General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Furthermore, the European Commission has adopted a stance strongly in favour of protecting competition and limiting the digital giants' market dominance. In March, the Commission fined Google US$1.7 billion for blocking rivals in the online advertising market - the third time it has penalised the company for antitrust violations. The US government, however, strongly supports the free movement of data, which big American tech companies want, while Trump has previously been quick to criticise the Commission for fining Google. READ: Commentary: The US govt is getting closer to a plan to tame Big Tech The UK relies heavily on the big global tech firms, all of which are American or Chinese, and must therefore try to regulate them. Once it leaves the EU, it will face a choice between giving in to US pressure or finding a way to mirror EU regulation, including the GDPR and the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework. WHO ARE UK'S \"STEADFAST ALLIES\"? Brexiteers claim that the UK can create its own \"global strategy\" and do things \"Britain's way\" after it leaves the EU. In 2016, for example, then-Prime Minister Theresa May said that after Brexit, the UK would rely upon its \"steadfast allies\" to establish an alternative to the EU's Galileo satellite navigation system. Three years later, however, with Trump in the White House and the UK in a much weaker negotiating position with the EU, it is not clear who these steadfast allies are. And even harder choices await the government that emerges after Dec 12.

One of my fellow academics Matthew Liao at the New York University has argued in the New York Times that it is immoral to have a Facebook account. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Presidential aspirant in the 2020 election has called for a breakup of the big tech companies including Google, Facebook and Amazon, an idea that has received support from several different quarters. READ: US lawmakers are gearing up for antitrust action against Big Tech, a commentary Today, I am going to admit to something that I find to be perfectly moral and good for me. I love Google and several of its products. </p><p>Let me explain why. VALUABLE FOR TEACHING AND RESEARCH I have been a user of Google search for as long as I can remember, because I find it to be extremely valuable in my teaching and research. When I am doing either of those tasks, I value the quality of results such as interesting data on business phenomenon (including charts available through search of Google images) and relevant academic papers. Google search gives me the most accurate and wide-ranging results. Most importantly, it costs me nothing. I use it several times a day for work as well as for my other interests including sports trivia (especially Cricket trivia), history and increasingly for searching flights and for checking flight status (which is often faster and more accurate than the airline website itself). As an academic, I am interested in how many people have cited my work. The higher this number, the greater the (supposed) impact of my work. Google, again, comes to the rescue. Google Scholar is free and the most comprehensive among the different alternative citation databases, many of which (e.g., databases from various publishers) are subscription based. READ: Disruption is coming for Singapore business schools, a commentary A third product I use is Gmail. It gives me a large storage capacity, separates \"real\" mail from promotions and social mails and is extremely quick in delivering my emails to the intended recipient. While I started out using Gmail for personal use, I am increasingly using it for my work as well, primarily because my employer-provided email is clunky, not as quick in delivering messages and its search (within the email box) function is far worse than Gmail. WHAT'S WRONG WITH MONOPOLIES? When I was doing my economics courses, I was taught that one way a monopolist captures consumer welfare is by reducing supply which will lead to higher prices (e.g., the OPEC cartel which tries to act like a monopolist, attempts (unsuccessfully) to hold back the oil production). READ: With Grab's super app ambitions, who will it eat for lunch? A commentary Neither reduced supply, nor elevated prices are relevant for arguing that Google is a monopoly - its products are widely available to users without any restrictions on supply and are free. Google does charge money to advertisers, however. It is almost impossible to determine whether these prices are monopolistic. My guess would be that they are not. According to recent data provided by Statista, search advertising is a much smaller market than display advertising online. There are clearly many more players in display online advertising - e.g., almost any content provider such as news sites (including the Financial Times), sports sites (espn.com), financial information sites (fool.com) - than Google. Thus any advertiser has many options besides Google and if one extends the boundaries of the market to offline advertisements (e.g., TV, print etc.), Google's position becomes even less dominant. SHIFTING GOALPOSTS Google sceptics want to shift the goalposts and define monopoly based on criteria other than the usual metrics of supply and prices. I will argue below that the case against Google as a monopoly doesn't hold, whatever definition of monopoly one adopts. A firm with great market power (e.g. a monopolist) can \"hurt\" (extract value from) the other stakeholders. Some years ago, detractors of Walmart which then enjoyed significant market power argued that while Walmart provided low prices to customers, it paid its employees poorly. READ: Walmart goes green, but grapples with what is 'sustainable enough' for shoppers, a commentary This clearly isn't true in Google's case. Google is among the best paymasters. I will be delighted if my son, who is pursuing a degree in Computer Science, gets an offer from Google when he graduates. Google doesn't harm the environment either, other than in a very indirect way by helping us use computers and Internet more. But, if one wishes to pursue this line of reasoning that greater use of computers is bad for the environment, then we, as users, are more at fault than Google. Another argument proposed by Google sceptics is that with its market power, Google may be able to restrict competition and stifle new entrants. I find this argument to be hollow. From a business perspective, Google search is essentially an advertising platform. Since Google became dominant, many new players have emerged that use advertising to generate revenues. Facebook, an alternative advertising platform, has in fact twice the number of sites linking into it versus Google, which on paper makes it more powerful. According to data compiled by Amazon, there are several sites such as Yahoo.com, Wikipedia.org (no advertising), Twitter.com, Live.com (operated by Microsoft, a Google rival), besides the e-commerce giant Amazon.com, which are among the top 15 sites. In fact, collectively, the number of users visiting these sites is far greater than Google, making it difficult to argue that Google is dominant. China based sites such as Baidu.com Qq.com and Taobao.com were not even included in the above list and their inclusion would further dilute Google's alleged market power. READ: Can China's superstar tech giants win over reluctant US customers? IT HAS FAILED MANY TIMES TOO If Google was omnipotent and really able to exclude potential competition, then it would be successful in almost everything it tried. But, Google has failed many times. Its social network Google+ was a failure and was disbanded recently. Other failed initiatives include Google Glass, Google Answers (have you heard of it?) and Google Health. Apparently, the wealth of information that Google collects through its dominant search engine puts it in a better position to launch new products. If this were true (that is, the information was a huge advantage), Google's above-mentioned failures would be very difficult to explain. It is a fact that a company needs information to come up with innovative products, but to translate that information into innovation, a company needs a lot of other things including a clever strategy and good execution. In my view, the reports of Google's alleged market power are greatly exaggerated. Though Google does dominate search-based advertising, there is a lot more to Internet, online advertising and e-commerce than search-based advertising. I think Google is simply very good at many things and users love its products which are mostly free for them. It would indeed be a travesty if this company (or any other company that offered excellent products at low or zero prices) was regulated based on wrong analysis and reasoning, and hampered from providing consumers the products they appreciate.

Privacy has always been a relative issue for the companies that dominate the consumer internet economy. It is not about aspiring to some absolute standard for protecting user data. Instead, what matters are the generally accepted standards of the time. </p><p>Being able to compare yourself favourably to a competitor who sets the bar lower helps. When things go wrong there is always a mea culpa to deliver and a new, higher ideal to commit to. This has become a tried and true formula for defending one of the most profitable advertising businesses ever invented. But for how much longer? FACEBOOK'S RESPONSE A 'TEXTBOOK EXAMPLE' Facebook  s response to the crisis over the alleged leak of 50 million users   personal data has been a textbook example of how to deal with calls for more outside regulation of a tech company. First, concede you did not live up to the trust of users  \" without being too specific about how you failed. Point out that the problems are historic and you have already changed your policies to deal with them. Then promise some extra protections to raise the privacy bar  \" while not doing anything that will hamper a business model that relies on the collection and use of unprecedented amounts of personal information. READ: A commentary on Facebook's floundering response to the data scandal. A PATTERN A refusal to look to its own shortcomings squarely in the eye has been an essential part of this pattern. Even by the standards of Silicon Valley, where the past is another country, Facebook  s ability to disown its own earlier practices can seem remarkable. Take a company blog post from late last year that brushed off prior failures to prevent users   data from leaking through third-party apps  \" the very issue at the heart of the scandal that has shaken the company this week. At the time, Facebook conceded it was   fair to criticise  its earlier shortcomings. But it also claimed credit for always having cared about privacy, along with the fact that   in the past five years we  ve significantly improved . It was as though past mistakes did not deserve a further thought  \" no matter that, five years before, the company was already public and had just topped 1 billion users. It has promised to take a harder look  \" for the first time  \" at weaknesses in the past that might have led to other instances of wholesale mishandling of personal data. Given the intense political pressure this week, it could hardly not. But in all other respects, Wednesday  s response to the Cambridge Analytica scandal looked like business as usual: Insist that you take the issue seriously, tighten some rules about the sharing of data, but do not do anything that might threaten the Golden Goose. This has worked with other privacy snafus. But will this time be different? INVESTORS SHOULD BE WORRIED The signals from Wall Street suggest it may. Investors have been worrying for some time about new regulations on consumer tech platforms, without anything specific to pin their fears to. Now they have it. All the big tech stocks were caught in a downdraft on Monday, but a bifurcation has been evident. Companies that rely on collecting data to support online advertising businesses  \" Facebook, Google, Twitter  \" have been hit the hardest. In one sign of the shift, Amazon  s stock market value jumped past that of Alphabet, making it second only to Apple. For its part, the iPhone maker, with no advertising business to defend, decided to make its own, heightened commitment to user privacy a differentiator some time ago. Like Microsoft, the company has fought a high-profile case against the US government to defend user data against unwarranted intrusion by law enforcement  \" a badge of honour at a time when other platforms are coming to be seen as promoters of private sector surveillance. ESCAPE AGAIN? The cynical view is that Facebook will escape, once again, with a ticking off and a promise to do better. Unlike Brussels, Washington has shown no taste for privacy legislation. The Federal Trade Commission put the social networking company on a short leash seven years ago after a previous failure, but has done nothing to clamp down on it subsequently. And while many users have expressed outrage this week, there is no evidence of large-scale user defection. History suggests that this storm, like the others, will eventually blow over. But with so much user data at stake  \" and claims that the inviolability of democracy itself may be on the line  \" the stakes have just got a lot higher. B) 2018 The Financial Times Ltd.

Cameras detect littering from high-rise buildings, illegal smoking and e-scooters on footpaths. Singaporeans, it seems, are accustomed to being watched for security and safety, and to curb nuisances. Now, it's increasingly practical to use cameras that not only capture images but recognise faces. READ: Commentary: Why China's social credit system gets thumbs-up from citizens READ: Commentary: Is Huawei dangerous because it's Chinese?</p><p> What about Facebook? Singapore is among nations experimenting with facial recognition at immigration checkpoints. Next, Singapore must choose. It can weave the technology more widely into everyday life, or join those taking a wait-and-see approach. Adopting the technology, along with regulations to maintain public trust, is the smarter approach. GLOBAL DEBATE Worldwide, in recent months, some have scrambled to bar facial recognition while others embrace it. In January, the European Commission considered a five-year moratorium on facial recognition in public places so that the authorities could develop a risk management strategy. Google CEO Sundar Pichai expressed openness to the ban. The Commission ultimately rejected a ban. Both San Francisco and Oakland, California - home to many who work in the tech industry - barred city government from using the technology last year. Then the whole state of California banned law enforcement from using it. Cambridge, Massachusetts - home to Harvard and MIT - just banned it. Berlin also imposed a moratorium. READ: Privacy, data security concerns as facial recognition becomes more common In December, the US dropped a plan to require facial scans of its citizens at immigration checkpoints. In February, two US senators introduced a bill that would impose a moratorium. Meanwhile, in recent days, authorities in India announced trials of facial recognition on railways. Police in London and Moscow announced they will use it in public places to match passers-by to \"wanted\" lists in real-time. Facial recognition is here to stay. A moratorium on it carries its own risk: falling behind other nations in the development of cutting-edge crime-fighting capabilities. Instead, developing controls on the technology can prevent errors and abuses and maintain public trust. INEVITABLE PROLIFERATION One might think that a searchable international database of billions of photos would need central planning and decades to build. The New York Times reported in January that over 600 American law enforcement agencies used the services of Clearview AI. This tiny start-up scraped - that is, it automatically harvested - billions of publicly available images from all sorts of websites, including Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Twitter. When a user uploads a person's photo to the Clearview app, other images of the person appear. By following links to the sources, a user can often get the subject's name and more. READ: Commentary: The uncomfortable choices US tech firms face in investing in booming China Clearview's scraping violates the terms of service of the social media sites. But a US court refused to block such scraping. The Clearview case shows how available the technology is and how easy it is to build a massive database of images. Artificial intelligence experts everywhere know how to design facial recognition technology, because, as Al Gidari of Stanford Law School says: \"There is no monopoly on math\". Those opting for a moratorium on facial recognition can rest assured that friends and foes around the world use it. If others stand still, China looks set to dominate facial recognition. China uses it in subways, airports, and rail stations in the name of public safety and health. To manage the spread of COVID-19, SenseTime, a leading Chinese AI company, unveiled a facial recognition product that incorporates thermal imaging to detect and identify people running a fever. It can scan up to 10 people per second, and has been deployed in public places in Beijing, Shanghai and Shengzhen. But there's the question of overreach. Getting a mobile phone line in China requires facial scans. Limits on data-sharing between private and public sectors are unclear. READ: Commentary: Disruptive tech is coming for COVID-19 threat, but needs more funding READ: Commentary: Tech is not all bad. Our COVID-19 experience shows this Others also have a head start. The US state of Florida began experimenting back in 2000. London has for years been a pioneer. Brexit supporters argued that a reason to leave the EU was to escape its cautious approach to artificial intelligence. RISKS AND SOLUTIONS Those who favour going slowly on facial recognition say we must not be guinea pigs in experiments with error-prone technology. MIT researchers published studies showing that commercially available facial recognition products made more errors in identifying the gender of people with light skin than dark skin. They made more errors in determining the gender of women than men. In December 2019, a US government study found similar biases in most of the hundreds of the algorithms on the market. The probable explanation: Algorithms were trained on more images of light-skinned people than dark-skinned people and more images of men than women. If facial recognition makes more mistakes with some groups than others, using it could be viewed as discrimination. Public trust in it may erode. The risks are vivid in a city as diverse as Singapore. The explanation for the technology's bias also points to a solution. If it's trained on more diverse data, it may perform better. The way to improve the algorithms is not a moratorium, but to develop better algorithms and train them better. READ: Commentary: Bad news. Artificial intelligence is biased READ: Privacy, data security concerns as facial recognition becomes more common ITERATION Breezing through immigration checkpoints without presenting a document is an appealing vision. But the crime-fighting potential of facial recognition makes experimenting with it urgent. The technology has been used to rescue victims of child sex abuse, to catch perpetrators of these and other crimes, and to identify bodies of murder victims. The New York police commissioner has argued: It would be an injustice to the people we serve if we policed our 21st-century city without using 21st-century technology. Microsoft's president Brad Smith said: \"There is only one way at the end of the day to make technology better and that is to use it\". As callous as it sounds, technological development proceeds through trial and error - through iteration. Automobile and air travel, and countless medical procedures, were once far riskier than we would tolerate now. The way forward is to refine the technology, deploy it, and learn from mistakes. And set the rules. READ: Commentary: The rise of the digital economy and tech-driven inequality REGULATION IS THE BEST PROTECTION A compromise between standing still and proceeding unfettered is to regulate the technology to maintain trust. In a deviation from the usual Silicon Valley approach - \"move fast and break things\" - both Google's Pichai and Microsoft's Smith have advocated AI regulation. Simon Chesterman, dean of the National University of Singapore Faculty of Law, has wisely observed that it's hard to anticipate, when a technology like facial recognition is in its infancy, what regulations are required. That said, no matter how facial recognition develops, certain legal questions are inevitable. Answers are worth considering now. False positives - saying your face matches one from a wanted list when you are not on the list - are an entirely foreseeable, dire problem. Before a facial recognition technology is relied on to make arrests, it could be legally required to meet high reliability standards across demographic groups in field trials. Laws could require that before an arrest, a person's identity must be confirmed through multiple methods, not just a camera saying it's a match. Should facial recognition cameras be installed in most public places, people worry that they will be continuously tracked and lose anonymity. A warrant could be required before law enforcement can use the cameras to monitor an individual as she goes about the city, or before stored footage is checked to see where she has been. Exceptions could be made for emergencies. Rules can determine how long such data is kept and how securely. READ: Commentary: The ubiquity of cameras and social media fuels unhealthy mob behaviours Microsoft has backed requiring court orders to track individuals with facial recognition. US law has precedents: It generally allows data collection in public, but some exceptions require a warrant. People don't like surprises about how their data is used. An everyday example: Many find it creepy to browse online for a pair of shoes and then get shoe ads for weeks. Ideally, people want notification about - and they want to consent to - handling of their data. Law enforcement must sometimes forgo notification and consent to avoid tipping off the targets of investigations. But the closer governments come to meeting those ideals, the more likely they are to maintain trust. In Hong Kong and worldwide, some fear that facial recognition could be used to monitor government critics. They want reassurance about limits on its use. Protocols for when government employees can access facial data may prevent abuses like a rogue officer tracking an ex-girlfriend. The sharing of facial recognition data among government agencies could be regulated. Then, to give a hypothetical example, people won't be surprised to find immigration photos are used to identify them in other contexts. Rules can tell us when law enforcement can access our images from social networks. In response to the Times' report on Clearview, New Jersey barred police use of the app. Commentary: Big Tech is showing some love to the US government - which comes as no surprise STANDING STILL MEANS FALLING BEHIND Standing still as rival nations develop technology means falling behind. Harnessing technological potential - without alienating people or depriving them of their rights - requires developing regulations along with the technology. Trust in the authorities is high in Singapore. Clear rules can help maintain and strengthen that.

The tax is also likely to have implications for future US tech investments in India. India began taxing online advertisement revenues earned by foreign businesses from 2016 through an \"equalisation levy\". Proposed as withholding tax at the rate of 6 per cent, it was imposed on online advertisement revenues by foreign e-commerce firms obtained from Indian sources. The tax was applied on revenues exceeding 100,000 rupees (US$1335) in a year on business-to-business (B2B) transactions. The tax was essentially on payments made by Indian businesses to foreign e-commerce platforms for advertising their products and services. </p><p>The tax is being collected through a withholding mechanism, which implies Indian businesses withholding or retaining 6 per cent of their payments, if these exceed the threshold of 100,000 rupees, as taxes to be paid to Indian authorities. READ: Commentary: TikTok and Microsoft and how government agendas are reshaping Big Tech Several start-ups and local firms, advertising on Google and other digital platforms, have been unhappy about the burden, as a result. INDIA'S NEW TAX The tax is described as an \"equalisation levy\", underscoring its intention to create a level playing field between domestic and foreign e-commerce service providers. The 2016 national budget clarified the tax to be on non-residents without \"permanent establishment\" in India. This was also India's effort to overcome the current insufficiency in global tax governance in taxing earnings by offshore businesses. Since Apr 1, apart from the equalisation levy of 6 per cent, India has imposed a tax of another 2 per cent on all online sales of goods and services by foreign e-commerce operators, as well as those facilitated by them through online platforms. The current measure brings a very wide range of e-commerce transactions within the ambit of the tax. Revenues from the sale of advertisements targeting Indian consumers, data collected from Indian consumers and from sale of goods and services using such data, including from those accessing advertisements through internet protocol (IP) addresses located in India, are now being taxed. READ: Commentary: How Tencent became world's most valuable social media company - and then everything changed The thrust of the tax remains on foreign e-commerce businesses. This is evident from domestic e-commerce entities with permanent establishments in India being exempted. Furthermore, the additional 2 per cent tax is on foreign e-commerce businesses with annual turnovers of more than 20 million rupees (US$267,000). INDIA ISN'T ALONE Several countries are taxing online advertisement revenues earned remotely by large e-commerce businesses. Popularly christened the \"Google Tax\", these taxes are expanding in scope to include revenues from most digital sales of goods and services by foreign firms. The taxes are being imposed notwithstanding the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) working with several countries in determining global rules for their imposition. The taxes have led to tensions between imposing countries and the US. The US has launched investigations against a group of countries to determine if the taxes are discriminatory to US technology firms. The countries being investigated include India and Indonesia from Asia, as well as Austria, Brazil, the Czech Republic, the European Union, Italy, Spain, Turkey and the United Kingdom. Taxes on earnings from the e-commerce sales of goods and services, provided remotely, are new complexities in global tax governance. Countries tax foreign businesses on the basis of \"permanent establishment\" in different locations. Global firms are taxed by national governments if they have significant physical presence within national territories. They are also taxed on profits repatriated to home countries. The scope of such double taxation is often minimised through bilateral tax treaties. Online e-commerce sales, by global giants like Amazon, Alibaba, Walmart, Shopify or eBay, to consumers across the world, and revenues earned from such sales, can't be taxed by national governments through the existing principle of \"permanent establishment\" as their physical presence in these countries is zero or insignificant. READ: Commentary: WeChat ban a formidable weapon in US-China trade war READ: Commentary: It's payback time for the way China handled the Internet all these years Countries, nonetheless, are taxing the remotely earned revenues, which are significant, given the huge increase in global e-commerce transactions in recent years. The taxes are being levied on the basis of the digital presence of e-commerce companies in different countries. THE INDIA-US ASPECT In India's case, in response to the tax, the US Trade Representative's (USTR) office had started a probe against India accusing it of targeting American tech companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon. Media reports reveal that India recently responded to the investigation by confirming that the tax was not targeted at a particular country nor its companies and that the decision will therefore not be reversed. The US tech industry has been distinctly unhappy with India and some other countries unilaterally imposing taxes on their digital sales from other locations, notwithstanding ongoing work on fixing a global framework for such taxes. The latter are seen to adversely affect business interests of major American tech firms such as Google, Facebook, Netflix and Amazon. The USTR's investigations on India and other countries is focusing on the impact on US tech firms, including whether they are penalising successful firms, and whether their extra-territorial nature deviates from prevalent practices of international tax systems. The results of the investigation might lead to the imposition of trade tariffs by the US on India, as it had threatened France with a 25 per cent import tariffs on a list of goods including handbags, cheese and wines.. More tariffs would mean the beginning of a fresh round of tit-for-tat trade actions between India and the US. The prospects of finalising a bilateral trade deal would thus become even more difficult. READ: Commentary: Trump's H-1B visa freeze shows that warm ties between US and India are mostly for show READ: Commentary: Trump's work visa suspension may wind up as self-sabotage India's equalisation levy also has implications for future US tech investments in India. There might be a tendency on the part of these investors to obtain a more local presence to qualify for the criteria of \"permanent establishment\" of avoiding the tax. This might be necessary as the current bilateral tax treaty doesn't include this equalisation levy and thus US businesses face the prospect of double taxation. THE LONG-TERM VIEW India's \"Google Tax\" has been expanded at a time when it is trying to protect the interests of domestic tech firms in an aggressive fashion. This is evident from the specific targeting of foreign e-commerce businesses by the tax. India is certainly not the only country trying to tax revenues earned by foreign e-commerce providers. It is noteworthy that India announced the equalisation levy in 2016 soon after the announcement of its \"Make in India\" initiative for making India a global industrial hub. By taxing foreign ecommerce businesses, while exempting domestic ones, the \"Google Tax\" resonates with India's strong pitch for a self-reliant India that emphasises reducing dependence on imports, as well as foreign suppliers of digital services. Such priorities, along with security concerns, have already resulted in India regulating Chinese content in the domestic digital space by blocking several prominent Chinese apps like TikTok. Whether the priorities would also lead to other foreign investments, particularly from the US, localising in India remains to be seen.

One is that Zuckerberg is a principled advocate of free expression struggling with a hard case. The second is that the billionaire is bending principles to avoid crossing Trump, out of fear of Trump's bluster about retaliation against Big Tech. A SWIFT U-TURN? Early on Friday morning (May 29), Trump cross-posted to Twitter and Facebook about violent protests against the police killing of George Floyd: \"These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won't let that happen. </p><p>Just spoke to [Minnesota] Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts.\" Twitter labelled it as \"glorifying violence\", but Zuckerberg announced that the post would stay on Facebook. Hundreds of Facebook employees staged a virtual walkout of work. Some took to Twitter to express disagreement, even shame. Zuckerberg told some 25,000 Facebook employees on Tuesday he had decided the post did not violate Facebook's content guidelines but he had voiced concerns about it to Trump himself. READ: Commentary: Twitter may have just helped Trump get re-elected READ: Commentary: Could Donald Trump not run for re-election? Zuckerberg then blinked on Friday, when he announced a policy review and opened the possibility of applying labels to posts, as Twitter had done. MARK, THE MAN OF PRINCIPLE? For years, Zuckerberg espoused something close to an absolutist approach to free speech. His remarks echoed centuries-old arguments that in an unregulated clash of truth and falsehood, truth wins. It's a rationale that underlies the United States Constitution's First Amendment protection for free expression. And though that amendment only limits government censorship - not how Facebook, a private company, can restrict speech - Zuckerberg has explained that the platform applies similar principles. One exception to the First Amendment is that incitement to violence can be prohibited, but it's defined so narrowly the test is almost never met. Facebook prohibits incitement, though it's not clear its definition is the same. Zuckerberg noted that unlike on Twitter, even incitement in newsworthy posts of political leaders is barred. But Trump's post wasn't incitement, Zuckerberg said. In the leaked transcript of Zuckerberg's meeting with Facebook employees, he explains how, in the hours after Trump's post, he considered three interpretations of the \"looting-shooting\" comment. The first interpretation, which Trump would later embrace: Trump was merely observing or predicting that where looting occurs, shooting may occur. He was not encouraging shooting. The second interpretation: Trump was encouraging police or ordinary citizens to shoot looters. If this were the case, the post could violate Facebook's incitement ban, depending on how strictly it defines incitement. The phrase has a history. A notorious Miami police chief first said it in 1967 about civil rights protests, adding that he didn't mind accusations of police brutality. Others segregationist leaders spoke of shooting looters. Zuckerberg said he considered suggestions that Trump's use of the phrase could be a signal - a \"dog whistle\" that only those who know the history would hear - to take justice into their own hands. But he told his employees that in the past, the \"looting-shooting\" phrase has referred to \"aggressive policing - maybe excessive policing - but has no history of being read as a dog whistle\". READ: Commentary: So much wrong in US response to George Floyd protests READ: Commentary: Why George Floyd's death could tilt the US election - in Trump's favour The third interpretation: The remark discusses or warns about the state's legal use of force. That's permissible under Facebook's guidelines. Zuckerberg claims that after consulting his team and external civil rights advisers, he concluded that the third interpretation was the most reasonable. He knew his decision would upset many. Then last week, in Zuckerberg's telling, he met his upset employees halfway. He acknowledged the need for a review of deeply held principles to meet the challenges of these restive times. MARK, THE OVERLY CAUTIOUS BUSINESSMAN? Zuckerberg had a telephone conversation with Trump on the day he decided to keep up the post. If only we could hear that exchange. But with swords hanging over Facebook, maybe few words were necessary. Trump has been threatening social media for years. READ: Commentary: Help, I love tech monopolies! READ: Commentary: Facebook's Xi Jinping's name gaffe is no laughing matter Trump had, earlier that same week, tweeted: \"Republicans feel that Social Media Platforms totally silence conservatives voices. We will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen.\" The day before their conversation, Trump had retaliated against Twitter's decision to flag two of his tweets as misleading. Trump had issued an executive order initiating a review of a decades-old law, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, that protects social media platforms from liability for most content we users post. In recent years, Trump has also raised the spectre of antitrust action against Facebook, Amazon, and Google. In 2018, Trump said, \"I do have a lot of people talking about monopoly when they mention those three\". He said they may be in \"a very antitrust situation\". He said his administration is \"looking at\" antitrust action against \"all three\", adding, \"that doesn't mean we're doing it, but we're certainly looking\". In the worst-case scenario, antitrust enforcement could force Facebook to let go of Instagram and WhatsApp, leaving Zuckerberg with a fraction of his empire. READ: Commentary: COVID-19 online shaming and the harm it can cause READ: Commentary: On social media, life amid coronavirus risks becoming a popularity contest In 2019, Trump's Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission announced probes into tech platforms, without naming which ones. The Wall Street Journal reports that the Justice Department may initiate proceedings against Google in the months ahead. If Zuckerberg is reacting to Trump's sabre-rattling, he is being exceedingly cautious. Trump's threats to Facebook's bottom line, even its existence, are grave, but his chances of successfully executing them are remote. Government closure of tech platforms would violate the First Amendment. Removing their immunity or breaking them up is not directly within Trump's power. Meanwhile, Zuckerberg must placate another group. Facebook can't innovate without top talent, who can easily find jobs elsewhere. Last week, with staff in revolt, the pressure to announce a policy review became a business imperative. This week, some Facebook moderators penned an open letter supporting the walkout. Maybe even Trump would understand Zuckerberg's announcement. After all, he made no promises about the review's outcome. WHICH MARK IS IT? In the meeting with his staff, Zuckerberg comes across almost as a judge, parsing the precise meaning of Trump's words and balancing principles of free expression and the harm it may cause. Still, Zuckerberg didn't address a complication: Shooting looters is generally illegal. Observers have suggested it was convenient for Zuckerberg to reach the conclusion that avoids antagonising Trump. It's not the first time critics questioned Facebook's motives for leaving up Trump's incendiary and false content, ranging from anti-immigrant remarks in the 2016 election campaign to its decision this year not to fact-check political ads. Facebook's track record and incentive structure when principles conflict with the bottom line do not bode well. Facebook makes 98.5 per cent of revenue from advertising. Its strength is its ability to target ads to us based on the spectacular amount of data it gathers as it tracks us. READ: Commentary: The world's most powerful teenager? Facebook READ: Commentary: Big Tech's growth spurt may be coming to an end In 2011, Facebook settled US Federal Trade Commission charges that it deceived users about privacy and promised not to do it again. Yet in 2019, the US Federal Trade Commission fined Facebook US$5 billion for again deceiving users about privacy. Now Facebook is facing legal action for not complying with a requirement to get users' explicit consent for how it handles our data under the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation. Next time, if Zuckerberg decides to leave Trump's posts up, unlabelled, it may be because Zuckerberg judiciously applied principles and found free expression outweighs potential harm. Or it may be to fend off the president's threats to his empire.

Governments must now be equally decisive in dealing with this home-grown danger. READ: Commentary: Why having access to your Google and Facebook data can be life-changing Huawei is not only the world's largest supplier of telecommunications equipment and its second-largest phone manufacturer; it is also the global leader in building ultra-high-speed 5G networks - far ahead of any US competitor. And, along with some other Chinese companies, Huawei supplies surveillance equipment to about 230 cities across Western Europe, Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa. </p><p>A MOVE AGAINST HUAWEI US President Donald Trump's administration accuses Huawei of stealing intellectual property, committing fraud and obstructing justice in evading American sanctions against Iran, and potentially using its hardware and inbuilt software to spy for the Chinese government. The US government has therefore prohibited US government agencies from buying equipment from Huawei (and also from ZTE, Hikvision, Dahua, and Hytera). Furthermore, the US Department of Commerce has put Huawei on its Entity List, thereby preventing American companies from supplying the Chinese firm unless they get a hard-to-obtain waiver. Facebook no longer lets Huawei pre-load apps, and Google has stopped providing Android updates to the Chinese company's devices. Meanwhile, US universities are under pressure to cut their research ties with the firm: In April, MIT severed its relationships with both Huawei and ZTE. The US is pushing other countries to follow its lead. New Zealand and Japan have banned Huawei, and Norwegian firm Telenor will roll out a 5G network with Sweden's Ericsson, ending a decade of collaboration with the Chinese company. Hungary and Russia, on the other hand, are happy to let Huawei develop their national 5G networks. READ: Commentary: Many businesses are not ready for US-China decoupling In a recent risk assessment, the European Commission and the European Agency for Cybersecurity warned about having a 5G supplier from a \"hostile\" country, or one \"where there are no legislative or democratic checks and balances in place.\" Mindful of these concerns, some European governments have adopted a more regulated, \"middle-way\" approach to Huawei. Germany, for example, will require telecom providers to be certified and monitored. The United Kingdom, meanwhile, has until now kept Huawei out of \"critical networks,\" and tests the firm's equipment at a comprehensive evaluation center (whose latest report warns of a \"significantly increased risk\"). HOW DANGEROUS IS HUAWEI? Western governments' concerns about Huawei are real. But are they so different from the worries we should have about American social-media and technology companies? READ: Commentary: Huawei security concerns cannot be divorced from US-China relations The fear is that Huawei could gain access to a huge volume of data about us, which then could be used in a way that is detrimental to our interests, including by adversely influencing national politics. But these threats already exist, because Facebook (which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp) and Google (which owns YouTube) have an astonishingly comprehensive range of data about their users - their location, contacts, messages, photos, downloads, searches, preferences, purchases, and much else. In other words, the US digital giants are already storing the kind of data that we fear Huawei may collect in the future. Furthermore, both Google and Facebook have already been found to misuse the data entrusted to them. The difference, we are told, is that Huawei is based in China - a strategic rival of the US - so the data the company gathers could be used to weaken democratic countries' political systems and geopolitical standing. THE DANGERS OF FACEBOOK But Facebook is already undermining the democratic process, including in the US itself, where the platform has been accused of facilitating foreign interference in elections. READ: Commentary: Someone needs to do something about Facebook - but what? In addition, Facebook has fueled division and fear, and refused to remove hate speech, Holocaust denial, and anti-Semitic posts. The platform has been described as a \"megaphone for hate\" against Muslims, and it is accused of facilitating a genocide against the Rohingya in Myanmar. For these reasons, the British actor and comedian Sacha Baron Cohen recently called Facebook \"the greatest propaganda machine in history\". The Trump administration and other Western governments have been extraordinarily slow to act, however, in contrast to their swift and decisive measures vis-\u00e0-vis Huawei. READ: Commentary: The world's most powerful teenager? Facebook One supposed reason for regarding Google and Facebook as a lesser threat is that they are private companies - unlike Huawei, which is seen as beholden to the Communist Party of China. But Google does a lot of work for the US government, including the US military and intelligence services, and the profit motive is not preventing Facebook from being a threat; in fact, it is amplifying the danger. That is because Facebook's profits depend on maximally harvesting our attention, which can then be sold to advertisers and to users wishing to \"promote\" their posts. The more attention the platform attracts, the more profitable it becomes. TAKE ACTION ON FACEBOOKFacebook uses algorithms to push the most attention-grabbing material, which typically is shocking, outrageous, fear-mongering, and hate-filled. And, having gathered huge amounts of data about us, the company sells the opportunity to target us personally to whomever is willing to pay - even if they are setting out to destroy our societies and institutions. The fact that Facebook is damaging social cohesion, weakening democracy, and making it easier for authoritarian governments to emerge is not the company's concern, as its behavior makes clear. READ: Commentary: One US lawmaker is onto something with her big ideas on Big Tech The Trump administration's peremptory and categorical response to the potential threat posed by Huawei has persuaded several other governments to follow suit, on the grounds that democracies must protect access to data about their citizens, and prevent it from being used in ways that undermine democracy. But if that is the case, Western governments should immediately take equally vigorous action against Facebook and Google.

Without a clear legal or regulatory framework, the Trump administration has issued executive orders banning transactions with the apps' respective parent companies - Bytedance and Tencent. China's leaders have not minced words in expressing their displeasure with US actions, referring to those against TikTok as a \"smash and grab\" in a China Daily editorial, vowing retaliation and even going so far as to suggest that Beijing could block a future sale. CYBER SOVEREIGNTY Yet despite its displeasure, Beijing seems to be witnessing the global adoption of a norm for which it has long advocated. </p><p>Ironically, it may do them more harm than good. For years, China has promoted the concept of \"cyber sovereignty.\" Although somewhat nebulous in definition, the term has been used to legitimise censorship, surveillance and localised control of data that make up what is often referred to as China's \"Great Firewall.\" READ: Commentary: WeChat ban a formidable weapon in US-China trade war Broadly put, it is the notion that the government of a sovereign nation should have the right to exercise control over the internet within its own borders, including political, economic, cultural and technological activities. Beijing's advocacy of the norm of cyber sovereignty has only grown more pronounced over time. Its annual World Internet Conference, which has drawn attendees such as Apple's Tim Cook and Google's Sundar Pichai as recently as 2017, has consistently offered a venue through which Chinese officials could lobby the movers and shakers of the tech world to see the value in this approach. China has also sought to advance this notion through international bodies such as the United Nations. For the Chinese Communist Party, cyber sovereignty has proved beneficial in a number of ways. While enabling the party to both moderate and gauge public discourse and sentiment, the technological barriers also provided space to develop into some of the world's largest companies, while impeding the entry and success of foreign internet platforms in China. THE TABLES HAVE TURNED China's model has worked out so well that other countries have begun adopting elements of it. And it is now Chinese companies who seem to be suffering most. Spurred by a recent escalation of border tensions, India has been purging Chinese apps from the country's internet. READ: Commentary: TikTok and Microsoft and how government agendas are reshaping Big Tech In addition to its pressure on TikTok, the Trump administration has recently announced the Clean Network programme, a comprehensive tech stack that, if fully implemented, would almost entirely exclude Chinese technology firms. The adoption of cyber sovereignty as a global norm could now prove to be one of the greatest impediments to China's peace, prosperity and development. As China has few allies and worsening relations with the majority of the world's most prosperous nations, its firms are finding a shrinking list of attractive overseas markets in which they are welcome. CHINA LACKING OPTIONS What's more, China's robust application of the cyber sovereignty principle over the past decade and a half has left it with few options through which to take reciprocal action when their firms are excluded from other nations' digital spheres. After all, they cannot go about banning apps which they already banned years ago. READ: Commentary: Trump's strategy on Huawei and China is disastrous This reality is already being acknowledged by leaders in China's technology industry. In an article on Sina.com that was later deleted, James Liang, co-founder of the online travel agency Ctrip, advocated for his country to adopt a more open approach to its domestic Internet in order to counter what he views as US diplomatic aggression. \"If we simply adopt a tit-for-tat strategy and implement the same xenophobic barriers, we will leave matters in the hands of the US,\" Liang wrote, adding \"our countermeasures should be to open up further... The United States wants to block WeChat and TikTok, so we can do the opposite.\" Whether or not Liang's prescription is correct, such an opening up would be a dramatic reversal of the direction that China and its digital sphere have been heading in, and starkly clash with what appears to be Xi Jinping's vision for the Chinese internet. READ: Commentary: It was always going to be hard for Huawei to stay in Western markets What does seem clear is that after years of lobbying the world to accept the notion of cyber sovereignty, China has gotten its wish. To which the axiom applies: Be careful what you wish for - you just might get it.

The first steps have seen the easing of city and regional lockdowns. The gradual easing of restrictions since end-March culminated in the lifting of the over 70-day long lockdown on Wuhan on Apr 8, once ground-zero for the deadly epidemic. In part, the easing was a response to the vast improvement in the situation and the recognition that most infections may come from importation, which border controls can keep a lid on now that community spread has been flattened. The impetus may also be economic rather than epidemiological where China posted negative first quarter GDP figures, the first in almost 30 years. Primed to restart its economy while taking great care to ensure the virus doesn't trigger a second major outbreak, China has embarked on a three-pronged intervention, namely: Cautiously lifting lockdowns while controlling the risks of spread, stimulating the economy, and engaging in soft power diplomacy to repair its reputation. </p><p>READ: Commentary: How Wuhan mobilised to survive an over-70 day COVID-19 lockdown - and bounced back READ: Commentary: How China ensured no one went hungry during coronavirus lockdown CAUTIOUS LIFTING OF LOCKDOWNS, CONTROLLING RISKS OF SPREAD With China recording more \"imported\" infection cases than local transmission, the central government is careful to balance creeping societal stress with that of reducing the risks of a second wave of widespread infections. In Wuhan, citizens are now free to exercise, visit restaurants and coffee shops, but this reality is only possible because of strict compliance with social distancing rules and the mandated wearing of face masks under pain of enforcement and amid public fears of what the city had to endure. Restaurants and public places must take the temperature of all entering their premises and refuse entry to those with a temperature in excess of 37 degrees Celsius. LISTEN: How many stars will you give Singapore's F&amp;B industry this COVID-19 season? People must show a colour-coded verification of their health status, based on questions on their movement history and health declaration on Alipay and WeChat to gain entry into facilities including subways after scanning a QR code. Residential committees also keep watch over households. Such efforts undergird hope the return to normalcy can be sustained by control measures and heightened vigilance. Over and above these common practices, cities of strategic importance have new entry requirements, with the capital Beijing having some of the strictest. International flights have been redirected to one of 12 other cities where travellers comply with quarantine procedures that take 14 days, before they can enter Beijing city limits. READ: Commentary: Think flying is dead? Four reasons why business travel will bounce back from the COVID-19 slump STIMULATING THE ECONOMY China had earlier announced in end-March a stimulus package, aimed at issuing special bonds and relaxing lending to boost the economy, with President Xi Jinping indicating the fiscal deficit ratio could rise to 3 per cent of GDP. A total of US$344.1 billion has been committed. Local authorities have been enlisted in thinking of novel ways to spur growth, which have given birth to interesting approaches, such as the introduction of digital gift coupons to support personal consumption in catering, food delivery and online shopping. Such a move may have been premised on China's traditionally high savings rate at 45 per cent of GDP, which would lead cash assistance to remain in bank accounts. The Chinese central bank estimates the multiplier effect of digital coupons would be twice as much compared to cash. READ: Commentary: COVID-19 is just a bump in the road of China's long-term development Moreover, consumer consumption made up more than half of China's 2019 GDP growth in 2019, according to the National Development and Reform Commission. Thirty provinces and cities have already introduced these, with Hangzhou having already issued US$237 billion in digital coupons, supporting also the burgeoning e-commerce sector, a vital lifeline for millions of entrepreneurs, merchants and manufacturers and home to some of China's Big Tech giants. READ: Commentary: In the time of COVID-19, China is revolutionising deliveries and e-commerce China is also taking this rare opportunity to review regulations that stymie domestic investment. Interest rates have been eased by the People's Bank of China on Monday (Apr 20), the second time this year. Chinese financial institutions also rolled out support measures for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), including increasing debt rollovers and providing specific credit lines for the resumption of production. The country has also embraced a concerted effort to encourage inward foreign investment. This includes the liberalisation of investment banking and money management markets. For the first time, beginning Apr 1, wealth funds can apply for licenses for wholly owned mutual fund management firms without the need for joint ventures. China is keen to signal it is open for business, aided in part by a surprising announcement of the signing of 152 major industrial projects in Shanghai on Mar 31, with a value of US$62.3 billion that included foreign investor like Bosch, Mitsubishi and Walmart subsidiary Sam's Club. READ: Commentary: China billionaires a force to be reckoned with in global COVID-19 fight - and more READ: Commentary: Why Singapore was among the world's largest recipients of investments in 2019 SOFT POWER DIPLOMACY TO REPAIR REPUTATION China's economic recovery will largely hinge on whether the country can arrest the reputational damage caused by the pandemic, after much finger-pointing, concerns over transparency and conspiracy theories suggesting the virus was manufactured in a Wuhan lab have grown. In total, China has dispatched 300 doctors, millions of coronavirus testing kits and thousands of ventilators to Italy, with 1.8 million masks, 210,000 test kits, 36,000 protective suits, ventilators and thermometers delivered to Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Laos, Maldives, Mongolia, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Apart from immediate actions to provide medical aid to affected countries, China is also reviewing the knock-on effects of the outbreak on its flagship Belt and Road projects. BRI projects have been delayed in countries including Bangladesh, Cambodia, Kenya, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Saudi Arabia and Sri Lanka, as Chinese workers who returned for the Lunar New Year found themselves trapped under lockdown. READ: Commentary: Imagine a North Korea without Kim Jong Un. Here's why you can't With the US's announcement it would cease funding to the World Health Organisation, however, there is a chance for China to step up leadership in this area. After all, it has a Health Silk Road mechanism, a key component of the BRI, which seeks to build public health cooperation among BRI nations. While much suspicions have surrounded China's intention and the viability of the Health Silk Road in supplanting WHO, China has made no such grandiose claims of the Health Silk Road's global pre-eminence. It has instead positioned efforts under that ambit as aiding member states in receiving urgently needed medical supplies and the sharing of experience in epidemic control to build national capacities. China will probably continue to push the Health Silk Road particularly through highlighting the importance of the BRI infrastructure network in delivering humanitarian aid amid border closures. READ: Commentary: China's COVID-19 push for global influence READ: Commentary: China makes inroads into Europe. That's creating some discomfort This is no better demonstrated by the supply of medical equipment to Spain. Medical supplies were shipped out from Yiwu to Madrid using rail freight through the Alataw Pass in Xinjiang, a rail hub-and-spoke centre, managed by China Railway Express. About 70 per cent of Central Asia freight volume travels through the pass. Aid can reach Madrid in just two weeks instead of the 50 days it normally takes. The recent Wuhan-to-Duisburg rail shipment, being the first rail shipment out of the city, is notable. Medical supplies occupied 19 of the 50 containers, with the balance being auto-parts, electronics and optical fibres from the Chinese megacity that is also the global leader in producing personal protective equipment. THE ROAD TO RECOVERY Where a vaccine will not be forthcoming until 2021, China has made commendable strides in finding a path back to normalcy. It might not be business as usual as the country grapples with the virus' implications for its international standing. But the steps it has taken to help restore some level of business activity and stimulate the economy in new ways while keeping a second wave of outbreaks in check is worth studying, especially for countries thinking of lifting lockdowns.

Today, more than 4 million moms blog. And as any child knows, we can learn a lot \u2014 sometimes about the unexpected \u2014 from our mothers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So what might moms teach us about regulating their online activities? Internet regulation can affect mommy bloggers as much as it does big tech companies like Google and Facebook.</p><p> Think about the sometimes-poisonous reader comments found beneath blogs and other online articles. Comments are a useful way to interact with readers and create a sense of community in the digital age. That's part of what makes many blogs successful and the reason some bloggers start or continue writing.</p><p> Still, comments can get quite nasty, which is why they are the target of plenty of jokes and more-serious criticism. It's easy to understand why a mommy blogger might want to remove certain comments, particularly if related to information or photos about someone's children.</p><p> Existing tech laws protect this right. 1996's landmark \"Section 230\" provision made clear that the provider of an internet service \u2014 whether big tech or a blogger offering a comment section \u2014 is not liable for the actions of its users when it is serving as a curator rather than a creator. It also allows bloggers to remove or otherwise moderate third party comments without fear of legal action.</p><p> This is critical for small-content generators and helps illustrate why Section 230 helped make the internet a free space for all kinds of people. How many moms would be able to do some casual blogging if a tense battle over content moderation could land them in expensive, time-consuming legal trouble?</p><p> Mommy bloggers don't just teach us the importance of maintaining internet freedom laws. They also help illustrate the building tension that can emerge between speech and privacy.</p><p> One woman stirred controversy earlier this year when, writing in the Washington Post, she described her daughter's request to stop blogging about motherhood. In publicly refusing, the author noted, \"my stories will be inextricably linked to her experiences.\" With the children of \"sharenting\" now coming online themselves, some parents' speech and their children's rights to privacy will increasingly come into conflict.</p><p> For better or worse, stories or pictures rarely exist in isolation anymore. Requests for extreme privacy measures like a \"right to be forgotten,\" as already found in Europe, can quickly make a thorny question thornier. Should legal, legitimate speech be regulated because it's online? Should the child of a mommy blogger be able to grow up, invoke a right to be forgotten, and have her mother's old blog delisted? Does free speech cover the longstanding tradition of sharing embarrassing stories about a child, or should that change in the digital age, where it's no longer contained to a photo album or yearbook?</p><p> These are questions without easy answers. Ideally, families will work them out on their own. But in our haste to call for stringent new privacy rights, we should consider not just how compliance might affect large tech companies but also how it might impact more personal conversations. If we don't, courts and lawmakers could settle too many dinner-table disputes.</p><p> As we argue over whether to regulate internet content, let's not forget that fundamentally, this debate is about some of the ways in which we share information with one another each day. Maybe some of those mommy bloggers can teach us how to work out our differences of opinion.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKIL-6495bc7eb67bd5efb499286ee1321d7b2a64594</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F1E113A10985CF6 NWBKIL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W1Y-HX21-JBCN-433G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399548</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"623\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Lee Enterprises, Inc.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

In August, US President Donald Trump ordered TikTok's parent company ByteDance to sell its product to a US company within 90 days. He simultaneously banned Tencent, the owner of WeChat, from most of its operations in the United States. The administration has targeted these two apps, but with somewhat different purposes in mind. </p><p>TikTok has a global following that already numbers 800 million users, and has ample allure to potential American bidders with an estimated market value of US$20 billion to US$30 billion. WeChat is an all-purpose app within China and abroad, encompassing gossip, sanctioned and unsanctioned news reporting, online payment systems, and contact between Chinese living abroad and their families and friends at home. READ: Commentary: The biggest IPO in history is happening but millions may miss out READ: Commentary: A Digital Iron Curtain may be descending between the US and China TIT-FOR-TAT MOVES The Trump administration sees malicious uses underlying dependence on both apps. According to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, utilising Chinese social media tools leaves massive amounts of personal data vulnerable to exploitation by Chinese intelligence, though both parent companies deny these allegations. The US claims that dangers to US national security justify efforts to disconnect Chinese carriers from America's telecommunications networks. Few non-government analysts can properly evaluate these allegations, and the government has disclosed little information to substantiate its claims. Chinese officials view these pending restraints as part of a larger effort to deny Chinese firms access to the US market, thereby impeding their continued advance and circumscribing future commercial opportunities. In response, Beijing is threatening to block the sale of TikTok's assets by withholding approval of Chinese export licenses for sale of China's commercial technologies to US firms. China's Ministry of Commerce has also announced new restrictions on the export of technologies that can be used for analysing personal information. In the competitive world of social media and e-commerce, Chinese companies grasp that turnabout is fair play, and that they are not without leverage. AN INTENSIFIED DIVIDE These moves reveal an intensifying US-China technological divide, with both countries proposing separate models of global digital governance. The Trump administration has enunciated plans for a clean network, and all measures exclusively target China. In response, China has unveiled its own proposal for data security standards, based on cyber sovereignty. This would enable individual countries to regulate and control their uses of the internet. The US's threat-driven narrative of China now goes well beyond Trump's long-standing obsession with trade imbalances, though these remain a core part of his message. READ: Commentary: Will China's new data security initiative define global norms? READ: Commentary: Would using TikTok really have national security implications? After protracted negotiations, the two countries signed a phase one trade agreement in January 2020, obligating China to make large-scale purchases of US agricultural products and manufactured goods. Trump saw the agreement as vindicating his belief in managed trade, but - partly because of the COVID-19 pandemic - the accord has done little to narrow the trade imbalance. Moreover, his unilateral imposition of new tariffs, initiated in 2018, failed to recognise that China would impose retaliatory tariffs of its own. Trump remains unwilling or unable to grasp that tariffs are a tax on US consumers and US companies, representing a dual liability to the United States. SOBERING OUTLOOK The investment outlook is even more sobering. Chinese outbound investment to the United States surged to record highs in 2016, but has since plummeted to 2010 levels. The expectation that increasing integration between the world's two largest economies would provide much needed ballast for the bilateral relationship does not apply in an administration dominated by economic nationalists hostile to interdependence. In the longer run, the administration seems intent on strategic separation and economic decoupling from China, especially in high technology areas. This includes Huawei, a leader in telecommunications gear and already well advanced in its 5G ambitions. The United States is pressuring its closest allies to sever or at least sharply curtail their links with Huawei, which it deems a major national security threat and commercial challenger. New US regulations prohibiting the sale of US chips to Huawei for smartphone manufacturing will deny Huawei the ability to compete once its existing inventory of chips is exhausted. READ: Commentary: TikTok and Microsoft and how government agendas are reshaping Big Tech READ: Commentary: How Singapore can thrive in a world past peak trade, with more regional blocs But it provides a powerful impetus for China to devote major resources to the indigenous development of advanced chips. Punitive sanctions are an additional weapon in the administration's arsenal. These are aimed at senior Chinese officials held responsible for policies that the United States deems objectionable or illegal, at commercial entities accused of technology theft, and at firms with substantial assets in the United States. Such measures are expected to inflict pain on China, though it seems likely to spur Beijing to pursue closer ties with major trade partners other than the United States. It is also unclear how the administration expects these actions to induce longer-term Chinese behaviour that would address US grievances. Trump and his advisers seem to believe that punitive policies will slow China's advance, and that characterising China as the preeminent threat to the United States will benefit Trump's re-election prospects. But the administration has given minimal consideration to the implications of an adversarial relationship with Beijing, or to the consequences of an increasingly fractionated global economy as China increasingly goes its own way. China's experiences with the Trump administration have been deeply sobering to leaders in Beijing. No matter who is elected in November, China will seek to reduce its dependence on the United States and accelerate the development of indigenous technologies to protect the country from US unpredictability and hostility. The next administration will need to ponder carefully whether a lasting US-China technology divide will be in anyone's long-term interest.

Warren's proposals amount to a total rethink of the United States' exceptionally permissive merger and acquisition policy over the past four decades. Indeed, Big Tech is only the poster child for a significant increase in monopoly and oligopoly power across a broad swath of the American economy. Although the best approach is still far from clear, I could not agree more that something needs to done, especially when it comes to Big Tech's ability to buy out potential competitors and use their platform dominance to move into other lines of business. </p><p>READ: Smartphones a double-edged sword but many think they're great sword wielders, a commentary COURAGEOUS MOVE Warren is courageous because Big Tech is big money for most leading Democratic candidates, particularly progressives, for whom California is a veritable campaign-financing ATM. And although one can certainly object, Warren is not alone in thinking that the tech giants have gained excessive market dominance; in fact, it is one of the few issues in Washington on which there is some semblance of agreement. Although the causal relationships are difficult to untangle, there are solid grounds for believing that the rise in monopoly power has played a role in exacerbating income inequality, weakening workers' bargaining power, and slowing the rate of innovation. And, perhaps outside of China, it is a global problem, because US tech monopolies have often achieved market dominance before local regulators and politicians know what has happened. READ: China banning Facebook and Google now looks smart considering recent data breaches, a commentary The European Union, in particular, has been trying to steer its own course on technology regulation. Recently, the United Kingdom commissioned an expert group, chaired by former President Barack Obama's chief economist Jason Furman, that produced a very useful report on approaches to the tech sector. A REMINDER OF AN OLDER DEBATE The debate about how to regulate the sector is eerily reminiscent of the debate over financial regulation in the early 2000s. Proponents of a light regulatory touch argued that finance was too complicated for regulators to keep up with innovation, and that derivatives trading allows banks to make wholesale changes to their risk profile in the blink of an eye. And the financial industry put its money where its mouth was, paying salaries so much higher than those in the public sector that any research assistant the Federal Reserve System trained to work on financial issues would be enticed with offers exceeding what their boss's boss was earning. There will be similar problems staffing tech regulatory offices and antitrust legal divisions if the push for tighter regulation gains traction. To succeed, political leaders need to be focused and determined, and not easily bought. READ: Antitrust law should change Facebook and Instagram's relationship status, a commentary One only has to recall the 2008 Global Financial Crisis and its painful aftermath to comprehend what can happen when a sector becomes too politically influential. And the US and world economy are, if anything, even more vulnerable to Big Tech than to the financial sector, owing both to cyber-aggression and vulnerabilities in social media that can pervert political debate. THE WORLD CAN CATCH A COLD Another parallel with the financial sector is the outsized role of US regulators. As with US foreign policy, when they sneeze, the entire world can catch a cold. The 2008 Global Financial Crisis was sparked by vulnerabilities in the US and the United Kingdom, but quickly went global. A US-based cyber crisis could easily do the same. This creates an \"externality,\" or global commons problem, because US regulators allow risks to build up in the system without adequately considering international implications. LISTEN: That awkward conversation we need to have with Facebook, an episode on The Pulse podcast It is a problem that cannot be overcome without addressing fundamental questions about the role of the state, privacy, and how US firms can compete globally against China, where the government is using domestic tech companies to collect data on its citizens at an exponential pace. And yet many would prefer to avoid them. That's why there has been fierce pushback against Warren for daring to suggest that even if many services seem to be provided for free, there might still be something wrong. There was the same kind of pushback from the financial sector fifteen years ago, and from the railroads back in the late 1800s. Writing in the March 1881 issue of The Atlantic, the progressive activist Henry Demarest Lloyd warned that: Our treatment of 'the railroad problem' will show the quality and calibre of our political sense. It will go far in foreshadowing the future lines of our social and political growth. It may indicate whether the American democracy, like all the democratic experiments which have preceded it, is to become extinct because the people had not wit enough or virtue enough to make the common good supreme. FAIRER, STRONGER CAPITALISM Lloyd's words still ring true today. At this point, ideas for regulating Big Tech are just sketches, and of course more serious analysis is warranted. An open, informed discussion that is not squelched by lobbying dollars is an imperative. The debate that Warren has joined is not about whether to establish socialism. It is about making capitalist competition fairer and, ultimately, stronger.

The company advised that important day-to-day tasks such as personal banking and online shopping would no longer be safe on users' now out-of-date and hacker-friendly Windows computers. It's hard to know how many people are affected but one estimate suggests it could be hundreds of millions. The company's recommendation was to upgrade immediately and ideally buy a new laptop, as the older one might be too slow or not function as well with the current Windows 10, a cost which many people will not be able to afford. </p><p>DO WE NEED THE STRESS? When I looked into this subject, I found over 100 expert articles referring to the process of upgrading to new operating systems as being stressful for users. One even referred to it as a process of suffering. The majority of these experts assumed stress was part of the process and offered tips on how to minimise or reduce that stress. But do you need a buy a new laptop, or is it time to switch to a different device altogether? Microsoft would have you believe that Windows 10 is the last version of Windows and instead of making new editions they will improve your experience on a more ongoing basis. Of course, this isn't only a problem for owners of Windows laptops and desktops. READ: Commentary: The rise of the digital economy - and how education may be transformed Apple and Android operating systems also suffer from upgrades to new versions, with regular announcements that support or security upgrades for older versions will end, along with warnings that staying with legacy systems will compromise online security. SCAREMONGERING Simply put, if your bank balance gets raided, you - the user - have only yourself to blame. It might be true that researchers and hackers regularly find vulnerabilities in legacy devices. And research shows that attackers are more likely to find vulnerabilities in older and more familiar code. But saying that legacy systems can't be protected is arguably scaremongering in the name of sales. They are made by huge, rich companies with more than enough resources to create patches and keep our older devices safe. Stopping support creates fear and customers who are more than happy with older devices end up surrendering to pay for new gadgets and software versions. READ: Commentary: Big Tech is showing some love to the US government - which comes as no surprise In many cases, it seems to persuade people to make the leap of faith and just buy a new laptop. There is certainly evidence of a short-term hike in laptop and PC sales. But some people have already begun to desert the laptop market. THE DEATH OF THE LAPTOP Research shows that PC and laptop ownership, usage and importance have declined over the past three years, replaced largely by smartphones. A survey of internet users found just 15 per cent thought their laptop was their most important device for accessing the internet, down from 30 per cent in 2015, while 66 per cent thought their smartphone was most important, up from 32 per cent. This has led some commentators to predict the slow death of the laptop because of young people's preference for and greater familiarity with the devices in their pocket. But a survey by UK regulator Ofcom in 2017 also found there has also been a record rise in older people using smartphones and tablets. Even for those who love a QWERTY keyboard, you arguably no longer need a PC or laptop thanks to the emergence of better keyboards for mobile devices and the growth in alternative products such as hybrid tablets (with keyboards) and foldable gadgets. Aside from these preferences, there are other reasons to consider not surrendering to a new Windows 10 upgrade and spending a small fortune on a new laptop. Not least is the fact that the new operating system isn't without its own bugs and other security issues. In fact the US National Security Agency recently found a flaw so serious that it took the unusual step of issuing a public warning. READ: Commentary: Investors, beware Apple's impending share price crunch So, do you need to upgrade? You might be wiser to wait and see. There are other devices to do your online banking and similar important and sensitive tasks. Your older laptop will be perfectly good for tasks that come with security risks. You could hold fire on giving your money to the laptop makers and sellers and spend it better elsewhere. This is new territory for Microsoft and you, the customer, are part of the experiment (for which you are expected to pay).

Here are some trends worth following:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Turning entrepreneurs into job-builders: Even as other economic indicators rebound, the unemployment rate seems stuck around 8.5 percent nationally and 7 percent in Wisconsin. Then again, the definition of \"back to work\" is changing. More people are employing themselves as they pursue start-up ventures launched when their 9-to-5 careers faded.</p><p>Some reports show Wisconsin is slowly escaping the bottom tier of states when it comes to creating new businesses, thanks in part to organized mentors, angel investors, small-business incubators and business and entrepreneurial networks.</p><p>Connecting Wisconsin with venture capital: A bill creating a state-leveraged venture capital fund will likely surface in the state Capitol in January, as key members of the Senate and Assembly appear near agreement on major provisions.</p><p>Such a bill would make the state a limited partner in a \"fund-of-funds\" that would help turn promising young companies into larger firms. About 30 states have adopted similar strategies over time. Success for start-ups won't happen overnight, however, so let's hope the state is a patient investor.</p><p>Building a NextGen Natural Resource economy: Striking a balance between creating jobs and protecting the environment will pose challenges for policymakers. State lawmakers will consider expediting a proposed iron mine in Iron and Ashland counties, where a need for jobs is countered by concerns for water quality. Another emerging industry is mining to produce sand needed to extract natural gas and oil through hydraulic fracturing of deep shale formations. Again, the main issue is protecting groundwater - not only in the sand mines, but in gas drilling sites around the country.</p><p>Wisconsin can attract and retain businesses with its clean and abundant supplies of water - something not every state or region can claim. The Public Service Commission will continue to pursue innovative water pricing strategies, including rates that promote efficient water use and economic growth. The PSC also hopes to work with utilities on water-metering technologies that can help evaluate demand patterns and trends. Wisconsin is a hub for water technology solutions through emerging companies, academic research and smart regulations. Let's use that combination to our advantage.</p><p>Encouraging trade and foreign direct investment: Wisconsin has benefited from a booming export economy, especially when it comes to high-quality manufactured products, medical technologies and food products. When the 2011 figures come in, don't be surprised if Wisconsin shatters the 2010 record of $19.8 billion in total exports. Also vital is foreign direct investment, which is globalizing Wisconsin's economy in ways that create jobs, expand supply chains, open the doors to new markets and provide needed investment dollars.</p><p>Wisconsin cannot possibly consume or sell everything it produces at home or even nationally. That's why exports and foreign investment are flip sides of the same coin. They represent Wisconsin's ability to build, produce and grow what the world needs - and to attract investment from markets that understands the state's strengths.</p><p>Educating tomorrow's workers now: Most colleges and universities in Wisconsin continue to see enrollment surges as people realize education is often the pathway to \"knowledge economy\" jobs. The trick is starting the education process earlier, which explains public and private efforts to encourage more middle- and high-school students to take science, technology, engineering and math courses. Some states have committed to STEM education in significant ways; Wisconsin should do the same if it wants to counter a coming demographic crunch as the \"baby boom\" generation retires and there are shortages of skilled workers.</p><p>On the other end of the spectrum, expect higher education to examine how efficiently it moves technology from the laboratory to the marketplace. Some states are taking the speed bumps out of their technology transfer processes; Wisconsin can do the same.</p><p>Making technology work for people: If 2011 was the year when Wall Street and Big Banking heard loudly from the man and woman on the street, perhaps 2012 will be the year when Big Tech gets an earful.</p><p>Privacy concerns continue to dog Facebook. Proposed \"piracy\" legislation may threaten the Internet. Attempts to ban all cell phone use by drivers are possible, given the National Transportation Safety Board's recent recommendation. The Obama administration must decide if it really wants to extend broadband coverage - or simply block mergers. And Amazon.com appears intent on turning brick-and-mortar retailers into showrooms via consumers armed with price-check apps and Amazon discounts for doing the company's research. The good news: There's a fresh new year in which to sort it all out.</p><p>Tom Still is president of the Wisconsin Technology Council. He is the former associate editor of the Wisconsin State Journal.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SHPRES-shb-145134123</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SHPRES2012</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:54P4-MT01-DYJJ-P09D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">257504</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-08-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"858\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2012 The Sheboygan Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sheboygan Press (Wisconsin)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"01\" year=\"2012\"><dateText>January 6, 2012 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Energy &amp;

The share prices of Alphabet, Apple, Facebook and Amazon have surged in recent weeks in a sign of Wall Street's approval amid promises by Google and Apple to create COVID-19 tracking apps to help public health \u2014 even as they enable them to harvest even more of our data.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The surge appears to reflect an update assessment by investors that the global pandemic will leave the tech giants even more powerful than before.</p><p> But American and European regulators should be accelerating efforts to roll back Big Tech's control on our economies, not pressing the pause button.</p><p> Earlier this month, House lawmakers threatened to subpoena Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos to explore whether Amazon's harvesting of data from its commercial users is a form of unfair competition. The Department of Justice and state attorneys general are also signaling they will initiate antitrust litigation against Google this year to combat its efforts to stifle competition. While these probes proceed behind closed doors, a parallel congressional investigation spearheaded by Rhode Island's Rep. David Cicilline is doing a remarkable job of bringing the scope of Big Tech's sins out of the shadows and into the public record.</p><p> The House Judiciary Committee's Antitrust Subcommittee, led by Cicilline, announced its sweeping investigation into competition in digital markets last June. In the months since, Big Tech's vaunted lobbying operation and its army of well-compensated \"experts\" have argued that antitrust enforcement could hamstring innovation. They're now seizing on COVID-19 to champion the indispensability of their clients. Don't buy their spin.</p><p> My own company's experience offers a clear example of how Google's blatant suppression of competitors on its platform represents the real threat to free market competition in the digital economy. And ultimately, it's consumers who end up paying the price.</p><p> Kelkoo was founded two decades ago, back when the digital economy was still a wide-open playing field on which any entrepreneur could launch a new idea without worrying that gatekeepers with trillion-dollar market valuations would stand in their way. Our value prop for consumers was simple: we brought together products from thousands of retailers in one place to enable consumers to compare choices and find the best deals. While we focused initially on Europe, we quickly found ourselves competing against dozens of startups on both sides of the Atlantic, all battling furiously to win market share by adding features, differentiating our sites, and trying to offer the best prices.</p><p> From its perch as the world's dominant search monopoly, Google saw the business opportunity and decided it wanted not just a slice but as much as possible of the entire pie. Google launched a competing service, Froogle, a few years after Kelkoo helped pioneer the market. But Froogle was a flop. Even after copying the most innovative features from competitors and rebranding, consumers were still flocking instead to smaller, scrappier comparison-shopping sites like ours.</p><p> So instead of doubling down on innovation and \"building a better mousetrap,\" Google then tilted the playing field. All comparison-shopping sites depend heavily on traffic from search results. So, Google decided to suffocate us by changing its search algorithm to bury us farther down in the results while ensuring Google's competing service held the top spot on the page. This wasn't about benefiting users. It was a brazen power play, leveraging Google's search monopoly to promote its inferior shopping service at the expense of competitors and consumers. And it worked.</p><p> The EU's competition regulator penalized Google's practices with a $2.71 billion fine. But the fine didn't stop Google from continuing to methodically suffocate competitors in the online shopping marketplace like Shopping.com, Pricegrabber and Nextag, driving them to the brink of extinction.</p><p> In the end it is consumers \u2014 who lose out when a digital gatekeeper is allowed to unilaterally remove competitors. You can measure the costs in dollars and cents: an analysis of Google's consolidation of the product advertising market suggests that if you buy a $650 TV online, you're probably paying $20 more today than you would pay if the online shopping ecosystem was more competitive.</p><p> A generation ago, the internet's pioneering entrepreneurs envisioned a wide-open digital playing field in which innovators would compete on the strength of their ideas. A generation from now, we may look at the COVID-19 pandemic as a turning point that either entrenched Silicon Valley's monopolistic gatekeepers or began to restore the promise and potential of that original vision.</p><p> The post Commentary: Tech giants in a post-pandemic world appeared first on Itemlive.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKMA-8a788d5ab1301db4b8a82f96674992510dadd39</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289856805CA8BF NWBKMA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:606D-0231-DXVP-V0H5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399550</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"816\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Daily Item<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

This is an indirect result of the recent China-baiting by US politicians, led by Donald Trump. Ant Group's US$200 billion flotation would normally have been a candidate for either the NYSE or NASDAQ, but will instead take place on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (as well as Shanghai). This is especially galling to the US stock markets considering American financial royalty Citigroup, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley are among those overseeing the listing. READ: Commentary: Why aren't tech unicorns listing on the SGX?</p><p> READ: Commentary: Alibaba makes a whopping US$28 billion bet on its next breakthrough act Ant Group is an online payments powerhouse that grew out of Alibaba, China's answer to Amazon. A dive into the Ant Group prospectus illustrates one of the issues behind the listings war: A technical market-integrity fight that has become hijacked by geopolitics. In the US, the stock market rules would mandate that the billionaire Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma and fellow shareholders Eric Jing (Ant executive chairman), Simon Hu (Ant chief executive) and Jane Fang Jiang (Alibaba chief people officer) should be treated as shareholders with significant control. The same goes for Alibaba itself, Ma-controlled investment consultancy Hangzhou Yunbo, and two investment vehicles that it controls, Hangzhou Junhan and Hangzhou Junao. READ: Alibaba, Xiaomi to join Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b Indeed, all these would normally also be considered controlling shareholders under the Hong Kong listing rules, but not on this occasion. For this listing, only Hangzhou Junhan and Hangzhou Junao are considered to be in control, owning just over 50 per cent of Ant Group between them. This is an expediency using Chinese laws and regulations which would not have been permitted in the US, and is probably part of the reason the company did not seek a US listing - especially in a climate where the US administration is so hostile to Chinese businesses. PART OF A DEEPENING POLITICAL SPAT This is not just about obscure rules and regulations. It is part of the very real and potentially dangerous political spat taking place between China and the US. In August, Trump issued executive orders restricting transactions related to two other Chinese tech giants: Tencent, which owns WeChat, and TikTok owner ByteDance. Meanwhile, the US Bureau of Industry and Security is restricting Chinese companies from using US-origin technology in their products. The president also issued an executive order to TikTok to make it destroy all copies of data on its US customers. And there is the \"clean network programme\", which started as a snub to Huawei's superior 5G wireless technology and has since been expanded to restrict storage on cloud-based systems by certain other Chinese companies. READ: Commentary: Will the TikTok saga in the US lead to the break-up of the Internet industry? READ: Commentary: WeChat ban a formidable weapon in US-China trade war Ant Group's involvement relates to yet another US initiative to tighten the screws on Chinese activities on American soil: The proposed \"Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act\". This legislation is designed to enforce compliance with certain company rules, including those relating to Ant Group's controlling shareholders. Other requirements include companies having to comply with US audits and disclose foreign government ownership or control. Failure to comply by the 230 Chinese companies listed in the US, which are worth circa US$1 trillion, would see them removed from American stock exchanges. These companies include Alibaba, internet giant Baidu, e-commerce group JD.com and PetroChina. The proposals are supposed to have a three-year timeframe, but Trump has politicised them and is planning on using yet another executive order to speed up the process. READ: Commentary: A Digital Iron Curtain may be descending between the US and China READ: Commentary: 2020 is shaping up to be a rough year for Huawei THE BIGGEST LOSERS In much the same way as US capital markets have missed out on the listing of Ant Group, those who will be harmed by this act are the US pension funds and other financial institutions with restrictive investment mandates that stipulate that they can only buy shares in companies with US listings. Qualified institutional buyers within the meaning of rule 144A under the US Securities Act will still be able to buy companies overseas, as indeed they might with Ant Group. The problem is that not all US institutions are mandated to invest outside of US capital markets. As for the Chinese companies themselves, they would not be starved of capital because they would simply relist elsewhere. READ: Commentary: TikTok and Microsoft and how government agendas are reshaping Big Tech Some investors will therefore be forced sellers under the proposed act. There is academic evidence that delisting causes a company's share price to fall: A sample of 520 companies demonstrated an average decline of 8.5 per cent. Thus, the biggest losers will be those US pension funds that diversified into these Chinese stocks, following established techniques for building more profitable portfolios. Although there are very sound reasons for punishing rule breakers, delisting for the kinds of violations included in the proposed act has been the exception in the US. The legislation, which sets a precedent, is being viewed as targeted specifically at Chinese companies. While it applies to all foreign companies, it will be hard for the Chinese to comply because of the state's particularly tangled relationship with businesses. READ: Commentary: It's payback time for the way China handled the Internet all these years READ: Commentary: Is national security a good reason to ban TikTok? The China Securities Regulatory Authority, in a bid to reduce the tension, approached the US Public Company Accounting Oversight Board in August with an offer to let it audit a few selected state-owned enterprises. It is unlikely that this will pacify the China hawks in the US administration. If it doesn't, the biggest losers will be US capital markets and investment funds - and ultimately ordinary Americans trying to save for their retirement. Targeted punitive action against companies, individual sanctions and nationalistic legislation will likely mean that Ant Group is not the last non-US company to decide against a listing in the US. As a result, the hegemony of US capital markets may well be under threat. It could all potentially be powerful ammunition for the Democrats in their battle to unseat the president in November.

He predicted that in the networked age, more value would accrue in controlling flows of information than in controlling the content itself. In other words, those who positioned themselves as network hubs - the routers and switchers of information - would become the gatekeepers of power in the digital age. With the rise of internet juggernauts Google, Facebook, Amazon and others, this insight seems obvious now. </p><p>But over the past two decades, a fundamentally new business model emerged which even Castells had not foreseen - one in which attracting users onto digital platforms takes precedence over everything else, including what the user might say, do, or buy on that platform. THE RISE OF BIG TECH Gathering information became the dominant imperative for tech giants - aided willingly by users charmed first by novelty, then by the convenience and self-expression afforded by being online. The result was an explosion of information, which online behemoths can collate and use for profit. The sheer scale of this enterprise means that much of it is invisible to the everyday user. The big platforms are now so complex that their inner workings have become opaque even to their engineers and administrators. If the system is now so huge that not even those working within it can see the entire picture, then what hope do regulators or the public have? Of course, governments are trying to fight back. The GDPR laws in Europe, the ACCC Digital Platforms report in Australia, and the DETOUR Act introduced to the US Congress in April - all are significant attempts to claw back some agency. READ: One year into the European GDPR, many firms are still not complying At the same time, it is dawning on societies everywhere that these efforts, while crucial, are not enough. GATEKEEPERS REIGN SUPREME If you think of the Internet as a gigantic machine for sharing and copying information, then it becomes clear that the systems for sorting that information are vitally important. Think not just of Google's search tool, but also of the way Google and Amazon dominate cloud computing - the largely invisible systems that make the internet usable. Over time, these platforms have achieved greater and greater control over how information flows through them. But it is an unfamiliar type of control, increasingly involving autonomous, self-teaching systems that are increasingly inscrutable to humans. READ: Help, I love tech monopolies! A commentary Information gatekeeping is paramount, which is why platforms such as Google, Amazon and Facebook have risen to supremacy. But that doesn't mean these platforms necessarily need to compete or collude with one another. The Internet is truly enormous, a fact that has allowed each platform to become emperor of a growing niche: Google for search, Facebook for social, Amazon for retail, and so on. In each domain, they played the role of incumbent, disruptor, and innovator, all at the same time. Now nobody competes with them. Whether you're an individual, business, or government, if you need the Internet, you need their services. The juggernauts of the networked age are structural. ALGORITHMS ARE RUNNING THE SHOW For these platforms to stay on top, innovation is a constant requirement. As the job of sorting grows ever larger and more complex, we're seeing the development of algorithms so advanced that their human creators have lost the capacity to understand their inner workings. And if the output satisfies the task at hand, the inner workings of the system are considered of minor importance. Meanwhile, the litany of adverse effects are undeniable. This brave new machine-led world is eroding our capacity to identify, locate, and trust authoritative information, in favour of speed. READ: Big Tech's growth spurt may be coming to an end, a commentary It's true that the patient was already unwell; societies have been hollowed out by three decades of market fundamentalism. But as American tech historian George Dyson recently warned, self-replicating code is now out there in the cyber ecosystem. What began as a way for humans to coax others into desired behaviours now threatens to morph into nothing less than the manipulation of humans by machines. The digital age has spurred enormous growth in research disciplines such as social psychology, behavioural economics, and neuroscience. They have yielded staggering insights into human cognition and behaviour, with potential uses that are far from benign. Even if this effort had been founded with the best of intentions, accidents abound when fallible humans intervene in complex systems with fledgling ethical and legal underpinnings. Throw malign intentions into the mix - election interference, information warfare, online extremism - and the challenges only mount. If you're still thinking about digital technologies as tools - implying that you, the user, are in full control - you need to think again. The truth is that no one truly knows where self-replicating digital code will take us. You are the feedback, not the instruction. REGULATORS DON'T KNOW WHERE TO START A consensus is growing that regulatory intervention is urgently required to stave off further social disruption, and to bring democratic and legal oversight into the practices of the world's largest monopolies. But, if Dyson is correct, the genie is already out of the bottle. READ: In Indonesia and more countries, social media and Big Tobacco are hooking a whole new generation of smokers, a commentary Entranced by the novelty and convenience of life online, we have unwittingly allowed Silicon Valley to pull off a \"coup from above\". It is long past time that the ideology that informed this coup, and is now governing so much everyday human activity, is exposed to scrutiny. The challenges of the digital information age extend beyond monopolies and privacy. This regime of technologies was built by design without concerns about exploitation. Those vulnerabilities are extensive and will continue to be abused, and now that this tech is so intimately a part of daily life, its remediation should be pursued without fear or favour. Yet legislative and regulatory intervention can only be effective if industry, governments and civil society combine to build, by design, a digital information age worthy of the name, which doesn't leave us all open to exploitation.

The spread of the internet came with claims of a huge reduction in printing, and by replacing paper with bytes, we thought we'd reduce our negative environmental impact But this early promise of solving environmental problems may not be delivering because digital devices, like most technologies, also have environmental impacts. READ: Commentary: Wasteful practices of affluence must stop Devices are powered by electricity - often produced in coal-fired plants - and are manufactured from materials such as metals, glass and plastics. These materials also have to be mined, made or recycled. </p><p>So, while digital technologies can facilitate environmental benefits, we shouldn't assume they always do. My research published this year shows much more needs to be done to debunk such myths. MEASURING DIGITAL ECO-FOOTPRINTS It's difficult to measure the environmental impacts of our digital lives, partly because the digital ecosystems that facilitate the internet are complex. The United Nations Environment Assembly defines a digital ecosystem as \"a complex distributed network or interconnected socio-technological system\". Simply, digital ecosystems are the result of humans, digital infrastructure and devices interacting with one another. They rely on energy consumption at multiple scales. The term \"digital ecosystem\" relates to ecological thinking, specifically in terms of how human-technological systems work. However, there's nothing inherently environmentally sustainable about digital ecosystems. READ: Commentary: A sustainable future increasingly looks more Chinese It's worthwhile considering digital ecosystems' environmental impacts as they grow. In 2017, it was reported in Nature that internet traffic (to and from data centres) was increasing at an exponential rate. At that stage, it had reached 1.1 zettabytes (a zettabyte equals one trillion gigabytes). As our digital use continues, so do our carbon emissions. DANGERS OF DATA CENTRES Data centres majorly contribute to the carbon emissions of digital ecosystems. They are basically factories that store, backup and recover our data. In April last year, it was estimated data centres around the world used more than 2 per cent of the world's electricity, and generated the same amount of carbon emissions as the global airline industry (in terms of fuel use). While there is debate about the impact of flying on climate change, we're less likely to evaluate our digital lives the same way. READ: Commentary: Air travel's huge carbon footprint and its climate-friendlier alternatives READ: Commentary: Carbon emissions? Sorry but I will keep flying until someone stops me According to British Open University Professor John Naughton, data centres make up about 50 per cent of all energy consumed by digital ecosystems. Personal devices use another 34 per cent, and the industries responsible for manufacturing them use 16 per cent. Tech giants such as Apple and Google have committed to 100 per cent renewable targets, but they're just one part of our giant digital ecosystem. Also, on many occasions, they rely on carbon offsets to achieve this. Offsets involve people and organisations investing in environmental projects to balance their carbon emissions from other activities. For instance, people can buy carbon offsets when booking flights. Offsets have been critiqued for not effectively reducing the carbon footprints of wealthy people, while absolving guilt from continued consumption. A CARBON-FILLED ROAD AHEAD With more digital technologies emerging, the environmental impacts of digital ecosystems are probably going to increase. Apart from the obvious social and economic impacts, artificial intelligence's (AI) environmental implications should be seriously considered. A paper published in June by University of Massachusetts Amherst researchers revealed training a large AI machine could produce five times as much carbon as what one car (including fuel) emits over a person's lifetime, on average. READ: Commentary: An AI taught itself to play a video game - and it's beating human players Also, this figure only relates to training a large AI machine. There are various other ways these machines suck energy. Similarly, bitcoin mining (an application of blockchain) continues to consume large amounts of energy, and is increasing on a global scale. According to the International Energy Agency, bitcoin mining uses more energy than some countries, including Austria and Colombia. PUTTING THE \"ECO\" BACK IN DIGITAL ECOSYSTEM The digital ecosystem that supports our devices includes storage systems and networks that aren't in our homes or workplaces, such as \"the cloud\". But we should still take responsibility for the impact of such systems. Satellites are in space. Wires run beneath footpaths, roads and oceans. All the while, the Internet of Things is creeping into old technologies and transforming how we use them. These underground and distant aspects of digital ecosystems may partly explain why the growing environmental impacts of digital are sidelined. LISTEN: Heart of the Matter podcast - Talking about the Madrid climate talks, what happened and what's next? There are some ways people can find out more about responsible tech options. A 2017 guide by Greenpeace rated digital tech companies on their green credentials. It assessed a range of corporations, including some managing digital platforms, and others hosting data centres. But while the guide is useful, it's also limited by a lack of transparency, because corporations aren't obliged to share information on how much energy is needed or supplied for their data centres. HOLDING BIG TECH ACCOUNTABLE The responsibility to make our digital lives more sustainable shouldn't lie solely with individuals. Governments should provide a regulatory environment that demands greater transparency on how digital corporations use energy. Holding these corporations accountable should include reporting on whether they are improving the sustainability of their practices. One immediate step could be for corporations that produce digital devices to move away from planned obsolescence. One example of this is when companies including Apple and Samsung manufacture smartphones that are not designed to last. Digital sustainability is a useful way to frame how digital technologies affect our environmental world. We need to acknowledge that technology isn't just a source of environmental solutions, but also has the potential for negative environmental impact. Only then can we start to effectively transition to a more sustainable future that also includes digital technologies. Jessica McLean is a senior lecturer in Geography at the Macquarie University.

But as some of those start-ups grew into behemoths, they turned this force on its head. Far from levelling the playing field, Big Tech now largely owns it, and rather than democratising the economy, the Internet has ended up exacerbating the world's inequality problem. Big Tech's rise has made a few people extremely wealthy. </p><p>The richest among them, Amazon owner Jeff Bezos, lost US$7 billion - more than the total wealth of several countries, including Burundi and Sierra Leone (US$3 billion each) - in a single day last week. And yet the biggest risk he faces as a result is falling to second place in the global wealth ranking, after another tech founder, Bill Gates. READ:Commentary: The world's most powerful teenager? Facebook Meanwhile, some 736 million people still lived in extreme poverty (less than US$1.90 per day) in 2015, and billions more lived on less than US$2.50 per day. Many workers worldwide - including low-level employees at tech companies like Amazon and freelancers who use platforms like Uber to find customers - face poor and deteriorating working conditions and stagnant wages. As labour's share of income declines, capital's share increases - trends that benefit the wealthy above all. WHAT'S NEEDED: GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION Given the power of major tech companies to stifle competition, reversing these trends will require government intervention. And, indeed, taming Big Tech has become a major issue ahead of the 2020 presidential election in the United States. In particular, Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren - in my view, the two strongest candidates vying for the Democratic Party's nomination to challenge President Donald Trump - have called for breaking up major tech companies. READ: Where US presidential candidates stand on breaking up Big Tech But the solutions being proposed, including by legal scholars like Lina Khan, tend to focus on making better use of antitrust laws. This approach is unlikely to work, because markets have changed dramatically since antitrust laws were conceived. NATURAL MONOPOLIES In the late 19th century, L\u00e9on Walras produced the first models of how competitive markets work, showing how buyers and sellers decide, based on prices, how much to buy and sell. Walras visualised an auctioneer responsible for bringing buyers and sellers together and adjusting prices until market equilibrium - when aggregate demand for each good equals aggregate supply - is achieved. Subsequent work, such as that by Kenneth Arrow and G\u00e9rard Debreu, expanded upon the Walrasian model, but the auctioneer remained in the background. With the emergence of digital platforms like Alibaba, Amazon, and Uber, however, everything changed. These platforms perform the work of Walras's imaginary auctioneer, only they are real - and profit-driven. READ: Commentary: How Big Tech giants became gatekeepers of power READ: Commentary: Big Tech's growth spurt may be coming to an end They may even be willing to make large initial losses - as Amazon did for its first seven years in operation, when it accumulated some US$2 billion in debt - in order to maximise later gains. They know that they need only reach the point where they can reap the benefits of economies of scale, bringing enough buyers and sellers to the \"auction\" to make search, information, and transaction costs plummet. In this sense, digital platforms are natural monopolies. Applying antitrust laws to break them up would thus eliminate their most fundamental advantage and destroy their ability to deliver benefits to economies and consumers. PROTECTING WORKERS This dilemma is not altogether new. Some central banks, such as the Reserve Bank of India, were once private organisations. But giving a single private agent power over something as consequential as money creation was quickly determined to be too risky. And dividing the responsibility among several authorities would make it impossible for any to serve a transaction-smoothing function, resulting in a costly fragmentation of the monetary system. It is worth noting one other potential barrier to using antitrust laws to break up Big Tech. In the US, at least, such laws have focused primarily on protecting consumers. Recognising that, many digital platforms have avoided hurting consumers, instead gouging the sellers who use their services to connect to buyers. But there is growing research - such as that conducted by Suresh Naidu, Eric Posner, and Glen Weyl - indicating that antitrust law should also be applied to protecting workers. SHARING PROFITS Still, given the ways digital platforms have transformed markets, governments must think beyond antitrust. One approach worth considering focuses not on breaking up tech giants, but rather on ensuring that their profits are more widely shared. This could be achieved, say, with regulations that require platforms over a certain size to disperse shares to a large number of individuals and also to funds dedicated to providing domestic and global public goods. For the most influential platforms, governments may consider pushing a gradual shift to non-profit models, akin to public utilities. To be sure, this approach should be used sparingly, to avoid excessive and burdensome state intervention in the economy. But it is not in society's interest to have a single organisation that is integral to the functioning of the entire economy - whether a central bank or digital platform - run by a small coterie of individuals for their own gain. The precise contours of a strategy for constraining Big Tech will emerge - and evolve - over time. But I am hopeful that either Sanders or Warren - two politicians who seem to have the right \"moral intention\" - would be able to lead that process in a way that serves the interests of consumers, workers, and business owners alike.

But the biggest influencer of the lot is Facebook - the company that owns Instagram, WhatsApp as well as Facebook itself. With 2.7 billion users - more than a third of the world's population - Facebook is a massive, global political force, accused of everything from tipping the 2016 US presidential election to enabling genocide in Myanmar. RELUCTANT SOCIAL MEDIA LEADER Facebook's founder Mark Zuckerberg was once reluctant to acknowledge the company's political power - initially rejecting the idea that fake news on Facebook influenced the 2016 election as \"crazy\". This attitude may have been naive or disingenuous, but it was certainly not sustainable. </p><p>Facebook has become a political target - and so it has had to enter the political arena, trying to mollify legislators who fear its power. READ: Commentary: Big Tech's growth spurt may be coming to an end At 35 years old, Mr Zuckerberg has proved himself to be a brilliant engineer and businessman. But now he will have to prove himself a brilliant politician. If he fails, his creation could be broken up - or find that its ambitions are increasingly thwarted and its best products regulated out of existence. THE THREAT: TREATING FACEBOOK LIKE A PUBLISHER Perhaps the biggest threat to Facebook would be if governments decided to treat it as a publisher rather than a platform - making it legally liable for every lie or libel published by the company. Its sprawling headquarters in Menlo Park, California, would then be buried under a blizzard of lawsuits. Yet government action could also be the company's salvation. At 15 years old, Facebook is the world's most powerful adolescent. READ: Commentary: Help, I love tech monopolies! Like many teenagers, it could benefit if adults set some limits - in particular, by regulating the way it deals with politics. The alternative is for a company with 40,000 employees to continue trying to moderate the political debates of 2.7 billion people. UNDER FIERCE ATTACK In its home market of the US, Facebook is under fierce attack from both sides of the political divide. The president has accused Facebook of being \"always anti-Trump\", a charge echoed by prominent Republicans who claim that the company's algorithm downplays news from rightwing sources. Facebook's decision to de-platform some far-right commentators, such as the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, have also sparked accusations of bias. READ: Commentary: One US lawmaker is onto something with her big ideas on Big Tech Meanwhile, the left accuses Facebook of blithe tolerance of lies and political manipulation - preferring to rake in profits and build user numbers than to face up to its political responsibilities. To make this argument, the senator Elizabeth Warren, a leading contender for the Democratic nomination, has deliberately placed a misleading advertisement on Facebook - claiming that Mr Zuckerberg endorsed Mr Trump for re-election. Facebook has not risen to the bait by taking it down. Last week, Mr Zuckerberg argued, \"I don't think its right for a private company to censor politicians.\" This week, Facebook's boss will be back in Washington to testify before Congress on the company's ambitions for Libra, a digital currency, which, in the current anti-Facebook climate, is a tough sell. GLOBAL CONCERNS These American controversies are replicated all over the world. In the UK, many Remainers believe that ads on Facebook played a nefarious role in swinging the 2016 Brexit referendum, by targeting susceptible voters with fake news about immigration. In Asia, the company faces even more serious allegations. UN investigators in Myanmar warned that Facebook was the primary means by which hatred and mass atrocities were sparked against Rohingya Muslims - hundreds of thousands of whom were forced to flee the country. In India, lynch mobs were allegedly mobilised using WhatsApp. Facebook is constantly having to adjust its policies and products to deal with this blizzard of complaints. It has limited the number of users to which WhatsApp messages can be forwarded, in an effort to prevent hysteria going viral. It uses external fact-checkers, aided by artificial intelligence, to search out fake news - which is then labelled and given a lower ranking. It continues to ban advocates of terrorism and hate speech. It has deleted billions of fake accounts. But the borderline between freedom of expression and incitement to violence - and between legitimate politicians and hatemongers - is inevitably contested. A COMPLICATED MATTER To deal with disputes about what content Facebook should ban from its platform, the company is setting up an independent oversight board - which it rather grandly likens to the US Supreme Court. The effort is interesting and serious. But it is surely beyond the capabilities of a single company to make nuanced judgments about political debate in hundreds of countries and languages. As a result, increasing intervention by governments is inevitable. China has simply banned Facebook. But there are less sweeping actions that can be taken. Facebook already adheres to Germany's laws on Holocaust-denial, for example, by geo-blocking that kind of content for Germany. READ: Commentary: China banning Facebook and Google now looks smart considering recent data breaches READ: Commentary: The real reason Google and Facebook should be broken up? China In the US, there is growing talk about breaking up the company. But while there might be an economic case for splitting it up, there would be no political justification to do so. The social media age is here to stay, with all its complications. Shutting down Facebook would not change that. - Financial Times/sl</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-12027770</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XBH-BX31-DYWP-R18R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"971\"/><timeReceived>10:26 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MCN International Pte Ltd.

I believe advocates of breaking up big technology companies, as well as opponents, are both falling prey to some serious myths and misconceptions. </p><p>READ: Facebook, Google absorb US lawmakers' jabs in rare Big Tech hearing NOT LIKE STANDARD OIL OR MICROSOFT Arguments for and against antitrust action often use earlier cases as reference points. The massive 19th-century monopoly Standard Oil, for example, has been referred to as the \"Google of its day\". There are also people who are recalling the 1990s antitrust case against Microsoft. Those cases may seem similar to today's situation, but this era is different in one crucial way: The global technology marketplace. Currently, there are two \"big tech\" clusters. One is in the US, dominated by Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple. The other is in China, dominated by Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent, Huawei and TikTok-maker ByteDance. READ: Commentary: 2020 is shaping up to be a rough year for Huawei This global market is subject to very different political and policy pressures than regulators faced when dealing with Standard Oil and Microsoft. For example, the Chinese government has blocked most of the US companies from entering its market. And the US government has done likewise, blacklisting some Chinese outfits over perceived national security threats while discouraging others. READ: Commentary: Is national security a good reason to ban TikTok? Since the COVID-19 outbreak, the Chinese government has doubled down on championing its own technology companies. US companies' size and data accumulation capabilities give the country economic and political influence around the globe. If the US technology giants are broken up, the result would be a vastly uneven global playing field, pitting fragmented US companies against consolidated state-protected Chinese firms. PRICE ISN'T KEY There are two main views of antitrust action among legal experts. One focuses on consumer welfare, which has been the prevailing approach federal lawyers have taken since the 1960s. The other suggests that regulators should look at the underlying structure of the market and potential for powerful players to exploit their positions. READ: Commentary: Big Tech is showing some love to the US government - which comes as no surprise READ: Commentary: Help, I love tech monopolies! Those two sides seem to agree that price plays a key role. People who argue against breaking up the tech giants point out that Facebook and Google provide services that are free to the consumer, and that Amazon's marketplace power drives its products' costs down. On the other side, though, are those who say that having low or no prices is evidence that these companies are artificially lowering consumer costs to draw users into company-controlled systems that are hard to leave. Both sides are missing the fact that the monetary price is less relevant as a measure of what users pay in the technology industry than it is in other types of business. Users pay for digital products with their data, rather than just money. Regulators shouldn't focus only on the monetary costs to the users. Rather, they should ask whether users are being asked for more data than is strictly necessary, whether information is being collected in intrusive or abusive ways and whether customers are getting good value in exchange for their data. READ: Commentary: Facebook's decision to resist advertiser boycott could pay off in the long run THE BEST OUTCOME IS IN THE MIDDLE There aren't just two ways for this debate to end, with either a breakup of one or more technology giants or simply leaving things as they are for the market to develop further. In my view, the best outcome is right in the middle. The errant company is sued to make necessary changes but isn't broken up. The very fact that the government filed a lawsuit leads to progress with other companies. That is exactly what happened in past cases against the Bell System, IBM and Microsoft. In the 1956 federal consent decree against the Bell System telephone company, for example, which settled a seven-year legal saga, the company wasn't split up. Instead, Bell was required to license all its patents royalty-free to other businesses. This meant that some of the most profound technological innovations in history - including the transistor, the solar cell and the laser - became widely available, yielding computers, solar power and other technologies that are crucial to the modern world. READ: Commentary: Artificial intelligence and automation would actually benefit Singapore READ: Commentary: The next tech crash is around the corner thanks to COVID-19 When the Bell System was eventually broken up in 1982, it did not do nearly as much to spread innovation and competition as the agreement that kept the Bells together a quarter-century earlier. The antitrust action against IBM lasted 13 years and didn't break up the company. However, as part of its tactics to avoid appearing to be a monopoly, IBM agreed to separate pricing for its hardware and software products, previously sold as an indivisible bundle. This created an opportunity for entrepreneurs Bill Gates and Paul Allen to create a new software-only company called Microsoft. The surge of software innovations that have followed can clearly trace their origins to the IBM settlement. Two decades later, Microsoft was itself the target of an antitrust action. In the resulting settlement, Microsoft agreed to ensure its products were compatible with competitors' software. That made room in the emerging internet marketplace for web browsers, the predecessors of Apple's Safari, Mozilla's Firefox and Google Chrome. READ: Commentary: Apple has a battle with regulators and unhappy developers Even Margrethe Vestager, the European Union's top antitrust official and frequent tech-giant nemesis, has said that \"antitrust prosecutions are part of how technology grows.\" But that doesn't mean they all have to achieve their most extreme ends and be broken up. HAS COVID-19 ENDED TECH-BASHING? The current pandemic has highlighted the value of the technological innovations of the big tech companies. Americans are relying more than ever on the internet and online shopping and delivery, while mobility data has been critical in gauging social distancing behaviors and guiding policy. Digital tools for tracking coronavirus cases, deaths and social distancing behaviors in the smallest counties have circulated widely, and social media and smartphone videos were crucial to the recent protests and calls for social justice. READ: Commentary: Why did George Floyd protests gain traction worldwide - including Asia? Altogether, this has led to a softening of public opinion toward big tech and calls for an end to talk of breaking them up. But the pandemic has also revealed numerous digital fault lines: Differences in access by country, race and region; the ability of tech companies to exploit labour; and potential for new kinds of misuse of data. READ: Commentary: COVID-19 has revealed a new disadvantaged group among us - digital outcasts Far from giving the technology industry a free pass, the pandemic is an opportunity to take a more balanced view. Yes, let's celebrate the Silicon Valley's value, but let's not turn a blind eye to the problems they create or worsen. During the hearings, you'll likely hear politicians accentuate the bad stuff, while the tech CEOs will paint an overly rosy image of themselves. Antitrust is complicated enough without misconceptions clouding their judgments as well. Bhaskar Chakravorti is Dean of Global Business at The Fletcher School, Tufts University.

But while the United States continues to outperform other advanced economies, this success has yet to dispel many Americans' persistent sense of economic insecurity and frustration; nor does it alleviate concerns about the lack of policy space to respond to the next economic downturn or financial shock. POWERED BY PRO-GROWTH MEASURES The current expansion began in mid-2009, following the 2008 financial crisis and the \"Great Recession\". Powered initially by exceptional fiscal interventions and previously unthinkable monetary policies, the economy built enough of a foundation for private-sector confidence to return, and for corporate balance sheets to recover. READ: The low-growth trap Japan is stuck in is spreading across the world, a commentary Coupled with accelerating advances in new technologies, the expansion came to be led in large part by technology and platform companies presiding over the new \"gig economy.\" </p><p>It was given further impetus by pro-growth measures, including deregulation and tax cuts. With the US unemployment rate at 3.6 per cent, real (inflation-adjusted) wages are now growing at 1.6 per cent. And with the most recent quarterly data indicating an annualized GDP growth rate of 3.1 per cent, US economic activity continues to outpace that of Europe and Japan by a significant margin. ASSERTIVE BUT VULNERABLE Owing to this strength, America has become increasingly assertive in pursuing national objectives abroad, including by circumventing longstanding cooperative and conflict-resolution mechanisms and threatening import tariffs and other protectionist measures. To get to this point, the US had to overcome headwinds from abroad, including an existential debt crisis in Europe and slowing economic growth in China. Domestically, deep political polarisation, especially since 2011, has impeded congressional legislative activity and produced multiple actual or threatened government shutdowns (including the longest on record). In the absence of new pro-growth measures from Congress, monetary policy became the \"only game in town\". After being forced to expand its role in the economy substantially during the crisis years, the US Federal Reserve flirted with some major policy mistakes, and became more vulnerable to political interference. Because annual growth over the past decade has often been tepid and insufficiently inclusive - what has become known as the \"new normal,\" or secular stagnation - the US economy has been left with a residual sense of underperformance and potential vulnerability. According to an oft-cited Fed survey, almost half of US households report having insufficient savings to cover a US$400 emergency expense. NO LONGER A RELIABLE ANCHOR No wonder trust in institutions and expert opinion remains so low. Coupled with excessive inequality (of income, wealth, and opportunity), frustration and political anger remain high. Making matters worse, fear-mongering about the implications of technology and globalisation continues to fuel concerns of job dislocations and disruptions. And outside the US, many have come to worry that the superpower responsible for issuing the global reserve currency, and that plays a decisive role in many multilateral interactions, is no longer a reliable and predictable anchor for global trade and finance. Moreover, unlike in prior expansions, the US is yet to build sufficient buffers to deal with future economic and financial challenges. READ: Why the coming global recession will be harder to get out of, a commentary Or, to quote former US President John F Kennedy by way of IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde more recently, we have not fixed the roof while the sun was shining. TOUGH TO COUNTER THE NEXT ECONOMIC RECESSION Beyond the lack of self-insurance at the household level, the Fed's ability to counter economic recessions and financial disruptions is rather limited. Whereas the current policy rate is 2.25 to 2.5 per cent, past downturns have usually required cuts of five percentage points or more. Also, the Fed has a bloated balance sheet and a rather weak mechanism for transmitting monetary-policy measures to the real economy. And even if fiscal policymakers were to become more responsive, they would be starting from a point of relatively high deficits and debt. Prolonging the current expansion will require great care. Policymakers, particularly Congress, need to avoid big mistakes and minimise the risk of market accidents while doing more to promote growth. The US needs a well-targeted approach to modernising and upgrading its infrastructure. BETTER DISTRIBUTION IS WHAT'S NEEDED Policymakers and leading economists also must be more sensitive to how the fruits of economic growth are shared; among other things, there should be better protections for the most vulnerable segments of society and stronger automatic stabilisers. Businesses, for their part, need to do more to embrace their social responsibilities, if only to avoid ending up in the same position as the banks after the 2008 crash. There is already a growing chorus calling for more regulatory constraints on Big Tech. LISTEN: That awkward conversation we need to have with Facebook, an episode on The Pulse Moreover, having shaken up global trade, the US needs to ensure that it will remain the anchor of the rules-based international system. Otherwise, its ability to inform and influence economic and financial outcomes around the world will weaken. The US will - and should - soon be celebrating its longest-ever expansion. But it must not lose sight of its remaining challenges. The last thing the world needs right now is for today's expansion to give way to a sustained period of lower growth, higher financial instability, and greater cross-border tensions.
