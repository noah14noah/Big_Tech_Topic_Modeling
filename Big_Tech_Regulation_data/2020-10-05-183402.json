The \"iCapitalists\" have long been zealots for a radically neoliberal vision of capitalism. It is their skill at making this harsh approach palatable to the modern zeitgeist which will probably save their skin - though with potentially disastrous consequences for our economy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Big tech, originating in California's Silicon Valley, has always been about more than cutting-edge engineering. It embodies a value system that merges a counter-cultural 60s romantic individualism with a cold-eyed commitment to free markets. Apple's Steve Jobs, the Zen Buddhist of canny entrepreneurialism, captured the worldview with Apple's famous 1997 slogan: \"Here's to the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers ...\"</p><p>And it is this rebellious pose that reconciled a whole swath of the educated professional classes - the \"creatives\" - to free-market capitalism. In the 1980s, it was besuited corporates who were in the vanguard of Thatcher's and Reagan's neoliberal revolution - people such as the hard-faced, downsizing financier <person><nameText>Mitt Romney. </nameText></person>The iCapitalists, however, presented a far more appealing vision to liberals - one of denimed democracy, of gender-blind and colour-blind egalitarianism. For many of us, Google's own Big Brother house-style offices, with their Play School sofas and pool tables, seemed the very epitome of a creative, \"happening\" workplace; while Facebook's Silicon Valley HQ was a mini-utopia of subsidised gyms, dentists, and personal stylists.</p><p>But this is an egalitarian utopia only for the networked and highly educated, not for the many. For the iCapitalist culture is not so much liberal as libertarian, and is founded on the belief that we should be led by elite hi-tech businesses and their shinily packaged semi-conductors and microchips; the state, a lumbering, bureaucratic drag on creativity and innovation, has a minimal role.</p><p>This worldview lies behind Eric Schmidt's <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2013/apr/22/eric-schmidt-google-tax-affairs-growth\">defending Google's tax affairs</url> with reference to the company being \"a key part of the electronic commerce expansion of Britain, which is driving a lot of economic growth for the country.\" It is not necessary, it seems, to worry about taxation, and indeed the state, as long as company profits are trickling down to the rest of us. The PayPal co-founder <person><nameText>Peter Thiel </nameText></person>has taken this anti-state view to its logical conclusion, and contributed funds to \"Seasteading\" - a project inspired by the libertarian writer Ayn Rand, to create mobile \"islands\" of entrepreneurs on cruise-ships and oil-rigs, where they can be free of tax and state regulations.</p><p>As the iCapitalists have become richer, they have aspired to project this libertarian vision beyond their sunny, frisbee-friendly Californian campuses to society more generally. Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg has set up <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2013/may/13/mark-zuckerberg-lobbying-group-backlash\">FWD.us to lobby American politicians</url>. It has been pressing for looser rules on immigration - a cause his critics argue is primarily driven by company's appetite for foreign tech-engineers, and a cheap alternative to improving the American education system.</p><p>Of course, we need hi-tech, and Britain should be investing more in the sector. But the iCapitalist vision of society is deeply flawed, and potentially destructive. It is based on the false premise that the tech industries are a triumph of and justification for pure laissez-faire economics - refusing to acknowledge, of course, that the US department of defence drove the development of Silicon Valley. Also, it erroneously assumes that economic growth can be driven by a small group of super-wealthy, highly educated individuals, producing technologies that allow employers to cut wage costs for the majority, while resisting taxation and redistribution. This was precisely the highly inegalitarian economic model that led governments to maintain consumption by allowing a debt build-up among us lesser mortals - contributing to the crisis of 2008.</p><p>Since the financial crisis, the iCapitalists, like the bankers, have come under more scrutiny. They will clearly now have to pay more tax, at least in the UK, and they are under pressure elsewhere.</p><p>And now we have the possibility that the tech companies have allowed the US government wide access to their users' data, something that they have denied. If true, it leave them open to the charge of gross hypocrisy; for despite their much-vaunted libertarianism, it seems, they can also collaborate with an overbearing state.</p><p>It may be this scandal, rather than the tax-dodging, that undermines faith in big tech.</p><p>But there is little sign of any rebellion yet. For the iCapitalist vision of liberation and creativity still resonates with many of us, and particularly the young. British polls show that those born since 1979 are more likely to be socially liberal on race, gender and sexuality, but also more pro-market and anti-state than their older peers. They are also less likely to engage in boycotts of companies guilty of tax avoidance.</p><p>One explanation may be that this generation came of age when the iCapitalist vision seemed to be working and jobs were plentiful. And it may be some years before the hollowed-out neoliberal economy takes its toll and the flaws of iCapitalism are finally exposed.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-A411161700</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2013</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:58P9-S4B1-DYN2-34F0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-07-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"936\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies All Rights Reserved Registered in England and Wales.

Balkin,Democracy and Dysfunction[1](University of Chicago Press, 2019).In my last post[2], I discussed the new configuration of the two major parties in the United States. In this post, I discuss how this new configuration may limit the kinds of reforms that are available in the coming (Democratic Party-led) regime.Many progressives and liberals are hoping that the new regime will do something to break through the economic inequality that is undermining American democracy. If my analysis is correct, we should expect limited, but not revolutionary change in the new regime, at least in its early years. Democrats will continue to be united around social issues and issues of identity, but they will be less unified when it comes to issues of class and economic inequality.To be sure, Democrats will continue to be more far more economically egalitarian than Republicans for some time-- that is part of their \"brand.\" </p><p>But it will be hard to get moderate, business-friendly Democrats and corporate donors to support serious changes. In fact, as the regime develops, the Democratic Party will face increasingly serious conflicts over economic justice and class issues. Put in terms of today's politics, if you are a supporter of Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders, you need to recognize why some of your reforms will face opposition from within your own party as well as from Republicans. Here is a simple model to explain why Democrats will unite on social issues but not on class issues.Suppose you are an ambitious moderate-liberal Democrat who wants to become president. (Thus, I am interested in the national party, as opposed to state parties.) What is the best way to expand your base of supporters?One strategy would be to try to reconstitute the New Deal coalition. You move to the left on economic issues and to the center on social issues, in the hopes that you could pick up independents and some white working class Republicans. The other strategy would be to remain moderate on economic issues (which means that you are pretty liberal anyway-- after all, you are a Democrat). Instead, you move to the left (or, in the alternative, become more vocal) on social and identity issues, emphasizing your support for abortion rights, transgender rights, undocumented immigrants, so on.In some red states, such as my home state of Missouri, the first strategy--move to the left on economics, move to the center on social issues--might be quite effective. But nationally, this approach faces a couple of big problems. First, if you start sounding too much like the Sanders and Warren wing of the party, your wealthy donors will strenuously object. Second, if you move to the center on social issues, the party's socially liberal base will loudly object, and this will sap your support. You may lose more voters than you gain. To be sure, Bill Clinton tried this strategy in 1992, but that was over twenty-five years ago. The composition of the party was quite different, and it's not clear that it will work nationally today.So your safest bet to expand your support is the second strategy. You should stay moderately liberal on economics (keeping your wealthiest contributors happy), and you should move to the left on social issues\u2014or at least signal visibly and vocally on these issues. Now suppose you are part of the Sanders/Warren wing of the party and you want to expand your base of support. You are not going to move to the center on economic issues--you will be regarded as a sellout by the very people who most strongly support you. So your most plausible strategies will involve either moving to the center on social issues or signalling that you are firmly on the left on social issues.Once again, the second strategy is likely to dominate the first. Move to the center on social issues and the party's social liberals and some members of minority groups will not trust you. As a result, you may lose more voters than you gain. And because your positions on economic issues are so far to the left, your ability to get contributions and support from business-friendly and moderate Democrats and independents will be limited, even if you tack to the center on social issues. As a result, your most likely way of improving your position will come from solidifying support from minority groups and from the party's social liberals. Once again, the path of least resistance is to align yourself firmly with the party's socially liberal views. (Political scientists may recognize this as a stripped-down version of the Miller-Schofield argument, with some slight alterations).Note how the dominant strategies for moderate Democrats and economically liberal Democrats converge. That means that, for the time being, Democrats may find it easiest to unite around social liberalism but not economic liberalism. In today's Democratic Party, you can be moderately liberal or very liberal on economics. But on social issues you should remain firmly on the left. A recent story about Joe Biden confirms this intuition. Biden is the natural inheritor of the Clinton/Obama business-friendly wing of the Democratic Party. Under pressure from party activists, Biden quickly and suddenly changed his long-held position on the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits most federal funding for abortions.This story is not important for the reasons the media covered it\u2014to expose the machinations within the Biden camp, or to remind people that Biden has held many conservative positions in the past (which he has). Rather, the story is important because it symbolizes the balance of incentives for Democratic politicians. A moderate liberal like Biden will find it much easier to shift positions on issues of identity and social liberalism than on issues of class and economic inequality. Of course, as he does so, his opponents will try to remind voters of his earlier, more conservative positions on race and other identity issues. But in one important respect Biden won't care. In fact, he wantsto signal as strongly as possible that he has moved to the left on all of these issues. By contrast, I would be very surprised if Biden embraced Elizabeth Warren's positions on economic reform as quickly as he changed his mind on the Hyde Amendment. Republicans face a different, but complementary set of incentives. For the time being, it will be very hard for them to move to the center on social issues. They have spent too much time establishing their position in the culture wars for that. But as the party becomes increasingly identified with white working class voters, there is space for strategic realignment on certain issues of class and economic equality, as long as these issues are not coded as socially liberal or seen as especially benefiting minority groups. Thus, Republican politicians can move to the center on class issues if they support \"family-friendly\" economic policies that are coded as helping white working-class people. (This requirement-- that the policies offer no hint of redistribution to minorities--should remind you of the problems Democrats faced during the New Deal.)Republicans can also make populist attacks on Big Tech (whose leaders tend to be liberal Democrats). Republicans can even get behind certain kinds of antitrust reforms to the extent that this can be sold as benefiting white working class voters and not as the federal government regulating the economy.Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri is currently attempting a version of this strategy. He is signalling that nobody will outflank him to the right on issues of religious freedom, while taking a prominent position on regulating Big Tech. I expect that other ambitious Republicans will attempt variations on the general theme until they find a model that maximizes their potential base of support. What that model will ultimately look like, however, is not foreordained: it will be shaped by many factors, including the views of the party's powerful donors. Previous attempts at moving to the center or to the left on class issues have been foiled by the donor base--which, as we have seen in the Tea Party and Trump eras, appears to care most about upward redistribution.In sum, in the new party configuration, the two parties will continue to be opposed on social and identity issues. But both parties are going to have a populist wing and a neo-liberal wing.Although both parties are internally divided on class, they are most definitely *not* the same on class issues. The Democratic Party, for the foreseeable future, is likely to be far more economically egalitarian than the Republican Party. It is unlikely to abandon its commitments to universal health care, the environment, and other economic issues. But moderate Democrats and the party's donor base will be more conservative than much of the party.We can tell a complementary story about Republicans. As a result of its successful cultural strategy, the Republican Party has absorbed many economic populists, who, among other things, support Medicare and Social Security. But the party's donor base and its activist networks mean that it is not going to support very liberal economic programs.Given this configuration, even if the Democratic Party is the dominant party in the new regime, it will be difficult to achieve real change on economic issues with only Democratic votes. The Democrats are now a cosmopolitan party, and not the party of the New Deal.As strange as it may sound in today's political climate, economic progressives will need help from the other side of the aisle. If they do not figure out how to do this, the neo-liberal wings of the two parties are likely to set the agenda. That suggests that real change awaits the end of party polarization. How that comes about is the subject of the next installment.Posts in this series:1.Escaping Dysfunction[3] 2.Cycle of Presidents or Cycle of Regimes?[4] 3.How Polarization Leads to Disjunction-- There Must be Fifty Ways to Leave Your Party[5] 4.The New Party Configuration[6] 5.

In fact, despite his freshman status, the senator is arguably the industry s chief antagonist on Capitol Hill.</p><p>But while Hawley is a loud and articulate advocate of the new Republican populism on big tech, he s also essentially alone. </p><p>Not a single Republican has signed onto his bill targeting Silicon Valley s liability protections not even Sens. Ted Cruz or Marsha Blackburn, two strident conservative critics of the industry s legal immunity in relation to user-posted content. </p><p>On privacy legislation, Hawley s worldview remains decidedly antithetical to that of Republican leadership. GOP lawmakers on the Senate Commerce Committee remain committed to a comprehensive privacy bill that would preempt state privacy efforts and avoid a private right of action for consumers priorities virtually identical to Silicon Valley s own stated aims. </p><p> I think this is just an instance where this town is, as usual especially official Washington, the think-tank world way behind where the voters are,  said Hawley, acknowledging his relative isolation in the Republican caucus.</p><p>But it s not entirely clear the voters back Hawley s broader plans, either. A poll released last week by Morning Consult <url normalizedValue=\"https://morningconsult.com/2019/09/18/in-washington-cracking-down-on-big-tech-is-popular-in-the-rest-of-u-s-not-so-much/\"> showed </url> the tech industry was among the last that voters wanted to hear presidential candidates criticize.</p><p> That does suggest that people aren t as worried about it, perhaps, as politicians and people here in D.C., and people out in [Silicon] Valley are concerned,  said Will Rinehart, director of technology policy at the conservative American Action Forum.</p><p>Despite, or perhaps because of, his larger-than-life media presence, Republican leadership in the Senate hasn t quite warmed up to Hawley s fondness for economic interventionism.</p><p>Sen. Majority Whip John Thune, the former Commerce Committee chairman who remains a key player in privacy negotiations, told <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">National Journal </emphasis>that the hold-up on a privacy bill still centers around the GOP s preference for a  light-touch  approach.</p><p> I think there s always a difference with Republicans and Democrats about how to handle regulatory issues,  Thune said.  And they tend to be [in favor of a] more heavy-handed, more interventionist type approach. </p><p>But what about members of his own party, like Hawley, who are advocating similar measures?</p><p> I think our members are, in some ways, oddly aligned with some of the Democrats on [the idea that] some of these companies have gotten too big, have too much influence, too much power,  Thune said. </p><p> From an antitrust standpoint, that s an issue that I think there may be some agreement,  Thune said.  That s a little bit different issue than privacy. </p><p>Zach Graves, the head of policy at the conservative tech group Lincoln Network, said that if a conservative realignment on tech issues occurs, Congress will be the last institution it reaches.</p><p> These things take time,  Graves said.  Particularly on the environment on the Hill, members are incentivized particularly in [the Commerce] Committee to not be completely hostile to industry ... there are a lot of orthodoxies still in place about the role of government. </p><p>Within the small army of right-leaning tech scholars in Washington, nearly all are wary of Hawley s plans for a new populist paradigm. Among the most strident is Neil Chilson, the senior tech researcher at the libertarian Charles Koch Institute.</p><p>Chilson acknowledged the slow shift toward Republican populism evinced by Hawley s rise. But he also questioned its staying power, particularly if Democrats continue their own leftward slide in 2020.</p><p> It will be very interesting to see how people like Josh Hawley approach and distinguish themselves from people like Elizabeth Warren, when on many of the issues that he is the loudest about he sounds extremely similar to the most leftward of the Democratic candidates,  said Chilson. </p><p> If Warren becomes the person to defeat for the Republican Party, that s going to be an interesting triangulation for people like Hawley,  Chilson said.</p><p>There are some signs that Hawley s isolation on the right is coming to an end. Last week saw the launch of the Internet Accountability Project, a new conservative think-tank aligned with Hawley s tech policy proposals. Rachel Bovard, a former Republican Senate staffer who s now head of policy at the IAP, said her organization was expressly created to provide a  safe space  for more aggressive anti-tech measures coming from the right.</p><p> I don t think that exists right now,  Bovard told <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">National Journal</emphasis>.  And that s part of the reason that we have a little bit of urgency behind starting this group. The tech [industry] takes up all that space, and everybody s getting money from them and they don t see any other alternative to doing so . . . it s hard for anyone to step out, because the hammer falls on them from all sides. </p><p>Hawley, for his part, remains unconcerned with any potential blowback caused by bucking his party s orthodoxy. And while he may be lonely in the Senate, he can always count on the White House to back his tech-centered populist push. </p><p> I think it s very significant that one of the loudest voices on this within the party is the leader of the party, it s President Trump,  Hawley said.  You see him talking about holding multinational corporations responsible. You see him talking about bias in big tech. You see him talking about competition. </p><p> The person who has to face the entire country is attuned to this,  Hawley said.  I don t think that s an accident. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNGDLY-681802</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNGDLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X4V-MSK1-DY4X-T3V7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8371</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1046\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The National Journal Group, Inc.

The arm of Californian law is long.</p><p>The legislation's arrival has been accompanied by a significantly quieter fanfare in Britain than the trumpeting ahead of the GDPR. However, with fines of between $2,500 and $7,500 for each violation, penalties could be even bigger than those under the EU law.</p><p>But, perhaps as a result of the diminished attention, there is a prevailing belief that complying with the GDPR automatically means compliance with the CCPA. This is a dangerous fallacy. Although cut from a similar cloth, there is a significant divergence: the California law catches fewer businesses, but extends broader rights.</p><p>This departure is neatly demonstrated by the definition of data used, with the CCPA significantly increasing its scope. Where the GDPR defines personal data as information relating to an identified or identifiable person, the CCPA arguably expands that definition to any information capable of being associated with or linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular Californian resident or, crucially, a household.</p><p>This divergence is acute when it comes to the regulation of the sale of data. Unlike the GDPR, the California law specifically requires a privacy policy to spell out if a business sells data, and then affords consumers the right to opt out.</p><p>The definition of sale is broad. Put simply, the CCPA defines a sale as any form of disclosure to a third party in exchange for money or another valuable consideration.</p><p>Thus, a sale would occur if a business disclosed data for free and, in exchange for access, received valuable intelligence. Therefore, a careful review of contracts is essential.</p><p>The CCPA confers a host of new responsibilities, from imposing additional on-demand disclosure rights to requiring the updating of privacy policies annually. Compliance with the GDPR is a start, but in a global market, businesses need to be able to ride the entire regulatory wave.</p><p>                   Rafi Azim-Khan is a partner at the London office of Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman, a US law firm                 </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-59244242</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XXY-2311-JCJY-G55S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"496\"/><timeReceived>12:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 9, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

The founder, a public policy scholar, hails from the Brookings Institution. Its seed-stage capital was a Rockefeller Foundation grant, not venture capital. \u00c2\u00b6 Yet it's hard to imagine the firm taking root in the District even a dozen years ago. In a region long dominated by federal contractors, telecommunications providers and professional services, a start-up with ambitions of Web and mobile-based software had little place in the local economy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In recent years, that has begun to change. Technology firms in industries as varied as e-commerce, education, health care, cybersecurity and energy have made their home in the nation's capital and its surrounding suburbs. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The result is a burgeoning technology hub that some consider the region's new economy, particularly in the District, where hundreds of young entrepreneurs have formed a creative class of technologists with business ideas and the zeal to execute them.</p><p>\"If you want to change the world, you still come to Washington, D.C.,\" said Matt Fellowes, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/the-download-hellowallet-debuts-its-financial-help-software/2011/05/11/AFVKJK4G_story.html&#34; title=&#34;www.washingtonpost.com\">HelloWallet</url>'s chief executive. \"What we haven't done very well to date is connect that intellectual firepower with the capability of technology to solve these big problems. And that's what is happening right now, so I only see growth in this area going forward.\"</p><p>But that growth has already encountered challenges, and more are inevitable. Many of the ingredients that have allowed places such as Silicon Valley and Boston, and more recently New York, to thrive seem to be lacking here - or missing altogether.</p><p>Local entrepreneurs and investors have moved quickly to tackle such issues as the shortage of Web developers or the dearth of investors, but it remains to be seen whether those efforts can coalesce and a vibrant tech economy will emerge as a result.</p><h>Creating an ecosystem</h><p>AOL established the Washington region as fertile ground for consumer technology companies as the firm introduced millions of Americans to dial-up Internet, and pioneered the concepts of chat rooms and instant messaging.</p><p>The company's<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/17/AR2007091700415.html&#34; title=&#34;www.washingtonpost.com\">epicenter shifted to New York in 2007</url>after its ill-fated merger with Time Warner, and many of its workers here have defected to start their own ventures. Indeed, if you scan the resume of many local entrepreneurs, including LivingSocial chief executive Tim O'Shaughnessy, a stint at AOL can often be found.</p><p>These veterans created an ecosystem that many say forms the foundation for a successful technology hub: A megalith company attracts thousands of workers, who then gain experience, grow restless and decide to forge their own path. The result is an ever-extending pipeline of fledgling technology firms poised for growth.</p><p>That has contributed in part to the more diverse technology sector around Washington today.

Sector advocates have sought to replicate Silicon Valley's culture of mixing business networking and socializing, which many credit with making that region a destination for young, eager technologists. </p><p>Monthly D.C. Tech Meetups, which began last year, regularly attract hundreds of attendees  for two hours of start-up demos and entrepreneur panels, followed by a trip to a nearby bar. The second annual Digital Capital Week, Washington's biggest <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/scenes-from-digital-capital-week-and-tech-cocktail-2011/2011/11/11/gIQAJ0kZIN_gallery.html&#34; title=&#34;www.washingtonpost.com\">conference for the young tech crowd</url>, tallied roughly 10,000 registrants last November, including many out-of-towners.</p><p>But the entrepreneurs must be balanced out by venture capitalists and other investors who provide the money to get a business off the ground. Venture capital data show Washington has been outpaced by Silicon Valley, Boston and New York over the past 15 years in both number of deals and total money raised. </p><p>Of course there are local exceptions. District-based Revolution, an investment firm helmed by former AOL executive Steve Case, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/leonsis-case-found-450-million-fund-to-aid-washington-area-start-up-firms/2011/11/30/gIQAtb1fEO_story.html&#34; title=&#34;www.washingtonpost.com\">raised a $450 million fund last year</url>.

Both invest locally.</p><p>On the other end of the spectrum, several groups of early-stage investors, also called angels,  have been funneling small sums of money to help firms get started. CIT GAP Funds at Herndon's Center for Innovative Technology and the University of Maryland's Dingman Center Angels are among the most active.</p><p>Once a business has been formed and funded, the last step in the time line of many successful tech ventures is an exit. That may take the form of an initial public offering, or as is increasingly the case, an acquisition offer from a larger player.</p><p>Jonathan Aberman, managing director at Amplifier Ventures, said start-ups here should be building companies to be acquired by the industries that dominate Washington's economy - government, law, media and hospitality, to name a few. In Silicon Valley, start-ups live alongside some of the Web's biggest players, including Google, Facebook, Amazon and eBay. </p><p>\"My argument is if you really want to be like the Valley, you have to understand that what drives behavior in [mergers and acquisitions] is a lot of times proximity, and young companies building technologies that the large companies want to own,\" Aberman said.</p><p>That prompted real estate search engine <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/the-download-two-washington-start-ups-move-west/2011/05/20/AFRUYr9G_story.html&#34; title=&#34;www.washingtonpost.com\">HotPads.com to relocate to San Francisco</url>last spring after six years in the District. Chief executive Matt Corgan said at the time that he hoped the move would help the firm recruit engineers.</p><p>More than a year later, Corgan said he hasn't done much hiring from within Silicon Valley - though it's easier to get engineers to relocate there than the District, he said. Instead, being surrounded by potential acquirers has been the biggest benefit.</p><p>\"Anyone who would want to purchase HotPads or invest in it further is going to be a large Internet media company most likely and the people who run those companies are either located in San Francisco or very comfortable with it,\" Corgan said.</p><p>Beyond easier meetings with those strategic partners, Corgan said the business is not all that different today compared to its time in the District. The company's servers are still located in Virginia and some of its 22 employees still work remotely.</p><p>\"There's actually no operational benefit to being here [in the San Francisco Bay area] whatsoever, it's just the ability to network at the critical times,\" he said. \"It's like an hour-a-week type benefit. It's funny that you have to live here to get that, but it does matter in the end.\"</p><p>overlys@washpost.com</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPOST-74558a90-e160-11e1-ae7f-d2a13e249eb2</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPOST2012</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:56B4-RGF1-DXXY-3066-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8075</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-10-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1930\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2012 Washingtonpost.Newsweek Interactive Company, LLC d/b/a  Washington Post Digital All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Post</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12311\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Every Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"08\" year=\"2012\"><dateText>August 13, 2012 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC000D0GK</classCode><className>LIVINGSOCIAL INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>BROOKINGS INSTITUTION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519190 ALL OTHER INFORMATION SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The founder, a public policy scholar, hails from the Brookings Institution. Its seed-stage capital was a Rockefeller Foundation grant, not venture capital. \u00b6 Yet it's hard to imagine the firm taking root in the District even a dozen years ago. In a region long dominated by federal contractors, telecommunications providers and professional services, a start-up with ambitions of Web and mobile-based software had little place in the local economy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In recent years, that has begun to change. Technology firms in industries as varied as e-commerce, education, health care, cybersecurity and energy have made their home in the nation's capital and its surrounding suburbs. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The result is a burgeoning technology hub that some consider the region's new economy, particularly in the District, where hundreds of young entrepreneurs have formed a creative class of technologists with business ideas and the zeal to execute them.</p><p>\"If you want to change the world, you still come to Washington, D.C.,\" said Matt Fellowes, HelloWallet's chief executive. \"What we haven't done very well to date is connect that intellectual firepower with the capability of technology to solve these big problems. And that's what is happening right now, so I only see growth in this area going forward.\"          But that growth has already encountered challenges, and more are inevitable. Many of the ingredients that have allowed places such as Silicon Valley and Boston, and more recently New York, to thrive seem to be lacking here - or missing altogether.          </p><p>Local entrepreneurs and investors have moved quickly to tackle such issues as the shortage of Web developers or the dearth of investors, but it remains to be seen whether those efforts can coalesce and a vibrant tech economy will emerge as a result.          </p><p>                       Creating an ecosystem                    </p><p>AOL established the Washington region as fertile ground for consumer technology companies as the firm introduced millions of Americans to dial-up Internet, and pioneered the concepts of chat rooms and instant messaging.</p><p>The company's epicenter shifted to New York in 2007 after its ill-fated merger with Time Warner, and many of its workers here have defected to start their own ventures. Indeed, if you scan the resume of many local entrepreneurs, including LivingSocial chief executive Tim O'Shaughnessy, a stint at AOL can often be found.</p><p>These veterans created an ecosystem that many say forms the foundation for a successful technology hub: A megalith company attracts thousands of workers, who then gain experience, grow restless and decide to forge their own path.

Sector advocates have sought to replicate Silicon Valley's culture of mixing business networking and socializing, which many credit with making that region a destination for young, eager technologists. </p><p>Monthly D.C. Tech Meetups, which began last year, regularly attract hundreds of attendees  for two hours of start-up demos and entrepreneur panels, followed by a trip to a nearby bar. The second annual Digital CapitalWeek, Washington's biggest conference for the young tech crowd, tallied roughly 10,000 registrants last November, including many out-of-towners.          But the entrepreneurs must be balanced out by venture capitalists and other investors who provide the money to get a business off the ground. Venture capital data show Washington has been outpaced by Silicon Valley, Boston and New York over the past 15 years in both number of deals and total money raised.           </p><p>Of course there are local exceptions. District-based Revolution, an investment firm helmed by former AOL executive Steve Case, raised a $450 million fund last year. Just last month, New Enterprise Associates, a global financier with a large office in Chevy Chase, added $2.6 billion to its coffers. Both invest locally.          On the other end of the spectrum, several groups of early-stage investors, also called angels,  have been funneling small sums of money to help firms get started. CIT GAP Funds at Herndon's Center for Innovative Technology and the University of Maryland's Dingman Center Angels are among the most active.          </p><p>Once a business has been formed and funded, the last step in the time line of many successful tech ventures is an exit. That may take the form of an initial public offering, or as is increasingly the case, an acquisition offer from a larger player.</p><p>Jonathan Aberman, managing director at Amplifier Ventures, said start-ups here should be building companies to be acquired by the industries that dominate Washington's economy - government, law, media and hospitality, to name a few. In Silicon Valley, start-ups live alongside some of the Web's biggest players, including Google, Facebook, Amazon and eBay. </p><p>\"My argument is if you really want to be like the Valley, you have to understand that what drives behavior in [mergers and acquisitions] is a lot of times proximity, and young companies building technologies that the large companies want to own,\" Aberman said.</p><p>That prompted real estate search engine HotPads.com to relocate to San Francisco last spring after six years in the District. Chief executive Matt Corgan said at the time that he hoped the move would help the firm recruit engineers.</p><p>More than a year later, Corgan said he hasn't done much hiring from within Silicon Valley - though it's easier to get engineers to relocate there than the District, he said. Instead, being surrounded by potential acquirers has been the biggest benefit.</p><p>\"Anyone who would want to purchase HotPads or invest in it further is going to be a large Internet media company most likely and the people who run those companies are either located in San Francisco or very comfortable with it,\" Corgan said. </p><p>Beyond easier meetings with those strategic partners, Corgan said the business is not all that different today compared to its time in the District. The company's servers are still located in Virginia and some of its 22 employees still work remotely.</p><p>\"There's actually no operational benefit to being here [in the San Francisco Bay area] whatsoever, it's just the ability to network at the critical times,\" he said. \"It's like an hour-a-week type benefit. It's funny that you have to live here to get that, but it does matter in the end.\"</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:overlys@washpost.com\">overlys@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPCOM-74558a90e16011e1ae7fd2a13e249eb2</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPCOM2012</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:56B5-C2R1-JCDY-T21H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">265544</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1969\"/><timeReceived>8:12 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2012 Washingtonpost.Newsweek Interactive Company, LLC d/b/a Washington Post Digital All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washingtonpost.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33547\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"08\" year=\"2012\"><dateText>August 13, 2012 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC000D0GK</classCode><className>LIVINGSOCIAL INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>BROOKINGS INSTITUTION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"/><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000629</classCode><className>ENTREPRENEURSHIP</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DLLK</classCode><className>DIGITAL ECONOMY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000A498</classCode><className>MIDDLE INCOME PERSONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N813211MM</classCode><className>FOUNDATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001960</classCode><className>PUBLIC POLICY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000CM77</classCode><className>FINANCING ROUNDS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001207</classCode><className>NEW ECONOMY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST0009RPH</classCode><className>CHAT ROOMS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST000DEHO</classCode><className>TECHNICIANS &amp;

It goes something like:Banks have millions of customers, billions of capital and centuries of history, but are hampered by heritage; Start-ups have no customers, little capital and no history, but are driven by vision; whilst Tech giants have billions of customers, billions of capital, decades of history and have vision and drive.In other words, the tech giants - Amazon, Facebook, Alibaba, Tencent - have both customers, capital and vision to win. This is summed up well in a recent 11FS post that fleshes out the meat of this statement in more depth. TitledBanking Battlefield: Winning the War for Customers,it delves deep into the future landscape of finance and they've been kind enough to share it here. </p><p>Enjoy!Banking Battlefield: Winning the War for Customers[1]by David M. Brear Over the last two years we have kept coming back to one diagram, the 11:FS Banking Battlefield. We use this to explain the changes we see in the financial services industry. In fact, one particular workshop we did in Australia last year had us talking through this diagram for the entire day! Seriously. It also featured in three bank board packs in the last 6 months which is also a pretty good indication we're onto something. At 11:FS we like to describe the state of banking today as a battlefield where incumbent banks are being attacked from all sides by new challengers and non-FS digital players. This battlefield is under more pressure today than ever before and filled with micro battles, all of which are shaping the future of the industry we all work within. It could not be a more volatile and interesting time to be looking at banking. The context for this diagram is super important. When we stood back from the industry far enough to take it all in and try to make sense of it, we saw two main drivers in the market that are shaping all of the player's futures.Number of Customers - The number of customers you have (in turn this is about the level of success you have/the amount of revenue you're making and so on and so forth) denotes your impact on the industry, but also your perspective on the industry and what needs to change. Intelligent Digital Service (IDS) - The sophistication of the digital services that are being provided by those organisations in Financial Services. These could be internally or externally but we mainly focus this on service to customers. Note: this isn't about how fancy your website is, but deeper digital services that might be operational in nature as well as your mobile app. But that deserves its own blog post in the future. Once you have your head around the axes it's about the players on the board. You have 4 main ones that we see today vying for customers' attention:1. Incumbent BanksWhat?: The big banks all have one thing in common and that is vast amounts of customers in the market, but also all the bad connotations of the word 'legacy' when it comes to their level of sophistication of digital services. Key Challenges: Incumbent banks have the issue and burden of past successes. The largest customer base comes with a significant sense of importance as to how they conduct business, as well as all of the costs you would expect from a company of such a size. Both technological and regulatory. Add in the rising sense of customer expectation as to what services they offer and they are facing a war on many fronts. Who are they?: RBS, HSBC, Barclays etc - you know, the 'big banks'.2. Brand ChallengersWhat?: These guys are the MNOs and surrounding industries that have taken advantage of their position and customer base to launch banks with a brand who are mostly recognised for something else. Key Challenges: The brand challengers in this space for the most part have all of the issues of their bigger brothers, but a fraction of the customers. Most have built their banks on the same structures and technologies that hold back the big banks. Who are they?: Metro Bank, First Direct, Tesco Bank.3. Startups and Digital ChallengersWhat?: These are the new kids on the block: brand new banking players with fully digital banking systems,intelligent services, and products to offer their customers. Key Challenges: Gaining customers. These are usually new, small startups that are just starting out with limited market spend and therefore reach and growth (at least at first). Who are they?: Monzo, Starling, Atom, Tandem, Revolut (in the UK).4. Consumer Digital GiantsWhat?: These are big tech giants who are not traditionally banking providers, but have a lot of customers, a lot of sophisticated technology and huge amounts of customer data (and money). This gives them the resources they need to start providing banking services with relative ease. Key Challenges: Trust. They hold a lot of customer's data, but will customers trust them enough to make the switch to use them as a banking provider? Likewise these companies have hugely sophisticated tech systems, but do they want to make the switch to become a banking service and be regulated accordingly? Who are they?: Amazon, Google, Facebook, Apple, Ant Financial, Baidu, Tencent As you can see, everyone is trying to get to the top right of this diagram. Everyone wants the most customers and the most sophisticated IDS. Incumbent banks have the customers but they need the tech, new challengers have the tech but not the customers, and the big tech companies seemingly have everything they need to be a real threat, if and when they start offering banking services.Getting Across the PageAt 11:FS we work with a number of people on this battlefield at different points but this is always the funnest part of any presentation. There is usually a pause at the end of this explanation. The question then comes. 'Okay okay so how do we get across the page?'So the advice we give is pretty to the point: 'You can't, and should stop trying. It's too hard. What you're trying to do is take the legacy systems and drag them forward kicking and screaming, and it's going to take too long and cost too much. There's a reason why most big bank's announcements surrounding innovation manifest themselves predominantly in terms of how much they're spending, not what they've done or plan to do.'The Red Queen's RaceDon't get me wrong here. Big banks have it tough. To make billions they have to spend billions. They have to constantly be ensuring regulatory compliance. Ensuring mandatory changes are made, the lights are kept on. Then and only then, after all those other things are taken care of, can they look to move the dial towards changing the organisation's future. A starving man doesn't worry about what he is having for dinner in the future, he's got to eat today! Likewise banks rightly have to be so preoccupied with eating today and ensuring the bank's lights stay on, by which I mean looking after the here and now. That's a lot of lights to keep on and a lot of mouths to feed. This leads to the behaviour we see. Billions of pounds being provisioned for 'Digital Transformation', most of which end up with little being changed beyond incrementally moving something forwards. Its the Red Queen's race I've written about in the past[2]. Banks have to run as hard as they can just to stay in the same place.What's the Plan?So if you can't get across the page, what should banks do instead? If you work in a bank strategy department I'm about to save you millions on consultancy fees for the McConsultancys of the world. This is a financial services incumbent bank's strategy for the next 5 years, summarised into a 3 sentence joke, ready? There's a man driving through the countryside, trying to find a nearby town. He is desperately lost surrounded by fields and so when he sees a woman by the side of the road pushing a bike he pulls over and asks for directions. After a long pause and head scratching the woman says, 'Well, If you want to get there I wouldn't start from here.' Okay, translation time. Banks cannot get to where they want to in the speed they want to, and to the quality of outcome if they start from where they currently are. It's just not possible or at least not effective.Sisyphean TaskI've said that's the wrong strategy for years now and will only lead to billions being spent and disappointment by the CEOs and Boards of those banks who they serve. The change they create will take too long and ultimately not make a big enough change to make a marked difference, not when the world around them is moving faster. If banks continue to continue to try to carry the boulder of legacy technology and culture up the mountain of the changing banking battlefield, they will be punished in Sisyphean style. The boulder will roll back down and they'll be back to where they started and ultimately, beaten to the post by those who think about this problem in a different way. Doing nothing is no longer an option. The big tech giants are also getting ever closer to announcing their invasion into the market; they have the tech, the customers and the money to make seismic shifts. They won't just copy the traditional banking model, they'll be doing something brand new which causes tension in the market. For the big banks, the time to act is now, to cross the Banking Battlefield and start winning the war for customers.

No, I didn't think so. It was an online retailer for pet accessories that started operating in 1998. It ran a wildly successful marketing campaign, featuring an odd doglike sock puppet but more notably it was an early pioneer of selling stuff on the under-explored plains of the World Wide Web.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the late 1990s companies were springing up like mushrooms after the rain, fertilised with bags of investor cash just for adding \".com\" to the end of their names.</p><p>Pets.com was a poster child of that boom. And regrettably as it turned out also of the bust. Listed publicly on the stock market in August 1998, fewer than 270 days later it filed for bankruptcy - a remarkable feat, even as the internet ushered in a new era of speed.</p><p>The problem was that the rise of the web had prompted almost unprecedented economic speculation. It opened up a galaxy of opportunity for both consumers and entrepreneurs. And every investor with cash in their pocket and dollar signs in their eyes wanted a piece of the sacred pie.</p><p>Companies that had yet to turn a profit - and, as it later turned out, never would - were valued at billions of dollars. Rock-bottom interest rates made bank funding readily available. And then suddenly, almost overnight, the glossy ecosystem of newfangled corporates started to unravel dramatically. Investors woke up to the idea that many of these new corporations lacked the basics: a fundamental ability to generate money on a sustainable level.</p><p>What happened next has been documented exhaustively but in recent years this particular tale of economic demise has been drowned out in the bars, restaurants and boardrooms of Wall Street, Canary Wharf and Silicon Valley. It's become folklore. One for the annals of crises past. The mistakes of our ignorant forefathers.</p><p>Many of those making the investment decisions, launching the companies and even writing about them today don't remember how they felt when the Nasdaq tech stock index lost almost 80 per cent of its value in the space of just over two years. So what's there to say about it today?</p><p>The only tech they (and we!) cared about was making sure Tamagotchis got fed. Mark Zuckerberg was 15 when Pets.com went bust and even a whizz-kid like him probably wouldn't have been able to tell you the merits of calculating a price-to-earnings ratio.</p><p>Now as Amazon's share price surges above $1,000, as Google owner Alphabet looks back on 30 per cent of share price growth in the past year, and as investors start predicting that Apple will hit the $1 trillion valuation mark, it may well pay to start dusting off those history books.</p><p>Truth is, the evidence we might be heading for trouble is staggering and far more worrisome than what the global fallout from something as isolated as Brexit might be.</p><p>And you don't have to take my word for it.</p><p>Last month Robert Bouroujerdi, chief investment officer at Goldman Sachs, and most definitely someone who does remember the last dotcom boom, published a report in which he cautioned of the growing risks presented by the meteoric rise of the Big Five tech behemoths: Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Alphabet and Microsoft.</p><p>Bouroujerdi noted that in the year to the start of June, these companies added a total of $600bn of market capitalisation - the equivalent of the gross domestic product of Hong Kong and South Africa combined. Parallels to the 1999-2000 crash are becoming increasingly evident, he said.</p><p>The note roiled the market, giving us a taste of just how nervy some of the investors in these companies are becoming. Apple shares fell 4 per cent, swiping about $30bn off the market capitalisation of the world's most valuable company, and this was a relatively moderate warning. Just think of the impact a more harrowing premonition might have had.</p><p>Tech companies are deeply intertwined: when one falls it often takes scores of others down with it and often psychology dictates that the more a stock falls the more likely it is to fall further. Imagine rats scuttling for the exit on a sinking ship. No one wants to be caught inside a cabin and sink.</p><p>The question we should be asking ourselves now is what will cause the first domino to topple. It could be any number of things.</p><p>The European Union last month slapped Google with an eye-watering pound 2.4bn fine for abusing its dominance in the market for search engines. Now others are in the regulator's crosshairs because of concerns around everything from advertising standards to consumer privacy.</p><p>The EU certainly has the teeth and the clout to curtail big tech companies' dominance. Some campaigners have even called for a break-up of the tech giants, borrowing the \"too-big-to-fail\" refrain from their banking buddies. Might that be enough to send investors scampering? And then of course there are the reputational dramas that have engulfed the sector. A string of expos\u00e9s has cast an unflattering and deeply necessary light on the rampant sexism and abuse prevalent across many of the big companies and their smaller prot\u00e9g\u00e9s.</p><p>Capitalist warriors looking for a quick buck or the prestige of being a Silicon Valley hero might not necessarily care about such issues as discrimination and misogyny for now. But they certainly will once the big financial endorsers determine that things have gotten a little too risqu\u00e9 for them to be involved. The tech sector is a small world and reputation can be quick to destroy and hellish to rebuild. Perhaps that will be the straw that breaks the unicorns' backs.</p><p>It might seem hard to think of companies of such titanic magnitude as anything other than unflappable. But once again, giants have fallen before. General Motors was the biggest company in the world 20 years ago. Today it doesn't feature in the top 10. The business landscape is constantly evolving, sticking to a boom-and-bust cycle, as we experience and then forget what happens when we become too greedy. A doglike sock puppet may have been an unlikely victim of the last dotcom crisis. I don't see why a precocious unicorn wouldn't be just as good at playing that part.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYTIM-DATIMES1007201700049</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYTIM2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5P0B-5BT1-JCH9-G1ND-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">381931</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1011\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Daily Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Daily Times</publicationName><volume>Vol. 15</volume><issueNumber>No. 189</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"07\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>July 10, 2017 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0007598</classCode><className>IPET HOLDINGS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>GOOG (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Pakistan</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N4493910M</classCode><className>PET STORES &amp;

No, I didn't think so. It was an online retailer for pet accessories that started operating in 1998. It ran a wildly successful marketing campaign, featuring an odd doglike sock puppet but more notably it was an early pioneer of selling stuff on the under-explored plains of the World Wide Web.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the late 1990s companies were springing up like mushrooms after the rain, fertilised with bags of investor cash just for adding \".com\" to the end of their names.</p><p>Pets.com was a poster child of that boom. Andregrettably as it turned outalso of the bust.Listed publicly on the stockmarket in August 1998, fewer than 270 days later it filed for bankruptcy - a remarkable feat, even as the internet ushered in a new era of speed.</p><p>The problem was that the rise of the web had prompted almost unprecedented economic speculation. It opened up a galaxy of opportunity for both consumers and entrepreneurs.And every investor with cash in their pocket and dollar signs in their eyes wanted a piece of the sacred pie.</p><p>Companies that had yet to turn a profit - and, as it later turned out, never would - were valued at billions of dollars. Rock-bottom interest rates made bank funding readily available. And then suddenly, almost overnight, the glossy ecosystem of newfangled corporates started to unravel dramatically. Investors woke up to the idea that many of these new corporations lacked the basics: a fundamental ability to generate money on a sustainable level.</p><p>What happened next has been documented exhaustivelybut in recent years this particular tale of economic demise has been drowned out in the bars, restaurants and boardrooms of Wall Street, Canary Wharf and Silicon Valley. It's become folklore. One for the annals of crises past. The mistakes of our ignorant forefathers.</p><p>Many of those making the investment decisions, launching the companies and even writing about them today don't remember how they felt when the Nasdaq tech stock index lost almost 80 per cent of its value in the space of just over two years. So what's there to say about it today?</p><p>The only tech they (and we!) cared about was making sure Tamagotchis got fed. Mark Zuckerberg was 15 when Pets.com wentbust and even a whizz-kid like him probably wouldn't have been able to tell you the merits of calculating a price-to-earnings ratio.</p><p>Nowas Amazon's share price surges above $1,000, as Google owner Alphabet looks back on 30 per cent of share price growth in the past year, and as investors start predicting that Apple will hit the $1trillion valuation mark, it may well pay to start dusting off those history books.</p><p>Truth is, the evidence we might be heading for trouble is staggering and far more worrisome than what the global fallout from something as isolated as Brexit might be.</p><p>Google slapped with record \u00a32.1bn fine for online shopping competition breaches</p><p>And you don't have to take my word for it.</p><p>Last monthRobert Bouroujerdi, chief investment officer atGoldman Sachs, and most definitely someone who </p><p>does</p><p> remember the last dotcom boom, published a report in which he cautioned of the growing risks presented by the meteoric rise of the BigFive tech behemoths: Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Alphabet and Microsoft.</p><p>Bouroujerdi noted that in the year to the start of June, these companies added a total of $600bn of market capitalisation - the equivalent of the gross domestic product of Hong Kong and South Africa combined. Parallels to the 1999-2000 crash are becoming increasingly evident, he said.</p><p>The note roiled the market, giving us a taste of just how nervy some of the investors in these companies are becoming. Apple shares fell 4 per cent, swiping about $30bn off the market capitalisation of the world's most valuable company, and this was a relatively moderate warning. Just thinkof the impact a more harrowing premonition might have had.</p><p>Tech companies are deeply intertwined: when one falls it often takes scores of others down with it and often psychology dictates that the more a stock falls the more likely it is to fall further. Imagine rats scuttling for the exit on a sinking ship. No one wants to be caught inside a cabin and sink.</p><p>The question we should be asking ourselves now is what will cause the first domino to topple. It could be any number of things.</p><p>The European Union last month slapped Google with an eye-watering (EURO)2.4bn fine for abusing its dominance in the market for search engines. Now others are in the regulator's crosshairs because of concerns around everything from advertising standards to consumer privacy.</p><p>The EU certainly has the teeth and the clout to curtail big tech companies' dominance. Some campaigners have even called for a break-up of the tech giants, borrowing the \"too-big-to-fail\" refrain from their banking buddies. Might that be enough to send investors scampering?</p><p>Read more</p><p>Uber's CEO resignation will not stop Silicon Valley's bro culture</p><p>And then of course there are the reputational dramas that have engulfed the sector. A string of expos\u00e9s has cast an unflattering and deeply necessary light on the rampant sexism and abuse prevalent across many of the big companies and their smaller prot\u00e9g\u00e9s.</p><p>Capitalist warriors looking for a quick buck or the prestige of being a Silicon Valley hero might not necessarily care about such issues as discrimination and misogyny for now. But they certainly will once the big financial endorsers determine that things have gotten a little too risqu\u00e9 for them to be involved.</p><p>The tech sector is a small world and reputation can be quick to destroy and hellish to rebuild. Perhaps that will be the straw that breaks the unicorns' backs.</p><p>It might seem hard to think of companies of such titanic magnitude as anything other than unflappable. But once again, giants have fallen before.General Motors was the biggest company in the world 20 years ago. Today it doesn't feature in the top 10.</p><p>The business landscape is constantly evolving, sticking to a boom-and-bust cycle, as we experience and then forget what happens when we become too greedy.</p><p>A doglike sock puppet may have been an unlikely victim of the last dotcom crisis.

No, I didn't think so. It was an online retailer for pet accessories that started operating in 1998. It ran a wildly successful marketing campaign, featuring an odd doglike sock puppet but more notably it was an early pioneer of selling stuff on the under-explored plains of the World Wide Web.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the late 1990s companies were springing up like mushrooms after the rain, fertilised with bags of investor cash just for adding \".com\" to the end of their names.</p><p>Pets.com was a poster child of that boom. Andregrettably as it turned outalso of the bust.Listed publicly on the stockmarket in August 1998, fewer than 270 days later it filed for bankruptcy - a remarkable feat, even as the internet ushered in a new era of speed.</p><p>The problem was that the rise of the web had prompted almost unprecedented economic speculation. It opened up a galaxy of opportunity for both consumers and entrepreneurs.And every investor with cash in their pocket and dollar signs in their eyes wanted a piece of the sacred pie.</p><p>Companies that had yet to turn a profit - and, as it later turned out, never would - were valued at billions of dollars. Rock-bottom interest rates made bank funding readily available. And then suddenly, almost overnight, the glossy ecosystem of newfangled corporates started to unravel dramatically. Investors woke up to the idea that many of these new corporations lacked the basics: a fundamental ability to generate money on a sustainable level.</p><p>What happened next has been documented exhaustivelybut in recent years this particular tale of economic demise has been drowned out in the bars, restaurants and boardrooms of Wall Street, Canary Wharf and Silicon Valley. It's become folklore. One for the annals of crises past. The mistakes of our ignorant forefathers.</p><p>Read more</p><p>We are heading for a tech bubble burst in 18 months</p><p>Many of those making the investment decisions, launching the companies and even writing about them today don't remember how they felt when the Nasdaq tech stock index lost almost 80 per cent of its value in the space of just over two years. So what's there to say about it today?</p><p>The only tech they (and we!) cared about was making sure Tamagotchis got fed. Mark Zuckerberg was 15 when Pets.com wentbust and even a whizz-kid like him probably wouldn't have been able to tell you the merits of calculating a price-to-earnings ratio.</p><p>Nowas Amazon's share price surges above $1,000, as Google owner Alphabet looks back on 30 per cent of share price growth in the past year, and as investors start predicting that Apple will hit the $1trillion valuation mark, it may well pay to start dusting off those history books.</p><p>Truth is, the evidence we might be heading for trouble is staggering and far more worrisome than what the global fallout from something as isolated as Brexit might be.</p><p>And you don't have to take my word for it.</p><p>Last monthRobert Bouroujerdi, chief investment officer atGoldman Sachs, and most definitely someone who </p><p>does</p><p> remember the last dotcom boom, published a report in which he cautioned of the growing risks presented by the meteoric rise of the BigFive tech behemoths: Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Alphabet and Microsoft.</p><p>Bouroujerdi noted that in the year to the start of June, these companies added a total of $600bn of market capitalisation - the equivalent of the gross domestic product of Hong Kong and South Africa combined. Parallels to the 1999-2000 crash are becoming increasingly evident, he said.</p><p>The note roiled the market, giving us a taste of just how nervy some of the investors in these companies are becoming. Apple shares fell 4 per cent, swiping about $30bn off the market capitalisation of the world's most valuable company, and this was a relatively moderate warning. Just thinkof the impact a more harrowing premonition might have had.</p><p>Tech companies are deeply intertwined: when one falls it often takes scores of others down with it and often psychology dictates that the more a stock falls the more likely it is to fall further. Imagine rats scuttling for the exit on a sinking ship. No one wants to be caught inside a cabin and sink.</p><p>The question we should be asking ourselves now is what will cause the first domino to topple. It could be any number of things.</p><p>The European Union last month slapped Google with an eye-watering (EURO)2.4bn fine for abusing its dominance in the market for search engines. Now others are in the regulator's crosshairs because of concerns around everything from advertising standards to consumer privacy.</p><p>The EU certainly has the teeth and the clout to curtail big tech companies' dominance. Some campaigners have even called for a break-up of the tech giants, borrowing the \"too-big-to-fail\" refrain from their banking buddies. Might that be enough to send investors scampering?</p><p>And then of course there are the reputational dramas that have engulfed the sector. A string of expos\u00e9s has cast an unflattering and deeply necessary light on the rampant sexism and abuse prevalent across many of the big companies and their smaller prot\u00e9g\u00e9s.</p><p>Capitalist warriors looking for a quick buck or the prestige of being a Silicon Valley hero might not necessarily care about such issues as discrimination and misogyny for now. But they certainly will once the big financial endorsers determine that things have gotten a little too risqu\u00e9 for them to be involved.</p><p>The tech sector is a small world and reputation can be quick to destroy and hellish to rebuild. Perhaps that will be the straw that breaks the unicorns' backs.</p><p>It might seem hard to think of companies of such titanic magnitude as anything other than unflappable. But once again, giants have fallen before.General Motors was the biggest company in the world 20 years ago. Today it doesn't feature in the top 10.</p><p>The business landscape is constantly evolving, sticking to a boom-and-bust cycle, as we experience and then forget what happens when we become too greedy.</p><p>A doglike sock puppet may have been an unlikely victim of the last dotcom crisis. I don't see why a precocious unicorn wouldn't be just as good at playing that part.</p><p>You can listen to Josie Cox read and disucssher piece here:</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INPDWB-36178864</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INPDWB2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5P45-RN21-JCJY-G46M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1028\"/><timeReceived>4:22 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Independent Digital News and Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Independent (United Kingdom)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19720\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"07\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>July 5, 2017 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

When taking a closer look at the numbers, with particular reflection on the 2008 financial crisis, some serious questions arise pertaining to consumer sovereignty, growth longevity, and inflation. These dangers may pop the tech bubble.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The chief suspects are the FAANGs: Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Alphabet's Google. The FAANG five make up about fifteen percent of the SandP 500 and account for almost all of its growth this year. The ten-year bull run since the meltdown is defined by the FAANGs. They may also define its undoing.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday that Facebookwants your bank account information. In light of the Cambridge Analytica scandal of this last year, Facebook's liaison with the banking industry is deeply troubling. Yes, companies are incentivized to streamline purchase systems. But leaks and hacks, such as with credit giant Equifax this past year, are credible threats. The Journal's report highlights the intrusiveness of big tech.</p><p>Consumer sovereignty concerns don't end there. The recent banning of Alex Jones's \"InfoWars\" on Apple's iTunes, Facebook, and Youtube are mere symptoms of undiagnosed problems. In short, consumers, regulators, and big tech are learning how to operate together. On the supply side, the narrowness of company product lineups worries investors. How did the iPhone carry Apple to a trillion dollar stock value? Can Googlediversify from ad revenue alone? Are FAANG stocks value stocks will they hit a certain value and sit or are they growth stocks?</p><p>To be sure, the emperor has clothes. Profits, revenues, cash holdings, growth rates, and other metrics demonstrate the real values of these companies. The questions above are but brush strokes for the day trader. In the greater economic landscape, however, the question pertains to inflation: is the economy off center and if it is, how does this relate to the tech market?</p><p>Economics isn't called the dismal science flippantly. The FAANGs are fine, but something is wrong with the entire picture.</p><p>The Federal Reserve quantitative easing policy post-2008 has created a huge bubble. Money, counting into the trillions of dollars, was printed to combat economic downturn. Now, that money, in combination with low interest rates, is pushing values higher than they are actually worth. We are sick from yesterday's medicine.</p><p>The Great Recession and the policies post-crash continue to drag on the economy. The artificial pumping of money into the U.S. economy, by printing bills to bail out too big to fail banks, has created what economists call the Cantillon Effect, as defined by the American Council for Economic Research (AIER):</p><p>The Cantillon Effect refers to the change in relative prices resulting from a change in money supply. The change in relative prices occurs because the change in money supply has a specific injection point and therefore a specific flow path through the economy. The first recipient of the new supply of money is in the convenient position of being able to spend extra dollars before prices have increased. But whoever is last in line receives his share of new dollars after prices have increased.</p><p>The first '49er to strike it rich at Sutter's Mill, for example, was incentivized to make new purchases quickly because prices lagged far behind knowledge of the money supply. Over the last ten years, we have seen this story play out. Certain industries were given favorable status by the first users of the new money, the big banks. As of now, the most notable recipients would be the housing market, goaded onward with ultra low interest rates and down payments (is it 2007 or 2018?).</p><p>How does this involve the tech sector? While high tech may be running on retained corporate earnings and stock shares, they are a part of the economy. If you cannot afford rent, you cannot pay for Netflix. When one pillar collapses, the next will go.</p><p>So, is tech a leading or lagging indicator of a bust? Looking at this last year's growth rates, it could be a mixture of both. The ten-year bull run is the longest in U.S. economic history and we are due for a pop. And, as stated, the FAANGs are the horns of this bull market.</p><p>The tech sector is the market to watch because of market psychology. As Mark Thornton of the Ludwig von Mises Institute put it, \"The [Federal Reserve] created the bubble and the deregulation and tax reform has allowed the market to return close to its all-time highs. Psychologically, if the market can't set a new all-time here it will disappoint the market. With the prospects of rate hikes coming the unraveling can begin.\"</p><p>If the tech sector can't keep chugging along, it could spell trouble.</p><p>Don't jump off the high rise, it's not 1929 yet. The FAANGs still have solid growth on the back of deregulation, tax reform, and good business practice. For instance, Apple has been able to move billions of dollars from its offshore accounts back into the U.S. for the first time in years. Private firms are hitting the marks they should all the while addressing consumer concerns. Yet, be warned. The system is broken and big tech could be the first to go.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1122336238</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T4D-D7V1-JCBF-S4TG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"905\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 10, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Rejected: The LSE turns down Hong Kong's takeover after blaming uncertainty as well as political risk. WeWork-ing towards an IPO. The startup plans to go public, but the founder shakes up its structure to do so. Brands be there for you. Why businesses is so keen make \"Friends\" 25 years on. It is Friday and this is FIRST MOVE.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A very warm welcome. Isa Soares sitting in for Julia Chatterley. It is Friday, the 13th. It is two o'clock here in London, Friday the 13th but it seems the signs are that it's bringing good luck not bad, at least on Wall Street. Have a look at the futures pointing to a higher open there. The futures, Dow up three tenths of a percent. The NASDAQ just a tenth of a percent or so. S&amp;P similar picture. All pretty much looking pretty good on the week as well.</p><p>Investors have gotten most of what they were looking for this week, not just a new short of monetary stimulus, if you remember from the ECB - the European Central Bank. We are also seeing signs of a break in the U.S.- China trade war. Of course, the question is, how long will that last?</p><p>Early on Friday, China delivered the latest in a series of what the U.S. President calls goodwill gestures. State media saying American pork as well as soybeans will be exempt from new tariffs. I will take you to Wall Street in just a minute to get a sense really how investors are interpreting this.</p><p>Have a look at the European markets though as we come to a few hours or so until the end of trade. Xetra DAX up almost half the percent; Paris CAC 40, a quarter; Amsterdam, a flat there, but the Milan MIB half of one percent.</p><p>Now in Europe, if you remember, ECB President Mario Draghi really dividing opinion on Thursday with a new round of stimulus. But European markets all taking on this stride, all in the green this Friday, the 13th.</p><p>And don't forget the Federal Reserve. They're holding another rate meeting next week. The big question for marketers, will the Fed follow with fresh cut? And markets is where we begin our drivers today.</p><p>Alison Kosik joins me now from New York. Alison, we will talk about the Fed in just a moment. But let's talk stocks because we seeing stocks really edgy, near those record highs. Is everyone just feeling very optimistic about that U.S. and China extending olive branches to one another here?</p><p>ALISON KOSIK, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: There may be a little bit of that, Isa, but I think more of the optimism is coming from the expectation that the Fed will cut another quarter percentage point and make that cut next week.</p><p>Of course the market is definitely going to be watching whether the Fed says, whether there will be more cuts. So that really is another step that the Fed would have to take to continue the optimism, but the optimism really is incredible when you look at the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow, they are fractional percentage points away from all-time highs. Never mind the trade war, despite softening a little bit is far from over.</p><p>Many multinational companies are expecting to report weak third quarter earnings. You know, never mind the fact that there's been a contraction in manufacturing for the first time in three years. And never mind the fact that Donald Trump continues to duke it out with the Fed.</p><p>So we're seeing stocks really hold up well, despite a little bit of a rough August. We did see stocks bounce back. So this bull-run really still has legs to run. There is an expectation at least from one analyst from BTIG strategist, Julian Emanuel, he thinks that the S&amp;P 500 could get to 30 to 50 by the end of the year. That means that's an almost nine percent jump from where it is now -- Isa.</p><p>SOARES: Well, pretty impressive. Let's talk about the Fed and next week and what you're hearing from the trader that you've spoken to. We know, President Trump, he has been highly critical of the Fed's policy. In fact, he tweeted this week regarding ECB saying that the ECB had acted quickly, while the Fed didn't act. In fact, he even called for rates of zero or lower in a tweet.</p><p>From those you've been speaking to, what are you hearing? Which way will the Fed move here?</p><p>KOSIK: Yes, the expectation once again is that the Fed will cut a quarter percentage point. You know what Donald Trump wants is to see a half a percent. Many are thinking that's just too much. The data that we've been getting, despite it being mixed, you know, showing once again, a contraction in manufacturing, but still showing that jobs are still hanging on as far as the numbers go.</p><p>The question is whether the Fed is justified to make even a quarter percentage point cut, but many are still expecting that to happen. Because the data still is mixed. The inverted yield curve is still a factor in in the Fed's thinking even though it shouldn't be, it probably is that Fed members do consider, you know, the big picture when they make that decision next week -- Isa.</p><p>[09:05:15]</p><p>SOARES: Alison Kosik, thank you very much. Good to see you, Alison. And some developing news to bring you, in the past couple of hours, in fact, the London Stock Exchange has rejected the Hong Kong exchanges takeover offer. Our Clare Sebastian has more on this. Clare, talk us through the reasons for rejecting the offer, what concerns did they have here?</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Well, Isa, the LSE has published a letter to the management of the Hong Kong Exchanges and clearing group this morning and it was brutal. They really criticized almost everything about this deal.</p><p>The first point they say was that the problem was this was contingent on them dropping an existing kind of a purchase of Refinitive, which is a market data company that has been, they say, extremely well received by the market.</p><p>By contrast, they say a takeover by the Hong Kong Exchanges would be quite a significant backward step for the LSE group strategically. So it's a pretty strong language there.</p><p>The second problem they say is that the regulatory approval process for this takeover would have been very long and created a lot of uncertainty for shareholders. Part of the problem of that is that they say, \"There is no doubt that your unusual Board structure and your relationship with the Hong Kong government will complicate matters.\"</p><p>We know that the Hong Kong government is the biggest single shareholder in the Hong Kong Exchanges and clearing. There's a lot of concern about China tightening its control over the city. That has been the root of a lot of the protests that we've seen in recent months, so clearly; that was a factor in this decision as well.</p><p>And they didn't like the structure of the deal, either. The fact that three quarters of it was made up with shares in Hong Kong Exchanges, and they were disappointed. They said that this went -- they went public with this just two days after notifying the LSE, so a stinging rebuke there, Isa. Pretty unusual to see that kind of criticism in this context.</p><p>SOARES: Pretty -- pretty damning. There was nothing positive there, but actually I am going to now ask, Rob, our producer to bring the share price because actually, the London Stock Exchange stocks actually are doing pretty well on the news, and Clare, you and I know this because analysts had widely expected the bid to fail, talking about worries, about Chinese influence over financial infrastructure.</p><p>Actually, we're looking at the share price now, almost up three and a half percent. But going back to the deal, you know, putting that aside the financial infrastructure and the concerns, was the proposition attractive in any way for shareholders, Clare?</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Well, I mean, it's pretty interesting actually looking at the share price, Isa, because it did go up about five percent on the day that this emerged, this news of a potential takeover bid, but as you see, as well up on the rejection, as well.</p><p>So I think that kind of -- that clearly has won out. And of course, the share price is up significantly more than 25 percent since the Refinitive deal was announced back in July. So clearly that is the proposal given that it was a binary choice between the two that shareholders prefer.</p><p>There was a grudging kind of nod in the letter to the fact that this takeover by the Hong Kong Exchanges would have provided greater access to the Chinese market and all of that growth there, but the LSE is saying that they already have access through a partnership they have with the Shanghai Stock Exchange.</p><p>So overall, you know, I think, we can hark back to the fact that the CEO of the Hong Kong Exchanges described this as a corporate Romeo and Juliet. I think he may now live to regret that because it seems to have been doomed from the start -- Isa.</p><p>SOARES: Brilliant. Clare Sebastian there for us. And Clare will be here for us later, as we talk \"Friends.\" Thanks, Clare. We will speak to you in a minute.</p><p>Now, workspace startup, WeWork plans to go public on the NASDAQ. The development comes as the company changes its governance structure. This includes appointing a new independent director by the end of this year. Matt Egan is with me. Matt, now this is fascinating story because I've been looking at WeWork in the last couple of days. Talk us through how they've changed the governance structure, whether that critically, Matt is enough to attract investors to their public offering here.</p><p>MATT EGAN, CNN BUSINESS LEAD WRITER: So Isa, this is what it looks like when a company is desperate to salvage its IPO. Right? I mean, this WeWork debut was really on life support, because investors were very concerned. They really didn't want to touch this thing, due to concerns about massive losses and questionable corporate governance issues.</p><p>And so now, WeWork is taking this sort of unusual step of just weeks before its IPO, it is announcing a series of corporate governance changes that they seem to be designed to sort of reassure Wall Street that this company is willing to grow up at least if that's what it takes to go public.</p><p>So just running through a couple of those changes. Lead independent director appointed by yearend, the power of the super voting shares are going to get cut in half, no member of CEO, Adam Neumann's family will sit on the Board. If Neumann becomes incapacitated or dies, his wife will no longer get to pick his successor.</p><p>[09:10:02]</p><p>EGAN: You know, of course, I think all of this raises a question though. I mean, if WeWork thought these were such smart moves, why didn't announce them earlier? Why did it take the fact that the IPO was on the verge of collapse before it did that? Now, that may rub some shareholders the wrong way.</p><p>But even if they do reassure people who are worried about these management issues, there is still this question about whether or not the company even has a path to profitability, right? Because WeWork has lost $4.2 billion since the start of 2016. It lost more than $900 million just during the first six months of this year. So Isa, it's no wonder why this company is in such a rush to raise more money.</p><p>SOARES: And on that point, Matt, I do wonder whether you know, these changes suffice in many ways, because I was reading a fascinating article by a journalist in \"The Guardian\" here who is basically saying that WeWork looks like a bubble waiting to burst, basically arguing its value is inflated. What are you hearing?</p><p>EGAN: Well, we're hearing that the valuation is coming down really, really sharply, which is very telling, right? Because in the last round of funding as a private company, WeWork was valued at $47 billion. That was just earlier this year. Now, \"The Wall Street Journal\" is reporting that the IPO valuation, if it happens, is going to be below $20 billion. That is really a remarkable shift.</p><p>And I think it's indicative of this serious skepticism about this company, given the corporate governance issues, given the massive losses. And I think there is a bigger picture. There's kind of a rethink on Wall Street about the need to really be cautious around some of these companies with high valuations. You sort of wonder if WeWork, wished it went public, maybe you know, nine months ago or so.</p><p>SOARES: Very good point, Matt Egan there for us. Thanks very much. Matt will keep an eye on WeWork, we know there will be several shifts in the next few weeks. Thanks, Matt.</p><p>Now, I want to take you to -- keep you in the U.S. because a potential merger between two the Americans biggest cigarette companies could go up in smoke as the Trump administration cracks down on e-cigarettes. Paul La Monica has more from New York.</p><p>And Paul, we heard both from the Trump administration and the FDA both really pushing to ban flavored e-cigarettes because of health concerns as well as teen addiction. Does this crackdown, Paul, make a merger harder to swallow, do you think?</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: I think it's going to be tougher, Isa because when you consider that Altria has made this big bet on the private unicorn, Juul Labs, which is one of the leaders in the vaping market, that was obviously a move that they did to try and minimize the loss that they're seeing in traditional tobacco cigarette use in the U.S, so the hope was that they can latch on to the vaping trend.</p><p>Then Philip Morris, which wants to merge with Altria, potentially, to reunify these companies that broke up, you know, more than a decade ago, Philip Morris has its own vaping technology called IQOS. So that is also, I guess, going to come into question whether or not that is as valuable as that company it may be hoped if the FDA is looking to put more, you know, limits on the sale of you know, vaping and e-cigarette products.</p><p>SOARES: One investor was suggesting perhaps that even if Philip Morris isn't planning to pay top dollar, let's say for Altria, a deal may not be viable because as you put it, it's an asset with a murky fundamental outlook.</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, exactly. That really, I think is the big question right now, Isa, and I think you had prior to this regulatory crackdown, the possibility of Altria and Philip Morris getting back together. It was not going to be about what the old company was, not traditional tobacco cigarettes. The hope was that vaping would lead to growth and then potentially also even cannabis, because keep in mind Altria has a huge stake in Cronos, one of the leading Canadian cannabis companies.</p><p>So now if vaping is no longer potentially going to be the growth industry that people had hoped, it does beg the question, why did these two companies need to get back together and even if they do, the price would probably be a lot lower than what Altria might have been hoping for just a few weeks ago.</p><p>SOARES: Paul La Monica there for us, breaking it all down. Thanks, Paul. We'll speak to you a bit later. Now, let me bring you up to date with the stories making headlines around the world this hour. Another chance to shine for 2020 hopefuls. For the first time, the top 10 Democratic candidates hoping to challenge Donald Trump squared off in Texas. Everything from gun control to health care was on the agenda. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: My plan for healthcare costs a lot of money, it costs $740 billion. It doesn't cost $30 trillion. SEN.

In the aftermath of the hurricane, 1,300 people are unaccounted for. The death toll stands at 50, but that is expected to rise as search efforts continue.</p><p>Still to come right here on FIRST MOVE. The Brexit bank robbery. The U.K. House of Commons Speaker has a stern warning for Boris Johnson.</p><p>And the one with the anniversary. Hit sitcom \"Friends\" is still there for you, believe it or not, 25 years on. We'll bring you the latest, next.</p><p>SOARES: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE. Let's check in on Sterling. The British Pound is doing its trading, we're bringing the graphic up for you. There is 1.24 against the dollar that is the strongest it has been since July and comes as investors judge the prospect of a no-deal Brexit. They are seeing that as receding.</p><p>So is a Brexit breakthrough on the cards? Why is Sterling so optimistic? Well, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson we have found in the last few hours will go to Luxembourg on Monday to meet Jean-Claude Juncker, the outgoing E.U. Commission President.</p><p>This was Mr. Johnson meeting voters in Yorkshire in the North England earlier today. Meanwhile, House of Commons Speaker, John Bercow has warned the Prime Minister that in his quest to deliver Brexit, there is no justification it seems for breaking the law. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN BERCOW, SPEAKER OF THE BRITISH HOUSE OF COMMONS: One should no more refuse to request an extension of Article 50, because of what one might regard as the noble end of departing from the E.U. as soon as possible, than one could possibly excuse robbing a bank on the basis that the cash stolen would be donated to a charitable cause immediately afterwards.\"</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[09:20:15]</p><p>SOARES: We'll talk about Bercow. Melissa Bell is joining me now in just a second. Let's talk about this meeting on Monday. Is this a sign? I mean, Sterling is looking at this as something positive that perhaps there might be a deal, there might be a proposal that the E.U. hasn't seen?</p><p>MELISSA BELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, because this samples the need to find some kind of resolution, some kind of way out. And there is now this talk, this whisper really, for the time being, Isa that one of things that Boris Johnson may be willing to look at is the very thing that Theresa May had been opposed to that had been an E.U. suggestion over the course of those long and laborious negotiations, which was essentially a Northern Ireland only backstop.</p><p>Her objection had been that this would drive a customs line through the Irish Sea, essentially creating or threatening rather the constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom. There is a suggestion so far confirmed that one of the things that may be being explored in the talks that are going on now, between the British government and the E.U. is this possibility that perhaps, in fact, Boris Johnson might consider this as a palatable -- more palatable -- alternative than the backstop that is on the table.</p><p>We will have to wait until this meeting on Monday to find out whether that is something that he is willing to explore and willing to put on the table, but that is for the time being the only solution, the only way out of the impasse in which we find ourselves. So perhaps a little hope is better than no hope at all.</p><p>SOARES: No, completely. But they haven't received any proposals, I'm guessing as of right now.</p><p>BELL: No. And we've heard from Michel Barnier, the Chief E.U. Brexit Negotiator being very clearly, as he spoke to MEPs saying, \"Look, the ball is again in London's court. We wait to hear what concrete proposals they have to make that might be acceptable to the 27.\" So this is far from done. It is far from even the beginning of a negotiation, as far as we know, in terms of where they're actually talking about.</p><p>But for the time being, because of all that's happened over the last couple of weeks, Boris Johnson's only hope for the time being, is this idea that maybe something might be able to be reached that would prevent this blockage from taking hold.</p><p>He spoke a moment ago in Rotherham saying again, that he was cautiously optimistic that a deal might be reached, but that he doubled down -- but doubling down again on the idea that if it was not, we would be leaving on the 31st of October and this is of course, at the heart of this battle that's going on now between Downing Street and all of the institutions that underpin British parliamentary democracy -- its legislature, its judiciary.</p><p>So a battle that has not seen its end yet and that continues very much and we were reminded of it a moment ago, when a heckler put to him in the middle of his speech, he had to be quoted as saying, \"Look, why don't you get to Parliament and sort out this mess that you've created, Mr. Johnson.\"</p><p>SOARES: Melissa Bell. Thank you very much. We'll have much more after a very short break.</p><p>[09:25:55]</p><p>SOARES: As prominent proponents of a no-deal Brexit has Tim Martin, the founder of one of Britain's largest pub chains, JD Wetherspoon. I spoke with him just before the show. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SOARES: Do you still believe or think that we can get a deal at this stage?</p><p>TIM MARTIN, FOUNDER AND CHAIRMAN, JD WEATHERSPOON: Well, I hope we don't get a deal because I think a deal will be bad for the country. A deal ties your hands. If we leave without a deal, we can eliminate tariffs on thousands of non-E.U. imports, and we can avoid payment of 39 billion pounds, regain control of fishing.</p><p>But the most important economic thing we can get is greater democracy and democracy is economic steroids. Look at South Korea versus North Korea. Look at how well Japan did when it became democratic.</p><p>SOARES: Tim, today we heard from John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons who basically said that Boris Johnson would be acting -- and I'm quoting him here -- \"like a bank robber\" if he refuses to delay Brexit. What are your thoughts on those comments? And what we've had from Bercow in the last couple of weeks?</p><p>MARTIN: I think Bercow and his cohorts are the bank robber. The government sent a leaflet to every house in the country in 2016 saying. \"This is a referendum. It's once in a generation, you decide. The government will implement your decision.\" Most MPs were elected, 85 percent of them on a manifesto which honored the referendum. And it is Parliament and Mr. Bercow who haven't honored the referendum.</p><p>SOARES: But had said that elite remainers are ignoring the big picture. What do you mean by that?</p><p>MARTIN: Elite remainers are ignoring the big picture, because what they're doing is they're ignoring the fact that tariffs on 93 percent of the world will be reduced and that we save 39 billion pounds, and that we increase the level of democracy.</p><p>They find it very difficult to input into their computers the effect of increasing democracy. They find it quite easy to say the ports will be blocked for three days.</p><p>SOARES: As a businessman, I want to get your take on what you've seen from the Yellowhammer report, a report really outlining some of the short impacts, the impact the country may face, everything from health care to medication delays at ports. How does that, if it does impact your business at all?</p><p>MARTIN: Yellowhammer, as I understand it is an exercise in trying to think of what might go wrong, which is a legitimate thing for a business or a government to do. All the things which are supposed to have gone wrong haven't gone wrong.</p><p>People said the planes won't fly. Now, Ryanair has said that will no longer be an issue. We've heard that by now tens of thousands of jobs would have left the city of London. That hasn't happened. I think Yellowhammer is an exercise in caution, and that's okay. It is not economic reality. We will do better if we leave without a deal.</p><p>SOARES: If there is chaos, would you be able to live with the fact that you're saying actually, this is the worst case scenario that it is not going to be as bad, can you live with that?</p><p>MARTIN: We're trying to regain democracy in the U.K., which is the biggest beneficiary for freedom and prosperity. One and a half days chaos at the ports. There's no reason there should be.</p><p>SOARES: For example, your burgers, tomato, salad, lettuce -- a lot of that comes from the E.U. What's your backup plan? Do you have a strategy? Do you have a plan in place if those produce can't come in?</p><p>MARTIN: I think what will happen is the E.U. suppliers will say, \"We can't afford this.\" We've just -- Kopparberg, one of our suppliers of excellent Swedish cider have switched their production to the U.K. and we sold a million pints of Kopparberg back in July. That's trade.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>[09:30:10]</p><p>SOARES: And that was the opening the bell on Friday, the 13th. The Dow and the S&amp;P, if you remember yesterday closing off just short of record highs. U.S. stocks opening -- expected to open at a high today. There you go. Dow Jones, quarter of a percent; S&amp;P, a tenth of one percent. Investors feeling rather positive in fact for Friday, the 13th as trade tensions appear to be easing between the U.S. and China. And of course after you saw a stimulus from the ECB on Thursday.</p><p>So starting this Friday or ending the week, depending how you want to see it in the positive, in the green as you can see there.</p><p>In terms of global movers we are keeping our eyes on, Southwest Airlines, they're trading higher. Stock got upgraded to outperform. Macquarie says the airline will be able to run efficiently after the Boeing 737 grounding ends.</p><p>Another stock we're looking at, you can see there is Apple. Stocks down at one and a half percent, almost one and a half percent lower. That's after Goldman Sachs reduced the tech giant's price tag. And now it's predicting and a 26 percent downside risk. Now, this is because of the accounting method Apple will use for its new streaming service that we brought to you here on CNN all this week.</p><p>SmileDirect also stocks are up as you can see there. The Club, it is up four percent, doing pretty well actually, still trading well below the IPO price of $23.00. Now the company, which makes teeth-straightening kits listed on the NASDAQ on Thursday, and still enjoying that celebration. They are up four percent or so.</p><p>Hugh Gimber, Global Market Strategist of JPMorgan Asset Management joins me now. Hugh, thanks for being here with me. Plenty for us to get our teeth into. Let's start first with what we saw in the markets. We're seeing a pretty stellar week, I have to say, with stock markets, so different from what we have been seeing in the last few weeks. How much of this is traders getting very excited about what the Fed has next week? Or trade -- the lack of trade war -- the trade war easing between China and the United States?</p><p>HUGH GIMBER, GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST, JPMORGAN ASSET MANAGEMENT: Sure, I think the equity market really is causing a bit of a tug-of-war at the moment with trade uncertainty and slowing global growth on one side, and then Central Bank stimulus on the other. And it is really about which of those two sides is pulling hardest in one direction.</p><p>SOARES: Which one is it?</p><p>GIMBER: And so this week, I think the trade news has been positive for the market. Investors are reading into the developments between the U.S. and China very positively, and really hopes of building for a deal or a mini- deal potentially of some sort later this year.</p><p>SOARES: But we've been her so many times.</p><p>GIMBER: Exactly. I think you're right, therefore, so it's a question whether this optimism in the market is appropriate. There have been ebbs and flows in the U.S.-China trade negotiations throughout the past year or so. And I think we're really in in another one at the moment. And so we're not reading too much into the optimism in the market currently.</p><p>SOARES: So maybe this might be short lived. We will keep an eye on that. Let's talk Fed. What are your expectations for next week? Alison Kosik at the New York Stock Exchange is basically telling us, expecting of a cut. But that might not be enough for President Trump here.</p><p>GIMBER: Yes, I think a cut is broadly expected, and I would agree with that personally at 25 basis point cut it looks likely next week.</p><p>SOARES: Yes.</p><p>GIMBER: For me, it will be about the direction of travel for the Fed thereafter. And so I think markets will be looking for any signs as to whether this is going to be a couple of cuts from the Fed. And then they're going to try and pause and let the economy run or whether this is really the start of a more significant cutting cycle.</p><p>SOARES: And as our viewers will know, language is key. What we hear from the Fed, not so much what they announce. But you know what -- reading between the lines, what do you want to hear? What will it tell you that this is -- we're in the right track here, Hugh?</p><p>GIMBER: Sure. So the assessment of the Fed's outlook for growth both domestically and globally will be very important. And I think if you were to see a softening in their tone concerns, building perhaps around the global outlook then that may cause markets to start to price in greater Fed easing ahead.</p><p>SOARES: Will the Fed be looking at the ECB and its move here this week trying -- will they be looking at each other? How does it -- do they work in tandem in terms of the global economy?</p><p>GIMBER: I wouldn't say that they're looking at each other, as much as I'd say they're looking at similar conditions globally. So they're facing similar challenges in terms of inflation not being quite as high as they may like, in terms of slowing growth, and so it's fair to say that their reaction is similar, but I don't think it's one leading the other.</p><p>[09:35:03]</p><p>SOARES: We heard from President Trump. You know, President Trump has been very critical of the Fed's policy. He tweeted this week about the ECB, the European Central Bank saying -- basically saying, they acted quickly, and basically saying why the Fed didn't act.</p><p>President Trump also has been tweeting and calling for rates of zero lower in a tweet. I mean, I've never even thought that we would get to this, this sort of comments, would you imagine of getting right through a zero? Is that even possible at this point?</p><p>GIMBER: It all depends on your time horizon, I think. So the path of rates in my view is lower from here. But as to whether we do start to approach zero, I think that says to how the macro picture plays out.</p><p>So if as I say, this is more of a significant cutting cycle, I think it's because growth weakens through this year and further into 2020. And then I do you see the path of Fed rates moving significantly lower. As to whether we approach zero, I think that's quite a negative macro scenario for that to come about.</p><p>SOARES: What are your concerns as you look to Europe? We've seen ECB move, quantitative easing, that's something that markets seem to have liked. Where are your concerns when you look at the European economy?</p><p>GIMBER: I think if you look at the market reaction yesterday, it was quite confused. Investors weren't quite sure whether to read this as good news, because there's more stimulus coming.</p><p>SOARES: Or more news, as a warning.</p><p>GIMBER: Exactly. So I think that explains some of the volatility that we saw in asset prices immediately after the event yesterday. From my perspective for Europe, the open nature of the European economy does make it particularly vulnerable to the trade disputes, and so even more so than the U.S. or China, for example, it's that openness and that high exposure to trade volumes that makes Europe vulnerable in this scenario.</p><p>SOARES: And I am being told to wrap, and I need to ask you this. Sterling, I don't know if you can bring it, Rob, Sterling doing particularly well today, hopes of a deal. There it goes. Up 1.24 against the dollar. What are you your thoughts, Hugh?</p><p>GIMBER: So Sterling, there are two very binary outcomes here. So you have no deal, I think Sterling would have significant room to move lower if we were to approach a no deal either at the end of October, or potentially early next year. At the same time, we're starting to hear noises about a deal not being completely written off over the next six weeks or so.</p><p>And so when faced with these two very binary scenarios, for us, it's about not taking heroic calls on either side really, and that applies for Sterling and for U.K. assets more broadly.</p><p>SOARES: Hugh, thank you very much. Lovely to meet you. Thanks for coming in.</p><p>GIMBER: Thank you.</p><p>SOARES: Now, time for one more \"Crypto Crazy\" as we wrap up all our week of all things Bitcoin and co. We show you how a veteran investor decided to ditch traditional assets and go for crypto. We'll explain, next.</p><p>[09:40:50]</p><p>TEXT: Crypto Crazy.</p><p>SOARES: Now in the last part of our Crypto Crazy week, we look at what your cryptocurrencies have for mainstream investors. Travis Kling is the Founder and Chief Investment Officer of IKIGAI Assessment Management. He spent 10 years in traditional finance leading institutions. Last year, he left that world to focus solely on investing in crypto. Julia spoke with Kling and asked him what got him into it in the first place.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TRAVIS KLING, FOUNDER AND CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, IKIGAI ASSESSMENT MANAGEMENT: I'm not really a tech investor by background, and I'm not really a tech kind of guy. I don't own an Apple Watch. I think Alexa is Big Brother. I've always kind of been like that. So you know, I saw Bitcoin pretty early, not nearly as early as some people, but around when the time Silk Road got shut down in late 2013. And then in early '14, Mt. Gox got hacked, and that was sort of confirmation to me that this wasn't really an investable asset class. So I stopped paying attention to it in early 2014.</p><p>And then fast forward to the back part of '16, the price started going back up again and it popped back up on my radar, and I started doing more research and then Ethereum and all of the ICOs in early '17, those started going crazy, so I started doing more research around those.</p><p>As I was doing that that period of self-study, I just kept coming across revolutionary concept after revolutionary concept. And collectively, over about probably 500 hours of self-study in the summer 2017 convinced myself that this technology was going to be the most important innovation since the internet the first time around. And as such, was likely to be the most significant investment opportunity of a generation.</p><p>JULIA CHATTERLEY, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR, FIRST MOVE: Why? Because I feel like up until that point, what was going on, whether it's in cryptocurrencies or in the underlying technology here was something very separate from what was going on in the rest of the world. And I do feel like, right now it feels like we're in an intersection where we talk about cryptocurrencies, in particular, in relation to what's going on as far as monetary stimulus, a lack of fiscal stimulus, perhaps from governments, it's like the intersection the two things that tied, particularly now.</p><p>KLING: Yes, so now is an incredibly interesting time from a global macro perspective, and it also is, you know, to borrow phrase from the Old Testament, it appears that crypto has been created for such a time as this, with what we have with monetary and fiscal policies from Central Banks and governments, big tech overreach, government overreach in general, data privacy issues that are coming to the front and center of the sort of collective consciousness and specifically with Bitcoin and maybe we can put sort of Bitcoin in one bucket and put, you know, all the other crypto assets in a different bucket.</p><p>Bitcoin has gone through a number of different sort of identities or phases over its ten and a half year history, and I think part of the confusion that the sort of average person has with understanding Bitcoin and other crypto assets is because of these evolutions of identity.</p><p>So just to be clear, Bitcoin is a non-sovereign, hard cap supply, global, immutable, decentralized digital store of value. And that's a lot of different adjectives, but all of them are very important. And what that leads us to is, it is a hedge against monetary and fiscal irresponsibility from Central Banks and governments globally.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You're basically saying actually, that at a time when it looks like some of the biggest economies and the Central Banks in those economies are enacting a race to the bottom, as far as their currencies are concerned, pushed by stimulus to support the economies, actually, cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin offer a better, an alternative source of protecting your wealth. Is that what you're saying? Because you use the term hedge there, which is an interesting way to describe them.</p><p>[09:45:04]</p><p>KLING: Yes, so the way that I think about it is, it's apparent that major Central Banks are all racing to devalue their currency faster than everybody else. And if all of these Central Banks are doing that at the same time, what are they devaluing against? They are devaluing against things that have provable scarcity and gold has provable scarcity. Bitcoin has even more provable scarcity than gold.</p><p>In Austrian economics terms, it is the hardest money in human history, and I understand that it's not sort of bite size for you know, the average person to understand this. You have to understand, you know, some amount of cryptography and computer science and game theory and sociology and governance and mechanism -- there's a lot of things that you have to understand.</p><p>But simplistically, it is an insurance policy against monetary and fiscal policy irresponsibility. And it's apparent that the world needs that more today than they did yesterday, and they are going to need it more tomorrow than we need it today based on what Central Banks and governments are doing.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: We spend some of the time talking about Bitcoin, what do you think of some of the others because from what I've seen, particularly on social media, there is a great deal of -- let's call it enthusiasm about XRP, there's a great deal of enthusiasm from certain quarters about things like Ethereum, what do you think of each of these? And what do you actually trade here?</p><p>KLING: Yes, so at IKIGAI, we consider the top 150 cryptos by market cap, it is our investible universe. We have that universe divided into sectors and subsectors that kind of look like the S&amp;P 500, so there's many use cases for distributed ledger technology.</p><p>Money is the killer app for distributed ledger technology right now. Specifically, store of value and people -- I think, some people try and put a knock on Bitcoin that it's too slow to be very good for payments right now, to be used as a method of exchange right now. And my argument there is, Bitcoin is too good at being a store of value right now, to be a good method of exchange right now.</p><p>Because nobody wants to be the Bitcoin pizza guy that spent 10,000 Bitcoin on a pizza, and as the price increases over a number of years, and the volatility decreases, which is certainly our expectation, it's going to be better for a method of exchange. But in the meantime, it's a great store of value.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So your messages to people that are perhaps looking at this, maybe they've dipped their toes into Bitcoin, maybe they're thinking about it. It's a good time to invest right now, and don't spend your Bitcoin if you've got it on a pizza.</p><p>KLING: Yes, I mean, look, that's exactly right. I mean, they're making it increasingly easier to spend Bitcoin. And that's great. But then you look at like, all of the centralized method of exchange crypto projects, and Libra is a great example of that. Right?</p><p>And specifically in the United States, like two years ago, like in the summer of 2017, we thought that Bitcoin's sort of use case for the world was so that Americans could buy cups of coffee, which is like really silly, right? Because we have a really great method of exchange system right now.</p><p>I mean, look at Venmo, right? Like Venmo works awesome. And in in China, you have WeChat and Alipay. And those are sort of proliferated methods of exchange. Their levers trying to run it that same use case, but all of those are backed by fiat currencies that Central Banks are racing to devalue as quickly as possible.</p><p>So however easy it is to use WeChat and Alipay and Line in Japan and Kakao in South Korea, and Libra and all these things. The underlying currency that you're still using to spend there is still these fiat currencies, which over time are going to prove to be an inferior store of value relative to Bitcoin.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SOARES: Travis Kling, the Founder and Chief Investment Officer of IKIGAI Assessment Management speaking to our Julia Chatterley.</p><p>Now if getting your head around cryptocurrency makes you feel old, then you might not want to hear that the TV series \"Friends\" began a quarter of a century ago. But don't worry, we'll be there for you. Next.</p><p>[09:51:47]</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOEY TRIBBIANI, FICTIONAL CHARACTER, \"FRIENDS\": Look, turning 30 is not that big of a deal.</p><p>ROSS GELLER, FICTIONAL CHARACTER, \"FRIENDS\": Oh, really? Is that how you felt when you turned 30?</p><p>TRIBBIANI: Why, God, why? We had a deal. Let the others grow old. Not me.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SOARES: I kind of feel what he felt when I turned 30. It was Joey's party and he could cry if he really wanted to, but in real life, the cast of the sitcom \"Friends\" are celebrating their anniversary. They don't really need to feel so glum about 25 years of their iconic show, one that almost feels as popular as ever. Clare Sebastian is in New York for us.</p><p>And Clare, I think it's still very popular even when those people, the much younger generation I may add, how are businesses making a mint out of this anniversary though?</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Yes, the extraordinary thing about this is that friends of course came of age in a world before the iPhone, before Instagram, before Netflix, where it still, you know, lives on and certainly as someone who grew up with the show feeling pretty old today, but the thing about this show is that it continues to be relatable and aspirational at the same time. Viewers want to watch it, but they also kind of want to live in it. And this is where brands and companies are coming in and trying to get a piece of the action. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice over): From product placement --</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This wonder broom is amazing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice over): To memorabilia and even haircuts, \"Friends\" has always been a brand that sells.</p><p>SEBASTIAN (on camera): And 25 years on that hasn't changed. It's still not enough of you as just to watch the show. They want to live in the world of Monica, Chandler Ross, Rachel, Phoebe and Joey and that means eating their food, sitting on their couch and of course, drinking their coffee.</p><p>And businesses are taking advantage. Coffee chain, Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf jumped at the chance of a tie up for the anniversary launching a special edition range of coffee specialty drinks and memorabilia.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DARRIN KELLARIS, VP MARKETING, COFFEE BEANS AND TEA LEAF: Our \"Friends\" themed coffee mugs we pre-released and actually sold out in about three hours.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice over): They also hosted two pop up Central Perk events in Los Angeles in August.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KELLARIS: Those two locations we saw significant spikes in foot traffic, but more importantly as a business it really bolstered system wide sales.</p><p>RACHEL GREEN, FICTIONAL CHARACTER, FRIENDS: Isn't it cool? It's an apothecary table.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice over): \"Pottery Barn\" also brought back the famous apothecary table which despite its thousand dollar price tag is a top seller in its department, the company says, it must be the antique properties.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PHOEBE BUFFAY, FICTIONAL CHARACTER, FRIENDS: You can almost smell the opium.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice over): Even Lego is getting in on the action with a $60.00 replica of Central Perk. Lego says it's one of its fastest selling sets ever.</p><p>SEBASTIAN (on camera): Now, of course, none of these promotions would work nearly as well if \"Friends\" hadn't experienced a revival in the age of streaming. Last year, it was Netflix's second most watched show and the company reportedly paid around $100 million to keep the rights to the show for one more year before it goes on a break, moving to Warner Media's HBO Max streaming service in 2022.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAN IVES, EQUITY ANALYST, WEDBUSH SECURITIES: It's an iconic show and ultimately it's really one of the crown jewels of streaming. Everything change now with HBO coming in a major shot across the bow of Netflix taking \"Friends\" and I ultimately believe two to three percent of Netflix viewers watch it just because of \"Friends.\"</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice over): So for those who say \"Friends\" and money, don't mix.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BUFFAY: What's more important? Your friends or money?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[09:55:06]</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice over): This 25-year-old sitcom still gets the last laugh.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEBASTIAN: And Isa, those last few shots you see in the piece, they are from a New York City pop-up experience for \"Friends.\" Tickets are actually sold out, you have to put your e-mail on a list. There has been an extraordinary response from \"Friends.\"</p><p>Lego is also sold out of that set. Pottery Barn launched another couple of products things like mugs and tea towels. They are not shipping until December, so people are clearly going crazy for all of these products and I think that's why you see the brands keep flogging.</p><p>SOARES: Absolutely. And Clare, at this point what we really want everyone wants to know is whether they're going to get back together again.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: I think it's unlikely. I think it was Chandler, the actor, Matthew Perry who once told \"Variety\" that he would worry that if they did that, people wouldn't watch. So I think there's an element that they don't want to mess with what the magic was the first time around -- Isa.</p><p>SOARES: Yes, if it's working, just leave it that way, isn't it? Clare Sebastian, thanks very much. Good to see you.</p><p>And that doesn't for me. Thanks very much for watching. I am Isa Soares. The \"International Desk\" with Robyn Curnow starts after a very short break. Do stay right here with CNN.</p><p>[10:00:00]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2019091301cbk41</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X22-HHS1-JB20-G2Y1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7675\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 13, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC00091PQ</classCode><className>EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00091PQ</classCode><className>EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Stock Market, Economy, Government, Politics, Hong Kong, WeWork, Europe, Brexit, Cryptocurrency, Friends, Entertainment</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

Tieless in a dark blue suit, occasionally ruffling his trademark boyish hair, the former leader of the Liberal Democrats and author of How to Stop Brexit seems remarkably willing to talk about his midlife crisis. \"Here's my 13-year-old,\" he says holding up his phone, leaning across the table in the cafe in Marylebone, central London, where we are having coffee. I see a wetsuited teenager standing confidently on a board. \"This is my little eight-year-old,\" he says proudly, flipping through the pics. \"And this,\" he chuckles, \"is me.\" I see a middle-aged gent, unrecognisable in a black wetsuit, floundering in the surf. \"I spent about two hours swallowing seawater ...\" he tails off into laughter. \"Then I gave up.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The summer breakers must have come as light relief after what has been a stormy two years for Clegg. In 2015, having served five years as deputy prime minister, he stepped down as Lib Dem leader when voters turned away from his party and gave <person><nameText>David Cameron </nameText></person>a majority. Then, six months ago, in one of the biggest upsets of the snap election called by <person><nameText>Theresa May, </nameText></person>Clegg lost his parliamentary seat in Sheffield Hallam to Labour.</p><p>I remember the moment he lost. It was about three in the morning and I was appearing on ITV as part of its election coverage. Despite all the surprises of that long night, people in the studio were momentarily stunned at the defeat of this giant political figure by an unknown. Yet Clegg looked as if he had already moved on. I had bumped into him in another TV studio, just after May called the election, and he'd told me - rightly, as it turned out - that the public would resent being asked to vote again, for the third time in three years.</p><p>At the podium, he gave a short speech about the need to heal a deeply divided nation and stepped away as if such a brutal end to his parliamentary career was not the worst thing that could happen. And it turned out that it wasn't. For what no one knew at the time was that his 15-year-old son, Antonio, had lymphoma (blood cancer).</p><p>\"He had this tiny bump, here,\" Clegg says, slipping his fingers under his shirt and touching the top-left side of his chest. It was September 2016. The family had just come back from a holiday in northern Spain. Nick, his Spanish wife, Miriam Gonzalez, and their three sons had climbed mountains and gone kayaking.</p><p>\"He's an incredibly active, physically strong boy,\" says Clegg. \"To this day, I don't know what possessed me to take him to the GP. It was those early days in September, you know, when you have to get kids ready for school. Miriam had to work very heavily that week, so I was at home most of the time, helping to do the preparatory things, buying clothes for the new term - and Antonio said he had this thing. We had an afternoon, so I thought, 'Why don't I just take him, and he'll stop going on about it.' \"</p><p>This was quite out of character, he says. \"Normally, I'm quite brutal. My Dutch mum regarded going to doctors and hospitals as something one should avoid at all costs. She fed us 'ziek eten', which literally means 'sick food' - which as far as I could work out was mashed-up bananas with orange juice - and was administered for every ailment.\"</p><p>It was also out of character for Antonio to complain. So off they went. \"The GP was brilliant, as lymphoma is quite a difficult thing to diagnose. You could barely see it with the naked eye. But he took pretty much one look at him and said, 'That's not right.' \"</p><p>On the x-ray, Clegg says the lymphoma \"looked like a huge bunch of black grapes, all across here\" - he gestures across his chest. From that moment on, it felt like \"sailing through a storm. You only really appreciate how perilous the journey was afterwards. Antonio was extraordinarily brave and resilient. I'm not sure he fully appreciated the enormity of it at the time.\"</p><p>Nick and Miriam coped \"by getting into the daily routine of illness: the charts, the 20-odd pills you have to take every day, when you have to take them, when we have to take his temperature. As a parent, you're so helpless, so getting that right becomes the only thing you can hold onto.\"</p><p>Antonio is now back at school and thriving. Relief at his recovery has left Clegg looking surprisingly at ease with himself, despite having recently published a furiously eloquent book about Brexit.</p><p>\"I'm just going through a classic, paunchy 50-year-old phase of my life,\" he says. \"I've tried to learn to surf, I've failed, but I am learning to play the drums. I wouldn't claim to have much musical talent, but I do love it.\" He has bought a drum kit and is having weekly lessons. I mention a friend who has started a band at a similar age. \"Does he need a drummer?\" Clegg asks, not entirely joking. \"I'd need a few more lessons ...\" </p><p>All this honesty, from a man I have previously bumped into only in TV studios or in parliament, is endearing. When I arrived at No 10 to head up Cameron's Policy Unit in 2015, Clegg had just left and many Conservatives felt a sense of liberation from a coalition partner they regarded as a brake on their ambitions, with a tendency to seek bureaucratic solutions. For this reason, I have always had the feeling that Clegg has regarded me warily. But now he seems to view me with the warmth of a fellow casualty of politics. So I decide to push my luck.</p><p>I hear you almost got a tattoo, I say mischievously. Suddenly he looks stricken. \"No, no!\" he cries, muttering what sounds like \"Miriam\" and \"verboten\", looking wildly around the cafe as if for rescue. A man at another table glances up, and Clegg subsides. \"Well, I did once say to Miriam, maybe I should get a tattoo.\"</p><p>Only once? \"Well, maybe more than once,\" he grins sheepishly, but with a slightly rebellious pout, as if regretting having been stopped by the formidable Gonzalez. So, if you had got a tattoo, what would you have gone for? He shakes his head. \"I'm just not going to have this tattoo conversation.\"</p><p>We turn, instead, to another intensely personal subject: Brexit. Clegg campaigned passionately against Vote Leave. His new book, How to Stop Brexit (And Make Britain Great Again), is a call to arms for fellow liberals.</p><p>\"My anger is not that I wish I could turn the clock back to June 22 - you can't,\" he says. \"My anger is they took this narrowly divided, hopelessly argued debate on the referendum and sought to interpret it in the most partisan and economically destructive way.\"</p><p>Is there really a difference between hard Brexit and Brexit? Isn't it inevitable that if you want to curb freedom of movement you have to leave the single market? When I worked for Cameron, his efforts to get an emergency brake on immigration were firmly repudiated by the EU.</p><p>\"No,\" he says emphatically, tapping the table. \"I suspect you and I might disagree, given your experience in Downing Street, but I've had several conversations in the past few months, with one prime minister and one deputy head of government in the EU, who were making efforts to go much further than the package of measures David negotiated. If the cost of keeping the UK in the tent was a new EU-wide approach to freedom of movement, they would bite that bullet.\"</p><p>So why haven't they, I ask. EU leaders may be rattled by Brexit, in a way they weren't when they thought Cameron would win, but seemingly not enough to make that kind of offer. If they are ready to negotiate a deal, why aren't they saying so in public?</p><p>Clegg makes a surprising claim - that the British government has never raised the issue. \"<person><nameText>Theresa May, </nameText></person>unforgivably in my view, made no attempt whatsoever in the wake of the referendum to reach out privately to European power brokers and see whether there was some way she could finesse this.\"</p><p>If true, this would be astonishing. But Clegg thinks May has been persuaded that free movement is a far more rigid principle than it actually is. \"The arch-federalists in Europe, and the arch-Brexiteers in this country, have interpreted freedom of movement as some Old Testament orthodoxy. But it ain't. The Belgians are deporting folk from other EU countries with gay abandon.\"</p><p>Oh yes, I say. You mean the old problem that member states deviate from their own rules, while Britons stick slavishly to them. He grimaces.</p><p>As a former European Commission trade official and MEP, Clegg remains well connected in Brussels. He was there the previous week. \"What they say to me is the EU is infinitely ingenious. If there's a consensus on where you need to go, we'll find a way. But why should we do that when we're not receiving any overtures from the British government?\"</p><p>\"Infinitely ingenious\" is not a phrase I would have used to describe the EU's shambling response to the financial crisis or the Greek crisis. I worry that Clegg may be too starry-eyed about how flexible Brussels will be. I thought they didn't want to receive any overtures, I say. The commission has restricted what can be discussed, and the member states are hiding behind its position. He firmly disagrees.</p><p>\"If <person><nameText>Theresa May </nameText></person>went to [the French president, Emmanuel] Macron privately and said I've looked at this every which way and this trajectory we're on is wrong for all of us, I want to settle on a new bargain - call it Norway, for the sake of argument - but for that indignity, I need your help on freedom of movement, she'd get it in an instant.\"</p><p>Such a deal, of course, would require the UK to abide by EU laws: a red line for many Brexiteers. But as the true costs of Brexit become clear, it is perfectly possible that an offer to control immigration, but remain in the single market, might satisfy many Leave voters. Clegg quotes David Davis, the Brexit secretary: \"If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.\"</p><p>He leans back and picks up his coffee cup. \"You must stop me ranting,\" he says. \"I do tend to rant.\" But Clegg's tone is more thoughtful than angry. Fundamentally, he thinks we underestimate just how much of a shock Brexit has been to the EU. He believes not only that there might be a deal to be done on immigration, but that Brexit will prompt the EU to reform into a two-speed Europe with an inner and outer core, which Britain could eventually rejoin. I wonder about this. Germany has been deeply reluctant, I say, to underwrite a federal union with poorer countries in southern Europe.</p><p>\"You've just identified the biggest issue in the EU - which way is Germany going to jump,\" says Clegg. He believes the Germans will back Macron, who is seeking closer union. He says southern economies such as Spain are in a more robust position after structural reforms and that if the Germans \"let Macron spin in the wind, he's finished\". They will probably support Macron, he thinks, because otherwise it's \"only a matter of time before the populist tide wins, in the form of Le Pen\".</p><p>Will the volatility of German politics make things worse for Britain? We are meeting just after the spectacular collapse of the coalition that has been keeping Angela Merkel in power.</p><p>\"The Brexiteers are making ludicrous claims about the situation in German politics,\" says Clegg, referring to the assumption among many Leavers that Germany would go out of its way to help Britain negotiate a favourable exit. \"They are oblivious to the reality that the only major democracy in Europe that looks truly dysfunctional right now is ours.\"</p><p>There will be either a new coalition or fresh elections in Germany in the coming weeks or months. Clegg thinks this may slow things down a bit, but not much. And it won't tilt the pitch in Britain's favour. \"There is a fairly stable consensus among all German parties that the UK cannot have its cake and eat it - and all the delay in the Brexit talks has been caused by divisions around the Downing Street cabinet table, not in Berlin.\"</p><p>Clegg's insistence on the righteousness of EU institutions is slightly maddening for those of us who feel that, had they offered Cameron what he asked for, the UK would not be in this situation at all. However, Clegg is not just sitting around wringing his hands. He is proposing action that ordinary citizens can take, if they feel strongly: join the Labour Party. If enough Remainers joined Labour, he says, they could outnumber the rest of the membership and push the party towards a firmer pro-Europe stance.</p><p>Really? This is a surprising suggestion, not just because Clegg is putting Brexit above his own party allegiance. He believes, understandably, that only the two main parties have the power to change anything - and that people who can't stomach Labour should join the Conservatives and try to change that party from within. But it's also curious because Jeremy Corbyn is a Eurosceptic who presides over a deeply divided party, and who has sat firmly on the fence over Brexit.</p><p>I very much doubt, I say, that Corbyn is going to become a Europhile. \"I'm making a judgment,\" says Clegg, \"that when push comes to shove, Corbyn and his hardline henchmen will realise that their core support base is actually quite a middle-class, pro-European one. Jeremy Corbyn and [the shadow chancellor] John McDonnell won't want to vote with Tories who they've been rubbishing. And you can't end austerity if you insist on Brexit.\"</p><p>All of that is perfectly plausible, though it glosses over the reality that Labour's northern heartlands voted Leave. And Corbyn is no friend of moderates. The Momentum movement's attempts to stir up class war and deselect moderate Labourites are surely oceans away from Clegg's liberal worldview. Does Clegg really want Corbyn as prime minister? He is elusive.</p><p>\"I'm rather sceptical the British people are going to hand anybody a majority.\"</p><p>But does he want Corbyn? \"I think what this Conservative government is doing with Brexit will inflict longer-lasting damage on a country I want my kids to live in than any other movement in British politics.\"</p><p>That's hardly a ringing endorsement. How does he feel about having been ousted in the election by a Labour candidate, Jared O'Mara, who has since been accused of making vile sexist and homophobic comments, and has lost the Labour whip?</p><p>Clegg goes quiet, thinking back. \"I was asked by the chair of the local Labour party, 'Could you go easy on our candidate as he's not up to it.' \" he recalls.</p><p>Wasn't that odd? \"I thought it was curious. My campaign team told me he'd behaved unpleasantly to, I think, some nurses. I didn't pay much attention. In any case, that's not stuff you're going to start putting in pamphlets.\"</p><p>At that point, a month before the election, no one thought Labour would win. But what is clear, Clegg says, is that the local Labour party already knew O'Mara was a liability. Labour HQ has denied knowing the detailed allegations against O'Mara before October. \"It's shock and horror from Labour now,\" says Clegg, \"but they knew. In Sheffield, everybody talks to everybody.\"</p><p>Does he miss Westminster?</p><p>\"It's such a fetid place. I've never liked it. I still couldn't tell you where most of the bars are. I was never a tearoom figure - that was my failing.\"</p><p>What does he think of the sex-pest scandal, which has seen the resignation of the defence secretary and an investigation into the deputy prime minister, Damian Green?</p><p>\"No party, including the Lib Dems, is free of the taint of sexual harassment and bullying. This behaviour is totally unacceptable and it should be stamped out hard, because no one should be made to feel uncomfortable or threatened while going about their work.\"</p><p>The peculiar environment of Westminster, he says, contributes to what he calls \"some nasty behaviour by unscrupulous types\" who have authority over others. \"People are locked up night after night away from their families, they feel they should be running the country and most don't run a whelk stall. They are like Sunday pantomime actors, desperate to put on the make-up and get the applause.\" </p><p>Clegg doesn't sound preachy when he says this, but weary. He sounds like an accidental politician who never quite bought into the system. The more he talks, the more I wonder how he managed to push himself so hard for so long. Most MPs I know have got the bug. They don't relish all the tedium, but they have a deep respect for our quirky institutions. <person><nameText>David Cameron </nameText></person>and George Osborne were experts on parliamentary procedure, they knew every nook and cranny, and they enjoyed the process of legislating.</p><p>Yet Clegg tells me that he would sometimes go to the whips and ask why he had to stay late to vote, rather than go home to his children, when the outcome of a vote was \"already known\". I suggest that would be free-riding. If everyone went home, the outcome of the vote would not be assured, would it? He grimaces again.</p><p>So what next then for <person><nameText>Nick Clegg? </nameText></person>Assuming the midlife crisis is temporary, what happens after drumming and surfing?</p><p>The answer is unexpected. In the past two years, he has become very interested in big tech, and how we should regulate it. He thinks that companies such as Google, Amazon and Facebook are \"flagrantly, blatantly on the wrong side\" on tax and should pay up. However, as you might expect from a man who opposed government attempts to let the intelligence services see more data on citizens - which he successfully dubbed the \"snoopers' charter\" - he doesn't think that internet platforms should be responsible for all the content they host in the way that publishers are.</p><p>\"There is a profound dishonesty where the political class is saying to [Facebook founder] Mark Zuckerberg, 'Why don't you know everything your 2bn users are looking at?' I don't want Zuckerberg to decide what is and isn't acceptable. If it's illegal, let the legislators lay down the rules and he must then abide by them.\"</p><p>Hang on. What about the things that aren't illegal? The public is sick of these companies mining our data, yet withholding information from security services that are trying to keep us safe.</p><p>\"OK,\" he responds. \"You're quite right that data is being harvested and used to accrue advertising revenue. But if you want the genius of artificial intelligence to work its magic, then you need huge volumes of data. On who owns data, we will definitely need to change the rules of the game. How you pool it is something we, the political class, will have to think long and hard about. But that is different from saying that they are exclusively responsible for the content.\"</p><p>He speaks rapidly and passionately about tech, almost as passionately as he does about Brexit. He would like to play a role in regulating these fast-moving technologies. \"I'm only 50 years old,\" he says. \"I'm desperate not to be one of these politicians who dines out on the past. And I hope this is the kind of area where folk like me can make a difference by rattling the cage.\"</p><p>It looks as though Clegg is set to remain a campaigner, but from a different vantage point. Is he not tempted to stand at the next election, which could be soon?</p><p>\"If the returning officer from Sheffield walked in here with two unopened boxes,\" he says cheerfully, waving his arm to take in the expanse of room behind us, \"and if those boxes changed the result, I would not be delighted.\"</p><p>I suspect that's probably not the usual politician's hedge. Given how relaxed he looks, and how much he dislikes Westminster, I would predict that <person><nameText>Nick Clegg </nameText></person>version 2.0 is far more likely to be spending time in Silicon Valley - perhaps with one of those new, temporary, interactive tattoos.How to Stop Brexit (And Make Britain Great Again) by <person><nameText>Nick Clegg </nameText></person>is out now (Bodley Head \u00a39)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-39398740</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R4W-TC81-JCJY-G137-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3249\"/><timeReceived>12:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"12\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>December 10, 2017 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLRH</classCode><className>UK LIBERAL DEMOCRATS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N813940MM</classCode><className>POLITICAL PARTIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLPE</classCode><className>UK POLITICAL PARTIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009EOQ</classCode><className>PRIME MINISTERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000DKY8</classCode><className>BREXIT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000CMLW</classCode><className>MIDDLE AGED PERSONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX001480</classCode><className>RESIGNATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX000248</classCode><className>CANCER</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX002086</classCode><className>LYMPHOMA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX002037</classCode><className>BLOOD DISORDERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST000DKM5</classCode><className>CANOEING &amp;

And as Margaret O'mara notes in her brilliant new book, The Code: Silicon Valley and the Remaking of America[2]: Added together, the valuations of tech's so-called Big Five\u2014Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google/Alphabet, and Microsoft\u2014total more than the entire economy of the United Kingdom.' The UK is the world's fifth largest economy. Silicon Valley has become one of the greatest wealth generators of all time, creating 'the richest people in the history of humanity'\u2014richer even than the original robber barons. </p><p>And yet, according to Second Harvest Food Bank, one in four people in Silicon Valley is at risk of hunger. Those most affected are the community's most vulnerable\u2014the elderly and the young. One in three children in Santa Clara and San Mateo counties, around 200,000 young people, are considered food insecure. That all sounds more like an old, gilded age economy, or a new aristocracy, with updated technology. I'd like to think a truly new economy could be on the horizon, and it may be\u2014and some of the shoots of it are documented in The Making of a Democratic Economy[3] by Marjorie Kelly and Ted Howard of the Democracy Collaborative. Today we live in a world in which 26 billionaires own as much wealth as half the planet's population. The three wealthiest men in the US\u2014Bill Gated, Jeff Bezos, and Warren Buffett\u2014own more wealth than the bottom half of America combined, a total of $160 million people. Since 2009, 95 percent of income gains in the US have gone to the top 1 percent. Meanwhile, an alarming 47 percent of Americans cannot put together even $400 in the face of an emergency, leaving most of us unprepared to face such ordinary mishaps as a flat tire or a child's twisted ankle. 'There can be no real political democracy,' said Theodore Roosevelt, 'unless there is something approaching an economic democracy.' The good news is that there is more progress on that front, on the ground in the real economy, than we might imagine from watching the nightly business report. Kelly and Howard define seven principles of a such a democratic economy\u2014community, inclusion, place, good work, democratic ownership, sustainability, and ethical finance\u2014and highlight the people, places, and enterprises that are putting these principles into practice. What we find emerging is a coherent paradigm for how to organize an economy\u2014one that takes us beyond the binary choice of corporate capitalism versus state socialism into something new. The authors are decidedly anti-capitalist, but only in the sense that they believe that people and planet should be at the center of economic concerns rather than capital, and believe 'that it's possible to design ordinary economic activity to serve broad well-being, not to extract maximum profits.' When we speak of a 'free market,' we usually speak of deregulation and keeping the government out of the economy. And Kelly and Howard cite many instances in which regulation isn't helpful, and may even be a hindrance. But adherence to the 'free market' is often used as an argument for the ability to oppress others, and the American economy was, indeed\u2014contrary to the democratic ideals of our founding\u2014built on such oppression that stretched across the Atlantic. 'The land that enslaved people planted in cotton,' Harvard professor Walter Johnson wrote, 'had been expropriated from the Creek, the Cherokee, the Choctaw, and the Seminole.' In the emerging capitalist system of the 1800s\u2014which knit together the cotton plantations of Mississippi with the looms of Manchester, England, and the financiers of New York\u2014'[e]nslaved people were the collateral upon which the entire system depended,' Johnson noted. As cotton merchants loaned money to planters to finance operations until harvest, they required security. 'That security was the value of the enslaved,' Johnson said. 'Enslaved people were the capital. Their value in 1860 was equal to all the capital invested in American railroads, manufacturing, and agricultural land combined.' The enslavement of African Americans and genocide of the indigenous population are our both our government's and our economy's original sins. Kelly and Howard discuss how organization like the Thunder Valley Valley Community Development Corporation and NDN Collective, rising from the Pine Ridge Reservation on which the Wounded Knee Massacre occurred, are building a new economy by returning to pre-colonial economic models based on community. They highlight Prosper Portland to discuss the principle of inclusion and investing in communities historically excluded and dislocated due to overtly racist policies in the city's past. The visit the Evergreen Cooperative in Cleveland to emphasize the principle of place and the 'power of institutions anchored in place, like nonprofit hospitals, universities, and colleges, which represent more than $1.7 trillion in economic activity\u2014close to 9 percent of US GDP'\u2014to use their economic power to work in the community and build wealth that stays local. One of the most instructive cases is that of environmental consulting firm EA Engineering, because it had tried and failed using an extractive ownership model before instituting a democratic one. The authors explain how, as the company grew, it was encouraged to go national by advisors, and took the traditional route by going public on the NASDAQ exchange. They found quickly that 'Quality work and integrity took a back seat to share price,' and staff morale plummeted. They found their environmental mission was incompatible with quarterly earnings, and founder Loren Jensen bought back controlling interest so he could return the company's focus 'immediately to the task of understanding environmental problems and what to do about them.' The company still does work on a national, and even international, scale, with projects from Guam to West Virginia to Lake Ontario, but it's ownership is local. In fact, Jensen and the minority partner that helped him buy back the company eventually allowed themselves to be bought out as the company transitioned to employee ownership under an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP), while also becoming a public benefit corporation (PBC). The environmental scientist and aquatic biologists who work there are now the company's owners, and their environmental purpose aligns perfectly with their purpose as a public benefit corporation. After cycling through three presidents and getting into trouble with the SEC over accounting mistakes as a publicly traded company, their financial health has never been better than since becoming a ESOP in 2014: EA's been profitable ever since. Legal and related costs for the new design were $750,000, but that 'was much less than one year's savings in taxes' As an S Corporation fully owned by an ESOP trust, EA pays zero income taxes on profits at the enterprise level. Profits pass through to employees, who pay taxes when they retire and withdraw holdings, when they're in a lower tax bracket. It not only shows that there is more than one way to structure a profitable company, it is in the authors' view, 'a harbinger of enterprise design for a new era of equity and sustainability.' And founder Loren Jensen even 'got additional personal tax advantages for selling to the ESOP.' While all the company's economic advisors had urged it to go public, it is through employee, mission-oriented ownership that it has the best chance to thrive financially and survive to carry out its mission\u2014to benefit both its employees and the environment. As Kelly and Howard write: In the extractive economy, companies are seen as objects owned by shareholders, designed to manufacture earnings like so many ball bearings off an assembly line. EA is a model of a company as a living system, part of the larger living system of the earth, designed to benefit life. Discussing why regulation won't always work, they share the story of one of EA's clients, chemical company Ciba-Geigy. EA conducted a study of the wastewater Ciba-Geigy had been dumping into the Atlantic Ocean at its Toms River, New Jersey facility, and found it was killing more than half of the mysid shrimp the water was tested on. So, in the early '80s, after 34 years of dumping '5 million gallons, per day, of highly acidic, partially treated toxic waste' into the ocean, poisoning the town water supply by seeping toxic waste into backyard wells from a leaking company pipeline, resulting in dozens of childhood cancers, what did the company do? Like many chemical companies at the time, it moved production to places like Alabama, Louisiana, and Asia, where wages and environmental oversight were much lower. It is for this reason that the authors suggest that ownership design is just as important as technology and regulation for the environmental movement. And the time is ripe: Retiring baby boomers are likely to sell or close 2.34 million businesses over the coming decade; many will simply shut down, resulting in layoffs and the loss of local jobs. If these could be converted to employee ownership, it could bend the curve of history. The combination of being a benefit corporation and employee owned is especially powerful alternative: EA Engineering has a legally binding duty to create public benefit, and as the company's value grows, it goes to employees. The reason is simple but invisible: ownership design. Just as we need to make such changes at the local and company level, we need large systemic change, as well. One of the more radical ideas in the book comes from Carla Santos Skandier, a Senior Policy Associate at the Democracy Collaborative the authors run. To confront climate change, she suggests the federal government 'buy out the 25 largest US fossil fuel companies using the power of the Federal Reserve.' It would be accomplished through quantitative easing, costing nothing to taxpayer. It was the method the Fed used to save the big banks, believing their failure posed an existential threat to our economy and way of life. Surely climate change and ecosystem failure rise to the same level of need? Unfortunately, we are not moving in that direction. Last year, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that 'carbon emissions must be slashed by 45 percent by 2030 from 2010, then crushed to net zero by 2050,' in order to prevent catastrophic global warming. Also last year, the United States surpassed Russia and Saudi Arabia to become the world's largest crude oil producer. This is the extraordinary end game of the extractive economy, which in its infancy did not shrink from commodifying human beings, in its maturity did not blink at dumping billions of gallons of toxins into oceans, and now in its aging fullness contemplates causing irreversible damage to life on earth, and shrugs. The authors quote Aldo Leopold's Sand County Almanac to make suggest the kind of mindset shift we need to make: 'We abuse the land because we view it as a commodity belonging to us. When we see land as a community to which we belong, we may begin to use it with love and respect.' The Wisconsin sand that Leopold named his almanac after (there is no actual Sand County here in Wisconsin), highly sought after for use in fracking, is now being dug up, shipped across the country, and buried underground in order to violently extract fossil fuels stored in shale rock. Our economy is not only failing the vast majority of people, it is literally destroying our planet. It's consuming natural resources at more than one-and-a-half times the Earth's ability to regenerate them. Soil depletion has ravaged one-third of all arable land. Nearly two-thirds of all vertebrates have disappeared from the Earth since 1970, part of a sixth mass extinction that is terrifyingly underway. We are razing the only home our civilization has, yet we remain caught inside a system designed to perpetuate that razing, in order to feed wealth to an elite. It doesn't have to be that way. The vast majority of human beings on this planet\u2014and the planet itself\u2014would be better off if it were not. The biggest change needed to make it happen is, as systems theorist Donella Meadows wrote, is 'a new way of seeing.' The authors offer a new paradigm: A different paradigm doesn't start with capital as the center of the universe. It starts from the point of view of life. And reality looks something like this: there's only one system, the earth, which is precious beyond measure. The economy and everything in it are subsets of this one system. The economic tools needed to build a more democratic economy are readily available and already in wide use. There are examples out there, some centuries old, some introduced in recent decades. The only thing we need is the imagination, or perhaps moral clarity, that we don't have to run our businesses for the benefit of elite, absentee shareholders\u2014that such a system, rather than causing wealth to trickle down, 'extracts wealth up from communities and sets it spinning in the ethereal realm of speculative trading.' The 'new' economy of big tech extracts even more\u2014our attention and data\u2014and sells it to others who want to sell us a lot of things we really don't need, just to keep the top spinning. Matthew Brown, the Leader of Preston City Council in the north of England, put it best when he said that, for the past 40 years, his community had really seen no alternative, 'just managed decline.' Inspired by Cleveland, they began experimenting. Now 'With the pension fund, anchor procurement, the living wage, worker co-ops getting started, the credit union, the [public] bank,' Matthew said, 'we're really building a democratic economy.' We can do it anywhere. And we'll have to, because big tech and the financial elites that sit atop our current economic system, based on extraction from communities like Preston, are not going to build it for us.

As with that deal, the odds are stacked against him following the initial rebuff by the London Stock Exchange Group Plc to his $36.6 billion offer and questioning by China's state media.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But that could suit the style of the first Chinese national to run the exchange. Having earned the nickname \"Mr. China\" for tying the company closer to the mainland, Li is described by current and former colleagues as relentless and with little tolerance for naysayers. He has dispatched senior HKEX officials, including co-president Romnesh Lamba, to meet LSE shareholders in London and New York, according to people with knowledge of the matter. An HKEX spokeswoman declined to comment.</p><p>Li is \"a typical investment banker, hungry for money and opportunities,\" said Stephen Hui, a former HKEX board member. \"He works with a can-do attitude, and will not stop until he absolutely tries everything.\"</p><p>The formula has worked for years, for both the exchange and its 58-year-old CEO. Now, after a firm refusal from LSE's management, it may be up against its toughest test yet.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Thinking ahead</emphasis></p><p>Born in Beijing, Li grew up in the northwestern Gansu province during the Cultural Revolution. He worked on an oil rig before studying English Literature at Xiamen University. A short stint as a journalist led him to the U.S., where he earned a Columbia University law degree. A few years working at law firms, including Davis Polk &amp; Wardell were followed by 16 years in banking: first Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. and then JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., where he was China chairman when he joined HKEX in 2009.</p><p>Taking over as CEO in 2010, Li had a plan to diversify the business and to do so with acquisitions, said Cecelia Zhong, a former HKEX executive. HKEX revenue has doubled to HKD14.3 billion ($1.8 billion) since Li took over in 2010, and its shares have outperformed the benchmark Hang Seng Index.</p><p>\"He's ambitious, has vision and thinks 10 years ahead,\" said Zhong, who's now CEO of Guojin Resources Ltd., a Hong Kong-based commodities trading platform.</p><p>Li has transformed a bastion of the Hong Kong business world into a global player with trading venues in the U.K. and mainland China. The city owns 6% of HKEX and appoints six of the company's directors.</p><p>At the same time, Li sought to elevate HKEX's global profile, a strategy reflected in his top aides. The company's heads of listings, group strategy and markets have all worked at Wall Street firms.</p><p>In meetings with senior stakeholders, Li would often present ideas that seemed to come out of nowhere, said a person with knowledge of the matter, and each proposal had a detailed analysis of risk and return. Linking HKEX with exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen - an idea that eventually became the stock connect program that now covers more than 2,000 equities - was one of those, the person said.</p><p>\"Our teams worked for years to overcome what many felt was 'mission impossible': finding a way to open up the mainland market as much as possible while minimizing the risks of an uncontrolled flow of capital,\" Li wrote on the HKEX website in December 2017. \"No exchange had ever done anything like Stock Connect before.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dual-class push</emphasis></p><p>One former colleague pointed to Li's push for weighted-voting rights in Hong Kong - to allow companies with different share classes to go public in the city - as an example of his approach.</p><p>Li first mooted the idea in 2013 as a way to lure big tech companies to the city but was denied by the regulator in 2015. He finally got his way last year. Xiaomi Corp. and Meituan Dianping have gone public under the new rules, and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. is expected to list in Hong Kong later this year in what will likely be one of the biggest ever share sales.</p><p>\"I have seen him fight hard battles, like introducing dual-class shares to the market against all odds,\" said Mike Wong, CEO of the Chamber of Hong Kong Listed Companies. \"He has a full plan forward, and thinks years ahead - but also knows when to advance and when to leave.\"</p><p>Not every idea has worked, especially when it comes to China. While HKEX has also started a bond link with the mainland, Li had often talked about a suite of connections, including one for exchange-traded funds and one that would allow Chinese investors to buy Hong Kong listing debuts. They haven't happened, and public comments about the plans have died away. Futures contracts in Hong Kong based on Chinese government bonds were launched, but shelved after a few months.</p><p>Those setbacks may have played a role in the LSE bid. At corporate strategy meetings held in September 2018, Li and other senior HKEX executives spoke about the need to diversify away from China, said one of the people.</p><p>The response so far from the LSE suggests Li will have to look elsewhere.</p><p>LSE CEO David Schwimmer last week reaffirmed his plans to combine with data provider Refinitiv and reject the HKEX bid. The London bourse and many of its investors view that $27 billion push into financial data as more promising than a multi-continental combination of exchanges.</p><p>For now, HKEX is trying to win over other LSE investors, and a hostile bid hasn't been ruled out. Former HKEX Chairman Ron Arculli said on Bloomberg Television that observers shouldn't dismiss Li's ability to overcome opposition and complete the deal.</p><p>\"He knows how to navigate his way around the regulatory circles, and indeed the financial circles, in London,\" he said. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Viren Vaghela, Kiuyan Wong &amp; Benjamin Robertson,</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bloomberg</emphasis></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://macaudailytimes.com.mo/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/1-Charles-Li.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Charles Li, chief executive officer of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd.

Simons, the F.T.C. chairman, is a newbie on data privacy policy. But he is overseeing the biggest privacy case in the agency's history.</p></bodyText></abstract></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><h>FULL TEXT</h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">WASHINGTON - The Federal Trade Commission has no shortage of critics who say it cannot protect Americans from the prying eyes of Big Tech. Instead of forceful action against the likes of Facebook and Google, they say, the F.T.C. leans on rules that make it hard to impose penalties bigger than rounding errors for the companies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those critics have an unusual champion: Joseph J. Simons, the man running the agency.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We have this over 100-year-old statute that is our main authority,\" Mr. Simons said in his first sit-down interview since becoming chairman 10 months ago. \"And clearly legislators who approved that were not thinking about data security and privacy issues.\"</p><p>In the deregulatory era of the Trump administration, Mr. Simons, 60, a Republican lawyer who has jumped between the public and private sectors for more than 30 years, is a rare voice for strengthening the government's hand.</p><p>Mr. Simons has urged Congress to expand the F.T.C.'s privacy-enforcement powers and allow it to impose fines more easily, write new rules and hire more experts. He also says the agency should police how all companies and nonprofits - not just technology companies - collect and handle people's digital data.</p><p>But none of those changes will happen before Mr. Simons must make the most anticipated decision on data privacy in the agency's history. In the coming weeks, he and the F.T.C.'s four other commissioners are expected to conclude an investigation into whether Facebook violated its promises to protect people's data.</p><p>The outcome of the case is seen as a referendum on the government's ability to rein in tech giants that have amassed incredible wealth and power from collecting and bartering user data.</p><p>\"The F.T.C.'s decision on Facebook will be highly consequential, for the F.T.C. and Facebook, for the tech industry, and for consumers,\" said David Vladeck, who led consumer protection at the agency during the Obama administration. \"The commission's action will set the bar.\"</p><p>The case has taken on huge significance in Washington, where Facebook has become Exhibit A for an industry accused of a wide range of problems, from enabling foreign election interference to crushing competitors.</p><p>A rising chorus of Republican and Democratic lawmakers has criticized the F.T.C. for not restraining the companies' data-collection practices, which are central to some of their businesses. The agency's biggest penalty on a tech company was a $22 million fine imposed on Google in 2012, for misrepresenting how it used some online tracking tools. Google reported $50 billion in revenue that year.</p><p>On Friday, Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat who is running for president, announced a sweeping plan to strengthen regulations against big tech companies.</p><p>\"The F.T.C. has been a disappointment with its lack of enforcement in the past, which for Facebook and Google has amounted to a slap on the wrist,\" Senator Josh Hawley, a freshman Republican from Missouri, said in an interview. Mr. Hawley investigated Google for competition violations when he was a state attorney general.</p><p>The Facebook investigation is focused on whether the social network violated a 2011 consent decree in which it promised to protect user data and inform users of changes in how their data was used. The inquiry started last March under Mr. Simons's Republican predecessor, Maureen Ohlhausen, after a report in The New York Times revealed that the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica had analyzed the data of 87 million users without their permission.</p><p>The agency is considering imposing a multibillion-dollar fine on Facebook as well as new requirements to strengthen protections on how data is collected and shared, according to two people close to talks between the agency and the company. The two sides have discussed a possible settlement for weeks, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation is continuing.</p><p>Facebook declined to comment about Mr. Simons and the investigation. The social network has defended its actions, saying that when it learned a researcher violated its terms of service by giving user data to Cambridge Analytica, it demanded that the data be destroyed and was promised that it had been.</p><p>On Wednesday, the company announced plans to shift to a more privacy-focused platform. Mark Zuckerberg, the company's chief executive, said Facebook would invest in encrypted communications and refashion its messaging tools to emphasize private conversations.</p><p>Mr. Simons declined to discuss the Facebook case. And he was even guarded about his own use of technology. He would not say whether he used Facebook or two other popular apps owned by the company, Instagram and WhatsApp. He doesn't use other social media like Twitter, he said; aides write the tweets from his official F.T.C. account.</p><p>\"I don't even know how to access my account,\" Mr. Simons said.</p><p>His comfort zone is antitrust regulation, a major focus for the F.T.C. and an area in which he has worked for most of his career. In his meticulous office, Mr. Simons keeps handy a worn Yale Law Journal with red plastic tabs on antitrust articles. He has had six of its authors speak at the F.T.C. since he arrived.</p><p>In one of his first actions as chairman, he held hearings on updating merger reviews and antitrust enforcement in the digital age. In late February, he announced a task force of 17 antitrust staff members to study potential problems that could arise from past tech mergers.</p><p>\"In antitrust, you want to focus on areas where there is likely to be market power or monopoly power,\" Mr. Simons said. \"So it is not unreasonable to look at big digital platforms and say, well, that might be an ripe area to look at.\"</p><p>He is new to the world of data privacy and admits he is cramming to understand it, immersing himself in articles and grilling staff about data protection. But that, he said, allows him to bring a \"fresh perspective\" to privacy enforcement.</p><p>\"I am willing to look at everything with a fresh eye, and to question long-held beliefs and assumptions,\" he said.</p><p>The F.T.C. monitors whether companies like Google, Uber and Facebook break promises written into privacy policies. But it can't directly fine a company for a first-time offense; it can only charge a company with deceptive or unfair business practices, which the agency must prove in court. The potential penalty against Facebook could reach billions of dollars because the case hinges on whether it violated a previous settlement.</p><p>Mr. Simons argues that the agency needs more direct authority to oversee privacy practices and fine companies. He says it is too hard to prove to a court that someone has been harmed by a company's unauthorized use of their data.</p><p>\"It's important that we get civil penalty authority,\" he said. \"For companies that have lots of money, the impact would be sufficient to deter them.\"</p><p>Privacy groups say the agency has missed numerous opportunities to punish companies with its existing powers. Many compare the commission with European regulators, which have levied hefty fines on Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple for violating antitrust, privacy, tax and security laws.</p><p>Some privacy advocates are also concerned about Mr. Simon's inexperience in the area, saying it requires a deep understanding of complicated technologies.</p><p>\"I don't think he understands the dimensions and implications underlying the consumer privacy threat,\" said Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group.</p><p>Mr. Simons said there were obvious differences between how the United States and Europe viewed privacy.</p><p>\"The E.U. has this strong sense of the right to be forgotten,\" he said. \"We don't have that. We have the opposite of that.

Simons, the F.T.C. chairman, is a newbie on data privacy policy. But he is overseeing the biggest privacy case in the agency\u2019s history.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">WASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Trade Commission has no shortage of critics who say it cannot protect Americans from the prying eyes of Big Tech. Instead of forceful action against the likes of Facebookand Google, they say, the F.T.C. leans on a rules that make it hard to impose penalties bigger than rounding errors for the companies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those critics have an unusual champion: Joseph J. Simons, the man running the agency.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cWe have this over 100-year-old statute that is our main authority,\u201d Mr. Simons said in his first sit-down interview since becoming chairman 10 months ago. \u201cAnd clearly legislators who approved that were not thinking about data security and privacy issues.\u201d</p><p>In the deregulatory era of the <person><nameText>Trump administration, </nameText></person>Mr. Simons, 60, a Republican lawyer who has jumped between the public and private sectors for more than 30 years, is a rare voice for strengthening the government\u2019s hand.</p><p>Mr. Simons has urged Congress to expand the F.T.C.\u2019s privacy-enforcement powers and allow it to impose fines more easily, write new rules and hire more experts. He also says the agency should police how all companies and nonprofits \u2014 not just technology companies \u2014 collect and handle people\u2019s digital data.</p><p>But none of those changes will happen before Mr. Simons must make the most anticipated decision on data privacy in the agency\u2019s history. In the coming weeks, he and the F.T.C.\u2019s four other commissioners are expected to conclude an investigation into whether Facebookviolated its promises to protect people\u2019s data.</p><p>The outcome of the case is seen as a referendum on the government\u2019s ability to rein in tech giants that have amassed incredible wealth and power from collecting and bartering user data.</p><p>\u201cThe F.T.C.\u2019s decision on Facebookwill be highly consequential, for the F.T.C. and Facebook, for the tech industry, and for consumers,\u201d said David Vladeck, who led consumer protection at the agency during the Obama administration. \u201cThe commission\u2019s action will set the bar.\u201d</p><p>The case has taken on huge significance in Washington, where Facebookhas become Exhibit A for an industry accused of a wide range of problems, from enabling foreign election interference to crushing competitors.</p><p>A rising chorus of Republican and Democratic lawmakers has criticized the F.T.C. for not restraining the companies\u2019 data-collection practices, which are central to some of their businesses. The agency\u2019s biggest penalty on a tech company was a $22 million fine imposed on Google in 2012, for misrepresenting how it used some online tracking tools. Google reported $50 billion in revenue that year.</p><p>\u201cThe F.T.C. has been a disappointment with its lack of enforcement in the past, which for Facebookand Google has amounted to a slap on the wrist,\u201d Senator Josh Hawley, a freshman Republican from Missouri, said in an interview. Mr. Hawley investigated Google for competition violations when he was a state attorney general.</p><p>The Facebookinvestigation is focused on whether the social network violated a 2011 consent decree in which it promised to protect user data and inform users of changes in how their data was used. The inquiry started last March under Mr. Simons\u2019s Republican predecessor, Maureen Ohlhausen, after a report in The New York Times revealed that the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica had analyzed the data of 87 million users without their permission.</p><p>The agency is considering imposing a multibillion-dollar fine on Facebookas well as new requirements to strengthen protections on how data is collected and shared, according to two people close to talks between the agency and the company. The two sides have discussed a possible settlement for weeks, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation is continuing.</p><p>Facebookdeclined to comment about Mr. Simons and the investigation. The social network has defended its actions, saying that when it learned a researcher violated its terms of service by giving user data to Cambridge Analytica, it demanded that the data be destroyed and was promised that it had been.</p><p>On Wednesday, the company <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/06/technology/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-privacy.html\">announced plans</url> to shift to a more privacy-focused platform. Mark <person><nameText>Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>the company\u2019s chief executive, said Facebookwould invest in encrypted communications and refashion its messaging tools to emphasize private conversations.</p><p>Mr. Simons declined to discuss the Facebookcase. And he was even guarded about his own use of technology. He would not say whether he used Facebookor two other popular apps owned by the company, Instagram and WhatsApp. He doesn\u2019t use other social media like Twitter, he said; aides write the tweets from his official F.T.C. account.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know how to access my account,\u201d Mr. Simons said.</p><p>His comfort zone is antitrust regulation, a major focus for the F.T.C. and an area in which he has worked for most of his career. In his meticulous office, Mr. Simons keeps handy a worn Yale Law Journal with red plastic tabs on antitrust articles. He has had six of its authors speak at the F.T.C. since he arrived.</p><p>In one of his first actions as chairman, he held hearings on updating merger reviews and antitrust enforcement in the digital age. In late February, he announced a task force of 17 antitrust staff members to study potential problems that could arise from past tech mergers.</p><p>\u201cIn antitrust, you want to focus on areas where there is likely to be market power or monopoly power,\u201d Mr. Simons said. \u201cSo it is not unreasonable to look at big digital platforms and say, well, that might be an ripe area to look at.\u201d</p><p>He is new to the world of data privacy and admits he is cramming to understand it, immersing himself in articles and grilling staff about data protection. But that, he said, allows him to bring a \u201cfresh perspective\u201d to privacy enforcement.</p><p>\u201cI am willing to look at everything with a fresh eye, and to question long-held beliefs and assumptions,\u201d he said.</p><p>The F.T.C. monitors whether companies like Google, Uber and Facebookbreak promises written into privacy policies. But it can\u2019t directly fine a company for a first-time offense; it can only charge a company with deceptive or unfair business practices, which the agency must prove in court. The potential penalty against Facebookcould reach billions of dollars because the case hinges on whether it violated a previous settlement.</p><p>Mr. Simons argues that the agency needs more direct authority to oversee privacy practices and fine companies. He says it is too hard to prove to a court that someone has been harmed by a company\u2019s unauthorized use of their data.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s important that we get civil penalty authority,\u201d he said. \u201cFor companies that have lots of money, the impact would be sufficient to deter them.\u201d</p><p>Privacy groups say the agency has missed numerous opportunities to punish companies with its existing powers. Many compare the commission with European regulators, which have levied hefty fines on Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple for violating antitrust, privacy, tax and security laws.</p><p>Some privacy advocates are also concerned about Mr. Simon\u2019s inexperience in the area, saying it requires a deep understanding of complicated technologies.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he understands the dimensions and implications underlying the consumer privacy threat,\u201d said Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group.</p><p>Mr. Simons said there were obvious differences between how the United States and Europe viewed privacy.</p><p>\u201cThe E.U. has this strong sense of the right to be forgotten,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have that. We have the opposite of that. We have the First Amendment.\u201d</p><p>And he said the details of how the government handled digital privacy should be for lawmakers, not him, to sort out.</p><p>\u201cPrivacy involves very important societal and cultural values that really need to be determined by the Congress,\u201d Mr. Simons said, pointing toward Capitol Hill, less than a mile up Pennsylvania Avenue from his office.</p><p>\u201cNot,\u201d he said, \u201cby unelected F.T.C. commissioners.\u201d</p><p>PHOTO: Joseph J.

Jim Hood antagonized Google for nine years as Mississippi\u2019s attorney gen...</p><p>Mississippi\u2019s former AG waged a nine-year battle with Google that prompted the company to take him to court \u2014 provoking states that are now pursuing a potentially devastating lawsuit.    Jim Hood antagonized Google for nine years as Mississippi\u2019s attorney general, going after the internet giant for enabling the sale of illegal drugs, allowing pirated content to flourish online and serving up targeted ads to children.    And Google fought back: Hood holds the title of the only U.S. public official the company has ever sued.      Now Hood has returned for more. Earlier this year, he signed on as a consultant to the massive, multistate investigation into the company\u2019s dominance online. Forty-eight states, D.C. and Puerto Rico are expected to file an antitrust suit against the company this fall \u2014 one that, paired with a federal antitrust probe, represents the biggest regulatory threat to Google\u2019s business yet. The twin efforts target the heart of Google\u2019s business: advertising and search, which are key to the company\u2019s $160 billion annual revenue.     The states\u2019 decision to bring on Hood, who stepped down in January following an unsuccessful bid for governor, suggests they are expecting a drawn-out legal battle that will require persistence, and maybe a bit of an attack dog.    \u201cDealing with Google is like dealing with a teenager,\u201d the 58-year-old Democrat said in an interview. \u201cThey don\u2019t follow the norms that other businesses do. Google will tell you one thing and do something different.\u201d    During his 16 years as Mississippi AG, Google was Hood\u2019s biggest \u2014 and most elusive \u2014 target, spanning issues including antitrust, privacy, intellectual property theft and the power of state attorneys general to investigate tech. While other states and agencies opened investigations into Google during the same years, Hood mostly operated independently and kept going long after the others settled or let their cases drop.    A spokesperson for Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton \u2014 who is leading the multistate probe \u2014 declined to comment on Hood\u2019s hire, but two people familiar with the investigation said Hood is helping the states develop investigative and litigation strategies. They declined to speak on the record because the probe is confidential.    Ironically, the current multistate case might never have existed except for Hood\u2019s dogged pursuit of Google, which prompted the company to file the 2014 lawsuit. Google\u2019s move infuriated his fellow attorneys general and helped spur them to take on the company.     Google argued in its suit that Hood was part of a Hollywood-organized plot to censor online content. Over the years, the company has repeatedly accused him of engaging in \u201cbad faith,\u201d issuing threats and \u201cpunitive\u201d subpoenas and suing the company based on \u201cunfounded and speculative allegations.\u201d                 The lawsuit, which was ultimately dismissed, also galvanized attorneys general across the country to advocate for Congress to change the legal liability law Google invoked in its defense, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.    Hood spoke to POLITICO in March about his previous Google investigations. After his hire, he declined to answer follow-ups, referring further questions to Texas.    Unfailingly polite in his soft Southern drawl, Hood compares Google to the robber barons of old and leans into hyperbole to argue his points against the company.    \u201cBecause they are innovative and we love what their technology has done for us, we give them a break versus other areas of business,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have more power than any company in the history of the world.\u201d Google declined to comment for this story.    Hood said he became interested in Google around 2011 when the company reached a $500 million settlement with federal enforcers for selling ads for illegal drugs like unprescribed oxycodone. The fine remains the largest Google has paid in the U.S.    Hood tasked investigators with testing Google\u2019s compliance with the settlement. In a 2012 presentation to the National Association of State Attorneys General , Hood demonstrated how easy it was to use Google to buy pirated movies and music and that it still served ads for illegal drugs, including bath salts and synthetic cannabinoids.    Around the same time, Hood started going after Google on antitrust allegations that it biased search results in favor of its own products.    Throughout 2013 and 2014, the Mississippi AG continued to pepper Google with letters, some on his own, some with others focused on removing illegal ads and content. He also used his platform as president of the National Association of Attorneys General to press other state AGs to join his efforts.    Those who know Hood said his relentless pursuit of Google is in character.    Jim Hood is the \u201cmost hard-headed person I\u2019ve ever met in my life,\u201d said Mike Moore, Mississippi\u2019s attorney general from 1988 to 2004 who gave Hood his first job after law school. \u201cHe likes to work on one thing and that one thing will occupy most of his time. He digs down deep into it and grabs hold of it like a snapping turtle.\u201d    Hood was among the first to raise several issues with Google\u2019s search platform that public uproar or advertiser pressure would later force the company to change. For example, Hood urged Google in 2014 to change its search bar autocomplete function to eliminate suggestions such as \u201cbuy oxycodone online without a prescription.\u201d    Google general counsel Kent Walker responded that it would do more to address illegal activity recommendations and ban ads related to human trafficking. But Google\u2019s lawyers said they couldn't change autocomplete without also harming legitimate results.    Three years later, after reports surfaced that Google recommended anti-semitic, racist and sexist searches such as \u201care Jews evil,\u201d public pressure led the company to update autocomplete to allow users to flag inappropriate results.       Hood and other AGs also upbraided the company for making money off of YouTube videos that promoted illegal or pirated content. In response, Google introduced a \u201cTrusted Flagger\u201d program in 2014 allowing government agencies and  independent watchdogs to tag problematic videos. Three years later, some 250 advertisers boycotted YouTube after their ads appeared next to extremist content and the video platform sped up and expanded its removals of objectionable content .    But what riled Google most was Hood\u2019s 2014 subpoena requesting information about alleged facilitation of illegal drug sales and pirated movies and music. By that time, the other state and federal antitrust probes had closed without action against Google.    In lieu of responding to the subpoena, Google sued Hood in federal court , arguing that Section 230 prevented his probe. Written in 1996, Section 230 shields internet companies from suits over user-generated content. In its complaint, Google argued the law immunized the company from state civil or criminal liability .    That law has become a major flashpoint ahead of the November election, with the Trump administration and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle seeking to narrow Section 230. Republicans argue that the law has let Google, Facebook and Twitter censor conservative speech online with impunity. Democrats, who have described Section 230 as a \u201cgift to Big Tech,\u201d say it creates an unlevel playing field since tech firms are shielded from taking responsibility in ways that offline companies aren\u2019t.    Hood called Google\u2019s invocation of Section 230 against him an abuse of power.    \u201cSection 230 was developed for the right reasons, but Google and some of these companies have abused what was originally written in there,\u201d Hood said. \u201cNow they use that shield like a sword for illegal activity.\u201d    Other AGs agreed, and came to Hood\u2019s defense.    Dozens of attorneys general weighed in for Hood in the initial Google suit \u2014 where a federal judge sided with Google \u2014 and during an appeal. They argued that Section 230 does not bar states from sending subpoenas to investigate potential illegal acts.    \u201cA target of an investigation should not be permitted to conjure up federal defenses to hypothetical claims for the purpose of forestalling or impeding a legitimate investigation,\u201d 40 attorneys general said in a brief .    A federal appeals court ruled in favor of Hood , but Google and Hood later jointly reached an agreement to dismiss the suit .    Google\u2019s case against Hood remains a sore spot among attorneys general. At a Justice Department workshop on Section 230 this year, Nebraska\u2019s Republican Attorney General Doug Peterson called the case the reason why state attorneys general want changes to the law.    \u201cWe need to have the ability not to have some of the online providers who aided or abetted the crime say, \u2018You\u2019re simply a state and we\u2019re immune,\u2019\u201d Peterson said.       Google and some of its supporters portrayed Hood\u2019s subpoena as a plot organized by Hollywood unfairly targeting the search giant. Emails from the 2014 Sony hack revealed the Motion Picture Association of America \u2014 the film industry\u2019s trade association \u2014 urged Hood to investigate Google over piracy, and retained by Hood\u2019s office to help build a case. But he maintains the effort had broader support among music, software and telecom companies who consider Google a monopoly.    For his part, Hood said the companies and associations, who he described as victims of online piracy, provided valuable technical advice about what to ask Google.    Moore said Hood was \u201ca bit before his time\u201d in pursuing Google. But with nearly every state on board, Hood\u2019s predecessor said the right time may be coming.    \u201cThere\u2019s a time for everything. Sometimes the issue hasn\u2019t matured enough,\u201d Moore said, noting that Mississippi didn\u2019t retire its state flag until now after two decades of effort. \u201cIt\u2019s also that way in the law.

From there, his opinions on roadworks, sports, price rises and even the last orders at the bar get shut down because \"politics affects almost everything,\" the advert so rightly tells us.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I think about this every time I get a new device from Huawei because I can't talk about it without mentioning the reason it <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.itpro.co.uk/mobile/google-android/354870/google-asks-the-white-house-to-return-its-apps-to-huawei-devices\">no longer has Google apps</url>.

The devices can no longer support the Google Play store and its ecosystem of apps. No Gmail, no Google Maps, literally all the things you've come to depend on since phones became smart, because the US government has placed Huawei on a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.itpro.co.uk/policy-legislation/33650/huawei-placed-on-trade-blacklist-by-us-gov\">blacklist</url> that prohibits all American firms from trading with it. Unfortunately, this includes Google, which is a US-based company.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>The reasoning behind it is murky. Essentially, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">the</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Man</emphasis> believes Huawei is in cahoots with the Chinese government and its dominance in the 5G market will lead to state-sponsored surveillance. The evidence that supports this theory hasn't been made public, yet, but it has proven enough to pull <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.itpro.co.uk/policy-legislation/33132/huaweis-meng-wanzhou-to-sue-canadian-authorities-over-her-arrest\">Huawei into a bitter trade war</url> between the US and China. It's also seemingly substantial enough for <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.itpro.co.uk/security/32433/us-gov-presses-allies-to-ditch-huawei\">US allies</url> to ditch the embattled Chinese firm from their national networks - potentially including the UK.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Man</emphasis>, in this case, is US President Donald Trump, an orange-faced crackpot who's managed to fail his way into one of the most influential jobs in the world. On Tuesday he tweeted \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1277977452187275266?s=20\">LONE WARRIOR</url>\" without any explanation and that wasn't even the strangest thing he'd posted during the week. All the really bizarre stuff got <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/02/twitter-removes-trump-image-in-tweet-for-violating-copyright-policy.html\">taken down by Twitter</url>.\u00a0</p><p>Now, I'm not suggesting that these claims are made up, or that the trade war is all based on some kind of bias against the Chinese - to say its government is authoritarian would be an understatement - but there does seem to be an unfair focus on Huawei. Worse, the sanctions actually hit the consumer and impact competition.\u00a0</p><p>Until Huawei released the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.itpro.co.uk/mobile/31270/huawei-p20-review-devito-to-the-p20-pros-schwarzenegger\">P20</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.itpro.co.uk/google-android/31288/huawei-p20-pro-review-a-three-eyed-monster-of-a-smartphone\">P20 Pro</url> smartphones in 2018, the market was dominated by two manufacturers; South Korean giant Samsung and Silicon Valley stalwart Apple. The Galaxy range and the iPhone were in quite a comfy position until Huawei's super camera phones came on the scene.</p><p>They followed this up with the P30 and P30 Pro in 2019. The latter had a camera with a mindblowing zoom capability. You could capture images from hundreds of yards away - strangely, no one thought that was a security issue - but these were launched just a month before big Don slapped the sanctions on the table.\u00a0</p><p>I don't mean to sound bitter, but why do we trust Huawei any less than Trump? He regularly refers to the coronavirus as the \"Chinese virus\" and other more racist terms. What's more, the sanctions on Huawei were put in place far more easily than any regulatory action against America's big tech firms. Facebook caused one of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.itpro.co.uk/data-insights/30795/cambridge-analytica-and-facebook-what-happened-and-has-it-impacted-any-votes\">biggest breaches of privacy and democracy the world has ever seen</url>, but no government has managed to curtail its growth. Google, meanwhile, has slipped the net of many <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.itpro.co.uk/mobile/google-android/354504/android-search-engine-auction-goes-against-spirit-of-eu-ruling-rivals\">anti-competition and data privacy rulings</url>.\u00a0</p><p>To its credit, despite all the political pressure and a pandemic, Huawei has still managed to launch hardware. Its <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.itpro.co.uk/mobile/mobile-phones/355123/huawei-p40-pro-first-look-zooming-above-it-all\">P40 Pro</url> smartphone is marvellous and comes in a range of stylish shades, but it's most notable for not having full-fat Google. If you want the apps, you need to sideload them, something both <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-51613577\">Huawei and Google</url> (and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">IT Pro</emphasis>) do not recommend.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DPITPR-httpswwwitprocoukmobilemobilephones356335themanhasruinedmyhuaweip40</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DPITPR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:608H-GR81-DXHJ-F4SD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464401</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"701\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Dennis Publishing Ltd.

Berners-Lee argued that the web has been tainted by misinformation, election interference, online harassment, in part thanks to the ad-funded business models pioneered by Google and Facebook. Berners-Lee called on the government to regulate for the digital age. Silicon Valley titans like to present their companies as more than mere services. </p><p>From Mark Zuckerberg's mantra of \"trying to make the world more open\" to Alphabet's \"Do the right thing\", the major US tech firms often bill their firms as ultimately serving humanity for the better. But the British engineer who invented the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee, has Silicon Valley in his sights and warned on the web's 30th anniversary of a \"downward plunge to a dysfunctional future.\" Speaking to the BBC[1], Berners-Lee took a direct shot at Facebook by highlighting the Cambridge Analytica scandal as an example of how the web has gone wrong. He criticised the use of people's information for nefarious purposes, like trying to influence elections. Read more: Facebook has a big, terrifying dream to be the communication backbone for the Western world[2] \"Everyone realized that elections had been manipulated using data they had contributed,\" he told the BBC. \"This person got all this data, and he got it under the pretext that he was going to use it for research purposes and he actually used it to manipulate an election.\" It isn't clear exactly who Berners-Lee is referring to here, but the most obvious person is Aleksandr Kogan, the data scientist who harvested information on millions of people[3] through a Facebook quiz app, then handed it to political consultancy Cambridge Analytica. That information was then used to inform targeted ads relating to the 2016 US presidential election. Berners-Lee added: \"I think with a mid-course correction... [we can] stop this downward plunge towards a very dysfunctional future, let's turn around. With a turnaround, a mid-course correction, I am then optimistic again.\" In an open letter[4] marking the web's 30th anniversary, Berners-Lee also criticised ad-funded services that promote \"clickbait and the viral spread of information.\"Both Facebook and Google have come under fire for algorithmically promoting content based on \"engagement\", a system which can end up favouring polarising, emotive, and often inaccurate material. The two firms also dominate online advertising, commanding 58% of the market between them, according to eMarketer[5]. Berners-Lee likewise called out \"state-sponsored hacking\" and online harassment, as well as the poor quality of online discussion. \"[While] the web has created opportunity, given marginalised groups a voice, and made our daily lives easier, it has also created opportunity for scammers, given a voice to those who spread hatred, and made all kinds of crime easier to commit,\" he wrote in the letter. He called on governments to make sure the web remains \"competitive\" through regulation, and to ensure companies don't prioritise short-term profits over the long-term good. Berners-Lee has already persuaded Facebook and Google to sign up to his proposed solution[6]: A code of ethics that binds private companies, governments, and citizens to work for a better web. Published last November, the \"contract\" asks people to commit to a free web, and to respect the right to privacy, among other principles.NOW WATCH: Amazon will pay $0 in federal taxes this year

Noun: The principle that Internet service providers (ISPs) should enable access to all content and applications regardless of the source, and without favoring or blocking particular products or websites.Your ISP, under regulations killed yesterday by Mr. Pai, previously could not, for example, decide to slow down the streaming of a Netflix movie because they want more money from Netflix for the service. Now your ISP can do anything it wants, because it's about to be the Wild West in streaming services and other Internet products.After Ajit Pai's action yesterday, your ISP can decide to charge you more for certain services, like access to Facebook or Google or Amazon. An ISP can decide to create tiers of service, so that your lowest-cost, most basic access might give you Fox News and Breitbart but little else. For a higher tier of service, like for the New York Times and the Washington Post and HuffPost, you would have to pay much more. Instead of a flat service rate, you can expect accelerating fees. Otherwise, why would Verizon and Charter and other ISPs be so ecstatic about their boy, Ajit Pai?Who Is Ajit Pai He's a free marketeer lawyer who Trump appointed to head the FCC and who used to work for -- who else? -- Verizon. As a free market true believer, he wants to unleash the big boys to make all the profit the market will bear. Sure, some \"little people\" will get hurt, but that's the price you pay for freedom!Can This Be Stopped? It will take weeks for the repeal to go into effect, so we consumers won't see changes right away. But the political and legal fight started immediately. Numerous Democrats on Capitol Hill called for a bill that would reestablish the rules that Ajit Pai just killed, but do we expect a Republican-dominated Congress to go against the big telecoms? Not bloody likely, even though plenty of Republicans have given lip service to net neutrality. Several Democratic state attorneys general, including Eric T. Schneiderman of New York, said they would file a suit to stop the change.\u00a0Several public interest groups including Public Knowledge and the National Hispanic Media Coalition also promised to file a suit. The Internet Association, the trade group that represents big tech firms such as Google and Facebook, said it also was considering legal action. In the meantime, you should be asking Virginia Foxx where she stands on net neutrality. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-WTGA1143551513371695374251764500119</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WTGA-114355</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R65-NJ01-JCMN-Y245-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"511\"/><timeReceived>9:01 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Watauga Watch</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"12\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>December 15, 2017 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001XGP</classCode><className>VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Noun: The principle that Internet service providers (ISPs) should enable access to all content and applications regardless of the source, and without favoring or blocking particular products or websites.Your ISP, under regulations killed yesterday by Mr. Pai, previously could not, for example, decide to slow down the streaming of a Netflix movie because they want more money from Netflix for the service. Now your ISP can do anything it wants, because it's about to be the Wild West in streaming services and other Internet products.After Ajit Pai's action yesterday, your ISP can decide to charge you more for certain services, like access to Facebook or Google or Amazon. An ISP can decide to create tiers of service, so that your lowest-cost, most basic access might give you Fox News and Breitbart but little else. For a higher tier of service, like for the New York Times and the Washington Post and HuffPost, you would have to pay much more. Instead of a flat service rate, you can expect accelerating fees. Otherwise, why would Verizon and Charter and other ISPs be so ecstatic about their boy, Ajit Pai?Who Is Ajit Pai He's a free marketeer lawyer who Trump appointed to head the FCC and who used to work for -- who else? -- Verizon. As a free market true believer, he wants to unleash the big boys to make all the profit the market will bear. Sure, some \"little people\" will get hurt, but that's the price you pay for freedom!Can This Be Stopped? It will take weeks for the repeal to go into effect, so we consumers won't see changes right away. But the political and legal fight started immediately. Numerous Democrats on Capitol Hill called for a bill that would reestablish the rules that Ajit Pai just killed, but do we expect a Republican-dominated Congress to go against the big telecoms? Not bloody likely, even though plenty of Republicans have given lip service to net neutrality. Several Democratic state attorneys general, including Eric T. Schneiderman of New York, said they would file a suit to stop the change.\u00a0Several public interest groups including Public Knowledge and the National Hispanic Media Coalition also promised to file a suit. The Internet Association, the trade group that represents big tech firms such as Google and Facebook, said it also was considering legal action. In the meantime, you should be asking Virginia Foxx where she stands on net neutrality. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SCNBLG-WTGA1143551513371695374251764500119</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WTGA-114355</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R65-MCD1-JB4V-827W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401995</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"509\"/><timeReceived>9:01 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>State Capital Newsfeed <br/>Watauga Watch( North Carolina)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"12\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>December 15, 2017 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001XGP</classCode><className>VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>VZC (LSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>VZ (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NFLX (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Ajit Pai</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>net neutrality</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

As head of the Board of Supervisors, he has championed the use of technology to streamline communications and cut costs at City Hall.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Chiu was also one of the first movers behind the so-called Twitter tax break, granting a temporary payroll tax exemption for fast growing companies moving into the Mid-Market area. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Several big names in tech have endorsed or contributed to his campaign, including LinkedIn co-founder <person><nameText>Reid Hoffman </nameText></person>and Yelp Chief Executive Jeremy Stoppleman. </p><p>Still, the big tech money appears to be lining up behind Mayor Ed Lee, the incumbent and front-runner. Prominent angel investor <person><nameText>Ron Conway </nameText></person>set up an independent political action committee that's free to raise unlimited amounts in support of Lee. Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff was among the early contributors.</p><p>In the interview that follows, the third in a series with mayoral candidates on tech issues, Chiu demonstrates a firm grasp of the nitty-gritty details of the city's technological infrastructure, particularly its considerable shortcomings. Unlike previous candidates, he didn't seem stumped by questions about the city's high-speed fiber Internet lines City Attorney Dennis Herrera and didn't refer to the Internet Explorer browser as \"the Microsoft version\" Lee.</p><p>Instead, Chiu lays out clear and specific plans to transform city systems \"stuck in 1999\" into what he calls a \"21st century government.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Q:</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">How would you grade the city's use of technology so far? </emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A:</emphasis> How about a D-plus? There is so much of our city's technology infrastructure that is stuck in 1999, from the IBM Lotus Notes e-mail system I use at the Board of Supervisors to the seven disparate systems that 26,000 city workers use, to the close to 40 data centers that the city government has when we should have two.</p><p> These disparate systems have real life consequences. </p><p>In 2000, there was a Filipina woman, Claire Joyce Tempongko, who was killed by her ex-boyfriend. All the law enforcement agencies knew she was being beaten and each had data that, together, clearly indicated that her life was at significant risk. </p><p>In the aftermath of her death, city leaders came together and swore they'd bring together communications systems across law enforcement. It was supposed to cost a couple million dollars and take a few years. Eleven years and $23 million later, we still don't have an answer to how much it will cost or when it will be available.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Q:</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">How would your administration better harness technology, be it social media or other tools, to more efficiently interact with citizens?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A:</emphasis> I want to be known as <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">the </emphasis>technology mayor, on a whole slew of fronts. </p><p>There are so many social media tools we can use better. Folks should be able to walk down the street, take a picture with their cell phone of the pothole, the broken light, the graffiti and send it to a city department and get an immediate response. </p><p>I would support city-sponsored hackathons an event in which programmers come together to tackle problems in short, intensive sessions. We can bring creative people from the technology world and other fields to come work with city staff to brainstorm solutions to the city's problems: How do you make Muni faster? How do you make buildings more green? </p><p>I've also been the advocate for licensing dark fiber the unused high-speed Internet cables controlled by the city. We have 110 miles of fiber under our city streets and only about 10 percent of it is being used for city purposes. We should utilize the other 90 percent. There is huge demand for high-speed Internet from our schools, health care and the San Francisco public. </p><p>We have to build a 21st century government.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Q:</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Stats show that technology is creating the greatest number of jobs in San Francisco right now. What would you do to propel that trend?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A:</emphasis> I am absolutely committed to making sure that we don't become a bedroom community for Silicon Valley and that we nurture our technology industry here in San Francisco. </p><p>In recent years, we have become a city where great ideas are born. But as those ideas turn into small- and then medium-sized businesses, we lose hundreds of those companies as they travel down 101 to Silicon Valley. </p><p>There are a variety of things we need to do. One I've been championing is comprehensive business tax reform. This is why I was the lead advocate for the legislation that is keeping Twitter and other 21st century companies in the Mid-Market area. </p><p>This is why I helped pass the legislation to keep companies like Zynga, Yelp and other startups here in San Francisco by ensuring that they were not in the only city in the country where their stock options would be taxed.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Q:</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Every candidate I've talked to is proposing comprehensive business tax reform, but it really sounds like what we mean are tax cuts. Unless that reform asks other companies to pay more, won't all of this just ultimately lower the amount coming into the city?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A:</emphasis> I'll say a couple of things. Independent economic analysis around the Mid-Market payroll tax legislation showed that if we had not moved forward with that and allowed Twitter to move to Brisbane, we would have lost $500,000 in tax revenue each year. </p><p>Instead, we've kept Twitter and created a halo effect that's attracting other companies around this tech hub. It's projected to be a revenue winner. </p><p>Point two is that city economists say that there are alternatives to the current payroll tax that could allow us to slightly reduce the tax burden while stimulating the economy in such a way that you have at least the same amount of tax revenue overall.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Q:</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Let's go back to the dark fiber issue. I know that's an area you've looked at closely. What do you hope to accomplish there and why is that important for the city?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A:</emphasis> Both for revenue and the chance for the city to push ahead data speeds here, we should invest in this incredibly underutilized asset. There's an opportunity for us to provide or lease that fiber to private parties as well as to the health care and educational institutions that require high bandwidth. </p><p>We also have to make it easier for the city to expand the fiber network, to lay down more fiber and get fiber straight to homes. </p><p>Every time the city and county digs up a street to deal with other needs, we should be laying down fiber. It's incredibly cheap once you've dug up a road. But we are not taking advantage of those opportunities. There are mazes of bureaucracies and regulations in place that kill that.</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PC or Mac? </emphasis>PC and a relatively unused iPad</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Smart phone: </emphasis>BlackBerry</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Internet browser: </emphasis>Firefox</p></bodyText></listItem></list></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>David Chiu says that San Francisco isn't close to fulfilling its potential in use of technology.

David Cicilline, D-R.I., the subcommittee's chairman, said at the start of the hearing. </p><p>The investigation is long overdue, he said, and Congress must determine whether the antitrust laws 'are equipped for the competition problems of our modern economy.'</p><p>Cicilline noted the steep layoffs in the news industry in recent years, saying the dominant position of the online platforms in the advertising market has created 'an economic catastrophe for news publishers, forcing them to cut back on their investments in quality journalism.' </p><p>At the same time, he said, tech platforms that are gateways to news online 'have operated with virtual immunity from the antitrust laws.'</p><p>As a partial solution, Cicilline proposed legislation to establish an antitrust exemption that would allow news companies to band together to negotiate revenue rates with big tech platforms. </p><p>He called it 'a life support measure, not the remedy for long-term health' of the news business.</p><p>The senior Republican on the full committee, Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, said he backs Cicilline's proposal. </p><p>Addressing the broader question of antitrust, however, he said, 'Big is not necessarily bad,' adding that lawmakers need to proceed cautiously.</p><p>The head of an association that represents technology and telecom companies said the government scrutiny of successful companies is appropriate. </p><p>However, an antitrust exemption for the news industry wouldn't solve the problem, said Matt Schruer, vice president of the Computer and Communications Industry Association.</p><p>Before the internet, 'news publishers received an exemption to deal with previous competitors like radio and TV news (and they) have not worked,' Schruer said. </p><p>'The results were fewer choices for readers and less competition among news outlets.'</p><p>But David Chavern, president of the News Media Alliance representing some 2,000 news organizations of all sizes and types, called an antitrust exemption 'the lightest-touch option on the table.'</p><p>'There's a real urgency in the industry. We're at crisis point now,' Chavern said.</p><p>Stepping ahead of the criticism, Google's vice president of news Richard Gringas said the company has 'worked for many years to be a collaborative and supportive technology and advertising partner to the news industry.'</p><p>'Every month, Google News and Google Search drive over 10 billion clicks to publishers' websites, which drive subscriptions and significant ad revenue,' he said in a statement Tuesday.</p><p>In a Capitol steeped in partisanship, inflamed by special counsel Robert Mueller's report and Democrats' intensifying probes of President Donald Trump, Congress' new investigation of tech market power stands out. </p><p>Not only is it bipartisan, but it's also the first such review by Congress of a sector that for more than a decade has enjoyed haloed status and a light touch from federal regulators.</p><p>With regulators at the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission apparently pursuing antitrust investigations of Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon, and several state attorneys general exploring bipartisan action of their own, the tech industry finds itself in a precarious moment - with the dreaded M-word increasingly used to describe their way of doing business. </p><p>Cicilline has flatly called them monopolies. </p><p>The Justice Department's antitrust chief suggested in a speech Tuesday that he may take a broad view of harm to competition, and take into account quality factors such as the threat to privacy, not only whether a company's dominant market position results in higher prices.</p><p>'Price effects alone do not provide a complete picture of market dynamics, especially in digital markets in which the profit-maximizing price is zero,' Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim said, according to a transcript of his speech in Tel Aviv, Israel, provided by the department.</p><p>Politicians on the left and right have differing gripes about the tech giants. </p><p>Some complain of aggressive conduct that squashes competition. Others perceive a political bias or tolerance of extremist content. </p><p>Still others are upset by the industry's harvesting of personal data.</p><p>Several Democratic presidential candidates think they have the solution: breaking up the companies on antitrust grounds. </p><p>Cicilline has called that 'a last resort,' but the idea has currency with both major political parties, including at the White House.</p><p>Trump noted the huge fines imposed by European regulators on the biggest tech companies.</p><p>'We are going to be looking at them differently,' he said in an interview Monday on CNBC.</p><p>'We should be doing what (the Europeans) are doing,' Trump said. 'Obviously, there is something going on in terms of monopoly.'</p><p>The tech giants have mostly declined to comment on the antitrust investigations.</p><p>Google has said that scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators 'often improves our products and the policies that govern them,' and that in some areas, such as data protection, laws need to be updated.</p><p>Facebook executives have been calling broadly for regulation while explicitly rejecting the idea of breaking up 'a successful American company.' </p><p>CEO Mark Zuckerberg has called for new rules in four areas: harmful content, election integrity, privacy and data portability.</p><p>When Democratic presidential contender Sen. Elizabeth Warren tweeted in April that tech giants like Amazon should be broken up, Amazon tweeted back, 'Walmart is much larger.'</p><p>And Apple has countered a legal challenge to its management of the App Store by saying it 'will prevail when the facts are presented and the App Store is not a monopoly by any metric.'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAILON-53601560</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAILON2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W9Y-MPC1-JCJY-G1HS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397135</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1166\"/><timeReceived>5:13 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

During the talk, he read social media hate speech about himself. He suggested that tech companies should face fines if they don't remove hate speech quickly. </p><p>London Mayor Sadiq Khan made a moving plea[1] for tech companies to take on hate speech at the annual SXSW conference[2] in Austin, Texas, on Monday. During his talk, the mayor read racist tweets about himself. \"I say kill the mayor of London and you'll be rid of one Muslim terrorist,\" Khan read aloud. \"I'd pay for someone to execute Sadiq Kahn.\" Khan, the first Muslim mayor of a Western capital city, said he read the half a dozen tweets or so not to \"be portrayed as a victim\" or \"ask for sympathy, but to illustrate that big tech has further to go in making the internet free of hate speech. \"But ask yourself this, what happens when young boys and girls from minority backgrounds see this kind of thing on their timelines or experience this themselves?\" Kahn said. Kahn warned that tweets like the ones addressed to him send a message to minority children that if they don't look a certain way or subscribe to the same establishment beliefs, they will grow up thinking there's no path for them in high-profile careers. \"We simply must do more to protect people online,\" Kahn said. Kahn urged companies like Facebook and Twitter to show \"a stronger duty of care,\" so that \"social media platforms can live up to their promises to connect, unify, and democratize the sharing of information and be places where everyone feels welcomed and valued.\" The London mayor offered a few recommendations. He suggested that Facebook and Twitter remove offensive content and misinformation faster. If they don't, he said, they should face fines. Germany began enforcing a new rule in January that gives social media platforms just 24 hours to decide if something is hate speech. German police are investigating far-right politician Beatrix von Storch[3] after she described Muslims as \"barbarians\" on Facebook and Twitter. Kahn said he expects Londoners to pressure their representatives to create a similar rule. \"This isn't about depriving people of free speech \u2014 this is about inciting hatred,\" Kahn said. \"This is about things that divide our community.\"NOW WATCH: I quit social media for a month \u2014 and it was the best choice I've ever made[4]See Also: HBO's 'Westworld' experience at SXSW teased a theory

It's a campaign not merely of ideas but of detailed policy proposals dealing with a host of ills that other politicians have ignored or tried to wish away. Yet <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Washington Post</emphasis> compared her plans to the silly \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/elizabeth-warren-bets-that-slew-of-policy-ideas-will-win-over-trump-weary-voters/2019/04/07/24a78926-4509-11e9-8aab-95b8d80a1e4f_story.html?utm_term=.7f0bc11bfdd4\">booklet of policy ideas</url>\" issued by Jeb Bush before he flamed out in the 2016 Republican presidential race. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Politico,</emphasis> for some reason, thought it worthwhile to get Steve Bannon's views. (\"You're not going to beat Trump with policies,\"       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2019/04/11/assange-arrested-in-london-as-mueller-report-looms-423575\">Bannon said</url>.) And <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">New York Times</emphasis> columnist Bret Stephens actually called this meticulously prepared and intellectually challenging thinker a \"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/20/opinion/elizabeth-warren-trump.html\">Trumpian of the Left</url>.\"</p><p>In reality, her proposals address many of the phenomena undermining the nation's republican values and commitment to equal opportunity. All appear to be based on consultations with progressive activists cognizant of the politics, as well as policy experts hip to the technical complexities. Without exception, her plans are bold, and in many cases they're truly visionary. As with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/19/politics/elizabeth-warren-donald-trump-impeachment-proceedings/index.html\">her call for Trump's impeachment</url>, made after she read Robert Mueller's report from cover to cover, their successful implementation would require a sea change in the way politics is conducted in this country. But unlike every other candidate in the race-or in recent US history-Warren is providing a detailed road map for where she wants to take the country. With plans like her proposal to eliminate most college debt, she is revealing the values and commitments that she hopes will take the United States to what Robert Kennedy called \"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.amazon.com/Seek-Newer-World-Robert-Kennedy/dp/4871877841\">a newer world</url>.\"</p><p>I am competent to judge the efficacy of just a handful of her plans. And with our sclerotic political system and the influence that the super-rich enjoy in it, I have my doubts about one day seeing, say, a 2\u00a0percent wealth tax on households with a net worth of $50 million to $1 billion and an additional 1 percent tax on net worth above $1 billion. I don't know how you reduce the <url normalizedValue=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/03/10/pentagon-eyes-windfall-as-trump-seeks-750-billion-defense-budget-military/\">Pentagon's budget</url> when its spending is spread across so many congressional districts and when so many defense contractors put money in the pockets of so many members of Congress. And I'd be amazed to see those members forbid themselves to own stocks or       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/the-revolving-door-why-politicians-become-lobbyists-and-lobbyists-become-politicians-64237\">exploit lobbying opportunities</url> after they leave office. But is Warren's       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/elizabeth-warren-its-time-to-let-the-government-manufacture-generic-drugs/2018/12/17/66bc0fb0-023f-11e9-b5df-5d3874f1ac36_story.html?utm_term=.1187cc7d3a7b\">proposal</url> for the federal manufacture of generic drugs the right one? Is her       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/elizabeth-warrens-fight-against-payday-lenders-comes-to-the-post-office/\">plan</url> for postal banking ideal, given all the options? I couldn't say. My guess, though, is that they are. She gives every evidence of having done her homework.</p><p>The proposals I can judge, however, are mighty impressive. My favorite is her plan to break up the big tech companies-specifically, Google, Amazon, and Facebook-which she laid out in a <url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/@teamwarren/heres-how-we-can-break-up-big-tech-9ad9e0da324c\">1,700-word article on Medium</url>. She defines the problem as follows: \"Today's big tech companies have too much power...over our economy, our society, and our democracy. They've bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else. And in the process, they have hurt small businesses and stifled innovation.\" She notes that \"weak antitrust enforcement has led to a dramatic reduction in competition and innovation in the tech sector\" and that these companies don't have to worry about protecting people's privacy or policing the lies and incitements to violence that appear so frequently on their sites. What's more, they tend to \"bully cities and states into showering them with massive taxpayer handouts in exchange for doing business, and can act, in the words of Mark Zuckerberg, '      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/19/facebooks-war-on-free-will\">more like a government than a traditional company</url>.'\" In calling for the breakup of these companies, Warren says it would be in keeping with America's long trust-busting tradition, especially during the previous Gilded Age.</p><p>She proposes legislation to forbid what she calls massive \"platform utilities\"-those with annual global revenue over $25 billion-from owning any participant on their respective platforms. They would also be prohibited from discriminating against users or <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-46618582\">sharing or transferring data with third parties</url>. Smaller companies would have to meet the same \"standard of fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory dealing with users\" but would not need to be split apart from the participant assets they own. And to make sure this got done, she would empower federal regulators, state attorneys general, and injured private parties to sue any platform utility found to be in violation. It could also cost them a fine of 5 percent of annual revenue.</p><p>In addition, Warren says her administration would reverse the \"illegal and anti-competitive tech mergers\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pcmag.com/feature/363939/the-biggest-tech-mergers-and-acquisitions-of-all-time/\">allowed under Trump and previous administrations</url> in order to \"help America's content creators\u200a-\u200afrom local newspapers and national magazines to comedians and musicians\u200a-\u200akeep more of the value their content generates, rather than seeing it scooped up by companies like Google and Facebook.\"</p><p>One cannot say for certain whether her ideas about tech monopolies will be the best ones put forward by a candidate, since in most cases, they are currently the only ones to have been put forward by a candidate. The problem may be that her competitors are afraid to take on the very corporations that enable them to communicate with voters-and can therefore punish them for it. Or it may be that the other candidates feel that the media tend to focus exclusively on personality, horse-race-style measurements like fund-raising and early, largely <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/09/why-2016-election-polls-missed-their-mark/\">meaningless poll results</url>, and that elusive phantom of likability.</p><p>Fine. How candidates want to run their campaigns is their business. But at the very least, it should be the press's business to ask them to respond to Warren's policies and proposals. Add that to the list of the media's failures to ensure that this time, voters are able to make informed decisions about who and what they're getting when they pull the lever to take back our country and restore our republic.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NATMAG-312052</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NATMAG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W0N-FGV1-JB81-B465-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">465017</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1020\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Nation Company, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Nation Magazine</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"7718\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>Apr 29, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000246</classCode><className>CAMPAIGNS &amp;

It was a reference to debate co-sponsor PBS NewsHour, and the abject horror that the moderators saw fit to focus on substantive policy issues rather than convening political food fights.But even for the SnoozeHour, one subject remained too obscure or boring to handle: Wall Street. There has not been a single question about financial policy in the first six debates this year. Wall Street has been mentioned only glancingly, in brief moments. </p><p>Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have occasionally sought the opportunity to vow to take on Big Finance; Sanders has mentioned his financial transactions tax to pay for tuition-free college; Wall Street executives have been name-checked as a reason not to hold high-dollar fundraisers. But actually seeking insight on how the candidates would handle Wall Street speculation, bank size, risk management, or the financialization of our economy? No debate moderator has yet tried.Tech titans and healthcare executives have surpassed banksters as the chief corporate villains for Democratic audiences. But any inference that Wall Street no longer plays a role in our unequal economy would be a perilous miscalculation. Financial engineering still dominates even the non-financial business world, creeping into sector after sector. The Wall Street blackout in the primary does a disservice to those candidates with the most appealing views on financial regulation. It also courts disaster by giving cover to the most important broken piece of our economic machinery. Worst of all, it shows how establishment and media bias really works.AS RECENTLY as 2016, Wall Street was one of the two main issues[1] at the heart of the primary debate (the other was healthcare). Sanders and Hillary Clinton diverged on the issue, making it useful for debate presenters to draw contrasts. But for those who claim that this has been the most policy-heavy presidential primary in memory, the one before this one featured detailed[2] disquisitions[3] about reducing volatility in the shadow banking sector, separating investment and commercial banking with a firewall, placing risk fees on the largest institutions, and other allegedly arcane subjects. Financial reform was more prominent in the 2016 primary than in 2008, which is interesting given how the world was melting down at the time. But even then, candidates needed to spell out some facsimile of a Wall Street policy.What's doubly frustrating about the silence on Wall Street in 2020, relative to the cacophony in 2016, is that the financial sector has grown more dangerous in the intervening four years, thanks to Trump and his allies.An ill-advised bipartisan deregulation law[4] has reduced supervisory rules on large regional banks, and triggered a chain reaction[5] of bank consolidation that is crushing the community banks[6] the measure was intended to help. Regulators have employed the deregulation law to roll back capital and liquidity requirements[7] for all but the very biggest banks, and reduce the frequency of stress tests and living wills, the roadmaps banks are supposed to update routinely to explain how they could be unwound in a crisis.The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has been idled under new leadership, putting millions at risk of being cheated by financial operators without a watchdog looking out for them. The SEC has also effectively stopped[8] enforcing the law, with significant drops in penalties and enforcement actions. Meanwhile, the agency will soon allow financiers to swindle more smalltime investors[9] with private offerings of shares in risky start-ups. An overhaul of the Volcker rule[10] enables investment banks to trade once more on their own accounts; an overhaul of the Community Reinvestment Act[11] enables commercial banks to ignore low- and middle- income communities, and even to classify the financing of downtown sports stadiums[12] as assisting the poor.In short, every single corner of the financial industry, from derivatives traders[13] to payday lenders[14], from financial advisors[15] to fintech firms[16], has seen major boosts to their bottom lines from Trump-era deregulation. And that translates into more risk for financial consumers, ordinary depositors, and the broader economy.It also bleeds into so many prominent issues in the nomination race. Financial stability is deeply threatened by climate change[17]. Access to financing keeps private prison operators alive[18]. Private equity firms have started to buy up hospitals and close them[19] for the real estate. The racial wealth gap has much to do with the obliteration of families of color's home equity[20] during the housing bubble collapse. The owner of the infamous wine cave was a real estate tycoon bailed out by the government[21] on his failed savings and loan.The financial industry may have been overshadowed by Big Tech in recent years but remains at the heart of the question of whom the economy works for. You would assume this would merit the attention of the candidates vying to replace Trump as president.IT HAS, at least for some. Elizabeth Warren, godmother of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, has introduced[22] plans[23], several of them before announcing her candidacy, that would restore the Glass-Steagall Act, which separated investment and commercial banking; enforce white-collar fraud laws and hold individuals accountable for wrongdoing, and upend the predatory private equity industry[24]. It's part of Warren's larger preoccupation of reorienting the Democratic Party's philosophy and advisors[25] away from Wall Street and toward the public interest. And Sanders has a pre-existing set[26] of Wall Street reform priorities from his 2016 campaign, including a public option for simple bank accounts[27] at the post office and a 15 percent usury cap on all consumer loans.These plans deserve to be debated. The public should understand whether, for example, private equity could get around rules putting them on the hook for the debts of the companies they purchase, or whether postal banks should offer loans in addition to savings accounts. There's a mediagenic fight to be had on this issue, between Warren and Sanders on one end, and Joe Biden, a guardian of the banking industry[28] when serving in the Senate, on the other. You even have a built-in point of conflict, with Warren and Biden's long-standing battle[29] on bankruptcy laws. And it would be good to know the views of former hedge fund manager Tom Steyer, billionaire financial executive Mike Bloomberg, and recipients of Wall Street cash like Pete Buttigieg (and to a lesser extent Cory Booker).So far, however, the media remains mute. Maybe they've moved on from the financial crisis; maybe they don't want to research the issues. Whatever the reason, their decision to avoid Wall Street issues neglects an entire field of presidential policymaking that, as Graham Steele correctly argued in the Prospect[30], could be put into place without any new laws.This blackout isn't fair to candidates with developed viewpoints, and a free gift to those with unpopular or unformed ones. When Julin Castro, who progressives have generally praised throughout the primary, took a question[31] at a candidate forum from a laid-off Toys 'R' Us worker about the private equity barons who destroyed her employer, he literally had no understanding of the issue. It was embarrassing and disqualifying, and we should know who else in the field fails to fundamentally grasp the rise of private equity, its systemic extraction of resources from the corporations it controls, and the economic devastation it inflicts millions of workers.If a rare moment of mass media attention to policy leaves out something as crucial as the role of the financial sector, there's no hope that the broader public will learn anything about how our economy actually works. This subsequently serves as a shield for financial malfeasance, an allowance for predators to spend the next couple years robbing people without scrutiny. If Wall Street isn't present in a presidential primary, it simply won't be present in the media at all, which risks a replay of the crash.The easiest way to ensure that nothing will fundamentally change, as Joe Biden famously told donors in June[32], is to narrow the presentation for the voting public of what's even possible. When we hear about media bias, it's usually about one outlet favoring one poll over another, or forgetting to add one candidate's name in a story. But leaving finance out of the picture reflects the deepest and most dangerous bias. It frees Wall Street-friendly Democrats like Biden from having to answer for their actions. It muddles the choice for voters.For an entire presidential primary, the greatest driver of inequality and economic risk has remained invisible to voters. The establishment thanks the media for their service.

WIn the presidential corner, Trump's regular attacks on the \"fake news media\" have provoked a robust response. This summer, newspapers coordinated a string of editorials defending the essential role of the press as a lens on power and a positive force in a democratic society. In tech news, Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg was lambasted last month for reportedly commenting that he doesn't care about publishers (you know, the ones Facebook is eating). Facebook has denied the claim, but the firm's rampant cannibalisation of the media, large and small publishers alike, would suggest otherwise.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Of the two sides, Trump has received the biggest outcry from the press, facing accusations of censorship, fascism, and more. But big tech's quieter danger to media is arguably far more serious.</p><p>After all, Trump's \"fake news\" rally cries and tweets about the \"failing New York Times\" ironically continue to boost sales of traditional publications. The opposite can be said of big tech.</p><p>From advertising power to the ability to set public narratives and dodge accountability, Silicon Valley is a threat to journalism.</p><p>Facebook and Google are rapidly supplanting the press and wielding power which in many ways now transcends not just media, but governance itself, as the fumbled and inconsequential congressional questioning of Zuckerberg in April showed. Zuckerberg ran rings around America's congressmen, who, it transpired, lacked both the technological understanding and the regulatory mechanisms to hold his firm to account.</p><p>The Google and Facebook duopoly currently controls the way we receive news. According to the Pew Research Center, 67 per cent of Americans now get at least some of their news from social media platforms, while 45 per cent cite Facebook specifically.</p><p>Facebook alone generates more ad dollars than all of America's newspapers, while Google has twice the ad revenues of Facebook. Together, these two companies control six out of 10 new dollars spent on digital advertising.</p><p>And tech's dominance in the news cycle is growing by the day. Facebook is launching its own news service, and Apple is rumoured to be interested in buying Conde Nast, while Amazon is also shaping up as a rapidly growing digital advertising entity. Instagram and YouTube have both launched long-form entertainment shows - will news be next? With little regulation and business models that transcend national borders, the potential for distorting influence on public attitudes is real - and it's getting bigger.</p><p>And it's not just the companies - it's tech leaders themselves. Paypal co-founder and tech heavyweight Peter Thiel has already been able to close down a media organisation he disliked (Gawker) by throwing his vast funds behind an arguably unrelated lawsuit.</p><p>Could Tesla's Elon Musk, who is regularly in aggressive Twitter spats with individual journalists, be next? Or even Zuckerberg? Big tech brands present themselves as the very antithesis of the US President - indeed, many have personally spoken out against Trump's policies. But delve beyond Silicon Valley's ukulele-accompanied promo videos, \"likes\", and rainbow flags, and you'll find a host of characters just as thin-skinned, controlling, and opaque as Trump.</p><p>Like Trump, the Silicon Valley titans appear strikingly lacking in self-awareness and rely on sloganeering just as simplistic as \"make America great again\" to put forth their narratives. Think of Zuckerberg's relentless referrals to his Facebook empire as a \"community\", Airbnb's attachment to its tagline \"belonging\", and the vast majority of Musk's Twitter feed that has enabled him to become something of a cult figure.</p><p>Moreover, these companies continue to present themselves as underdogs. They promote the narrative that the now beleaguered traditional media brands remain dominant, when the current financial and cultural pressures on journalism are more real than ever - thanks primarily to the efforts of the Silicon Valley giants themselves.</p><p>Amazon chief Jeff Bezos stands distinct amid this trend, in being relatively open to the mainstream media. Not only did he buy the Washington Post in 2013, a paper which continues to win Pulitzers for its journalism, but he has also acknowledged the need for external scrutiny of Amazon.</p><p>\"I say, 'look, we are a large corporation. We deserve to be inspected. It's going to happen. Don't take it personally.'

But on this occasion, it's hard to avoid the conclusion that May is absolutely right.</p><p>Not that newsroom decisions are easy. Every day, journalists make snap choices under enormous pressure. It is easy to run a news desk as a spectator, but much harder when major events are breaking. The advent of alternative sources of news, notably via social media platforms, has complicated matters further, as journalists consider what details to exclude from their own coverage, even though they are widely available elsewhere.</p><p>But then, it has always been thus - only the scale and the sense of immediacy has change. Likewise, it has been the case for a long time that many of those who commit terrorist atrocities in the name of some sort of \"cause\" have a very clear idea of the narrative they want to create - and to see distributed.</p><p>A few years ago, this would be evident in the video recordings made by Islamist suicide bombers before they carried out their attacks. In the case of Anders Breivik, who killed 77 people in 2011, it was a lengthy manifesto which sought to justify his murders. The same was true of Ted Kaczynski, the \"Unabomber\", whose bombing campaign in the US lasted nearly 20 years.</p><p>Now, however, terrorists have the ability - thanks to technological \"advances\" - to film their crimes as they happen, streaming them in real time to audiences around the world. In the case of the Christchurch attacks, video and online manifesto were in circulation even before the horror had ended.</p><p>Still, the whole point of journalism is to be the filter; to analyse and bring order, clarity. That does not mean avoiding difficult issues, or preventing the world from knowing about appalling crimes, or the bleak realities of war. But it should mean we do not project or amplify precisely those narratives that killers and terrorists - or indeed any who seek to exercise power over others, violently or not - have formed for themselves.</p><p>By showing the video taken by Brenton Tarrant of his bloody assault - even if edited to exclude the worst elements - some parts of the media in this country and elsewhere have done precisely as he would have wished. A mass murder, presented through the murderer's eyes, like something from a computer game. By turns horrifying, glorifying and somehow sanitising the deaths of 49 innocent people.</p><p>The Mirror has acknowledged that it erred; perhaps others (including MailOnline and The Sun) will do the same in due course. Earlier, though, The Sun was happy to defend its position.</p><p>Of course, there are big questions to be asked of the major social media companies as well. It is partly via the platforms they provide that people are being radicalised, that hate is being fostered and that violent imagery and even murder is being circulated. This cannot be the price we accept for the internet's many virtues. No wonder the regulatory vultures are circling over the big tech firms. They must do better.</p><p>Nevertheless, failings by the likes of Facebook or YouTube cannot be an excuse for the media to avoid exercising proper ethical judgements. It should be abundantly clear that publishing footage taken by a terrorist as he embarks on a mass murder spree is the wrong thing to do: insensitive, gratuitous, unnecessary and likely to promote more violence.</p><p>It does not, despite protestations to the contrary, shed light - rather, it suggests we are prepared to succumb to the darkness.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INPDWB-INMLMMGLSTRY000031634414-ARTICLE-TEXT-1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDPNT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VN6-6S11-F072-43V5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"653\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Independent Print Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Independent - Daily Edition</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30262\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 16, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001905</classCode><className>JOURNALISM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001710</classCode><className>TERRORISM</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODg4MDhDQ0I2QkY5NDU2Rjg1RDNEREFBODk1Nzg1QTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RjgwNUY4MjJCMTg5NDgzRUJBMDQwNkM4NkUyNTJBMEY</classCode><className>Terrorism</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D0T5</classCode><className>TERRORIST ATTACKS</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDlBOEIwQjg0OTdFNEFDQUJCRkZBMEZCNTJDMTlEQTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODg4MDhDQ0I2QkY5NDU2Rjg1RDNEREFBODk1Nzg1QTY</classCode><className>Terroristic Acts</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000453</classCode><className>DEATH &amp;

Lack of accurate street addresses, a preference for face-to-face interactions, alon...</p><p>The coronavirus pandemic is just one factor accelerating the emergence of e-commerce in the Middle East.       The Middle East has had a complicated relationship with e-commerce. Lack of accurate street addresses, a preference for face-to-face interactions, alongside consumer preferences for cash on delivery \u2013   instead of credit cards or online-payment systems \u2013   have all contributed to a relatively slow adoption of e-commerce.   Recently this has begun to change . The $580m acquisition of Souq.com in 2017 by Amazon  \u2013 now rebranded as Amazon.ae \u2013   coupled with new platforms like Noon , and the growth of mobile wallets in Egypt, the region's biggest market, have played pivotal roles in this changing picture.    E-commerce's day of retail reckoning  As a result, US management consultancy Bain &amp; Co predicted in 2019 that: \"The retail industry in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) is on the verge of a pivotal shift.\"    SEE: Guide to Becoming a Digital Transformation Champion  (TechRepublic Premium)   \"E-commerce is becoming a reality,\" it wrote, \"reinventing consumers' path to purchase, forming new customer experiences, disrupting business models, and creating growth opportunities for large and small retailers as well as for a new generation of e-commerce pure players.\"   Noting that Middle East consumers, and particularly those in the Gulf states, are \"among the most connected and digitally savvy in the world,\" a  study from Bain &amp; Google identified  high levels of internet and smartphone take-up in UAE and Saudi Arabia, coupled with the eight hours 10 minutes a day that Egyptians spend online, as a strong basis for growth in the region's three biggest markets.    Firm foundations for e-commerce  Now, the coronavirus pandemic is helping to usher in a new era of e-commerce, accelerating trend lines that had already become apparent.       Efforts to grow e-commerce have included new laws and regulatory frameworks , moves to encourage e-commerce startups , as well as ongoing investment .    Ventures such as Kuwaiti beauty e-commerce startup  Boutiqaat , and specialist providers like the Dubai-based Sprii.com  \u2013   \"The #1 shopping destination providing everything for Mums in the Middle East \" \u2013   are just two businesses to have benefited from recent funding rounds.    Last-mile challenges, which have historically been an issue for fulfillment of e-commerce in the region, also appear to have been overcome.    MarkeetEx, an Omani online marketplace, offers delivery within two hours for  Muscat-based customers and a few days if you live elsewhere in the country.   Over in UAE, online fashion platform Namshi even promises that, \"If you are on a vacation in Dubai, staying in a Rove hotel and need to do online shopping; do not worry as Namshi is now delivering the orders within four hours at all the Rove Hotels.\" For everyone else, they promise next-day delivery in Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Sharjah \"for orders placed before 10am\".  COVID-19's catalytic effect  These elements, coupled with China's interest in the region , have driven further interest in the Middle East's e-commerce potential.    Since the pandemic began, ZON, which describes itself as \"the region's first fully decentralized mobile-only e-commerce network,\" raised $8m in seed funding , ahead of its launch later this year. Meanwhile, Mumzworld, an online baby shop, reported an 800% increase in activity  across some verticals.   Physical retailers, not wishing to be left behind, are also rapidly developing their online presence.   SME10X, a publication for smaller businesses, revealed how, \"Emaar Malls has partnered with Noon.com , to open The Dubai Mall virtual store that will support its retailers and the community to address the unprecedented challenges from the COVID-19 situation.\"    Historically, the mall, the biggest in the world, has been open 24/7 during Ramadan. This year, instead, customers can visit a virtual version on Noon.com, \"make their purchase choice online, and have the purchases delivered to their homes by noon across the UAE\".   Other retailers are following suit, with many launching their own portals.    SEE: How coronavirus has exposed Middle East's gaping digital divide   MG Motors announced plans to launch an e-commerce platform  for the region during Ramadan, a time of year that typically sees deals being offered on new vehicles, while the food and drink provider Fresh Del Monte launched an e-commerce store .    Before the COVID-19 outbreak, online groceries were already seen as an untapped market in the region. Wamda commented in 2019, that, \"The e-groceries market is currently worth $200m in the [Gulf states] and Egypt, accounting for less than 1% of the e-commerce market and so there is room for rapid growth.\"   That's begun to change as a result of the coronavirus. As Wamda notes , \"Food delivery platforms like Deliveroo, Otlob in Egypt and Careem NOW in Saudi Arabia [are] to start offering groceries on their platforms alongside their roster of meals from restaurants.\"   More traditional food retailers are also benefiting. BinDawood Holding \u2013 the Saudi retail company behind the Kingdom's BinDawood stores and Danube hypermarkets  \u2013   says average e-commerce sales on a 10-day basis had increased by 200%. Meanwhile, Logistics Middle East reported , \"its average order value rose by 50% and app installations by 400%.\"  Looking ahead at Middle East e-commerce  Whether the Middle East's e-commerce sector can maintain the momentum triggered by COVID-19 remains to be seen. After all, malls and markets are a key part of life for many people in the Middle East.   Moreover, as Racha Ghamlouch , chief aggregator at the Digital Digest , recently told ZDNet , many players in the region are investing heavily in retail tech. These efforts are designed to offer a more personalized, and perhaps enjoyable, in-person shopping experience.    As Ghamlouch observes, companies are exploring innovations such as robots, smart mirrors and AR apps; as well as analytic-based tech found in facial-recognition programs, and heat maps , which can track and improve store layout and flow.    The big question, then, is whether once restrictions are lifted, consumers will return to their previous habits, or if new online behaviors will have become more ingrained.    Certainly some are betting that this will be the case.    In March, Nana Direct , a Saudi online grocery app, raised $18m in series B funding , after seeing a rapid rise in usage, encouraging investors to back its potential expansion into other markets.    SEE: Middle East: Web-chat services unblocked but big tech projects take a hit in COVID crisis   As StepFeed's Leyal Khalife , explained , \"The app allows users to pick and choose groceries from different supermarkets or stores and have them delivered to their doorstep in one go.\"    It's likely that some customers \u2013   especially if they've had a positive experience using a technology forced on them due to shop closures and public-health concerns \u2013   will continue their online shopping habits. Having acquired a taste of e-commerce, these consumers may be more willing to do it permanently.    The continued rollout, and adoption, of 4G and 5G technologies across the region will also help, by speeding up the online process and unlocking a new series of apps and enhanced digital retail experiences.    If that's the case, Bain's prediction that e-commerce in the region would be worth $28.5bn a year by 2022 \u2013   up from $8.3bn in 2017 \u2013   with a penetration rate of 7% of total retail sales, may turn out to be an underestimate.    E-commerce's time in the Middle East may finally have come.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42864846990</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60MB-XDD1-F07F-839T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1324\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>ZDNet</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 18, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>CC00028PO</classCode><className>BAIN &amp;

El-Erian, Special to Gulf News</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There was a time when many regarded being in the middle of the distribution \u2014 socially, politically, and in the business world \u2014 as a favourable, stabilising, and desirable outcome.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">From the anchoring role in society of the middle-class to the agility and resilience of mid-size firms, the middle was seen as consistent with both individual and collective well-being. Yet, in recent years, the middle has become less stable, less predictable, and more elusive, and its primacy \u2014 in economics, politics, business, asset management, and even sports \u2014 has become increasingly unsustainable.</p><p>Driven by structural changes, as well as lagging business and policy responses, the middle has been eroded \u2014 or is at risk \u2014 almost everywhere you look. Should this trend continue \u2014 which is subject to some debate \u2014 the implications would be far-reaching.</p><p>For decades, a rising median household income in advanced economies anchored the growth of a middle-class that often opted for the political center. Together with stable and trusted institutions, the middle-class acted as a stabiliser for a more prosperous society.</p><p>In business, too, an environment in which mid-size firms flourished was viewed as desirable, because it reconciled small firms' lack of balance sheet strength with their larger counterparts' tendency to slip into oligopolistic complacency.</p><p>But median incomes have stagnated, which, combined with the impact of technology and insufficient policy attention to the potential distributional effects of unfettered globalisation, has gradually hollowed out the middle-class around the world. As a result, both the hope and reality of a satisfying middle-class life, with its potential for upward social mobility, are in decline.</p><p>In addition to weakening an important social stabilising force, the diminution of the middle-class has fuelled the politics of anger and undermined the political center, hitherto dominated by established parties. As polarisation and fragmentation have increased, bipartisan policies have become a lot more difficult to pursue.</p><p>This trend is also reflected in declining public trust in expert opinion and established institutions. And all this has supported the growth of more extreme political parties and/or anti-establishment movements.</p><p>The middle is also proving less friendly and stable for business. In sector after sector, mid-size companies face greater competition from small disrupters and/or their large counterparts. This includes the financial sector, where higher regulatory and compliance costs have eaten away at the sustainability of mid-size providers.</p><p>This is visible in the number of mergers among mid-size asset managers that lack a strong corporate parent.</p><p>Sports, too, is losing its middle. In the absence of forced equalisation mechanisms (such as those used in the US' National Football League), European soccer is now dominated by a handful of teams that have become business behemoths.</p><p>This last example also sheds light on important questions concerning what lies ahead. Is the erosion of the middle really inevitable? Are we in the midst of what economists call \"multiple equilibria\", in which one unfavourable shift makes another, even worse, shift more probable? Or will a mix of natural mean reversion and responsive policies restore the soundness and benefits of the center?</p><p>Given the rapid changes in technology and political disruptions, it is hard to know what lies ahead. But there seem to be enough indicators to suggest that, in certain areas, a strong middle can indeed be reclaimed if policies adapt quickly enough. That is probably the case when it comes to economic policies, where there is at last greater recognition of the importance of structural changes and distributional effects.</p><p>For example, economists are beginning to resist the inclination to rely on too many simplifying assumptions that facilitate modelling but are removed from reality. They are also beginning to redress the inadequate inclusion of financial linkages and insights from behavioural science, as well as over-emphasis on single equilibrium conditions.</p><p>And they are deepening their understanding of accelerating structural changes associated with technology, the impact of China and other emerging economies, and the politics of anger.</p><p>The more these changes feed into better policies, the greater the potential for political parties to present more compelling agendas, especially if they are presented by more engaging leaders.</p><p>The decline of the middle in business is also likely to result in some pushback, though the impact will differ significantly by industry and will be continuously challenged by structural headwinds. It is more likely to occur in some industries, such as big tech, where a regulatory response will probably be one outcome of a developing backlash, and less likely for asset management.</p><p>These developments have the potential to slow what, for now, has been a self-reinforcing migration away from the middle. But restoring faith in the feasibility and desirability of the middle \u2014 belief that the middle is strong enough to promote stability and prosperity \u2014 will take time, and sustained effort.</p><p>And that loss of faith, compounded by accelerating technological change and the fragmentation of international order, goes a long way toward explaining why the future seems less predictable, and why the average person feels more unsettled.</p><p>The writer is Chief Economic Adviser at Allianz and the author of \"The Only Game in Town: Central Banks, Instability, and Avoiding the Next Collapse\".</p><p>Project Syndicate</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GULNWS-114075814</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GULNWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S2X-XWD1-F11P-X11C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">338760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"947\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Gulf News - Al Nisr Publishing LLC.

His focus was more prosaic. A computational neuroscientist at the University of California, Berkeley, Dr. Gallant worked for years to improve our understanding of how brains encode information -- what regions become active, for example, when a person sees a plane or an apple or a dog -- and how that activity represents the object being viewed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">By the late 2000s, scientists could determine what kind of thing a person might be looking at from the way the brain lit up -- a human face, say, or a cat. But Dr. Gallant and his colleagues went further. They figured out how to use machine learning to decipher not just the class of thing, but which exact image a subject was viewing. (Which photo of a cat, out of three options, for instance.) </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  One day, Dr. Gallant and his postdocs got to talking. In the same way that you can turn a speaker into a microphone by hooking it up backward, they wondered if they could reverse engineer the algorithm they'd developed so they could visualize, solely from brain activity, what a person was seeing.</p><p>  The first phase of the project was to train the AI. For hours, Dr. Gallant and his colleagues showed volunteers in fMRI machines movie clips. By matching patterns of brain activation prompted by the moving images, the AI built a model of how the volunteers' visual cortex, which parses information from the eyes, worked. Then came the next phase: translation. As they showed the volunteers movie clips, they asked the model what, given everything it now knew about their brains, it thought they might be looking at.</p><p>  The experiment focused just on a subsection of the visual cortex. It didn't capture what was happening elsewhere in the brain -- how a person might feel about what she was seeing, for example, or what she might be fantasizing about as she watched. The endeavor was, in Dr. Gallant's words, a primitive proof of concept.</p><p>  And yet the results, published in 2011, are remarkable.</p><p>  The reconstructed images move with a dreamlike fluidity. In their imperfection, they evoke expressionist art. (And a few reconstructed images seem downright wrong.) But where they succeed, they represent an astonishing achievement: a machine translating patterns of brain activity into a moving image understandable by other people -- a machine that can read the brain.</p><p>  Dr. Gallant was thrilled. Imagine the possibilities when better brain-reading technology became available? Imagine the people suffering from locked-in syndrome, Lou Gehrig's disease, the people incapacitated by strokes, who could benefit from a machine that could help them interact with the world?</p><p>  He was also scared because the experiment showed, in a concrete way, that humanity was at the dawn of a new era, one in which our thoughts could theoretically be snatched from our heads. What was going to happen, Dr. Gallant wondered, when you could read thoughts the thinker might not even be consciously aware of, when you could see people's memories?</p><p>  ''That's a real sobering thought that now you have to take seriously,'' he told me recently.</p><p>  The 'Google Cap'</p><p>  For decades, we've communicated with computers mostly by using our fingers and our eyes, by interfacing via keyboards and screens. These tools and the bony digits we prod them with provide a natural limit to the speed of communication between human brain and machine. We can convey information only as quickly (and accurately) as we can type or click.</p><p>  Voice recognition, like that used by Apple's Siri or Amazon's Alexa, is a step toward more seamless integration of human and machine. The next step, one that scientists around the world are pursuing, is technology that allows people to control computers -- and everything connected to them, including cars, robotic arms and drones -- merely by thinking.</p><p>  Dr. Gallant jokingly calls the imagined piece of hardware that would do this a ''Google cap'': a hat that could sense silent commands and prompt computers to respond accordingly.</p><p>  The problem is that, to work, that cap would need to be able to see, with some detail, what's happening in the nearly 100 billion neurons that make up the brain.</p><p>  Technology that can easily peer through the skull, like the MRI machine, is far too unwieldy to mount on your head. Less bulky technology, like electroencephalogram, or E.E.G., which measures the brain's electrical activity through electrodes attached to the scalp, doesn't provide nearly the same clarity. One scientist compares it to looking for the surface ripples made by a fish swimming underwater while a storm roils the lake.</p><p>  Other methods of ''seeing'' into the brain might include magnetoencephalography, or M.E.G., which measures magnetic waves emanating outside the skull from neurons firing beneath it; or using infrared light, which can penetrate living tissue, to infer brain activity from changes in blood flow. (Pulse oximeters work this way, by shining infrared light through your finger.)</p><p>  What technologies will power the brain-computer interface of the future is still unclear. And if it's unclear how we'll ''read'' the brain, it's even less clear how we'll ''write'' to it.</p><p>  This is the other holy grail of brain-machine research: technology that can transmit information to the brain directly. We're probably nowhere near the moment when you can silently ask, ''Alexa, what's the capital of Peru?'' and have ''Lima'' materialize in your mind.</p><p>  Even so, solutions to these challenges are beginning to emerge. Much of the research has occurred in the medical realm, where, for years, scientists have worked incrementally toward giving quadriplegics and others with immobilizing neurological conditions better ways of interacting with the world through computers. But in recent years, tech companies -- including Facebook, Microsoft and Elon Musk's Neuralink -- have begun investing in the field.</p><p>  Some scientists are elated by this infusion of energy and resources. Others worry that as this tech moves into the consumer realm, it could have a variety of unintended and potentially dangerous consequences, from the erosion of mental privacy to the exacerbation of inequality.</p><p>  Rafael Yuste, a neurobiologist at Columbia University, counts two great advances in computing that have transformed society: the transition from room-size mainframe computers to personal computers that fit on a desk (and then in your lap), and the advent of mobile computing with smartphones in the 2000s. Noninvasive brain-reading tech would be a third great leap, he says.</p><p>  ''Forget about the Covid crisis,'' Dr. Yuste told me. ''What's coming with this new tech can change humanity.''</p><p>  Dear Brain</p><p>  Not many people will volunteer to be the first to undergo a novel kind of brain surgery, even if it holds the promise of restoring mobility to those who've been paralyzed. So when Robert Kirsch, the chairman of biomedical engineering at Case Western Reserve University, put out such a call nearly 10 years ago, and one person both met the criteria and was willing, he knew he had a pioneer on his hands.</p><p>  The man's name was Bill Kochevar. He'd been paralyzed from the neck down in a biking accident years earlier. His motto, as he later explained it, was ''somebody has to do the research.''</p><p>  At that point, scientists had already invented gizmos that helped paralyzed patients leverage what mobility remained -- lips, an eyelid -- to control computers or move robotic arms. But Dr. Kirsch was after something different. He wanted to help Mr. Kochevar move his own limbs.</p><p>  The first step was implanting two arrays of sensors over the part of the brain that would normally control Mr. Kochevar's right arm. Electrodes that could receive signals from those arrays via a computer were implanted into his arm muscles. The implants, and the computer connected to them, would function as a kind of electronic spinal cord, bypassing his injury.</p><p>  Once his arm muscles had been strengthened -- achieved with a regimen of mild electrical stimulation while he slept -- Mr. Kochevar, who at that point had been paralyzed for over a decade, was able to feed himself and drink water. He could even scratch his nose.</p><p>  About two dozen people around the world who have lost the use of limbs from accidents or neurological disease have had sensors implanted on their brains. Many, Mr. Kochevar included, participated in a United States government-funded program called BrainGate. The sensor arrays used in this research, smaller than a button, allow patients to move robotic arms or cursors on a screen just by thinking. But as far as Dr. Kirsch knows, Mr. Kochevar, who died in 2017 for reasons unrelated to the research, was the first paralyzed person to regain use of his limbs by way of this technology.</p><p>  This fall, Dr. Kirsch and his colleagues will begin version 2.0 of the experiment. This time, they'll implant six smaller arrays -- more sensors will improve the quality of the signal. And instead of implanting electrodes directly in the volunteers' muscles, they'll insert them upstream, circling the nerves that move the muscles. In theory, Dr. Kirsch says, that will enable movement of the entire arm and hand.</p><p>  The next major goal is to restore sensation so that people can know if they're holding a rock, say, or an orange -- or if their hand has wandered too close to a flame. ''Sensation has been the longest ignored part of paralysis,'' Dr. Kirsch told me.</p><p>  A few years ago, scientists at the University of Pittsburgh began groundbreaking experiments on that front with a man named Nathan Copeland who was paralyzed from the upper chest down. They routed sensory information from a robotic arm into the part of his cortex that dealt with his right hand's sense of touch.</p><p>  Every brain is a living, undulating organ that changes over time. That's why, before each of Mr. Copeland's sessions, the AI has to recalibrate -- to construct a new brain decoder. ''The signals in your brain shift,'' Mr. Copeland told me. ''They're not exactly the same every day.''</p><p>  And the results weren't perfect. Mr. Copeland described them to me as ''weird,'' ''electrical tingly'' but also ''amazing.'' The sensory feedback was immensely important, though, in knowing that he'd actually grasped what he thought he'd grasped. And more generally, it demonstrated that a person could ''feel'' a robotic hand as his or her own, and that information coming from electronic sensors could be fed into the human brain.</p><p>  Preliminary as these experiments are, they suggest that the pieces of a brain-machine interface that can both ''read'' and ''write'' already exist. People cannot only move robotic arms just by thinking; machines can also, however imperfectly, convey information to the brain about what that arm encounters.</p><p>  Who knows how soon versions of this technology will be available for kids who want to think-move avatars in video games or think-surf the web. People can already fly drones with their brain signals, so maybe crude consumer versions will appear in coming years. But it's hard to overstate how life-changing such tech could be for people with spinal cord injuries or neurological diseases.</p><p>  Edward Chang, a neurosurgeon at the University of California, San Francisco, who works on brain-based speech recognition, said that maintaining the ability to communicate can mean the difference between life or death. ''For some people, if they have a means to continue to communicate, that may be the reason they decide to stay alive,'' he told me. ''That motivates us a lot in our work.''</p><p>  In a recent study, Dr. Chang and his colleagues predicted with up to 97 percent accuracy -- the best rate yet achieved, they say -- what words a volunteer had said (from about 250 words used in a predetermined set of 50 sentences) by using implanted sensors that monitored activity in the part of the brain that moves the muscles involved in speaking. (The volunteers in this study weren't paralyzed; they were epilepsy patients undergoing brain surgery to address that condition, and the implants were not permanent.)</p><p>  Dr. Chang used sensor arrays similar to those Dr. Kirsch used, but a noninvasive method may not be too far away.</p><p>Facebook, which funded Dr. Chang's study, is working on a brain-reading helmet-like contraption that uses infrared light to peer into the brain. Mark Chevillet, the director of brain-computer interface research at Facebook Reality Labs, told me in an email that while full speech recognition remains distant, his lab will be able to decode simple commands like ''home,'' ''select'' and ''delete'' in ''coming years.''</p><p>  This progress isn't solely driven by advances in brain-sensing technology -- by the physical meeting point of flesh and machine. The AI matters as much, if not more.</p><p>  Trying to understand the brain from outside the skull is like trying to make sense of a conversation taking place two rooms away. The signal is often messy, hard to decipher. So it's the same types of algorithms that now allow speech-recognition software to do a decent job of understanding spoken speech -- including individual idiosyncrasies of pronunciation and regional accents -- that may now enable brain-reading technology.</p><p>  Zap That Urge</p><p>  Not all the applications of brain reading require something as complex as understanding speech, however. In some cases, scientists simply want to blunt urges.</p><p>  When Casey Halpern, a neurosurgeon at Stanford, was in college, he had a friend who drank too much. Another was overweight but couldn't stop eating. ''Impulse control is such a pervasive problem,'' he told me.</p><p>  As a budding scientist, he learned about methods of deep brain stimulation used to treat Parkinson's disease. A mild electric current applied to a part of the brain involved in movement could lessen tremors caused by the disease. Could he apply that technology to the problem of inadequate self control?</p><p>  Working with mice in the 2010s, he identified a part of the brain, called the nucleus accumbens, where activity spiked in a predictable pattern just before a mouse was about to gorge on high-fat food. He found he could reduce how much the mouse ate by disrupting that activity with a mild electrical current. He could zap the compulsion to gorge as it was taking hold in the rodents' brains.</p><p>  Earlier this year, he began testing the approach in people suffering from obesity who haven't been helped by any other treatment, including gastric-bypass surgery. He implants an electrode in their nucleus accumbens. It's connected to an apparatus that was originally developed to prevent seizures in people with epilepsy.</p><p>  As with Dr. Chang or Dr. Gallant's work, an algorithm first has to learn about the brain it's attached to -- to recognize the signs of oncoming loss of control. Dr. Halpern and his colleagues train the algorithm by giving patients a taste of a milkshake, or offering a buffet of the patient's favorite foods, and then recording their brain activity just before the person indulges.</p><p>  He's so far completed two implantations. ''The goal is to help restore control,'' he told me. And if it works in obesity, which afflicts roughly 40 percent of adults in the United States, he plans to test the gizmo against addictions to alcohol, cocaine and other substances.</p><p>  Dr. Halpern's approach takes as fact something that he says many people have a hard time accepting: that the lack of impulse control that may underlie addictive behavior isn't a choice, but results from a malfunction of the brain. ''We have to accept that it's a disease,'' he says. ''We often just judge people and assume it's their own fault. That's not what the current research is suggesting we should do.''</p><p>  I must confess that of the numerous proposed applications of brain-machine interfacing I came across, Dr. Halpern's was my favorite to extrapolate on. How many lives have been derailed by the inability to resist the temptation of that next pill or that next beer? What if Dr. Halpern's solution was generalizable?</p><p>  What if every time your mind wandered off while writing an article, you could, with the aid of your concentration implant, prod it back to the task at hand, finally completing those life-changing projects you've never gotten around to finishing?</p><p>  These applications remain fantasies, of course. But the mere fact that such a thing may be possible is partly what prompts Dr. Yuste, the neurobiologist, to worry about how this technology could blur the boundaries of what we consider to be our personalities.</p><p>  Such blurring is already an issue, he points out. Parkinson's patients with implants sometimes report feeling more aggressive than usual when the machine is ''on.'' Depressed patients undergoing deep brain stimulation sometimes wonder if they're really themselves anymore. ''You kind of feel artificial,'' one patient told researchers. The machine isn't implanting ideas in their minds, like Leonardo DiCaprio's character in the movie ''Inception,'' but it is seemingly changing their sense of self.</p><p>  What happens if people are no longer sure if their emotions are theirs, or the effects of the machines they're connected to?</p><p>  Dr. Halpern dismisses these concerns as overblown. Such effects are part of many medical treatments, he points out, including commonly prescribed antidepressants and stimulants. And sometimes, as in the case of hopeless addiction, changing someone's behavior is precisely the goal.</p><p>  Still the longer-term issue of what could happen when brain-writing technology jumps from the medical into the consumer realm is hard to forget. If my imagined focus enhancer existed, for example, but was very expensive, it could exacerbate the already yawning chasm between those who can afford expensive tutors, cars and colleges -- and now grit-boosting technology -- and those who cannot.</p><p>  ''Certain groups will get this tech, and will enhance themselves,'' Dr. Yuste told me. ''This is a really serious threat to humanity.''</p><p>  The Brain Business</p><p>  ''The idea that you have to drill holes in skulls to read the brains is nuts,'' Mary Lou Jepsen, the chief executive and founder of Openwater, told me in an email. Her company is developing technology that, she says, uses infrared light and ultrasonic waves to peer into the body.</p><p>  Other researchers are simply trying to make invasive approaches less invasive. A company called Synchron seeks to avoid opening the skull or touching brain tissue at all by inserting a sensor through the jugular vein in the neck. It's currently undergoing a safety and feasibility trial.</p><p>  Dr. Kirsch suspects that Elon Musk's Neuralink is probably the best brain-sensing tech in development. It requires surgery, but unlike the BrainGate sensor arrays, it's thin, flexible and can adjust to the mountainous topography of the brain. The hope is that this makes it less caustic. It also has hairlike filaments that sink into brain tissue. Each filament contains multiple sensors, theoretically allowing the capture of more data than flatter arrays that sit at the brain's surface. It can both read and write to the brain, and it's accompanied by a robot that assists with the implantation.</p><p>  A major challenge to implants is that, as Dr. Gallant says, ''your brain doesn't like having stuff stuck in your brain.'' Over time, immune cells may swarm the implant, covering it with goop.</p><p>  One way to try to avoid this is to drastically shrink the size of the sensors. Arto Nurmikko, a professor of engineering and physics at Brown University who's part of the BrainGate effort, is developing what he calls ''neurograins'' -- tiny, implantable silicon sensors no larger than a handful of neurons. They're too small to have batteries, so they're powered by microwaves beamed in from outside the skull.</p><p>  He foresees maybe 1,000 mini sensors implanted throughout the brain. He's so far tested them only in rodents. But maybe we shouldn't be so sure that healthy people wouldn't volunteer for ''mental enhancement'' surgery. Every year, Dr. Nurmikko poses a hypothetical to his students: 1,000 neurograin implants that would allow students to learn and communicate faster; any volunteers?</p><p>  ''Typically about half the class says, 'Sure,''' he told me. ''That speaks to where we are today.''</p><p>  Jose Carmena and Michel Maharbiz, scientists at Berkeley and founders of a start-up called Iota Biosciences, have their own version of this idea, which they call ''neural dust'': tiny implants for the peripheral nervous system -- arm, legs and organs besides the brain. ''It's like a Fitbit for your liver,'' Dr. Carmena told me.</p><p>  They imagine treating inflammatory diseases by stimulating nerves throughout the body with these tiny devices. And where Dr. Nurmikko uses microwaves to power the devices, Dr. Carmena and Dr. Maharbiz foresee the use of ultrasound to beam power to them.</p><p>  Generally, they say, this kind of tech will be adopted first in the medical context and then move to the lay population. ''We're going to evolve to augmenting humans,'' Dr. Carmena told me. ''There's no question.''</p><p>  But hype permeates the field, he warns. Sure, Elon Musk has argued that closer brain-machine integration will help humans compete with ever-more-powerful A.I.s. But in reality, we're nowhere near a device that could, for example, help you master Kung Fu instantaneously like Keanu Reeves in ''The Matrix.''</p><p>  What does the near future look like for the average consumer? Ramses Alcaide, the chief executive of a company called Neurable, imagines a world in which smartphones tucked in our pockets or backpacks act as processing hubs for data streaming in from smaller computers and sensors worn around the body. These devices -- glasses that serve as displays, earbuds that whisper in our ears -- are where the actual interfacing between human and computer will occur.</p><p>Microsoft sells a headset called HoloLens that superimposes images onto the world, an idea called ''augmented reality.'' A company called Mojo Vision is working toward a contact lens that projects monochrome images directly onto the retina, a private computer display superimposed over the world.</p><p>  And Dr. Alcaide himself is working on what he sees as the linchpin to this vision, a device that, one day, may help you to silently communicate with all your digital paraphernalia. He was vague about the form the product will take -- it isn't market ready yet -- except to note that it's an earphone that can measure the brain's electrical activity to sense ''cognitive states,'' like whether you're hungry or concentrating.</p><p>  We already compulsively check Instagram and Facebook and email, even though we're supposedly impeded by our fleshy fingers. I asked Dr. Alcaide: What will happen when we can compulsively check social media just by thinking?</p><p>  Ever the optimist, he told me that brain-sensing technology could actually help with the digital incursion. The smart earbud could sense that you're working, for instance, and block advertisements or phone calls. ''What if your computer knew you were focusing?'' he told me. ''What if it actually removes bombardment from your life?''</p><p>  Maybe it's no surprise that Dr. Alcaide has enjoyed the HBO sci-fi show ''Westworld,'' a universe where technologies that make communicating with computers more seamless are commonplace (though no one seems better off for it). Rafael Yuste, on the other hand, refuses to watch the show. He likens the idea to a scientist who studies Covid-19 watching a movie about pandemics. ''It's the last thing I want to do,'' he says.</p><p>  'A Human Rights Issue'</p><p>  To grasp why Dr. Yuste frets so much about brain-reading technology, it helps to understand his research. He helped pioneer a technology that can read and write to the brain with unprecedented precision, and it doesn't require surgery. But it does require genetic engineering.</p><p>  Dr. Yuste infects mice with a virus that inserts two genes into the animals' neurons. One prompts the cells to produce a protein that make them sensitive to infrared light; the other makes the neurons emit light when they activate. Thereafter, when the neurons fire, Dr. Yuste can see them light up. And he can activate neurons in turn with an infrared laser. Dr. Yuste can thus read what's happening in the mouse brain and write to the mouse's brain with an accuracy impossible with other techniques.</p><p>  And he can, it appears, make the mice ''see'' things that aren't there.</p><p>  In one experiment, he trained mice to take a drink of sugar water after a series of bars appeared on a screen. He recorded which neurons in the visual cortex fired when the mice saw those bars. Then he activated those same neurons with the laser, but without showing them the actual bars. The mice had the same reaction: They took a drink.</p><p>  He likens what he did to implanting an hallucination. ''We were able to implant into these mice perceptions of things that they hadn't seen,'' he told me. ''We manipulated the mouse like a puppet.''</p><p>  This method, called optogenetics, is a long way from being used in people. To begin with, we have thicker skulls and bigger brains, making it harder for infrared light to penetrate. And from a political and regulatory standpoint, the bar is high for genetically engineering human beings. But scientists are exploring workarounds -- drugs and nanoparticles that make neurons receptive to infrared light, allowing precise activation of neurons without genetic engineering.</p><p>  The lesson in Dr. Yuste's view is not that we'll soon have lasers mounted on our heads that play us ''like pianos,'' but that brain-reading and possibly brain-writing technologies are fast approaching, and society isn't prepared for them.</p><p>  ''We think this is a human rights issue,'' he told me.</p><p>  In a 2017 paper in the journal Nature, Dr. Yuste and 24 other signatories, including Dr. Gallant, called for the formulation of a human rights declaration that explicitly addressed ''neurorights'' and what they see as the threats posed by brain-reading technology before it becomes ubiquitous. Information taken from people's brains should be protected like medical data, Dr. Yuste says, and not exploited for profit or worse. And just as people have the right not to self-incriminate with speech, we should have the right not to self-incriminate with information gleaned from our brains.</p><p>  Dr. Yuste's activism was prompted in part, he told me, by the large companies suddenly interested in brain-machine research.</p><p>  Say you're using your Google Cap. And like many products in the Google ecosystem, it collects information about you, which it uses to help advertisers target you with ads. Only now, it's not harvesting your search results or your map location; it's harvesting your thoughts, your daydreams, your desires.</p><p>  Who owns those data?</p><p>  Or imagine that writing to the brain is possible. And there are lower-tier versions of brain-writing gizmos that, in exchange for their free use, occasionally ''make suggestions'' directly to your brain. How will you know if your impulses are your own, or if an algorithm has stimulated that sudden craving for Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream or Gucci handbags?</p><p>  ''People have been trying to manipulate each other since the beginning of time,'' Dr. Yuste told me. ''But there's a line that you cross once the manipulation goes directly to the brain, because you will not be able to tell you are being manipulated.''</p><p>  When I asked Facebook about concerns around the ethics of big tech entering the brain-computer interface space, Mr. Chevillet, of Facebook Reality Labs, highlighted the transparency of its brain-reading project. ''This is why we've talked openly about our B.C.I. research -- so it can be discussed throughout the neuroethics community as we collectively explore what responsible innovation looks like in this field,'' he said in an email.</p><p>  Ed Cutrell, a senior principal researcher at Microsoft, which also has a B.C.I. program, emphasized the importance of treating user data carefully. ''There needs to be clear sense of where that information goes,'' he told me. ''As we are sensing more and more about people, to what extent is that information I'm collecting about you yours?''</p><p>  Some find all this talk of ethics and rights, if not irrelevant, then at least premature.</p><p>  Medical scientists working to help paralyzed patients, for example, are already governed by HIPAA laws, which protect patient privacy. Any new medical technology has to go through the Food and Drug Administration approval process, which includes ethical considerations.</p><p>  (Ethical quandaries still arise, though, notes Dr. Kirsch. Let's say you want to implant a sensor array in a patient suffering from locked-in syndrome. How do you get consent to conduct surgery that might change the person's life for the better from someone who can't communicate?)</p><p>  Leigh Hochberg, a professor of engineering at Brown University and part of the BrainGate initiative, sees the companies now piling into the brain-machine space as a boon. The field needs these companies' dynamism -- and their deep pockets, he told me. Discussions about ethics are important, ''but those discussions should not at any point derail the imperative to provide restorative neurotechnologies to people who could benefit from them,'' he added.</p><p>  Ethicists, Dr. Jepsen told me, ''must also see this: The alternative would be deciding we aren't interested in a deeper understanding of how our minds work, curing mental disease, really understanding depression, peering inside people in comas or with Alzheimer's, and enhancing our abilities in finding new ways to communicate.''</p><p>  There's even arguably a national security imperative to plow forward. China has its own version of BrainGate. If American companies don't pioneer this technology, some think, Chinese companies will. ''People have described this as a brain arms race,'' Dr. Yuste said.</p><p>  Not even Dr. Gallant, who first succeeded in translating neural activity into a moving image of what another person was seeing -- and who was both elated and horrified by the exercise -- thinks the Luddite approach is an option.

Use of mobile phone payment systems like Alipay and WeChat Pay is expanding, even in the cash-dominated Japanese retail world. [REITs]</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Mobile_Payment_1490623851.jpgFirmBee\">http://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Mobile_Payment_1490623851.jpgFirmBee</url>[1] / PixabayCashless settlements already are the norm for many Chinese. Now, Ant Financial Services Group's Alipay and Tencent Holdings' WeChat Pay are looking to expand to overseas markets, initially by offering such options to Chinese overseas residents and tourists. The two Chinese fintech giants may make significant inroads in developing countries in Asia and elsewhere where consumers have relatively less access to traditional credit cards and other banking services, but experts say the going likely will be harder in more affluent markets like Japan and the U.S. Mobile payments took off in China thanks to a savvy decision by Alipay to use QR, or Quick Response, codes to handle such transactions. The technology was developed by Japanese company Denso Wave in 1994 for the automotive industry, but it was the Chinese who seized on its promise as a way to handle mobile payments. Digital payments are processed by scanning QR codes at the point of sales which link to the customer's bank account in China. That genius for pragmatically tweaking an existing technology to serve a new purpose helped mobile payments soar to 58.8 trillion yuan in 2016 from just 1.2 trillion yuan to in 2013, according to iResearch Consulting Group in China. China e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holdings, which owns Ant Financial, and Tencent Holdings, which owns payment platform WeChat Pay, hold a combined market share of 92% of such transactions in the market of 1.4 billion people. Alipay\u00a0says it processed\u00a0256,000 payment transactions per second during its peak Singles' Day festival on November 11, 2017. But it's likely that the spread of mobile payments will not go as smoothly in Japan or elsewhere as it has in China, says Wharton Dean Geoffrey Garrett[2]. Innovation of customer services \u2014 from delivery to mobile banking \u2014 has gone faster there because China's regulatory environment is less mature than in the West, so there's more room for new players to innovate and 'leapfrog,' Garrett notes. Since Alibaba is\u00a0an\u00a0'end-to-end' company\u00a0that handles\u00a0marketing, sales, payments and delivery, it has been easier for\u00a0it\u00a0to expand into mobile payments by using all\u00a0of its\u00a0resources and internal synergies.\u00a0Wechat Pay, owned by Tencent, is linked to\u00a0the\u00a0Tencent mobile messaging and social media platform, helping it to catch up with\u00a0Alipay. Bumps Along the Digital Road Alipay recently hit a snag with its U.S. strategy. A deal set in May 2017 enabled its Chinese users to shop at 4 million U.S. merchants served by payments processor First Data Corp. That was a big step forward. But the U.S. government recently rejected its attempt to acquire Dallas-based MoneyGram International, citing national security concerns. The deal would have allowed Alipay to market its services to MoneyGram customers in 200 countries. 'In the U.S., innovation like this would more likely come from a Paypal 2.0 that one of the big tech players would acquire,' Garrett says. 'American firms have a lot of interests to protect, and hence may not innovate as quickly.' 'We are trying to develop local payment services in countries that have big unbanked or underbanked populations.'\u2014 Xinyun Yang The lack of a history of credit card use and the very centralized nature of China's e-commerce market have facilitated the quick expansion of mobile payments in China. 'Meanwhile, using banks here for pretty much anything is inefficient, and you have to spend a lot of time standing in line and paying bills, or getting them to give you cash,' says Benjamin Cavender, principal of China Market Research Group based in Shanghai. 'When Alibaba came up with Alipay originally, it was so easy compared with anything people have had before, and they became interested in it very quickly.' It didn't hurt that Alibaba owns both Tmall and Taobao, which together account for more than 70% of all e-commerce transactions in China. 'Having access to the retail space where all consumers were already shopping online made it easy for them to build a strong payments platform,' Cavender says. In other markets where there is no dominant player, it can be more difficult to get customers to try such services, he adds. A big share of consumer spending in China is by the younger generation \u2014 the under-35s who grew up with smart phones and are very comfortable with the internet and technology. Many have never shopped much apart from online. 'If you look at American consumers, they have other options. They are used to using credit cards, debit cards or are more likely to log on to their laptops or desktop computers at home. They always have had more choice, so it is more difficult to convince them to use a mobile payments platform,' Cavender says. Mobile phone payments totaled 58.8 trillion yuan (US$9 trillion) in 2016, nearly quadrupling from 12.2 trillion yuan\u00a0in 2015. In 2017, QR code settlements are forecast to have totaled 98.7 trillion yuan and 165.9 trillion in 2018, according to iResearch Consulting Group in China. That is more than 90 times the size of the U.S. mobile payments market, according to Forrester Research. The mobile penetration rate in China, with its population of 1.4 billion, is 96.88% (some own more than one), of which 58% own smartphones. That's higher than in Japan, where 83.6% own mobile phones, of which 56.8% own smart phones. Although it is slowly losing its supremacy as Japanese warm to banking online and using credit cards, cash is still king in Japan. A survey by the Bank of Japan in 2016 showed only 6% of Japanese have used mobile phone payments via smart phones or mobile phones, while 98.3% of Chinese had used mobile payments. In America, only 5.6% of those surveyed had used mobile payments like Venmo. Mobile settlements are barely beginning to make inroads into Japan and America, and use of Alipay and WeChat Pay is still mainly confined to Chinese visitors. But Alipay has been moving aggressively into Southeast Asia, tying up with local payment platforms and other companies in more than seven countries in the region since 2015. It has now four local payment platforms providing such services in Thailand, India, Hong Kong and the Philippines, and is expected to expand across Asia soon. Yang Xinyun, a spokeswoman for Ant Financial, says Alipay had\u00a0about 280 million users\u00a0of its\u00a0four local payment platforms and 520 million users in China by the end of 2017. Ant Financial has acquired the Lazada Group payment service HelloPay Group in Singapore, rebranding it as Alipay in 2017.\u00a0'They first focus on making it easy for Chinese consumers to travel there for a vacation or business overseas. The second step is to cooperate with local payment platforms or build their own that allow local consumers to use the service,' Cavender says. 'We are trying to develop local payment services in countries that have big unbaked or underbanked population,' says Xinyun Yang, a spokeswoman for Ant Financial. 'What we are doing now is to find local strategic partners we can work with to provide technology know-how, business know-how and experience.' In India, Alipay joined with local partner One97 Communications \u2014 which operates India's Paytm Payments Bank and is backed by Alibaba \u2014 to provide local payment services. According to Bloomberg, Paytm is majority owned by Indian entrepreneur Vijay Shekhar Sharma, and One97 owns the remaining 49%. Meanwhile, in Thailand, Ant Financial is partnering with Ascend Money. Tencent, likewise, is expanding in the region. It has obtained a license for local transactions in Malaysia, with plans to launch WeChat pay there early this year. Tencent also is edging into Thailand, having bought local company\u00a0Sanook.com, which has been rebranded as Tencent Thailand. [3] The Japanese financial daily Nikkei reported on August 20, 2017, that Alipay plans to launch its Japanese local market payment platform in spring 2018, building on the success of its payment platform for Chinese tourists. The number of Japanese vendors in Alipay's network, from department stores to mom-and-pop shops, is expected to grow to 45,000 by March of this year, up from 40,000 at the end of 2017, Yang says. Ant Financial started providing payment services to Chinese tourists in Japan in 2015. WeChat Pay also started up in Japan in 2015 and has about 10,000 vendors providing mobile payment services to Chinese tourists. Yang did not confirm the Nikkei report, calling it a 'rumor.' But she did say Ant Financial is looking for partners to jointly develop overseas versions of Alipay to provide services to local users in overseas markets. 'Japan is one of the markets where we could offer this kind of service to local users with a Japanese partner in the future if there is a chance,' Yang says. A Tough Market Breaking into Japan's local payments market requires finding a local bank to cooperate, says Cavender. 'If they get one bank to cooperate in Japan and it is popular, they may be able to grow. But Japan is a tough market for them.' 'Over time the companies gaining scale here like Alibaba and Tencent are likely to become players in pure research and radical innovation, too.' -Duncan Clark Japanese experts agree with Cavender. Given the hard times the Japanese banking industry is facing thanks to the central bank's negative interest rate policy and a shrinking local market, it's unclear if the banks could be enticed to join forces with Alipay or WeChat in offering mobile payments unless it would pay off for them. The three megabanks \u2014 Mizuho Financial Group, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and Sumitomo Mitsui Finance Group \u2014 are hurting badly enough that they are laying off retail staff and downsizing their domestic retail networks. 'I wonder if there is any Japanese bank willing to cooperate with Chinese payment platforms that could take away some of their business,' says Tomoo Marukawa, a China industry and economy expert and professor at the Institute of Social Science at the University of Tokyo. 'If they attempt to enter the Japanese market, there may be a negative campaign against them, saying they might leak your personal data for free,' Marukawa says. The fortress mentality of Japan's banking sector has long been evident: Foreign banks generally have made little headway in the highly overbanked market. 'Any attempt by Alibaba to dominate in the Japanese market is a major threat. It is like a U.S. 'black ship' invasion for us in the banking industry,' Daisuke Yamada, Mizuho Financial Group's chief digital technology offer, said in a speech last September, alluding to the so-called black ships of Commodore William Perry that helped end Japan's long era of isolation in the 19th century. But while Mizuho appears uninterested in joining forces with Chinese newcomers, the Mizuho Financial Group is cooperating with Japanese regional banks to develop a QR code settlement system before the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Assuming that Alipay and WeChat Pay are widely adopted in emerging markets like Southeast Asia and South Asia, eventually, Japanese banks may have to accept their payment settlements, given their own extensive and growing business engagement in those regions, says professor Yasuhiro Goto of Asia University, an expert on China's economy and industry. Backlash? While the volume of mobile payments in China has skyrocketed, Alipay and WeChat Pay could be facing a backlash.\u00a0In August 2017, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), the central bank, ordered that all electronic payments must go through a new central bank payments clearing platform, called Wanglian, beginning sometime in 2018. Up to now, the PBOC has not required mobile payments to use that clearing system, which was set up in March 2017 and enables the central bank to keep tabs on capital outflows and monitor transactions for money laundering and fraud. The central bank and the Chinese banking industry may also being angling for a share of the massive profits generated by the mobile payments platforms, says Toshihiko Okano, senior specialist at Global Financial Business Unit of NTT DATA Institute of Management Consulting, a research unit of NTT DATA Corp. Ant Financial declined to comment on the potential impact of such requirements on its business. 'We are working with the central bank at the moment, but it is hard to say how it will be affect our business. We do not know when we might have to use [the PBOC's payment clearing platform],' Yang says. In December, the\u00a0Central Bank also announced new rules on mobile payments made by QR code, and companies including Alipay\u00a0and\u00a0WeChat Pay will be required to set three levels of daily transaction limits for users based on their demand and risk \u2014 500 yuan, 1,000 yuan and 5,000 yuan. Yang says 'the new rules will be valid from April 1. We are still studying them and will not be able to comment at this stage. But we do support any efforts from the regulator that ensure the security of users' accounts and assets.' 'Globalization of the Chinese tech sector will be a massive feature of our world in the next few years.' -Geoffrey Garrett For now, Ant and Tencent are basking in the payoff of having spotted a lucrative market niche for commercializing use of QR code technology for financial transactions. While China may lag in such technological innovations, it excels in finding ways to deploy them. 'They had the foresight to see how using it could become such a big business. Japanese are able to develop wonderful technologies, but they fail at spreading and marketing such innovations to the world, to make them world standards,' says Goto of Asia University. 'This is the weakness of Japanese industry.' Duncan Clark, chairman of investment advisory firm BDA China and the author of Alibaba: The House That Jack Ma Built, sees strong potential for China to lead in innovation. For now, such developments are mostly market driven and incremental, helped by the massive scale of Chinese markets. 'But over time, the companies gaining scale here like Alibaba and Tencent are likely to become players in pure research and radical innovation, too,' he says. Such cash-rich giants have a powerful ally in a government keen to lead technology initiatives in areas like artificial intelligence, big data and super computing, where China is poised to rival the West. So while up to now, China has mostly piggybacked on technologies that emerged elsewhere, that may be changing, says Wharton's Garrett. 'China did not invent high speed rail. But they have scaled it much more and much faster than anywhere else, and they can build the networks much more cheaply. If innovation is the process of turning ideas into outcomes, China is clearly an innovation economy,' he says. In high speed rail, the technology was nurtured from the top down, with the government in the driver's seat, Garrett says, pun intended. 'In mobile payments, it was bottom up, and now the Chinese government is trying to play catch up to regulate what Alipay and WeChat pay are doing. That is a pretty powerful one-two punch when it comes to innovation,' he says. 'I do think that globalization of the Chinese tech sector will be a massive feature of our world in the next few years.'

Elizabeth Warren </nameText></person>on Saturday defended her plan to break up top tech giants Amazon and Alphabet's Googleand Facebook, saying 'boo-hoo' to her critics.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">'The monopolists will make fewer monopoly profits. Boo-hoo,' she told the crowd at the South by Southwest festival.</p><p>'The whole idea behind this is for the people in this room. It's for people who are tech entrepreneurs it's for people who have small businesses and want to grow big businesses, it's for people who have medium sized businesses and want to grow them,' she said, adding she didn't want big companies to use their information and power to crush the smaller ones. </p><p>'We want to keep that marketplace competitive and not let a giant who has an incredible competitive advantage snuff that out,' she said. </p><p>Warren filled the room at the Moody Theater for her one hour conversation.</p><p>Time Magazine Editor at Large Anand Giridharadas, who questioned her, began by asking those in the audience who worked for a tech company to stand.</p><p>After about a dozen people rose, Giridharadas asked Warren to explain to them why she wanted to break up their employers.</p><p>'Because it'll be a lot more fun to work there,' she responded. </p><p>On Friday, the day before her scheduled appearance to the tech heavy crowd at SXSW, Warren announced a plan to break up the tech giants, saying they have 'too much power' and have 'bulldozed competition.' </p><p>Warren received a warm welcome from the crowd when she joked and interacted with them. </p><p>She chided them gently when they didn't know her response to her favorite female politician: Frances Perkins, the Labor Secretary who was the first female Cabinet secretary.</p><p>The crowd applauded when she described who Perkins' was but Warren jokingly told them: 'You didn't know.' </p><p>She was also asked if it was true that Bernie Sanders asked her not to get into the presidential race.</p><p>But she didn't bite.</p><p>'Bernie and I had a private dinner and my view is that dinner stays private,' she responded.</p><p>During a lightening round of questions, she revealed she drinks Michelob Light ('the club soda of beers,' she called it); she's reading the fifth book in the Victor the Assassin series; that she thinks President Donald Trump is a racist and that marijuana should be legalized.</p><p>Warren is polling in the first or second tier of potential presidential candidates, earning an average of 7 per cent support in a polling average - though to implement her ideas she would have to capture both the nomination and defeat President Trump. </p><p>Warren described her plans for tech companies in an essay published on Medium that made the case for promoting competition.</p><p>'Today's big tech companies have too much power - too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy,' she wrote. 'They've bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else. And in the process, they have hurt small businesses and stifled innovation.'</p><p>Amazon shares fell 1.5 percent and Facebookand Alphabet shares were down 0.6 percent in morning trade on Friday. </p><p>Warren, a former academic, became a liberal favorite after she helped create the first consumer financial protection board. </p><p>Warren, who is seeking to stand out in a Democratic field crowded with progressives, said the companies have been allowed to purchase potential competitors, like Facebook's acquisition of Instagram. </p><p>She made her policy pitch as she seeks to distinguish herself from other contenders, including Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has gone after Amazon to try to get the shipping and Internet giant to boost wages. </p><p>Sanders introduced legislation, named after Amazon chief Jeff Bezos, that would seek to tax companies whose workers are forced to rely on government benefits for health care and living costs.</p><p>The acronym comes from its title: 'Stop Bad Employers by Zeroing Out Subsidies.' </p><p>She also said she would appoint regulators who would rely on existing antitrust laws 'to break up mergers that reduce competition.'</p><p>She said they would rely on those tools to 'unwind anti-competitive mergers, including: Amazon: Whole Foods; Zappos Facebook: WhatsApp; InstagramGoogle: Waze; Nest; DoubleClick.'</p><p>In her pitch to rein in the influence of tech giants, the Massachusetts senator envisions legislation targeting companies with annual worldwide revenue of $25 billion or more, limiting their ability to expand and forcing parts of Google and Amazon's current business structure to operate as separate entities.</p><p>As president, Warren said she would pick regulators who would seek to break up what she called 'anti-competitive mergers' such as Facebook's recent purchase of Instagram and Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods.</p><p>She made the pitch before a town hall appearance later in the day in the New York City neighborhood where Amazon recently scrapped plans to open a new headquarters. </p><p>'Today's big tech companies have too much power - too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy,' Warren said.</p><p>It remains to be seen whether Warren will introduce legislation in the current Congress aligning with the first element of her plan. A spokeswoman, Kristen Orthman, said a bill introduction was not imminent.</p><p> Warren described the current crop of big tech firms as a threat to business innovation.</p><p>'As these companies have grown larger and more powerful, they have used their resources and control over the way we use the Internet to squash small businesses and innovation, and substitute their own financial interests for the broader interests of the American people,' she wrote.</p><p>'To restore the balance of power in our democracy, to promote competition, and to ensure that the next generation of technology innovation is as vibrant as the last, it's time to break up our biggest tech companies.' </p><p>According to OpenSecrets, individuals from Alphabet Inc. came in 9th among firms that have contributed most to Warren's campaigns from 2013 to 2018. They collectively gave some $41,000 out of $8 million raised. </p><p>One of her 2020 rivals, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, has faced criticism for his past closeness to the tech industry. A Booker spokesman did not immediately return a request for comment on Booker's view of Warren's new proposal. </p><p>Warren said that she would nominate regulators who would unwind mergers such as Facebook's deals for WhatsApp and Instagram, Amazon's deals for Whole Foods and Zappos, and Google's purchase of Waze, Nest and DoubleClick.</p><p>Amazon, Googleand Facebookdid not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAILON-52448024</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAILON2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VKT-HYW1-F021-64WW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397135</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1191\"/><timeReceived>9:05 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

Groups like Open Markets have made a strong case that big companies (especially big tech companies) are distorting the market to drive out competitors. We need a new standard for monopolies, they argue, one that focuses less on consumer harm and more on the skewed incentives produced by a company the size of Facebook or Google. Someday soon, those ideas will be put to the test, probably against one of a handful of companies. For anti-monopolists, it's a chance to reshape tech into something more democratic and less destructive. </p><p>It's just a question of which company makes the best target. To that end, here's the case against four of the movement's biggest targets, and what they might look like if they came out on the losing end. (Note: Apple was too much of a conventional retailer to make the list, but if you're wondering what an antitrust lawsuit against Cupertino might look like,this is a pretty good place to start.) Google: The Conglomerate Our best model for tech antitrust is the Department of Justice's anti-bundling case against Microsoft in the \u201890s, which argued that Microsoft was using its control over the PC market to force out competing operating systems and browsers. If you're looking for a contemporary equivalent, Google is probably the closest fit. On a good day, Google (or Alphabet, if you prefer) is the most valuable company in the world by market cap, with dozens of different products supported by an all-encompassing ad network. Google also has clear and committed enemies, with Microsoft, Oracle, Yelp, and even the Motion Picture Association of America calling for restrictions on the company's power. Some of those restrictions are already starting to take shape in Europe, as Google facesa $5 billion fine for alleged anti-competitive Android bundlinganda separate $4 billion GDPR casethat alleges stingy opt-out provisions. Last week, Sen. Orrin Hatchcalled on the Federal Trade Commissionto investigate anti-competitive effects from Google's dominance in online ads and search, hinting that similar regulatory pressure may not be far off in the US. But according to Open Markets' Matthew Stoller, the best long-term remedy for Google's dominance has more to do with Google's acquisitions. 'If you're looking for a silver bullet, probably the best thing to do would be to block Google from being able to buy any companies, says Stoller. 'Suddenly, you have to compete with Google, you can't just be bought out by Google. That might sound tame compared to Europe's billion-dollar fines, but it cuts to the core of how Google is organized. The company has acquired more than 200 startups since it was founded, including central products like YouTube, Android, and DoubleClick. The company's modular structure is arguably a direct result of that buying spree, and it's hard to imagine what Google would look like without it. More recent buys like Nest have fallen under the broader Alphabet umbrella, but the core strategy hasn't changed. Would Google still be an AI giant if it hadn't bought DeepMind? Probably, but everyone involved would have had to work a lot harder. Even better, anti-monopoly activists would have a bunch of different ways to block those acquisitions. The Department of Justice's antitrust division hasn't contested Google's acquisitions so far, but it could always change its approach. The strongest fix would come from Congress, where Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) has introduced a bill that would placean outright ban on acquisitionsby any company with a market cap higher than $100 billion. (As of press time, Google is worth roughly $840 billion.) Of course, Klobuchar's bill doesn't focus on Google or even tech giants, but Stoller says that kind of blockade would have a unique effect on how big companies shape the startup world. 'All of these companies, from Amazon to Facebook to Google, they proactively find their competitors and buy them out, says Stoller. 'This would push VCs and entrepreneurs to truly compete with Google. Right now, their strategy isn't to do that because they want to get acquired. Amazon: The Platform Amazon makes life hard for its competitors \u2014 and by now, the company is competing against nearly everyone. The most notorious example isthe company's wholesale pillaging of Diapers.com in 2010, which saw Amazon drop diaper prices by as much as 30 percent and matching Diapers.com's pricing move for move until the smaller outfit agreed to be acquired. More recently, smaller retailers say they're being targeted and priced out by generics from Amazon Basics, which benefits from Amazon's wealth of data on who's buying what. Since Amazon has the money to out-discount any competitors, there's not much anyone can do about it. With a laser focus on consumer benefit (usually meaning lower prices), the company has become a major player in nearly every market it enters. Since the modern antitrust standard is mostly focused on consumer harm, Amazon has largely avoided regulatory scrutiny, making it a prime target for the new generation of policy minds that are focused on how big companies can distort markets. Anti-monopoly lawyer Lina Khan laid out the case against the retail giant ina 2017 article called 'Amazon's Antitrust Paradox,in which she argued that the Amazon store had become a utility infrastructure that the company was subverting for its own benefit. (The argument seems to have found favor with FTC commissioner Rohit Chopra, who hired Khan in July.) In that view, the problem is that Amazon the store gives too much advantage to Amazon the manufacturer. And thanks to acquisitions such as Whole Foods and the power of Prime, Amazon the store keeps getting bigger. But Stacy Mitchell, co-director at the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, says that could be solved with a Microsoft-style antitrust suit, carving Amazon up into distinct parts and setting new rules for each part. 'Amazon needs to be broken up so that the platform is separated from its retail and manufacturing operations, says Mitchell. 'The platform needs to be treated like a common carrier, so it's required to serve all comers equally. In short, it would be court-mandated net neutrality for The Everything Store. That would take a pretty aggressive Department of Justice to get us there, butKhan's analysis is gaining favor in surprising corners of Washington. Uber: The Price-Fixer Uber might not seem as scary as it did during the Kalanick years, but it's still the largest single crowd-labor platform and a vital piece of transportation infrastructure in 600 cities across the world. Sitting between one-off customers and independently contracted drivers, there are lots of ways for Uber to subtly manipulate the market for its own benefit. The most notorious method was surge pricing, which added a multiplier whenever the supply of nearby drivers was running low. More recently, Uber switched to upfront pricing, but the company still has near total control over how much a given ride costs, and how much of that money makes it back to drivers. That would be fine for a normal business, but it might be a bigger problem for Uber. The company has long insisted that drivers are independent contractors, not employees. That means Uber can't be a monopoly in the Standard Oil sense, but it could be a part of a price-fixing conspiracy, in which an entire industry colludes to raise prices at once. That usually looks like a bunch of companies secretly agreeing not to compete with each other, like whenUK supermarkets all agreed to boost milk pricesorApple convinced publishers to sell ebooks at a single rate. In both cases, the companies were found to be in violation of the Sherman Act, and the conspiracy was broken up. Marshall Steinbaum, research director at the Roosevelt Institute, says the 'independent contractor structure makes Uber uniquely vulnerable to a conventional antitrust case. 'The nature of the business is fundamentally a conspiracy among hundreds of thousands of independent businesses, Steinbaum says. One customer has already tried to cast surge-pricing as a price fixin civil court, suing over the higher prices paid as a result of the conspiracy. The case was ultimately thrown out because of an arbitration clause in Uber's Terms of Service (although not before Uber got in trouble for spying on the plaintiff). Still, the Justice Department isn't bound by Terms of Service, and it could bring the same case any time it likes. If the case were successful, Uber and other crowd-labor platforms would be faced with a tough choice. If it keeps drivers as independent contractors, it'd be forbidden from any kind of price control and forced into a flat Airbnb-style marketplace as it scraps it out with competing networks. It could escape those limits by recognizing drivers as employees, but that would subject the company to a battery of new requirements on minimum wage, benefits, and workers' compensation, immediately becoming the largest employer in the country. Either way, Uber would face a lot more limits on how it treats drivers and passengers. 'It would force them to take away either the ability to charge whatever they want or the ability to treat drivers as independent contractors, says Steinbaum. 'Lose either one, and you've undermined the power of having a centralized transportation monopoly. Facebook: The Starfish In some ways, Facebook is the most urgent case. It's inescapable, opaque, and it wields immense power over the fundamental functions of our society. More than any other tech giant, Facebook's power feels like an immediate threat and the most plausible first target for congressional action. Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) has already laid out20 different measuresthat would rein in Facebook and other tech giants, ranging from GDPR-style data portability requirements to more carveouts of Section 230. But while Warner's measures focus on nudging Facebook toward more responsible behavior, a growing number of critics see the problem as Facebook itself. It may be that a social network with more than 2 billion users is simply too big to be managed responsibly, and no amount of moderators or regulators will be able to meaningfully rein the company in. For those critics, social networks are a natural monopoly, and no amount of portability requirements will ever produce a meaningful competitor to Facebook or a meaningful check on its power. If that's true, a classical antitrust breakup (as some have suggested) would seem like the only option. The best example is the breakup of AT T, which saw the telecom giant's local phone business split into 'baby bells, each bound by serious geographical and regulatory restrictions. It's the classic example of how to cut a giant company into smaller companies without disrupting service. Public Knowledge's Harold Feld has beenthinking hardabout how that model might apply to Facebook. Feld is best known as a telecom lawyer, but he's become increasingly interested in how the telecom model fits into the new platform era. The obvious answer is to approach it like Google: blocking future acquisitions and breaking off side products like WhatsApp and Instagram. But if the problem is the all-consuming size of the network, splitting off networks may lead to what Feld calls the 'starfish problem. 'If you tear up a starfish, the pieces regrow and now instead of one starfish you have five starfish, says Feld. 'If you're going to split up Facebook, what's to prevent it from becoming three Facebooks, each one dominant in its particular market segment? That's a hard problem for antitrust. Facebook would be less powerful without WhatsApp and Instagram, in Feld's view, but it wouldn't be entirely de-fanged. Facebook Messenger could pick up most of the slack from WhatsApp, while Facebook photo-sharing tools might start to resemble the severed Instagram in response. You could prohibit Facebook from making any products involving photo-sharing or mobile messaging, but even that wouldn't touch the broader problem of how to govern a universal network. 'It's not that we shouldn't think about a breakup, says Feld. 'It's that we shouldthinkabout a breakup. You have to consider how you're going to address these problems. For Feld, the only complete fix is a specific platform regulation bill akin to the Telecom Act that spells out a new set of requirements for privacy, moderation, and all the other issues that have dogged Facebook in recent years. That's a lot for Congress to handle, but there may be no other way through. 'We're not going to solve it all at once, says Feld. 'We need a new and comprehensive law that will address these issues because they've come to have an enormous and out-sized impact on our lives.

It now seems like \"a quaint relic of the company's early days, when the crayon colours of the Google logo still conveyed the cheerful, idealistic spirit of the enterprise. How long ago that feels.\" The opening lines of Rana Foroohar's new book, Don't Be Evil: The Case Against Big Tech, are not only spot on, her timing is also perfect. Sergey Brin and Larry Page announced last week that they were stepping down as leaders at Alphabet, the parent company of Google, the search engine that the pair founded two decades ago, prompting many to question their record.</p><p>Critics say what started as a benign endeavour to organise the world's information and make it available to all has turned into a corporate Big Brother. The charge sheet is so lengthy it could take up most of this page, but here are some of Google's worst sins: Hoovering up our vast digital footprint and using it to deliver hyper-targeted advertisements. Abusing the dominance of its search platform - Google accounts for 93% of search queries worldwide - to promote its own services over those of its rivals. Slashing - legally - its tax bills by setting up webs of overseas companies to funnel revenues away from high-tax economies, such as Britain and Germany, to tax havens.</p><p>Flogging online ads to Russian agents, enabling them to spread misinformation and manipulate the 2016 US presidential election. Publishing extremist material on YouTube, which Google owns, including videos on how to make bombs. Looking the other way on copyright - impoverishing newspapers, magazines, authors, film-makers and musicians.</p><p>Latterly, Brin and Page have been battling their own staff, who have revolted over Google's contracts with the American military and plans - now shelved - to create a Chinese search engine censored by Beijing. Last year 20,000 Google employees walked out over sexual harassment, discrimination and pay inequality.</p><p>It was not always that way, as I found out when I first stepped off a bio-dieselpowered bus and walked through the glistening glass-and-steel curves of the vast Googleplex in Silicon Valley in 2007. Back then, Brin and Page were in fine fettle - and not just because of all the free muesli and massages available in \"the Plex\". The world's most successful business double act had convinced themselves and most of the rest of us that they were not just newer, shinier, smarter and, yes, richer than the average entrepreneur, but they were also better because they had a higher moral calling.</p><p>Google would never be like Microsoft, then the poster boy for aggressive monopolistic behaviour. As Page and Brin put it in their 2004 founders' IPO (stock market float) letter: \"Google is not a conventional company. We do not intend to become one.\"</p><p>There was nothing sinister about their mission to record, categorise and index \"all the world's information\" and make it available online. They were merely latterday explorers, mapping human knowledge to help mankind navigate the new information economy. When I raised privacy concerns, they said I'd got the wrong end of the memory stick. Not a single byte of my Google-generated data would ever be made available - far less flogged - to advertisers.</p><p>What went wrong? Why did scrappy, innovative digital utopians become rapacious, arrogant capitalists? Money. Page and Brin soon realised that their hippie-ish dream could be the best cash machine capitalism had ever seen - and that sounded a lot more fun than running a free global public library.</p><p>By dicing and splicing the quadrillions of bytes of data that surge across Google's servers every few minutes, they could enable advertisers to target consumers precisely and effectively and charge a premium for it. So they did. Their company rakes in more than $100bn (\u00a376bn) in advertising revenue each year, helping it to a market value close to $1 trillion.</p><p>\"Google has been the pioneer of big data, targeted advertising and surveillance capitalism,\" Foroohar says. \"When it advised its employees not to be evil, it did so because it knew full well that evil was more than a powerful temptation. Evil was baked into the business plan.\"</p><p>Google insists it uses \"data to make our services more useful and to show relevant advertising and we give people the controls to manage, delete or transfer their data\". It adds that it is improving tools that let users limit how much data is captured and how long it is kept. Critics claim few people use these tools or even know they exist.</p><p>Until recently - and for far longer than others such as Facebook, Uber and Amazon, whose reputations have been tarnished by consumer and regulatory backlash - Brin and Page continued to pull the wool over most people's eyes. It was not hard to see why. Google makes whizzy, free software - not only the best search engine but services that we use every day such as Gmail, Maps, Docs, spreadsheets, YouTube and Waze.</p><p>Android software powers three-quarters of the world's smartphones. YouTube has all but supplanted television for many.</p><p>Yet the penny has finally dropped that Google's teeth are as sharp as the other Faangs - Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Netflix. As Rob Cox, a leading American technology writer, puts it: \"Underneath the haughty language of moral superiority lies the same profit motive that drives all business - and a ruthlessness rivalling history's greatest industrial bullies.\"</p><p>In her book, Foroohar lays the blame at Brin and Page's door, but also says regulators have been dazzled by the \"free\" services the tech giants offer - missing the point that we all \"pay dearly with our data and our attention\". Regulatory \"get out of jail free cards\" have enabled the \"tech bros\" to become the modern equivalent of 19th-century \"railroad barons\" who were also \"able to drive competitors out of business and avoid taxation and regulation\".</p><p>That is beginning to change. The European Commission launched a fresh investigation into how Google and the companies it works with gather, process, use and monetise data last week. It has already fined the company more than (EURO)8bn (\u00a36.7bn) for anti-competitive practices. The US justice department, Federal Trade Commission and House judiciary committee are pursuing inquiries into potential antitrust violations by leading technology firms, including Google.</p><p>Authorities on both sides of the Atlantic are trying to close loopholes to force Google and the other tech behemoths to pay more tax. Boris Johnson has vowed to impose a digital sales tax of 2% of the UK revenues of big tech outfits. California has proposed that a \"digital dividend\" be paid by data collectors to the owners of this resource - people living in the state.</p><p>Germany has laws requiring platforms to delete illegal content within 24 hours of being notified or face large fines. Australia is considering similar legislation. To protect copyright, two anti-piracy bills have been proposed in America.</p><p>Page and Brin, both now 46, steadfastly refuse to engage with their company's critics. A chair labelled \"Google\" was left conspicuously empty at last year's congressional hearings into statesponsored election meddling on Capitol Hill. When you are worth $50bn each, you can get away with stuff like that.</p><p>Sundar Pichai, the new chief executive of Alphabet, will have no such luxury. He will be spending less time talking to his flip-flop-wearing staff and more time jousting with buttoned-up lawyers, regulators and legislators.</p><p>\"The next chapter is going to be a lot around policy, data privacy and regulation,\" points out Gene Munster, an analyst with Loup Ventures.</p><p>Or, to put it another way, the announcement by Brin and Page that they are leaving the Googleplex formally marks the end of the free-wheeling era in Silicon Valley. We've reached a tipping point - that has tipped the dynamic duo off their golden Segways.</p><p>Perhaps it's a good thing they will be spending more time with their flying cars and other \"moonshots\". They might come up with the next Google and we can fall in love with them all over again.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Larry Page, left, and Sergey Brin convinced themselves that not only were they smarter than every other entrepreneur, they also had a higher moral calling</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STIMES-155491063</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XP4-SSM1-DYTY-C1D6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">332263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1345\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"57900\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Scotland</edition><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 8, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It also trotted out the first 15-inch laptop with an AMOLED screen at CES this year and battled rival Dell to be the first to deliver a gaming notebook with a 240hz display. Now we have its Elite Dragonfly[2], which is the \"world's lightest 13-inch business convertible.\" Despite the caveats, that's an impressive achievement as its magnesium frame comes in at under one kilo and still packs more impressive specs than Samsung's Galaxy Book S. It has an eighth-gen Intel Core vPro CPU and can run for up to 16.5 hours on battery. It even has a top-mounted webcam (with sliding cover) that is Windows Hello-capable.

UBS was brilliant 12 months, 14 months ago on Sterling. The world was coming to an end as we know, and you said, no, Sterling stability and even some Sterling strength. I guess the world is coming to an end for the dollar. Can you look for dollar stability or dollar strength?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FIOTAKIS</emphasis>:  Definitely, we cannot extrapolate the pace of depreciation as it has been. But part of what you call Sterling stability has been the fact the dollar has weakened across a number of currencies, including Sterling. So the big dollar driver is there and there are very fundamental drivers that mean we still have a little bit further dollar weakness to go in the months ahead. Maybe not at this pace, but definitely the direction is there.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  So what kind of level are you looking at?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FIOTAKIS</emphasis>:  So for the euro-dollar, we have 1.25 for this year and 1.30 for next year and that's about it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  OK.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Themos Fiotakis, we will continue this conversation with UBS. Lots to talk about on foreign exchange today.  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  We are back with Themos Fiotakis of UBS. Themos, I think I have a euro trade wage chart, which actually I'd love to show you if we can bring that up on stage. So this is -- I don't know if there's a difference between trade wage or this is the real one that we're looking at. And where do you expect that to go depending on how markets perceive the ECB?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FIOTAKIS</emphasis>:  So I think what captions this very nice trade-weighted chart is that the euro has been for a while undervalued. Part of the reason why it has been undervalued is the exception of values of the ECB. Even today, the European bonds are the most expensive in the world among the major countries. European yields are way too low. And as the ECB exits, this should correct the fair value and this is for bunds. It's somewhere between 1 and 1.3. But keep in mind that they will still be buying bonds for the majority of this year and they will be absorbing more than the supply of German revenue bunds. So yields will be under control.  </p><p>      And even if they tweak their forward guidance, they will be making very sure that they actually imprint it on the market's minds that this is going to happen sometime a lot later after they actually stop purchasing bonds, potentially in 2019 story. And that has been actually in the core of some of the comments that we have seen in the recent weeks as the euro has been rising a little bit faster than we would have expected.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  OK. So what are you expecting ECB policy to actually be?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FIOTAKIS</emphasis>:  So gradually --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  And policy and asset purchase by December?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FIOTAKIS</emphasis>:  Yes, by the end of the year, they will have ramped it up and sometime in the middle of next year it's going to be hikes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  I look, Themos, at the optimal price of euro. I've never seen an academic or market study that says the euro is an intelligent system, you've got too many different economies. Single point optimum German euro where are chance (inaudible) euro. And as a point of discussion, look at Italy flat on its back granted recovering on a per capita basis, what's the optimum Italian value for Euro?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FIOTAKIS</emphasis>:  Always, and all of these models, there's a wide differential.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Yes, yes, yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FIOTAKIS</emphasis>:  Double-digit --  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Yes, I know. Right. And correct me, (inaudible) made you say that, right?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FIOTAKIS</emphasis>:  No, I actually. I think we would agree on that. But I think that what is really important for aggregate for the euro area, the euro being monetary union is still competitive at 1.30 for the euro-dollar and that includes also Italy, which has not -- but when the euro does well, Italy does well as well. Maybe it would've done better if the euro was lower. But it will continue to do it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  This is really important. In the Italian election, you are suggesting the currency dynamics are the litmus paper of currency is the secondary or tertiary indicator of how well Italy will do in the future?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FIOTAKIS</emphasis>:  That's right and even further more now that you mentioned the Italian elections, we actually view the election as a catalyst that will unlock some risk premium of the positive catalyst.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  OK.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FIOTAKIS</emphasis>:  Italy still maintains one of the very wide risk premiums out there and the fundamentals are a lot better than perceived by the market.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  OK. Well, let's rip up the script here and go to your political analysts' best outcomes for Italy? Does it involved -- first I tell you, what is the coalition that is the best outcome for Italy and for that advanced risk premium?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FIOTAKIS</emphasis>:  Well, the statement we have made is, obviously, the dynamics and how the votes here have shifted, of course, Italian makes a coalition more likely and a coalition which now sees very little scope for revising any kind of euro acceptance in Italian referendum.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  But what happens to reforms?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FIOTAKIS</emphasis>:  Well, reforms, it depends on what the pricing is. The pricing is still for recession. At the same time, you have risk premium and Italian bonds, you have (inaudible) which are quite trading quite poorly, and you have GDP which is recovering. Not just per capita basis. Unemployment rate (inaudible) decline and all of this has not been in the price primarily because people are worried about the instability that elections may trigger. So any kind of coalition that is actually viable is --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Is constructive.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FIOTAKIS</emphasis>:  At least for the next six months.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Very good. Themos, thank you so much and we will continue. Mr. Fiotakis is with UBS.  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  We're back to talk currencies with Themos Fiotakis of UBS. Themos, when you look at pound, do you look at cable or does euro-pound give you a different story?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FIOTAKIS</emphasis>:  I think euro-pound is very important to watch now, now that euro-dollar has actually moved cable higher come. All this stability, which is still stability despite the fact that the euro-Sterling is grinding higher with pound stability, there is one underlying factor behind this. And U.K. is a very global economy, have a lot of global-based firms, such as the one we are in here and the surge in global profits has actually been reflected in the U.K.'s current account, the U.K.'s current account has improved, the balance of flows into the U.K. has improved because of global deflation.  </p><p>      Now, to me, the fact that we are not trading stronger despite global reflation, despite the Bank of England tightening, despite the fact that we have had a year where the data is printed better than the community would have expected, it makes you think that the underlying current for Sterling is actually still to weaken against the euro. And potentially gradually as long as global reflation continues, we will see this grind higher, euro-Sterling grind higher.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  OK. Are there any kind of different pairs that we don't often look at? I mean Tom was joking that we're looking at Polish zloty, but I don't know if there's a pound zloty dynamic duo that you're looking at.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FIOTAKIS</emphasis>:  There's definitely a lot of these ideas to think.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FIOTAKIS</emphasis>:  Sterling and Swiss will probably underperform Central and Eastern European currencies (inaudible). So these are some interesting classes to think about.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  See how he answered that question without giving us a currency pair?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  But he is good.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  That is a rare skill. OK, Czech Swiss (inaudible) I'll make a chart of it and put out on Twitter. You'll see it first up there. Czech Swiss, I think that's C-H-S, hyphen, C-Z-K. Did I get that right?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FIOTAKIS</emphasis>:  That's right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Oh, wow.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Oh, my word. Bonus round. Themos Fiotakis is with us of UBS on the comparison of the Swiss Franc to the Czech. What is it Krona?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FIOTAKIS</emphasis>:  Krona.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Krona to be here in Mexico. Czech-krona, OK, we'll do that.  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Thomas Fiotakis with us of UBS and Kona Haque. I'm thrilled to have you on set. I was fascinated by your analysis of robust and coffee. We can bring up the chart here of coffee and a slowdown in all that. Is the analysis in trading of soft the same as it was 10 or 20 years ago or vague into a revolution in commodity just like everything else?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAQUE</emphasis>:  Yes. To a certain extent, they have. And analysis is very much broadly still supply and demand. Ultimately for agricultural commodities, it is very supply-side driven, because demand tends to be very constant in coffees going stable 2 percent per year. But it is supply that drives that, because it's growing tropical countries. So what is the weather in Brazil, what's the weather in Vietnam?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Yes. So it sounds like it was 20, 30 years ago. But within your coffee analysis, Brazil, I get the usual names, there is the new kid on the block, Vietnam as well. So is there a new complexity which makes it harder for commodity traders to get on trend?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAQUE</emphasis>:  I think what sets coffee apart from the rest is that actual on the ground supply for the information is not really prevalent. You don't have the USDA that's constantly reporting on what the production was at all.  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Exactly. Where as for coffee, you really have to be on the ground, literally counting the cherries on the tree to see how big the crop is going to be. And you are right, there is Vietnam, there's Honduras, there's Columbia, there's Mexico, Peru. You have to agronomist on the group to literally count the numbers.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Yes. Is it different from cocoa? And I don't know whether we do have a cocoa chart, right, but this was one of the first things that I did.  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  She doesn't do this at any day but Friday. I have to discover a cocoa chart right now?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  The cocoa, this is depending on drought, this is depending on a lot of producers where you have social unrest, such as the Ivory Coast.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAQUE</emphasis>:  Yes, yes, absolutely. It is, again, boots on the ground. That is the only way you can find out really what is happening to those production, because it is not large necessarily scale. It is usually one man and his hectare of land.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  OK. So Kona, if you look at the kind of soft commodity landscape, what will do well in 2018?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAQUE</emphasis>:  Well, it is tricky. I mean you just talk about oil that's method (ph). There's I think on the back of a strong economic global growth, those look quite positive, particularly if we have a weaker U.S. dollar. As some people are saying, again, that's mostly for commodities. But soft in grains, generally, I don't think we're going to share that uplift in commodities, because the story, fundamentally, is not quite there.  </p><p>      Both sugar and grains right now are very well supplied. So we have oversupplied that, so price should stay under pressure. Coffee, technically, is in a deficit. But the 2018 crops will be large. So fund futures will be looking ahead at big crops and so they will be looking to discount that.  </p><p>      So I don't think you're going to see the kind of push up in prices in these crops as you've seen in (inaudible).  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Yes. And one more question on cocoa. Actually, I make a joke about it, Francine, but I'm thrilled you brought it up. Cocoa has always been the volatility of it. You can get on it, you can play the game. Is there still a depth of market in the sauce (ph) that you followed for years? Is there still enough of a game being played where it's a good bid, it's a good ask to tic?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAQUE</emphasis>:  Yes, I think so. I think that very much depends on if you have insight that other people don't necessarily have. But something has changed fundamentally from 20 to 30 years ago.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  What is that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAQUE</emphasis>:  It is the amount of system funds that are involved in the futures market. They now are probably 50 percent to 60 percent off the total open interest.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Wow.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAQUE</emphasis>:  And they don't follow fundamentals.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  They're doing almost a black box on cocoa or coffee?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAQUE</emphasis>:  Yes. And it's very difficult to trade that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Do they make out from that, do they make money on that? I am fascinated from you on the trenches of what you think of bitcoin. I believe bitcoin is not a soft. So if you don't want to talk about it, I get it. But you have been in the battle of commodities, getting it right, getting it wrong, making a ton of money going down in flames. What are your thoughts when you look at the bid-ask quality of bitcoin?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAQUE</emphasis>:  Well, that is tricky, because I've been so used to looking at markets on a fundamental basis. I am struggling to understand the fundamental of bitcoin. I understand that by 2040, you can't produce that many because of mining system finishes. The demand then depends on the likes of Amazon adopting it as a currency. But then you have this new thing where you have regulators who are not necessarily going for it or (inaudible) government. And that to me feels a bit scary.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Themos can't wait to talk bitcoin. I knew it was coming. Do you want to talk about bitcoin or actually you wanted just to talk? This is like a free get out of jail card. You can also talk about commodity nations and what is that or currency.  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Please.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FIOTAKIS</emphasis>:  The fact that soft commodities are going to be in -- not going up so fast is very important for merging markets. By far, the biggest driver of inflation for merging is soft commodities. And the fact that it haven't split means emerging market inflation is probably going to be Czech despite the higher oil price.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  You see how you avoided bitcoin there.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Let's get that --  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  It was like a master -- when you look at emerging markets, though, Themos, a lot of the gains that we have seen have to do with artificial intelligence, right? And some of the components, for example, that's driving equity stocks down, right, wood tech, chips, and the like. Is it the same for currency or do investors look at things such as commodities, inflation, and anything in between?  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FIOTAKIS</emphasis>:  Definitely, the theme for emerging markets has been this year the equity side and particularly the tech side. I have to say, though, that the theme is broadening out because primarily of how strong China is in the background, how strong Chinese consumption is in the background. So if you're looking for the next equity theme in emerging markets, I think the China consumption story is going to take (ph).  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Is china part of soft?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAQUE</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Is it a growing part?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAQUE</emphasis>:  Definitely, for sure there.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Give us a quick example -- I want to come back on this, but give us a quick example of China in soft. Is it cotton?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAQUE</emphasis>:  Cotton, sugar, coffee, in a declining order.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Cotton, sugar, and coffee.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAQUE</emphasis>:  Or obviously before that, the soybeans.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Do I know Chinese sugar? When I have Chinese sugar, is it just sort of going?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAQUE</emphasis>:  Sorry, I am talking about consumption.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Oh, consumption, I am talking about what they make. They make cotton, right, cotton, cotton, cotto.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAQUE</emphasis>:  But even then, they have mastered importer, China is still an importer.  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAQUE</emphasis>:  Because they have a big tech sales industry.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAQUE</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  How much do they consume? So we were trying to figure out the China GDP story. Yesterday, it was -- they're going to use less of the commodities for infrastructure, because a lot of them has already been used. So that will have longer-term impact on (inaudible) copper, zinc, and the like. Do they drink coffee? And will they drink less coffee this year?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAQUE</emphasis>:  So if they follow the path of Japan and South Korea have been doing, then yes, we think that they make that move from traditional tea to old coffee. And certainly, Starbucks is opening as shop every other day in the main cities of China. So, yes, that whole western coffee coach is definitely is growing.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FIOTAKIS</emphasis>:  Generally speaking, across different parts of commodity spectrum, this is why the ball is the QE dollar that supplies a lot of food, particularly China.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  There you go. Themos Fiotakis with UBS. Kona, thank you so much for joining us. It's wonderful that you're with ED&amp;F Man as well.  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  With us today, Themos Fiotakis of UBS. We're going to chart out a single chart. You know it's going to be single best chart. It's going to be our newest dollar. This is the Bloomberg dollar index that we've zoomed in to a short-term deal. I've (inaudible) on Twitter for Radio London here in a bit. And it's a kind of chart that comes down, we go September, lows up we go and we roll over again. As you mentioned, Themos, at the beginning of the hour, we've got some acceleration, we've got some gamma, gamma, gamma, we're plunging down here. Let's start with the why. Why do we have the sudden drop? Why do we have the gamma and dollar right now, weak dollar?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FIOTAKIS</emphasis>:  Well, you have a number of different factors. The most important driver of all of these tactics in the short-term is the ongoing easing in financial conditions, easier financial conditions driven by growth. You have higher equities, you have higher oil prices, weaker dollar, it's all basically endogenous. And you also have a couple of events, including the government shutdown, which maybe exacerbating some of the --  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  OK. But there is also -- within those type one ideas, it is this, it's this, it's this. It is also what's not going out on, what is not going on is inflation. Or does UBS see inflation percolating?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FIOTAKIS</emphasis>:  Look, I mean it is not going on now, but you have a weaker dollar which hasn't yet fed through the numbers. You have higher oil prices. These things, even arithmetically around the middle f the year may bring U.S. headline, CPI inflation close to 3 percent  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  All right. What about --  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  That is quite a statement. You are predicting 3 percent U.S. inflation?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FIOTAKIS</emphasis>:  Yes, a little below that. But if the dollar now continues, go like this around the middle of the year, again very specifically on the year, headline CPI will jump.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  But Themos, what does that mean for treasuries? I mean if CPI is, or PCU, which is maybe the preferred term for Fed (inaudible), it could be -- they could tightened significantly quite violently.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FIOTAKIS</emphasis>:  Look, I think that for now, we need some inflation, because the worry has been that we are not delivering some of that. At the same time, I think that what -- the front end, what has allowed the market to price in more Fed hikes has been strong equities. If they hike in an environment of financial conditions are easing, equities are strong, growth is strong, the market will absorb it. It's not going to be an issue. The curve will flatten, move invert, and the market will absorb it. And given that a lot of that is priced in on the long-end of the curve, and the U.S. is going to have lesser that stock in the dollar.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Are there bubbles anywhere in the market? And would that be the trigger?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FIOTAKIS</emphasis>:  Bubble is a difficult word to use. There are points of vulnerability. For instance, we have highlighted that parts of the U.S. high yields credit spectrum, the very low end of the credit quality is more susceptible to higher rates. And that is going to underperform, some of our trade recommendations have some of that color.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Well, let's get back. I don't know if the chart (inaudible), but you mentioned Eastern Europe is a place where you could see some real movement. Those are more Trump-like governments right now. There has been real political changes or noise better said, there has been noise. Is that good noise for their currencies? Does that develop sort of an authoritarian certitude that leads to stronger currencies?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FIOTAKIS</emphasis>:  So the smaller of an economy, it will move away from the states and the likes and we go into small open economy. They are mostly reflecting how they are positioned in the global set up. These economies have rebalanced significantly, whereas (inaudible). They have recovered quite significantly so that other gaps are closed. And at the same time, they are benefiting a lot from strength in Europe. And at the same time, they have better --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Economic strengths, are they harmed by a stronger euro? I mean that's what Draghi -- what Draghi does, does it matter for the Baltic States on down south?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FIOTAKIS</emphasis>:  It does matter, and for sure it creates a signal with respect to how their own Central Banks are priced and we're going to be talking about broad statement basically.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Themos, you haven't even talked on yen.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FIOTAKIS</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACUQA</emphasis>:  Why? What is your call on yen? Do we know -- does it actually get impacted by inflation expectations, or it could be impacted by the fact that Governor Kuroda may not get another term?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FIOTAKIS</emphasis>:  Hugely, by all of these factors. The first and most important thing to keep in mind is that Japan has a Phillips curve and it is inflating. And that's what our economist, James Macron s actually projecting. As inflation expectations go up in Japan, real rates compress. That should drive the yen initially weaker. As the yen weakens, inflation picks up. The Bank of Japan should revise its inflation target and yield curve target higher by 20 basis points or so. And this creates opportunities, both for the yen and for the yield curve, which is steepened there and bonds actually getting some light after spending a lot of time doing nothing.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  But Themos, if Governor Kuroda were to step down or not be reappointed or choose to retire, whatever you want to call it, then would his legacy be --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FIOTAKIS</emphasis>:  Live on?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Yes, success.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FIOTAKIS</emphasis>:  I think that you have to think of what kind of like succeeds him. And the names that have flown around in the press, they're very dovish (ph), all the names.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  This has been great.

UBS was brilliant 12  months, 14 months ago on Sterling.  The world was coming to an end as we  know, and you said, no, Sterling stability and even some Sterling strength.   I guess the world is coming to an end for the dollar.  Can you look for  dollar stability or dollar strength?</p><p> THEMOS FIOTAKIS, CO-HEAD FX &amp; RATES, UBS:  Definitely, we cannot  extrapolate the pace of depreciation as it has been.  But part of what you  call Sterling stability has been the fact the dollar has weakened across a  number of currencies, including Sterling.  So the big dollar driver is  there and there are very fundamental drivers that mean we still have a  little bit further dollar weakness to go in the months ahead.  Maybe not at  this pace, but definitely the direction is there.</p><p> FRANCINE LACQUA, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  So what kind of level are you looking  at?</p><p> FIOTAKIS:  So for the euro-dollar, we have 1.25 for this year and 1.30 for  next year and that's about it.</p><p> LACQUA:  OK.</p><p> KEENE:  Themos Fiotakis, we will continue this conversation with UBS.  Lots  to talk about on foreign exchange today.</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> LACQUA:  We are back with Themos Fiotakis of UBS.  Themos, I think I have a  euro trade wage chart, which actually I'd love to show you if we can bring  that up on stage.  So this is -- I don't know if there's a difference  between trade wage or this is the real one that we're looking at.  And  where do you expect that to go depending on how markets perceive the ECB?</p><p> FIOTAKIS:  So I think what captions this very nice trade-weighted chart is  that the euro has been for a while undervalued.  Part of the reason why it  has been undervalued is the exception of values of the ECB.  Even today,  the European bonds are the most expensive in the world among the major  countries.  European yields are way too low.  And as the ECB exits, this  should correct the fair value and this is for bunds.  It's somewhere  between 1 and 1.3.  But keep in mind that they will still be buying bonds  for the majority of this year and they will be absorbing more than the  supply of German revenue bunds.  So yields will be under control.</p><p> And even if they tweak their forward guidance, they will be making very  sure that they actually imprint it on the market's minds that this is going  to happen sometime a lot later after they actually stop purchasing bonds,  potentially in 2019 story.  And that has been actually in the core of some  of the comments that we have seen in the recent weeks as the euro has been  rising a little bit faster than we would have expected.</p><p> LACQUA:  OK.  So what are you expecting ECB policy to actually be?</p><p> FIOTAKIS:  So gradually --</p><p> LACQUA:  And policy and asset purchase by December?</p><p> FIOTAKIS:  Yes, by the end of the year, they will have ramped it up and  sometime in the middle of next year it's going to be hikes.</p><p> KEENE:  I look, Themos, at the optimal price of euro.  I've never seen an  academic or market study that says the euro is an intelligent system,  you've got too many different economies.  Single point optimum German euro  where are chance (inaudible) euro.  And as a point of discussion, look at  Italy flat on its back granted recovering on a per capita basis, what's the  optimum Italian value for Euro?</p><p> FIOTAKIS:  Always, and all of these models, there's a wide differential.</p><p> KEENE:  Yes, yes, yes.</p><p> FIOTAKIS:  Double-digit --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> KEENE:  Yes, I know.  Right.  And correct me, (inaudible) made you say  that, right?</p><p> FIOTAKIS:  No, I actually.  I think we would agree on that.  But I think  that what is really important for aggregate for the euro area, the euro  being monetary union is still competitive at 1.30 for the euro-dollar and  that includes also Italy, which has not -- but when the euro does well,  Italy does well as well.  Maybe it would've done better if the euro was  lower.  But it will continue to do it.</p><p> KEENE:  This is really important.  In the Italian election, you are  suggesting the currency dynamics are the litmus paper of currency is the  secondary or tertiary indicator of how well Italy will do in the future?</p><p> FIOTAKIS:  That's right and even further more now that you mentioned the  Italian elections, we actually view the election as a catalyst that will  unlock some risk premium of the positive catalyst.</p><p> KEENE:  OK.</p><p> FIOTAKIS:  Italy still maintains one of the very wide risk premiums out  there and the fundamentals are a lot better than perceived by the market.</p><p> KEENE:  OK.  Well, let's rip up the script here and go to your political  analysts' best outcomes for Italy?  Does it involved -- first I tell you,  what is the coalition that is the best outcome for Italy and for that  advanced risk premium?</p><p> FIOTAKIS:  Well, the statement we have made is, obviously, the dynamics and  how the votes here have shifted, of course, Italian makes a coalition more  likely and a coalition which now sees very little scope for revising any  kind of euro acceptance in Italian referendum.</p><p> LACQUA:  But what happens to reforms?</p><p> FIOTAKIS:  Well, reforms, it depends on what the pricing is.  The pricing  is still for recession.  At the same time, you have risk premium and  Italian bonds, you have (inaudible) which are quite trading quite poorly,  and you have GDP which is recovering.  Not just per capita basis.   Unemployment rate (inaudible) decline and all of this has not been in the  price primarily because people are worried about the instability that  elections may trigger.  So any kind of coalition that is actually viable is  --</p><p> KEENE:  Is constructive.</p><p> FIOTAKIS:  At least for the next six months.</p><p> KEENE:  Very good.  Themos, thank you so much and we will continue.  Mr.  Fiotakis is with UBS.</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> LACQUA:  We're back to talk currencies with Themos Fiotakis of UBS.   Themos, when you look at pound, do you look at cable or does euro-pound  give you a different story?</p><p> FIOTAKIS:  I think euro-pound is very important to watch now, now that  euro-dollar has actually moved cable higher come.  All this stability,  which is still stability despite the fact that the euro-Sterling is  grinding higher with pound stability, there is one underlying factor behind  this.  And U.K. is a very global economy, have a lot of global-based firms,  such as the one we are in here and the surge in global profits has actually  been reflected in the U.K.'s current account, the U.K.'s current account  has improved, the balance of flows into the U.K. has improved because of  global deflation.</p><p> Now, to me, the fact that we are not trading stronger despite global  reflation, despite the Bank of England tightening, despite the fact that we  have had a year where the data is printed better than the community would  have expected, it makes you think that the underlying current for Sterling  is actually still to weaken against the euro.  And potentially gradually as  long as global reflation continues, we will see this grind higher, euro- Sterling grind higher.</p><p> LACQUA:  OK.  Are there any kind of different pairs that we don't often  look at?  I mean Tom was joking that we're looking at Polish zloty, but I  don't know if there's a pound zloty dynamic duo that you're looking at.</p><p> FIOTAKIS:  There's definitely a lot of these ideas to think.</p><p> KEENE:  Yes.</p><p> FIOTAKIS:  Sterling and Swiss will probably underperform Central and  Eastern European currencies (inaudible).  So these are some interesting  classes to think about.</p><p> KEENE:  See how he answered that question without giving us a currency  pair?</p><p> LACQUA:  But he is good.</p><p> KEENE:  That is a rare skill.  OK, Czech Swiss (inaudible) I'll make a  chart of it and put out on Twitter.  You'll see it first up there.  Czech  Swiss, I think that's C-H-S, hyphen, C-Z-K.  Did I get that right?</p><p> FIOTAKIS:  That's right.</p><p> LACQUA:  Oh, wow.</p><p> KEENE:  Oh, my word.  Bonus round.  Themos Fiotakis is with us of UBS on  the comparison of the Swiss Franc to the Czech.  What is it Krona?</p><p> FIOTAKIS:  Krona.</p><p> KEENE:  Krona to be here in Mexico.  Czech-krona, OK, we'll do that.</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> KEENE:  Thomas Fiotakis with us of UBS and Kona Haque.  I'm thrilled to  have you on set.  I was fascinated by your analysis of robust and coffee.   We can bring up the chart here of coffee and a slowdown in all that.  Is  the analysis in trading of soft the same as it was 10 or 20 years ago or  vague into a revolution in commodity just like everything else?</p><p> KONA HAQUE, HEAD OF GROUP RESEARCH, ED&amp;F MAN:  Yes.  To a certain extent,  they have.  And analysis is very much broadly still supply and demand.   Ultimately for agricultural commodities, it is very supply-side driven,  because demand tends to be very constant in coffees going stable 2 percent  per year.  But it is supply that drives that, because it's growing tropical  countries.  So what is the weather in Brazil, what's the weather in  Vietnam?</p><p> KEENE:  Yes.  So it sounds like it was 20, 30 years ago.  But within your  coffee analysis, Brazil, I get the usual names, there is the new kid on the  block, Vietnam as well.  So is there a new complexity which makes it harder  for commodity traders to get on trend?</p><p> HAQUE:  I think what sets coffee apart from the rest is that actual on the  ground supply for the information is not really prevalent.  You don't have  the USDA that's constantly reporting on what the production was at all.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> KEENE:  Exactly.  Where as for coffee, you really have to be on the ground,  literally counting the cherries on the tree to see how big the crop is  going to be.  And you are right, there is Vietnam, there's Honduras,  there's Columbia, there's Mexico, Peru.  You have to agronomist on the  group to literally count the numbers.</p><p> LACQUA:  Yes.  Is it different from cocoa?  And I don't know whether we do  have a cocoa chart, right, but this was one of the first things that I did.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> KEENE:  She doesn't do this at any day but Friday.  I have to discover a  cocoa chart right now?</p><p> LACQUA:  The cocoa, this is depending on drought, this is depending on a  lot of producers where you have social unrest, such as the Ivory Coast.</p><p> HAQUE:  Yes, yes, absolutely.  It is, again, boots on the ground.  That is  the only way you can find out really what is happening to those production,  because it is not large necessarily scale.  It is usually one man and his  hectare of land.</p><p> LACQUA:  OK.  So Kona, if you look at the kind of soft commodity landscape,  what will do well in 2018?</p><p> HAQUE:  Well, it is tricky.  I mean you just talk about oil that's method  (ph).  There's I think on the back of a strong economic global growth,  those look quite positive, particularly if we have a weaker U.S. dollar.   As some people are saying, again, that's mostly for commodities.  But soft  in grains, generally, I don't think we're going to share that uplift in  commodities, because the story, fundamentally, is not quite there.</p><p> Both sugar and grains right now are very well supplied.  So we have  oversupplied that, so price should stay under pressure.  Coffee,  technically, is in a deficit.  But the 2018 crops will be large.  So fund  futures will be looking ahead at big crops and so they will be looking to  discount that.</p><p> So I don't think you're going to see the kind of push up in prices in these  crops as you've seen in (inaudible).</p><p> KEENE:  Yes.  And one more question on cocoa.  Actually, I make a joke  about it, Francine, but I'm thrilled you brought it up.  Cocoa has always  been the volatility of it.  You can get on it, you can play the game.  Is  there still a depth of market in the sauce (ph) that you followed for  years?  Is there still enough of a game being played where it's a good bid,  it's a good ask to tic?</p><p> HAQUE:  Yes, I think so.  I think that very much depends on if you have  insight that other people don't necessarily have.  But something has  changed fundamentally from 20 to 30 years ago.</p><p> KEENE:  What is that?</p><p> HAQUE:  It is the amount of system funds that are involved in the futures  market.  They now are probably 50 percent to 60 percent off the total open  interest.</p><p> KEENE:  Wow.</p><p> HAQUE:  And they don't follow fundamentals.</p><p> KEENE:  They're doing almost a black box on cocoa or coffee?</p><p> HAQUE:  Yes.  And it's very difficult to trade that.</p><p> KEENE:  Do they make out from that, do they make money on that?  I am  fascinated from you on the trenches of what you think of bitcoin.  I  believe bitcoin is not a soft.  So if you don't want to talk about it, I  get it.  But you have been in the battle of commodities, getting it right,  getting it wrong, making a ton of money going down in flames.  What are  your thoughts when you look at the bid-ask quality of bitcoin?</p><p> HAQUE:  Well, that is tricky, because I've been so used to looking at  markets on a fundamental basis.  I am struggling to understand the  fundamental of bitcoin.  I understand that by 2040, you can't produce that  many because of mining system finishes.  The demand then depends on the  likes of Amazon adopting it as a currency.  But then you have this new  thing where you have regulators who are not necessarily going for it or  (inaudible) government.  And that to me feels a bit scary.</p><p> LACQUA:  Themos can't wait to talk bitcoin.  I knew it was coming.  Do you  want to talk about bitcoin or actually you wanted just to talk?  This is  like a free get out of jail card.  You can also talk about commodity  nations and what is that or currency.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> KEENE:  Please.</p><p> FIOTAKIS:  The fact that soft commodities are going to be in -- not going  up so fast is very important for merging markets.  By far, the biggest  driver of inflation for merging is soft commodities.  And the fact that it  haven't split means emerging market inflation is probably going to be Czech  despite the higher oil price.</p><p> LACQUA:  You see how you avoided bitcoin there.</p><p> KEENE:  Let's get that --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> LACQUA:  It was like a master -- when you look at emerging markets, though,  Themos, a lot of the gains that we have seen have to do with artificial  intelligence, right? And some of the components, for example, that's  driving equity stocks down, right, wood tech, chips, and the like.  Is it  the same for currency or do investors look at things such as commodities,  inflation, and anything in between?</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> FIOTAKIS:  Definitely, the theme for emerging markets has been this year  the equity side and particularly the tech side.  I have to say, though,  that the theme is broadening out because primarily of how strong China is  in the background, how strong Chinese consumption is in the background.  So  if you're looking for the next equity theme in emerging markets, I think  the China consumption story is going to take (ph).</p><p> KEENE:  Is china part of soft?</p><p> HAQUE:  Yes.</p><p> KEENE:  Is it a growing part?</p><p> HAQUE:  Definitely, for sure there.</p><p> KEENE:  Give us a quick example -- I want to come back on this, but give us  a quick example of China in soft.  Is it cotton?</p><p> HAQUE:  Cotton, sugar, coffee, in a declining order.</p><p> KEENE:  Cotton, sugar, and coffee.</p><p> HAQUE:  Or obviously before that, the soybeans.</p><p> KEENE:  Do I know Chinese sugar?  When I have Chinese sugar, is it just  sort of going?</p><p> HAQUE:  Sorry, I am talking about consumption.</p><p> KEENE:  Oh, consumption, I am talking about what they make.  They make  cotton, right, cotton, cotton, cotto.</p><p> HAQUE:  But even then, they have mastered importer, China is still an  importer.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HAQUE:  Because they have a big tech sales industry.</p><p> LACQUA:  Yes.</p><p> KEENE:  Yes.</p><p> HAQUE:  Yes.</p><p> LACQUA:  How much do they consume?  So we were trying to figure out the  China GDP story.  Yesterday, it was -- they're going to use less of the  commodities for infrastructure, because a lot of them has already been  used.  So that will have longer-term impact on (inaudible) copper, zinc,  and the like.  Do they drink coffee?  And will they drink less coffee this  year?</p><p> HAQUE:  So if they follow the path of Japan and South Korea have been  doing, then yes, we think that they make that move from traditional tea to  old coffee.  And certainly, Starbucks is opening as shop every other day in  the main cities of China.  So, yes, that whole western coffee coach is  definitely is growing.</p><p> FIOTAKIS:  Generally speaking, across different parts of commodity  spectrum, this is why the ball is the QE dollar that supplies a lot of  food, particularly China.</p><p> KEENE:  There you go.  Themos Fiotakis with UBS.  Kona, thank you so much  for joining us.  It's wonderful that you're with ED&amp;F Man as well.</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> KEENE:  With us today, Themos Fiotakis of UBS.  We're going to chart out a  single chart.  You know it's going to be single best chart.  It's going to  be our newest dollar.  This is the Bloomberg dollar index that we've zoomed  in to a short-term deal.  I've (inaudible) on Twitter for Radio London here  in a bit.  And it's a kind of chart that comes down, we go September, lows  up we go and we roll over again.  As you mentioned, Themos, at the  beginning of the hour, we've got some acceleration, we've got some gamma,  gamma, gamma, we're plunging down here.  Let's start with the why.  Why do  we have the sudden drop?  Why do we have the gamma and dollar right now,  weak dollar?</p><p> FIOTAKIS:  Well, you have a number of different factors.  The most  important driver of all of these tactics in the short-term is the ongoing  easing in financial conditions, easier financial conditions driven by  growth.  You have higher equities, you have higher oil prices, weaker  dollar, it's all basically endogenous.  And you also have a couple of  events, including the government shutdown, which maybe exacerbating some of  the --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> KEENE:  OK.  But there is also -- within those type one ideas, it is this,  it's this, it's this.  It is also what's not going out on, what is not  going on is inflation.  Or does UBS see inflation percolating?</p><p> FIOTAKIS:  Look, I mean it is not going on now, but you have a weaker  dollar which hasn't yet fed through the numbers.  You have higher oil  prices.  These things, even arithmetically around the middle f the year may  bring U.S. headline, CPI inflation close to 3 percent</p><p> KEENE:  All right.  What about --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> KEENE:  That is quite a statement.  You are predicting 3 percent U.S.  inflation?</p><p> FIOTAKIS:  Yes, a little below that.  But if the dollar now continues, go  like this around the middle of the year, again very specifically on the  year, headline CPI will jump.</p><p> LACQUA:  But Themos, what does that mean for treasuries?  I mean if CPI is,  or PCU, which is maybe the preferred term for Fed (inaudible), it could be  -- they could tightened significantly quite violently.</p><p> FIOTAKIS:  Look, I think that for now, we need some inflation, because the  worry has been that we are not delivering some of that.  At the same time,  I think that what -- the front end, what has allowed the market to price in  more Fed hikes has been strong equities.  If they hike in an environment of  financial conditions are easing, equities are strong, growth is strong, the  market will absorb it.  It's not going to be an issue.  The curve will  flatten, move invert, and the market will absorb it.  And given that a lot  of that is priced in on the long-end of the curve, and the U.S. is going to  have lesser that stock in the dollar.</p><p> LACQUA:  Are there bubbles anywhere in the market?  And would that be the  trigger?</p><p> FIOTAKIS:  Bubble is a difficult word to use.  There are points of  vulnerability.  For instance, we have highlighted that parts of the U.S.  high yields credit spectrum, the very low end of the credit quality is more  susceptible to higher rates.  And that is going to underperform, some of  our trade recommendations have some of that color.</p><p> KEENE:  Well, let's get back.  I don't know if the chart (inaudible), but  you mentioned Eastern Europe is a place where you could see some real  movement.  Those are more Trump-like governments right now.  There has been  real political changes or noise better said, there has been noise.  Is that  good noise for their currencies?  Does that develop sort of an  authoritarian certitude that leads to stronger currencies?</p><p> FIOTAKIS:  So the smaller of an economy, it will move away from the states  and the likes and we go into small open economy.  They are mostly  reflecting how they are positioned in the global set up.  These economies  have rebalanced significantly, whereas (inaudible).  They have recovered  quite significantly so that other gaps are closed. And at the same time,  they are benefiting a lot from strength in Europe.  And at the same time,  they have better --</p><p> KEENE:  Economic strengths, are they harmed by a stronger euro?  I mean  that's what Draghi -- what Draghi does, does it matter for the Baltic  States on down south?</p><p> FIOTAKIS:  It does matter, and for sure it creates a signal with respect to  how their own Central Banks are priced and we're going to be talking about  broad statement basically.</p><p> LACQUA:  Themos, you haven't even talked on yen.</p><p> FIOTAKIS:  Yes.</p><p> LACUQA:  Why?  What is your call on yen?  Do we know -- does it actually  get impacted by inflation expectations, or it could be impacted by the fact  that Governor Kuroda may not get another term?</p><p> FIOTAKIS:  Hugely, by all of these factors.  The first and most important  thing to keep in mind is that Japan has a Phillips curve and it is  inflating.  And that's what our economist, James Macron s actually  projecting.  As inflation expectations go up in Japan, real rates compress.   That should drive the yen initially weaker.  As the yen weakens, inflation  picks up.  The Bank of Japan should revise its inflation target and yield  curve target higher by 20 basis points or so.  And this creates  opportunities, both for the yen and for the yield curve, which is steepened  there and bonds actually getting some light after spending a lot of time  doing nothing.</p><p> LACQUA:  But Themos, if Governor Kuroda were to step down or not be  reappointed or choose to retire, whatever you want to call it, then would  his legacy be --</p><p> FIOTAKIS:  Live on?</p><p> LACQUA:  Yes, success.</p><p> FIOTAKIS:  I think that you have to think of what kind of like succeeds  him.  And the names that have flown around in the press, they're very  dovish (ph), all the names.</p><p> KEENE:  This has been great.  Themos Fiotakis, thank you so much.</p><p> FIOTAKIS:  Thank you.</p><p> KEENE:  Greatly appreciate it.  It has been a wonderful brief in this  morning.  Of course, we do this with a weaker dollar this morning.</p><p> [*]</p><p> ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p> THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

UBS was brilliant 12 months, 14 months ago on Sterling. The world was coming to an end as we know, and you said, no, Sterling stability and even some Sterling strength. I guess the world is coming to an end for the dollar. Can you look for dollar stability or dollar strength?</p><p>THEMOS FIOTAKIS, CO-HEAD FX &amp; RATES, UBS: Definitely, we cannot extrapolate the pace of depreciation as it has been. But part of what you call Sterling stability has been the fact the dollar has weakened across a number of currencies, including Sterling. So the big dollar driver is there and there are very fundamental drivers that mean we still have a little bit further dollar weakness to go in the months ahead. Maybe not at this pace, but definitely the direction is there.</p><p>FRANCINE LACQUA, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: So what kind of level are you looking at?</p><p>FIOTAKIS: So for the euro-dollar, we have 1.25 for this year and 1.30 for next year and that's about it.</p><p>LACQUA: OK.</p><p>KEENE: Themos Fiotakis, we will continue this conversation with UBS. Lots to talk about on foreign exchange today.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>LACQUA: We are back with Themos Fiotakis of UBS. Themos, I think I have a euro trade wage chart, which actually I'd love to show you if we can bring that up on stage. So this is -- I don't know if there's a difference between trade wage or this is the real one that we're looking at. And where do you expect that to go depending on how markets perceive the ECB?</p><p>FIOTAKIS: So I think what captions this very nice trade-weighted chart is that the euro has been for a while undervalued. Part of the reason why it has been undervalued is the exception of values of the ECB. Even today, the European bonds are the most expensive in the world among the major countries. European yields are way too low. And as the ECB exits, this should correct the fair value and this is for bunds. It's somewhere between 1 and 1.3. But keep in mind that they will still be buying bonds for the majority of this year and they will be absorbing more than the supply of German revenue bunds. So yields will be under control.</p><p>And even if they tweak their forward guidance, they will be making very sure that they actually imprint it on the market's minds that this is going to happen sometime a lot later after they actually stop purchasing bonds, potentially in 2019 story. And that has been actually in the core of some of the comments that we have seen in the recent weeks as the euro has been rising a little bit faster than we would have expected.</p><p>LACQUA: OK. So what are you expecting ECB policy to actually be?</p><p>FIOTAKIS: So gradually --</p><p>LACQUA: And policy and asset purchase by December?</p><p>FIOTAKIS: Yes, by the end of the year, they will have ramped it up and sometime in the middle of next year it's going to be hikes.</p><p>KEENE: I look, Themos, at the optimal price of euro. I've never seen an academic or market study that says the euro is an intelligent system, you've got too many different economies. Single point optimum German euro where are chance (inaudible) euro. And as a point of discussion, look at Italy flat on its back granted recovering on a per capita basis, what's the optimum Italian value for Euro?</p><p>FIOTAKIS: Always, and all of these models, there's a wide differential.</p><p>KEENE: Yes, yes, yes.</p><p>FIOTAKIS: Double-digit --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KEENE: Yes, I know. Right. And correct me, (inaudible) made you say that, right?</p><p>FIOTAKIS: No, I actually. I think we would agree on that. But I think that what is really important for aggregate for the euro area, the euro being monetary union is still competitive at 1.30 for the euro-dollar and that includes also Italy, which has not -- but when the euro does well, Italy does well as well. Maybe it would've done better if the euro was lower. But it will continue to do it.</p><p>KEENE: This is really important. In the Italian election, you are suggesting the currency dynamics are the litmus paper of currency is the secondary or tertiary indicator of how well Italy will do in the future?</p><p>FIOTAKIS: That's right and even further more now that you mentioned the Italian elections, we actually view the election as a catalyst that will unlock some risk premium of the positive catalyst.</p><p>KEENE: OK.</p><p>FIOTAKIS: Italy still maintains one of the very wide risk premiums out there and the fundamentals are a lot better than perceived by the market.</p><p>KEENE: OK. Well, let's rip up the script here and go to your political analysts' best outcomes for Italy? Does it involved -- first I tell you, what is the coalition that is the best outcome for Italy and for that advanced risk premium?</p><p>FIOTAKIS: Well, the statement we have made is, obviously, the dynamics and how the votes here have shifted, of course, Italian makes a coalition more likely and a coalition which now sees very little scope for revising any kind of euro acceptance in Italian referendum.</p><p>LACQUA: But what happens to reforms?</p><p>FIOTAKIS: Well, reforms, it depends on what the pricing is. The pricing is still for recession. At the same time, you have risk premium and Italian bonds, you have (inaudible) which are quite trading quite poorly, and you have GDP which is recovering. Not just per capita basis. Unemployment rate (inaudible) decline and all of this has not been in the price primarily because people are worried about the instability that elections may trigger. So any kind of coalition that is actually viable is --</p><p>KEENE: Is constructive.</p><p>FIOTAKIS: At least for the next six months.</p><p>KEENE: Very good. Themos, thank you so much and we will continue. Mr. Fiotakis is with UBS.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>LACQUA: We're back to talk currencies with Themos Fiotakis of UBS. Themos, when you look at pound, do you look at cable or does euro-pound give you a different story?</p><p>FIOTAKIS: I think euro-pound is very important to watch now, now that euro-dollar has actually moved cable higher come. All this stability, which is still stability despite the fact that the euro-Sterling is grinding higher with pound stability, there is one underlying factor behind this. And U.K. is a very global economy, have a lot of global-based firms, such as the one we are in here and the surge in global profits has actually been reflected in the U.K.'s current account, the U.K.'s current account has improved, the balance of flows into the U.K. has improved because of global deflation.</p><p>Now, to me, the fact that we are not trading stronger despite global reflation, despite the Bank of England tightening, despite the fact that we have had a year where the data is printed better than the community would have expected, it makes you think that the underlying current for Sterling is actually still to weaken against the euro. And potentially gradually as long as global reflation continues, we will see this grind higher, euro- Sterling grind higher.</p><p>LACQUA: OK. Are there any kind of different pairs that we don't often look at? I mean Tom was joking that we're looking at Polish zloty, but I don't know if there's a pound zloty dynamic duo that you're looking at.</p><p>FIOTAKIS: There's definitely a lot of these ideas to think.</p><p>KEENE: Yes.</p><p>FIOTAKIS: Sterling and Swiss will probably underperform Central and Eastern European currencies (inaudible). So these are some interesting classes to think about.</p><p>KEENE: See how he answered that question without giving us a currency pair?</p><p>LACQUA: But he is good.</p><p>KEENE: That is a rare skill. OK, Czech Swiss (inaudible) I'll make a chart of it and put out on Twitter. You'll see it first up there. Czech Swiss, I think that's C-H-S, hyphen, C-Z-K. Did I get that right?</p><p>FIOTAKIS: That's right.</p><p>LACQUA: Oh, wow.</p><p>KEENE: Oh, my word. Bonus round. Themos Fiotakis is with us of UBS on the comparison of the Swiss Franc to the Czech. What is it Krona?</p><p>FIOTAKIS: Krona.</p><p>KEENE: Krona to be here in Mexico. Czech-krona, OK, we'll do that.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>KEENE: Thomas Fiotakis with us of UBS and Kona Haque. I'm thrilled to have you on set. I was fascinated by your analysis of robust and coffee. We can bring up the chart here of coffee and a slowdown in all that. Is the analysis in trading of soft the same as it was 10 or 20 years ago or vague into a revolution in commodity just like everything else?</p><p>KONA HAQUE, HEAD OF GROUP RESEARCH, ED&amp;F MAN: Yes. To a certain extent, they have. And analysis is very much broadly still supply and demand. Ultimately for agricultural commodities, it is very supply-side driven, because demand tends to be very constant in coffees going stable 2 percent per year. But it is supply that drives that, because it's growing tropical countries. So what is the weather in Brazil, what's the weather in Vietnam?</p><p>KEENE: Yes. So it sounds like it was 20, 30 years ago. But within your coffee analysis, Brazil, I get the usual names, there is the new kid on the block, Vietnam as well. So is there a new complexity which makes it harder for commodity traders to get on trend?</p><p>HAQUE: I think what sets coffee apart from the rest is that actual on the ground supply for the information is not really prevalent. You don't have the USDA that's constantly reporting on what the production was at all.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KEENE: Exactly. Where as for coffee, you really have to be on the ground, literally counting the cherries on the tree to see how big the crop is going to be. And you are right, there is Vietnam, there's Honduras, there's Columbia, there's Mexico, Peru. You have to agronomist on the group to literally count the numbers.</p><p>LACQUA: Yes. Is it different from cocoa? And I don't know whether we do have a cocoa chart, right, but this was one of the first things that I did.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KEENE: She doesn't do this at any day but Friday. I have to discover a cocoa chart right now?</p><p>LACQUA: The cocoa, this is depending on drought, this is depending on a lot of producers where you have social unrest, such as the Ivory Coast.</p><p>HAQUE: Yes, yes, absolutely. It is, again, boots on the ground. That is the only way you can find out really what is happening to those production, because it is not large necessarily scale. It is usually one man and his hectare of land.</p><p>LACQUA: OK. So Kona, if you look at the kind of soft commodity landscape, what will do well in 2018?</p><p>HAQUE: Well, it is tricky. I mean you just talk about oil that's method (ph). There's I think on the back of a strong economic global growth, those look quite positive, particularly if we have a weaker U.S. dollar. As some people are saying, again, that's mostly for commodities. But soft in grains, generally, I don't think we're going to share that uplift in commodities, because the story, fundamentally, is not quite there.</p><p>Both sugar and grains right now are very well supplied. So we have oversupplied that, so price should stay under pressure. Coffee, technically, is in a deficit. But the 2018 crops will be large. So fund futures will be looking ahead at big crops and so they will be looking to discount that.</p><p>So I don't think you're going to see the kind of push up in prices in these crops as you've seen in (inaudible).</p><p>KEENE: Yes. And one more question on cocoa. Actually, I make a joke about it, Francine, but I'm thrilled you brought it up. Cocoa has always been the volatility of it. You can get on it, you can play the game. Is there still a depth of market in the sauce (ph) that you followed for years? Is there still enough of a game being played where it's a good bid, it's a good ask to tic?</p><p>HAQUE: Yes, I think so. I think that very much depends on if you have insight that other people don't necessarily have. But something has changed fundamentally from 20 to 30 years ago.</p><p>KEENE: What is that?</p><p>HAQUE: It is the amount of system funds that are involved in the futures market. They now are probably 50 percent to 60 percent off the total open interest.</p><p>KEENE: Wow.</p><p>HAQUE: And they don't follow fundamentals.</p><p>KEENE: They're doing almost a black box on cocoa or coffee?</p><p>HAQUE: Yes. And it's very difficult to trade that.</p><p>KEENE: Do they make out from that, do they make money on that? I am fascinated from you on the trenches of what you think of bitcoin. I believe bitcoin is not a soft. So if you don't want to talk about it, I get it. But you have been in the battle of commodities, getting it right, getting it wrong, making a ton of money going down in flames. What are your thoughts when you look at the bid-ask quality of bitcoin?</p><p>HAQUE: Well, that is tricky, because I've been so used to looking at markets on a fundamental basis. I am struggling to understand the fundamental of bitcoin. I understand that by 2040, you can't produce that many because of mining system finishes. The demand then depends on the likes of Amazon adopting it as a currency. But then you have this new thing where you have regulators who are not necessarily going for it or (inaudible) government. And that to me feels a bit scary.</p><p>LACQUA: Themos can't wait to talk bitcoin. I knew it was coming. Do you want to talk about bitcoin or actually you wanted just to talk? This is like a free get out of jail card. You can also talk about commodity nations and what is that or currency.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KEENE: Please.</p><p>FIOTAKIS: The fact that soft commodities are going to be in -- not going up so fast is very important for merging markets. By far, the biggest driver of inflation for merging is soft commodities. And the fact that it haven't split means emerging market inflation is probably going to be Czech despite the higher oil price.</p><p>LACQUA: You see how you avoided bitcoin there.</p><p>KEENE: Let's get that --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LACQUA: It was like a master -- when you look at emerging markets, though, Themos, a lot of the gains that we have seen have to do with artificial intelligence, right? And some of the components, for example, that's driving equity stocks down, right, wood tech, chips, and the like. Is it the same for currency or do investors look at things such as commodities, inflation, and anything in between?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FIOTAKIS: Definitely, the theme for emerging markets has been this year the equity side and particularly the tech side. I have to say, though, that the theme is broadening out because primarily of how strong China is in the background, how strong Chinese consumption is in the background. So if you're looking for the next equity theme in emerging markets, I think the China consumption story is going to take (ph).</p><p>KEENE: Is china part of soft?</p><p>HAQUE: Yes.</p><p>KEENE: Is it a growing part?</p><p>HAQUE: Definitely, for sure there.</p><p>KEENE: Give us a quick example -- I want to come back on this, but give us a quick example of China in soft. Is it cotton?</p><p>HAQUE: Cotton, sugar, coffee, in a declining order.</p><p>KEENE: Cotton, sugar, and coffee.</p><p>HAQUE: Or obviously before that, the soybeans.</p><p>KEENE: Do I know Chinese sugar? When I have Chinese sugar, is it just sort of going?</p><p>HAQUE: Sorry, I am talking about consumption.</p><p>KEENE: Oh, consumption, I am talking about what they make. They make cotton, right, cotton, cotton, cotto.</p><p>HAQUE: But even then, they have mastered importer, China is still an importer.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HAQUE: Because they have a big tech sales industry.</p><p>LACQUA: Yes.</p><p>KEENE: Yes.</p><p>HAQUE: Yes.</p><p>LACQUA: How much do they consume? So we were trying to figure out the China GDP story. Yesterday, it was -- they're going to use less of the commodities for infrastructure, because a lot of them has already been used. So that will have longer-term impact on (inaudible) copper, zinc, and the like. Do they drink coffee? And will they drink less coffee this year?</p><p>HAQUE: So if they follow the path of Japan and South Korea have been doing, then yes, we think that they make that move from traditional tea to old coffee. And certainly, Starbucks is opening as shop every other day in the main cities of China. So, yes, that whole western coffee coach is definitely is growing.</p><p>FIOTAKIS: Generally speaking, across different parts of commodity spectrum, this is why the ball is the QE dollar that supplies a lot of food, particularly China.</p><p>KEENE: There you go. Themos Fiotakis with UBS. Kona, thank you so much for joining us. It's wonderful that you're with ED&amp;F Man as well.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>KEENE: With us today, Themos Fiotakis of UBS. We're going to chart out a single chart. You know it's going to be single best chart. It's going to be our newest dollar. This is the Bloomberg dollar index that we've zoomed in to a short-term deal. I've (inaudible) on Twitter for Radio London here in a bit. And it's a kind of chart that comes down, we go September, lows up we go and we roll over again. As you mentioned, Themos, at the beginning of the hour, we've got some acceleration, we've got some gamma, gamma, gamma, we're plunging down here. Let's start with the why. Why do we have the sudden drop? Why do we have the gamma and dollar right now, weak dollar?</p><p>FIOTAKIS: Well, you have a number of different factors. The most important driver of all of these tactics in the short-term is the ongoing easing in financial conditions, easier financial conditions driven by growth. You have higher equities, you have higher oil prices, weaker dollar, it's all basically endogenous. And you also have a couple of events, including the government shutdown, which maybe exacerbating some of the --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KEENE: OK. But there is also -- within those type one ideas, it is this, it's this, it's this. It is also what's not going out on, what is not going on is inflation. Or does UBS see inflation percolating?</p><p>FIOTAKIS: Look, I mean it is not going on now, but you have a weaker dollar which hasn't yet fed through the numbers. You have higher oil prices. These things, even arithmetically around the middle f the year may bring U.S. headline, CPI inflation close to 3 percent</p><p>KEENE: All right. What about --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KEENE: That is quite a statement. You are predicting 3 percent U.S. inflation?</p><p>FIOTAKIS: Yes, a little below that. But if the dollar now continues, go like this around the middle of the year, again very specifically on the year, headline CPI will jump.</p><p>LACQUA: But Themos, what does that mean for treasuries? I mean if CPI is, or PCU, which is maybe the preferred term for Fed (inaudible), it could be -- they could tightened significantly quite violently.</p><p>FIOTAKIS: Look, I think that for now, we need some inflation, because the worry has been that we are not delivering some of that. At the same time, I think that what -- the front end, what has allowed the market to price in more Fed hikes has been strong equities. If they hike in an environment of financial conditions are easing, equities are strong, growth is strong, the market will absorb it. It's not going to be an issue. The curve will flatten, move invert, and the market will absorb it. And given that a lot of that is priced in on the long-end of the curve, and the U.S. is going to have lesser that stock in the dollar.</p><p>LACQUA: Are there bubbles anywhere in the market? And would that be the trigger?</p><p>FIOTAKIS: Bubble is a difficult word to use. There are points of vulnerability. For instance, we have highlighted that parts of the U.S. high yields credit spectrum, the very low end of the credit quality is more susceptible to higher rates. And that is going to underperform, some of our trade recommendations have some of that color.</p><p>KEENE: Well, let's get back. I don't know if the chart (inaudible), but you mentioned Eastern Europe is a place where you could see some real movement. Those are more Trump-like governments right now. There has been real political changes or noise better said, there has been noise. Is that good noise for their currencies? Does that develop sort of an authoritarian certitude that leads to stronger currencies?</p><p>FIOTAKIS: So the smaller of an economy, it will move away from the states and the likes and we go into small open economy. They are mostly reflecting how they are positioned in the global set up. These economies have rebalanced significantly, whereas (inaudible). They have recovered quite significantly so that other gaps are closed. And at the same time, they are benefiting a lot from strength in Europe. And at the same time, they have better --</p><p>KEENE: Economic strengths, are they harmed by a stronger euro? I mean that's what Draghi -- what Draghi does, does it matter for the Baltic States on down south?</p><p>FIOTAKIS: It does matter, and for sure it creates a signal with respect to how their own Central Banks are priced and we're going to be talking about broad statement basically.</p><p>LACQUA: Themos, you haven't even talked on yen.</p><p>FIOTAKIS: Yes.</p><p>LACUQA: Why? What is your call on yen? Do we know -- does it actually get impacted by inflation expectations, or it could be impacted by the fact that Governor Kuroda may not get another term?</p><p>FIOTAKIS: Hugely, by all of these factors. The first and most important thing to keep in mind is that Japan has a Phillips curve and it is inflating. And that's what our economist, James Macron s actually projecting. As inflation expectations go up in Japan, real rates compress. That should drive the yen initially weaker. As the yen weakens, inflation picks up. The Bank of Japan should revise its inflation target and yield curve target higher by 20 basis points or so. And this creates opportunities, both for the yen and for the yield curve, which is steepened there and bonds actually getting some light after spending a lot of time doing nothing.</p><p>LACQUA: But Themos, if Governor Kuroda were to step down or not be reappointed or choose to retire, whatever you want to call it, then would his legacy be --</p><p>FIOTAKIS: Live on?</p><p>LACQUA: Yes, success.</p><p>FIOTAKIS: I think that you have to think of what kind of like succeeds him. And the names that have flown around in the press, they're very dovish (ph), all the names.</p><p>KEENE: This has been great. Themos Fiotakis, thank you so much.</p><p>FIOTAKIS: Thank you.</p><p>KEENE: Greatly appreciate it. It has been a wonderful brief in this morning. Of course, we do this with a weaker dollar this morning.</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.
