The separate meetings highlight the efforts by the Trump administration to move against an industry that he has accused of stifling conservative voices.   In the White House meeting, Trump will meet with state attorneys general from Texas, Arizona, Utah, Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, South Carolina and Missouri - like Trump, all Republicans, according to a person briefed on the matter.   Justice Department officials have invited staff for the dozens of state attorneys general involved in a Google antitrust investigation to a call in the afternoon, according to two sources knowledgeable about the call.   Officials from both Democratic and Republican states are expected to participate, the two sources said.   While the Justice Department has not said what the agenda of the meeting will be, the expectation is that officials could preview the complaint that is expected to be filed against Google as soon as next week, one of the sources said.   \u201cOnline censorship goes far beyond the issue of free speech, it\u2019s also one of protecting consumers and ensuring they are informed of their rights and resources to fight back under the law,\u201d White House spokesman Judd Deere said on Monday.   \u201cState attorneys general are on the front lines of this issue and President Trump wants to hear their perspectives.\u201d   In May, Trump signed an executive order that seeks new regulatory oversight of tech firms\u2019 content moderation decisions and backed legislation to scrap or weaken the relevant provision in the 1996 Communications Decency Act, Section 230.   Trump directed the Commerce Department to file a petition asking the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) to limit protections under Section 230 after Twitter Inc warned readers in May to fact-check his posts about unsubstantiated claims of fraud in mail-in voting.   A group representing major internet companies including Facebook Inc, Amazon.com Inc and Google urged the FCC to reject the petition, saying it was \u201cmisguided, lacks grounding in law, and poses serious public policy concerns.\u201d   FCC Chairman Ajit Pai opened the petition to a 45-day public comment.   Earlier this month, the Republican state attorneys general of Texas, Louisiana, Indiana and Missouri backed Trump\u2019s push, arguing social media platforms cannot be truly free \u201cunless the participants understand the rules of the forum, and competition is able to provide alternatives when speech restrictions go too far.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

The separate meetings highlight the efforts by the Trump administration to move against an industry that he has accused of stifling conservative voices.    In the White House meeting, Trump will meet with state attorneys general from Texas, Arizona, Utah, Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, South Carolina and Missouri \u2013 like Trump, all Republicans, according to a person briefed on the matter.    Justice Department officials have invited staff for the dozens of state attorneys general involved in a Google antitrust investigation to a call in the afternoon, according to two sources knowledgeable about the call.    Officials from both Democratic and Republican states are expected to participate, the two sources said.    While the Justice Department has not said what the agenda of the meeting will be, the expectation is that officials could preview the complaint that is expected to be filed against Google as soon as next week, one of the sources said.    \u201cOnline censorship goes far beyond the issue of free speech, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also one of protecting consumers and ensuring they are informed of their rights and resources to fight back under the law,\u201d White House spokesman Judd Deere said on Monday.    \u201cState attorneys general are on the front lines of this issue and President Trump wants to hear their perspectives.\u201d    In May, Trump signed an executive order that seeks new regulatory oversight of tech firms\u2019 content moderation decisions and backed legislation to scrap or weaken the relevant provision in the 1996 Communications Decency Act, Section 230.    Trump directed the Commerce Department to file a petition asking the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) to limit protections under Section 230 after Twitter Inc warned readers in May to fact-check his posts about unsubstantiated claims of fraud in mail-in voting.    A group representing major internet companies including Facebook Inc, Amazon.com Inc and Google urged the FCC to reject the petition, saying it was \u201cmisguided, lacks grounding in law, and poses serious public policy concerns.\u201d    FCC Chairman Ajit Pai opened the petition to a 45-day public comment.    Earlier this month, the Republican state attorneys general of Texas, Louisiana, Indiana and Missouri backed Trump\u2019s push, arguing social media platforms cannot be truly free \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unless the participants understand the rules of the forum, and competition is able to provide alternatives when speech restrictions go too far.\u00e2\u20ac (Reporting by David

U.S. President Donald Trump descends from Air Force One following a campaign trip to Ohio, at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, U.S., September 21, 2020. REUTERS/Tom Brenner   \u201cOnline censorship goes far beyond the issue of free speech, it\u2019s also one of protecting consumers and ensuring they are informed of their rights and resources to fight back under the law,\u201d White House spokesman Judd Deere said. \u201cState attorneys general are on the front lines of this issue and President Trump wants to hear their perspectives.\u201d   A person briefed on the matter said Trump is expected to meet with the state attorneys general of Texas, Arizona, Utah, Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, South Carolina and Missouri.   The planned meeting was reported earlier by the Washington Post.   In May, Trump signed an executive order that seeks new regulatory oversight of tech firms\u2019 content moderation decisions and backed legislation to scrap or weaken the law, Section 230.   He directed the Commerce Department to file the petition asking the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) to limit protections under Section 230 after Twitter Inc warned readers in May to fact-check his posts about unsubstantiated claims of fraud in mail-in voting.   FCC Chairman Ajit Pai opened the petition to a 45-day public comment.   Earlier this month, the Republican state attorneys general   of Texas, Louisiana, Indiana and Missouri backed Trump\u2019s push, arguing social media platforms cannot be truly free \u201cunless the participants understand the rules of the forum, and competition is able to provide alternatives when speech restrictions go too far.\u201d   A group representing major internet companies including Facebook Inc, Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google urged the FCC to reject the petition, calling it \u201cmisguided, lacks grounding in law, and poses serious public policy concerns.\u201d

The Trump administration's potential targets include image-recognition software, ultrafast quantum computers, advanced computer chips, self-driving cars and robots. Companies that make those products and services might, for instance, have to obtain licenses before selling them to foreign governments or partnering with some researchers in certain countries.</p><p>The document is only an initial notice of rules to come, and the Commerce Department, which is leading the effort, is still deciding how to proceed. But its broad wording, along with the White House's long-running, high-stakes trade rift with Beijing, left some tech experts fearful that it could result in greater market barriers for companies doing business in China. They also worry that any rule could adversely affect U.S. investment and research in AI.</p><p>\"If you think about the range of products this potentially implicates, that's massive. This is either the opening of a big negotiation with the industry and the public or a bit of a cry for help in scoping these regulations,\" said R. David Edelman, the director of the Project on Technology, the Economy, &amp; National Security at MIT.</p><p>\"We've seen the China trade war is a political football,\" said Edelman, a former top tech aide to President Barack Obama, adding: \"Surprises are not off the table here.\"</p><p>The Commerce Department explicitly said it hopes to protect national security without \"hampering the ability of the U.S. commercial sector to keep pace with international advances.\" The rules come at the request of Congress, which authorized them as part of a recently passed defense bill. On Thursday, the agency said it is \"committed to laying the proper foundation to ensure that those technologies critical to national security remain protected to ensure the safety of our country.\"</p><p>Spokesmen for Apple, Google and IBM also did not respond to requests, and Amazon declined to comment. (Amazon.com founder Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>In its proposal, the Trump administration said it is focused \"at a minimum\" on countries already subject to a U.S. arms embargo, a category that includes China. The potential limits on AI research and exports reflect a growing apprehension with Beijing's investment in that industry. In December 2017, for example, the White House's official National Security Strategy warned that \"risks to U.S. national security will grow as competitors integrate information derived from personal and commercial sources with intelligence collection and data analytic capabilities based on artificial intelligence and machine learning.\"</p><p>What the Trump administration is \"trying to control is the flow of know-how or research or development that enables\" high-tech capabilities, said Melissa L. Duffy, an export-control expert and partner at the law firm Dechert.</p><p>Some in the tech industry worry the regulations could widen an existing trade rift between Washington and Beijing. Many executives at big tech companies have bristled at White House-backed tariffs on China, fearing that Beijing's retaliation could result in higher costs for them - or higher prices on components for their products. Others simply don't want to anger Beijing, which controls one of the world's largest markets for tech devices.</p><p>To that end, Silicon Valley's lobbyists have been scrambling to digest what the new proposal would mean for their industry at a time when U.S. firms are racing their Chinese counterparts to dominate the market for AI.</p><p>\"We view this as a really important process that our industry is taking very seriously and plan to engage in, because the outcomes are of great consequence for us,\" said Christian Troncoso, a policy director at BSA, a Washington-based trade group for companies including Apple, Microsoft, IBM and Oracle.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-0534463ed7da447b81bed1c591e3d024</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TSF-DDN1-JB4M-V2HF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"742\"/><timeReceived>10:51 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 19, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

The details: The legislation, submitted by the DOJ to Congress on Wednesday, targets a portion of federal law known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects a broad swath of online businesses from liability for hosting user material and taking steps to curb noxious material on their sites.    The legal shield, enacted in 1996, has come under attack from officials across the political aisle amid scrutiny of how social media platforms including Facebook and Twitter moderate content on their platforms. President Donald Trump escalated his attacks on the statute after Twitter began placing fact-checking labels on his tweets this spring, reviving longstanding GOP allegations of an anti-conservative bias by Silicon Valley firms.    Under Section 230, internet companies are protected from lawsuits for making \u201cgood faith\u201d efforts to take down or restrict a wide range of illicit or \u201cotherwise objectionable\u201d material. But under the new DOJ proposal, the scope of those protections would be narrowed to exclude material that is merely \u201cobjectionable,\u201d but expanded to include content that promotes terrorism, violent extremism or self-harm. And it would require companies to notify users.    That could open internet companies up to lawsuits for removing content that is inflammatory or otherwise harmful, such as election misinformation or hate speech, but does not fall under the categories outlined under the revamped proposal.    \u201cFor too long Section 230 has provided a shield for online platforms to operate with impunity,\u201d Attorney General William Barr said in a statement.    Barr added that he urges Congress \u201cto make these necessary reforms to Section 230 and begin to hold online platforms accountable both when they unlawfully censor speech and when they knowingly facilitate egregious criminal activity online.\u201d    The bill would also create carve-outs to the protections to enable federal and state prosecutors to bring both civil and criminal lawsuits against companies that promote or facilitate the spread of material that could violate federal criminal law.    What's next: The proposal faces long odds of passage in the current Congress, despite Democrats' own objections to the way social media companies handle disinformation and hate speech. Some congressional Democrats who support Section 230 changes objected earlier this year to the DOJ's initial proposal on the matter.    Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), who is leading a separate bipartisan effort to revamp Section 230, called an earlier version of the DOJ proposal a \"way overbroad, meat-ax effort to suppress free speech.\"    \"Any efforts to narrow the scope of Section 230 have to be carefully crafted and targeted to address big tech\u2019s egregious failures,\" he told POLITICO in June . \"General prohibitions on speech and free expression have to be avoided.\u201d    Senate lawmakers have proposed a flurry of proposals to revamp the law, including one bipartisan bill to remove liability protections for online businesses that host child porn and another to grant federal and state regulators the power to sue platforms over third-party content that violates federal civil law .    And in rare sign of agreement, both Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden have called for Section 230 to be repealed altogether.    But Democrats and Republicans remain deeply divided over GOP-led efforts to amend the law to address allegations of political bias, which Democrats have blasted as baseless and politically driven. Republicans say social media companies have gone too far in curtailing free speech, while Democrats argue the platforms haven't done enough to crack down on hate speech, misinformation and other harmful content online.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-43145777324</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60X6-K4T1-JCSC-J3HP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"721\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Politico</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 23, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The goal of the proposal, which is being finalized, is to push tech companies to address criminal content on their platforms such as child exploitation, terrorism or cyber stalking, and boost transparency for users when the outlets take down lawful material, the Justice Department official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. For the proposal to become law, U.S. lawmakers would need to submit an approve a bill. \"These reforms are targeted at platforms to make certain they are appropriately addressing illegal and exploitive content while continuing to preserve a vibrant, open and competitive internet,\" Attorney General William Barr said in a statement. </p><p>The president, who has battled Twitter and other tech companies over alleged censorship of conservative voices on social media platforms, said in late May he would propose legislation to potentially scrap or weaken the law shielding internet companies, in an extraordinary attempt to regulate outlets where he has been criticized. Trump said he sought to \"remove or change\" Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which generally exempts platforms from responsibility for what their users post and allows them to moderate the content of their sites as they wish. The Justice Department proposal would seek to push platforms to \"address\" illicit content online, such as material that violates federal criminal law, the department said. It would also seek to require the companies to be upfront about content moderation decisions and prevent the big online platforms from invoking Section 230 in antitrust cases. Facebook policy chief Nick Clegg told reporters that Section 230 enables the company to remove hate speech and that big changes would, \"in the end, mean less speech of all kinds appearing online.\" The White House, for its part, welcomed news of the Justice Department proposal. \"The president expressly called on DOJ to develop such model legislation in the Executive Order signed recently, and yes, President Trump is pleased to see the department following through,\" said White House spokesman Judd Deere. Trump has attacked Twitter for tagging his tweets about unsubstantiated claims of fraud about mail-in voting with a warning prompting readers to fact-check the posts. Google and Twitter did not comment. Carl Szabo, general counsel of NetChoice, a trade association which counts Google and Facebook among its members, said the proposal would create so many obstacles to removing content that the U.S. House of Representatives would not consider it. Also on Wednesday, Senator Josh Hawley joined with three other Republicans to introduce a bill that would allow people to sue tech companies if they feel that their speech was censored. In a letter to Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Hawley referenced a dispute with the conservative website The Federalist, saying that Google's threat to demonetize the site because of comments made about Black Lives Matter protests was \"profoundly disingenuous.\" Hawley said Google sought to hold The Federalist responsible for its readers' comments even though Google's YouTube is not held responsible for comments because of Section 230. \"In short, Google demands minimum oversight for itself, but maximum power over those who use its platform,\" Hawley wrote.

Without those, the growth forecast falls below 3 percent.</p><p>This year\u2019s report takes direct aim at the 2016 report presented by Mr. Obama and his Council of Economic Advisers, then led by the Harvard economist Jason Furman, which warned that rising market concentration was hampering economic dynamism and exacerbating inequality.</p><p>The Trump administration has approved some high-profile corporate mergers, like the <url normalizedValue=\"https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/docs/ERP_2016_Book_Complete%20JA.pdf\">marriage of Sprint and T-Mobile</url>, while trying to block others, like       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/docs/ERP_2016_Book_Complete%20JA.pdf\">AT&amp;amp;T\u2019s purchase of Time Warner</url>. In their report, Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers say federal agencies already have the tools they need to evaluate those mergers and other antitrust cases. It laments that some Americans have come to hold the \u201cmistaken, simplistic view that \u2018Big Is Bad.\u2019\u201d</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/docs/ERP_2016_Book_Complete%20JA.pdf\">New research</url> released Thursday by the University of Chicago\u2019s Becker Friedman Institute for Economics offers new evidence for why populist politicians like Mr. Trump should be concerned with whether market concentration is in fact rising in the economy: The rise hurts blue-collar workers, like those employed in factories, more than everyone else.</p><p>The research, from the University of Chicago economists Greg Kaplan and Piotr Zoch, does not seek to quantify whether concentration has gone up or down in recent years. Instead, it studies what happens to particular classes of workers when companies increasingly dominate a market and have more power to raise prices. It finds that some workers \u2014 those who make things \u2014 are hurt in when their employer dominates an industry. The workers who sell or market or design things gain.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s leading to an increase in the incomes of white-collar workers,\u201d Mr. Kaplan said in an interview, \u201cat the expense of blue-collar workers.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a relatively simple explanation for why that is. When companies have more pricing power, they make fewer products and sell each one for a higher profit margin. In that case, it\u2019s far more valuable to a company to be an employee working in so-called expansionary positions, like marketing, than in production jobs, like working a factory line \u2014 because there\u2019s less production to be done and more salesmanship.</p><p>Mr. Trump has repeatedly highlighted his administration\u2019s record of delivering for the production workers he targeted in his 2016 campaign promises. The new economic report is no exception.</p><p>In recent decades, the report says, the government disproportionately regulated industries like manufacturing \u201cthat offer fulfilling, blue collar jobs for the majority of Americans who do not have a college degree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese misguided policy decisions,\u201d it continues, \u201cimposed real-world costs that created barriers to success and prosperity for hardworking Americans.

I'm Steve Hilton. And this is the home of positive populism, pro-worker, pro-family, pro-community, and yes, pro-America -- very much so.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Big show for you tonight, including an important news \"Swamp Watch\" on a massive government contract involving Amazon, the Bezos bailout. That is ahead.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But I just wanted to start with something personal. I've just been completely overwhelmed with the response from you to what I told you about a couple of weeks ago that I'm going to be applying for U.S. citizenship, it was just such a lovely thing to see your response and your great welcome.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And there's just a couple of things I want to say about that especially in the light of what we're going to be talking about tonight. I understand that there is an obligation that comes from being an American citizen. And as far as I'm concerned, that is particularly so for new immigrants.</p><p>I didn't ask you, if I could come here, I just showed up and said right, let's do it. You didn't invite me here. We're here as new immigrants saying please let us join your country and I hope you'll have -- when we get to the end of the process, I hope that that'll be a positive answer. You've certainly indicated you'd like to see that.</p><p>But the obligation to be positive about this country, I think is even greater for new immigrants. That's how I see it.</p><p>All right, speaking of immigration and before we dive into this week's big debate, just some context on President Trump and immigrants.</p><p>Not long ago, he published a plan to reform our legal immigration system, it would welcome just as many legal immigrants as now except the system would be merit-based. Here's what he told me about it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We need people. We need people and our unemployment now is down to 3.6, and I think it's going a lot lower. We're doing really well. I want to make sure that anybody that comes into our country comes in through merit.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILTON: He is pro-immigration, it just has to be merit-based and controlled properly. All of that was lost in this week's raging debate in the media.</p><p>As so often with elites who have comfortable lives, the focus was on words, but real people can't afford such a decadent self-indulgence. For them, what matters is substance, not scandal. So, what does that substance tell us about President Trump and his populist revolution? When it comes to policy, to practicality, to fact? The establishment's favorite sneer is that those who support the President sacrifice their principles for poultry gains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): If you're saying to yourselves, well, he got us our big tax cut. Well, he's taking regulations off big corporations. Well, he pulled out of the Paris Accords. We have to go along with this racism? You're making a deal with the devil.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILTON: Easy for you to say, Chuck Schumer, but it wasn't your jobs sent to China by establishment economics. It wasn't your neighborhood collapsing when the factory went away. It wasn't your income that was stagnant for decades.</p><p>For the working Americans who did put up with all that establishment failure, the last three years of Trump policies have finally brought real hope and real change. Unemployment this year hit a 50-year low.</p><p>With President Trump we've seen the lowest ever African-American and Hispanic unemployment. The booming Trump economy has pushed up workers' wages, too. Average hourly earnings growth has far outpaced what we saw under President Obama and across industries from mining and construction to leisure and hospitality.</p><p>And Trump economics reversed the divisive pattern we saw under establishment economics with booming coasts and a slumping heartland. With President Trump, we see income growth in states like Iowa, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Nevada, Florida, swing states that went to Trump in 2016 because he promised not to forget about them like the establishment had done for decades.</p><p>And their trust in President Trump quite literally paid off as they saw their incomes rise. And it's the lowest paid workers who have gained the most with Trump economics. The latest data from June shows wages have grown for the bottom quarter 4.5 percent over the past 12 months faster than any other income group.</p><p>Critics say it all started under Obama. Yes, it did. But we're now officially in the longest expansion in history. It's much harder to keep things going at the end of an expansion than at the beginning after a recession. Of course you get a rebound, but 10 years of the recession, usually things slow down. But with President Trump they sped up.</p><p>Economic growth is now above three percent, when all the experts said Obama's two percent was the new normal. The Dow is up almost 50 percent since the 2016 election. The average 401(k) employer contribution hit a record high in 2019.</p><p>Establishment idiots say the Trump tax cuts only help the rich. Don't they understand anything about economics? The reason earnings are finally rising for the working class is precisely because of the corporate tax cuts.</p><p>The first quarter after they were announced, capital investment went up 8.7 percent among S&amp;P 500 companies, and in the first quarter after they were signed into law, capital investment jumped 21 percent. That capital investment leads to higher productivity, which means workers can be paid more, and it means more job creation for the long term.</p><p>This investment boom is also thanks to the deregulation. Again, the idiots say this just favors business. No, it boosts business confidence. They know they're not going to have an anti-enterprise administration like you had with Obama that can hit them with new regulations any minute.</p><p>Now, with the pro-enterprise Trump administration, they decide to invest and that means more jobs. We see this clear as day in the manufacturing industry.</p><p>Last year 264,000 new manufacturing jobs were added which was the best year for manufacturing job growth since 1997. The establishment also said that Trump tariffs would kill manufacturing. But the opposite has happened. Manufacturers are moving back and bringing jobs with them.</p><p>They're leaving China, which is now experiencing its slowest economic growth in 27 years. It couldn't happen to a nicer authoritarian dictatorship.</p><p>Tariffs also worked on trade with our neighbors. The Trump USMCA will replace the job destroying NAFTA with policies that support American workers. For example, rules to drive higher wages by requiring the 40 to 45 percent of automobile parts be made by workers earning at least $16.00 an hour. This helps ensure American workers don't get constantly under bid by foreign firms. You've got workers willing to work for almost nothing.</p><p>Tariffs worked on the border, too. Look at Mexico and immigration. In May, President Trump threatened tariffs. Mexico agreed to deploy their National Guard and in June, arrests at the southwestern border dropped by 28 percent.</p><p>Beyond the economy, ISIS has had its entire Empire destroyed on our national defense. Last year, the President signed the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act, boosting our military and including measures to stop China stealing our technology.</p><p>NATO, remember all the establishment talking heads saying you can't be rude to NATO. Well, they're finally coughing up their fair share. Here's the Secretary General.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JENS STOLTENBERG, SECRETARY GENERAL OF NATO: By the end of next year, NATO allies will add $100 billion extra for the defense. So, we see some real money and some real results and we see that a clear message from President Trump is having an impact.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILTON: Look at all the other things -- judges who will help fight back against the administrative states' anti-democratic takeover; on energy, America, a net exporter by 2020, the first time in almost 70 years. On prescription drug prices, the first fall in half a century. On criminal justice reform and rehabilitation. The First Step Act.</p><p>On restoring the proud American tradition of free speech, the President takes action to remove Federal grants from colleges that won't defend the First Amendment and new positive changes are coming all the time.</p><p>Just last week, the President signed an Executive Order to provide early detection and care for the thousands of Americans suffering from kidney disease and to find innovative treatments. On and on it goes.</p><p>And having worked in government myself, it seems to me that the scale and energy of this administration's ambition is happening precisely because President Trump had never done this before and just ignored all the usual bureaucratic BS that said, \"Oh, you can only do one or two things at a time.\" He said, \"No, I want to get all the things done that I promised and more.\"</p><p>Now, that list of positives, of course, is great news. But you could say it's not historic, not completely transformational. So, here's what is.</p><p>On two vital issues, Donald Trump has overturned at least 50 years of establishment consensus. On trade, he has rejected the globalist idea that manufacturing can happen anywhere and said, \"No, we want the job jobs back here.\" And that is so fundamental, not just for economic reasons, but for social reasons, too. Factories are at the heart of many communities.</p><p>And connected to that, but even bigger than just trade and economics, the President has completely overturned the establishment consensus on China and said, \"No, we will no longer help them in their stated aim of toppling America as the world's superpower.\"</p><p>What is most astonishing about all of this is that Donald Trump did it almost single handedly. The Reagan Revolution came on the back of decades of think tanks and policy wonks and other politicians pushing the free market agenda.</p><p>On these absolutely giant historic policy ships of huge consequence on trade and China, Trump did it almost single handed, because not just the entire establishment, but as we have previously told you, people in his own team were blocking him.</p><p>Contrast all of this with the Democrats. We don't have to demonize anyone. We can just look at what they say in their presidential debates, the loony left has taken over. They want to decriminalize illegal immigration. They want to take private healthcare away from 180 million Americans and give public healthcare to God knows how many illegal immigrants.</p><p>They want to make working Americans pay for free college for elite Americans. They want to reverse the tax cuts and deregulation that have boosted jobs and raised incomes. They want to close down American energy, so we're dependent on the Middle East again. They want to put Iran back on the path to a nuclear weapon and China back on track for world domination, especially #JoeChina. It's the most extreme platform we've ever seen.</p><p>See what I'm getting out tonight? I think we can agree. There is plenty to hit the Democrats with and plenty to be positive about without stoking racial divisions. Facts, substance, policy, positive, the July the Fourth salute to America -- positive -- while they go left, let's go forward. Positive populism, positive patriotism.</p><p>Tell me what you think of that @NextRevFNC and and @SteveHiltonX.</p><p>When we come back, we'll discuss all of this with our great panel. Tammy, Tomi, Henry Olsen. They're all here. It's going to be great. So you after the break.</p><p>HILTON: Okay, you heard what I just had to say. Now, let's bring in our guest for the night. Fox News contributor and President of Independent Women's Voice, Tammy Bruce. Author of the \"Working Class Republican,\" senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center and \"Washington Post\" columnist, Henry Olsen, and Fox Nation host and author of \"Never Played Dead,\" Tomi Lahren.</p><p>All right, Tammy.</p><p>TAMMY BRUCE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, sir.</p><p>HILTON: What do you think of what I said about this whole argument? Just you go.</p><p>BRUCE: Well, you've hit a number of important points. I think that for the President and for the nature of the conversation, there's a number of different fronts that are going on. But ultimately, when it comes to what he has accomplished, and what he's done, it validates the nature of the choices that we made in '16, what we had seen for generations, well, since Reagan, was a decline. It wasn't just a malaise during a Jimmy Carter.</p><p>There was the sensibility of hope with Reagan that things could change and then it just tumbled right back down when the establishment got its mitts on the country again.</p><p>So Americans, you know, we love the underdog, we love to try. We love the nature of what's possible. But we also in the very end, we have responsibilities to people other than ourselves, to our children, to our neighbors, to our community. That I think is a remarkable uniqueness about Americans, about the choices we make, and they left, it seems when they appeal to us, is to appeal to us based on our own personal greed or something. They think that it's all just about the individual. For them, it is.</p><p>But for us, it really is about people other than ourselves, like jumping off the boats on to a Normandy beach, right? The things we do to save strangers for this country's is extraordinary.</p><p>So in the end, what we really do want, we know that saving the nation is imperative. This nation. You know, because it saves the world. And the only way that's going to happen is if the economy is strong, is if we have a sense of security for our own families. That's not selfish, that, in fact, is the larger concern for the world. And that government has a role. We've seen how it works, it can get the boot off our neck and step back, be responsible for the things that it's supposed to be doing, like the border and the military, and then led Americans in the free market work.</p><p>The left holds Americans in contempt. The establishment does as well, they think we're dumb rubes, and so they resent us.</p><p>The bottom line is this is going to have to take another generation to reform the country. But it's based on your sense, and that positive populism framework about what Americans want.</p><p>HILTON: I think that's very well said, Tammy. I mean, I think, Tomi, that's why I wanted to set it up because there's so much to be positive about.</p><p>TOMI LAHREN, FOX NATION HOST: Well, it's all about priorities. And I don't know about you, Steve, but after watching the first two Democratic debates, we've got more coming up, I couldn't feel better about our chances in 2020, not just because Donald Trump has done such a great job, which you laid out, and which he really needs to emphasize on a daily basis, besides all the squabbling on Twitter, because that, to me is getting petty at this point as well.</p><p>What I think he needs to emphasize is the gains he is making, but also just watching the Democrats, all you have to do is turn on the TV and watch what their priorities are, their lack of priorities.</p><p>They've spent all week -- they spent their whole time on the Sunday shows today, arguing over Trump is mean on Twitter. That's what they've done for the American people. That's all they have to offer. And then you watch them on the debate stage talking about how much more they want to offer illegal immigrants.</p><p>So, all you have to do is look at President Trump. Look at his plans for 2020. Look at his record that he's been able to complete in the last three years and he's just getting started and say, \"Hey, I think we got this one in the bag.\" I don't like to be overly confident, but I'm feeling very confident.</p><p>HILTON: All right, Henry.</p><p>HENRY OLSEN, SENIOR FELLOW, ETHICS AND PUBLIC POLICY CENTER: All elections are about a choice. Our presidential elections are about a choice. And what Trump is doing is setting it up so that there's no reason to change. It was a change election in 2016 because people wanted a different direction. He's delivered a different directions, it's a different direction that has delivered for America -- peace and prosperity. And the Democrats are saying we don't want that, we want -- well, what sort of change? We want to change where we tax more, where we spend more, where we divide America more.</p><p>And I think the more people focus on the choice, the more they're going to be coming back to President Trump because there's not a reason for people to want to change.</p><p>HILTON: And do you think he is focusing on the choice or not?</p><p>BRUCE: I think he is by in many ways that he gets criticized for by being himself. Right? He was elected because of his transparent bluntness. And even though that is sometimes shocking, you do know what you've got. And what that translates to as well, is that when he says he's going to do X, and then he actually does it, then you can connect those dots.</p><p>So, I think that he does in reminding people about what he's working for. He stands for specific policy dynamics. He does stand for unifying the country. We saw that and you outlined it in your monologue.</p><p>HILTON: Yes, the \"Salute to America,\" everyone said, \"Oh, this is going to be another kind of divisive Trump.\"</p><p>BRUCE: And the First Step Act with justice reform, the economy itself, bringing companies back -- all of it.</p><p>HILTON: Yes.</p><p>LAHREN: I think though his strategy is very smart, whether you agree with his tweets or not, whether you find them aggressive or abrasive, it doesn't matter. His strategy is, let's draw a clear line between me and the rest of the Democrats. Because I believe in the United States of America, I want to salute America, I want us and the Trump supporters to be the party of patriotism and love of country.</p><p>And then, he is drawing a clear distinction to the left, which says, \"We're offended by Betsy Ross flag.\"</p><p>HILTON: Oh, yes.</p><p>LAHREN: We're offended by tweets. Were offended by a Salute to America. It's just over and over again, the negativity on that side. And the only thing they can get excited about, quite frankly, is themselves and illegal immigration. That should wake the American people up.</p><p>HILTON: I totally agree. And by the way, I agree with that drawing of the contrast, just as you said, Henry, but my argument is that you can do that, you can put your story out there in a positive way and you can draw the contrast with the other side in a way that it doesn't inflame some of the divisions that have been, you know, people have been struggling with in this country for an awful long time.</p><p>I just think there's a way of doing that that will satisfy what we're all looking for, I think, which is this kind of positive argument. And we've got to leave it there for the moment.</p><p>Now, we've got a quick \"Swamp Watch\" update for you on Robert Mueller. He is testifying this week of course.</p><p>And I hope when he is testifying, he is asked directly. And in these exact terms, why he lied at his press conference the other week? He told the American people, he would have charged the President if not for the legal advice that a sitting President couldn't be charged. And then later that same day admitted that was false or in plain English a lie.</p><p>But in case anyone involved in that hearing happens to be watching tonight, here is something else that would be good to get some answers on. Was their personal financial corruption between Robert Mueller and James Comey? Here's what we reported in \"Swamp Watch\" last August.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILTON: How convenient for Lockheed Martin then, that just at the moment when it hired the former Deputy Attorney General James Comey, a post which of course includes supervision of the F.B.I., James Comey's brother in arms, Robert Mueller happens to be the F.B.I. Director.</p><p>What an incredible coincidence that shortly afterwards, the F.B.I. gave Lockheed Martin a $300 million deal to develop a program called Sentinel. And what a further astonishing coincidence that Robert Mueller's F.B.I. then awarded James Comey's Lockheed Martin, a $1 billion contract for a biometric surveillance program called the Next Generation Identification System.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILTON: Robert Miller is a swamp lawyer. Do not let him off the hook on Wednesday. All right, coming up, we're going to continue our conversation about the political debate, President Trump and the left, why is everyone so angry?</p><p>One conservative argues that this is all the result of the left's aggression towards conservatives over many decades. We will debate it, next.</p><p>HILTON: Welcome back. We can all agree that emotions are running high in politics these days. But what's the origin? Here's part of a series of tweets from a conservative this week. He is no supporter of President Trump. But what he said caught my eye. Quote, \"One of the most frustrating things for a movement conservative is that it feels impossible to publicly make the accurate case that the reason we have Trump, the reason so many on the right embraced him despite all of his obvious shortcomings, vulgarities and inadequacies is because of the way the left has treated the rights in this country for decades.\"</p><p>\"The right's embracing of Trump is a byproduct of the tyrannical and bad faith treatment perpetrated on the right, culturally and politically and economically by the left.\"</p><p>Henry, I thought there was some real wisdom in that.</p><p>OLSEN: Oh, absolutely. I mean, I've been involved in conservative politics for 45 years, and I was called racist and fascist years before Donald Trump ever came. People were accusing Mitt Romney of that. They accused George Bush at different times. It's just, if you are on the right in America, you are attacked as being at best, stupid and at worst, evil.</p><p>And as one of my friends, if you're really effective, they call you stupid and evil. And after a time, you just realize that they're not going to treat you fairly. So, you want somebody who fights back.</p><p>HILTON: And they are constantly sort of pushing their agenda, pushing their agenda without ever kind of stopping to think, let's have a bit of kind of diplomacy here. Let's have a sort of a sense of tolerance to what other people might think. It's no, we've got to ram it down your face.</p><p>LAHREN: I like to bring it down to the level when you and I talk about people and families and relationships, something I write about a lot in my book and why we're experiencing what we're experiencing on college campuses, and especially in places like California, New York, the coasts that are blue, deep blue, is that these people think that everyone around them must be a liberal, everyone around them must hate Donald Trump.</p><p>So, they have no problem disparaging Trump supporters, disparaging the president, disparaging patriotism, and all things that come along with it because they think everybody else thinks like they do. That's why they were so wrong when Trump won in 2016 because they had this notion that, \"Well, everyone must think like me,\" and it's an indulgent feeling. It's an indulgent theory, and they're being proved wrong, and Donald Trump doesn't take it from them. And that's why he won and that's what he's going to win again.</p><p>HILTON: Yes. I mean, you've chronicled this. I mean, this is, you know, the behavior of the left. It's just so intolerant, and that's what people are reacting to. Funny though, President Trump kind of speaks up for them.</p><p>BRUCE: Well, when I was on the left in which I continue to try to make up for, for the last quarter of a century, is part of the theory was that we've trusted that Republicans wouldn't push back, and it would make it easier to move through.</p><p>But what I also realized as I began to make my move out was that liberals didn't have the answers if they were questioned, is that we didn't -- we couldn't survive an actual debate and an actual confrontation. So, you had to simply shut people down and eliminate the nature of their voice and all.</p><p>Monson's tweet also went on to say that the people who voted for Trump would regret choosing him as an antidote. The biggest mistake conservatives continue to make, I should say, Republicans in particular, is to underestimate Donald Trump, and by then proxy, underestimate the American people. That's the problem here is that we're at reacting, that we're a reactive force, that there's no thought behind what we're doing. We're like a ball rolling down a hill, and we can't stop.</p><p>The fact is, we know what we're doing, we elected him not because of one thing, but because of a million things and that is the next -- certainly, the next generation of the future. And what he discussed, the fact that he is focused on accomplishing things as a man of action, that we actually, as we operate in our own lives, you've got a budget, you've got a to-do list, you've got to get as much on that to-do list done, because tomorrow is coming, and we could relate to him.</p><p>So, it's an insult to suggest that we're kind of zombies, and we're kind of like crows, and there was a shiny thing, and we're going to follow the shiny thing. No, it's deeper than that. And that's also why President Trump will win in 2020, because it is on the issues constantly underestimated and constantly underestimating the American people.</p><p>HILTON: And Tomi, I mean, we were talking earlier about, you know, just the latest -- you know, the Nike business with the shoe. You can't have the American flag on the shoe, just yet another example all the time of this kind of cultural imperialism, you know, from the left, saying, \"No, you're right, you're wrong. Forget about it.\"</p><p>LAHREN: Well, loving this country didn't used to be a partisan thing, but the left has chosen to cosign that proudly, and it makes it very easy for us. Because if we have to say we're the party that loves the American flag and the American way of life, and I guess we'll take that and President Trump should take that on as well.</p><p>But to what you were saying to him, I think it's important that we don't make President Trump our Messiah. But we look at him and say, this man did something fantastic. And then he needs to pass the torch along to someone else who is willing to do the same thing.</p><p>We can never go back to a John McCain or Mitt Romney style of conservative again, because we will lose again.</p><p>BRUCE: Or even to your point going from a Reagan to Bush, is that there has to be someone who understands the nature of the Reformation.</p><p>HILTON: Great point, by the way, I just wanted to reemphasize something that is so brilliant. The left couldn't survive an actual debate, Tammy Bruce. Very good. All right. Why on Earth is the Federal government thinking of awarding a $10 billion bailout to Amazon's Jeff Bezos. We will tell you next.</p><p>HILTON: Welcome back. It's been a while since we brought you a \"Swamp Watch\" and tonight, we've got one with all the greatest hits, backroom deals, lavish lobbying, the revolving door and Big Tech.</p><p>The Defense Department's $10 billion contract aka the Bezo's bailout is this week's \"Swamp Watch\".</p><p>In March 2017, then Defense Secretary Jim Mattis had dinner in London with someone called Teresa Carlson. She worked for Amazon and her job was to sell Amazon Web Services to government entities. Around the same time, Pentagon officials with ties to Amazon also helped arrange other meetings for Ms. Carlson with General Mattis's Chief of Staff and other Pentagon officials.</p><p>Why all this cozying up to the Department of Defense? Well, the DoD was putting together a Cloud computing contract worth up to $10 billion, one of the largest government contracts in U.S. history. The program is called the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure or JEDI. Yes, really.</p><p>Now, Amazon Web Services is the most profitable bit of Amazon. The money they make there is what allows them to enter and dominate other markets. So, giving such a massive contract to Amazon Web Services is effectively a taxpayer bailout for Jeff Bezos.</p><p>So, what went on in those meetings between Pentagon officials and Amazon Web Services? Well, a recent Federal lawsuit by another company he wants the contract claims that Amazon secretly negotiated with a then DoD employee named Deap Ubhi, offering him a job, stock options and even a signing bonus to come and work for Amazon, all while he was working on the JEDI program.</p><p>Unbelievably, Ubhi did not even recuse himself when he allegedly received the offer, despite the government regulation that bans this exact kind of conflict of interest.</p><p>But none of this is a surprise when you realize just how swampy Amazon is. Look how many senior executive branch officials, some of whom were literally responsible for procurement, recently left the government and spun round Amazon's revolving door, not just Deap Ubhi, but also Christine Halvorsen, Brandon Bouier, Scott Renda, Nishant Shah, Victor Gavin, Stephen Block, Rahul Prabakhar, Shawn Arnwine -- on and on it goes.</p><p>And then there's the lobbying. Amazon spent $14.2 million on lobbying in 2018, all under the direction and guidance of President Obama's former spokesman Jay Carney, who is now Amazon's Head of Public Policy and Communications. Oh, and the $14 million they spent on lobbying doesn't even include other swampy ways Amazon tries to influence our government, for example, while pushing for the JEDI contract, Amazon bought ads for its web services and placed them prominently in the D.C. Metro's Pentagon stop.</p><p>Amazon has funded think tanks who've returned the favor by defending Amazon and promoting its messages. Like the Lexington Institute, a defense think tank whose Vice President has published no less than nine op-eds in support of the JEDI contract. Amazingly, Lexington gets funding from Amazon, but not from any of its Cloud computing rivals like Microsoft, Oracle or IBM. Amazon, of course somehow failed to disclose funding Lexington in its political transparency report earlier this year.</p><p>Now, in the wake of the lawsuit on the alleged conflict of interest here, Congressional leaders, including senators Marco Rubio and Ron Johnson, along with various watchdog groups are accusing the Department of Defense and Amazon of using the terms of the contract to conspire together and freeze out competitors using inside information to give Amazon a clear advantage.</p><p>In response to all of that, President Trump is demanding more information on the JEDI contract and is considering intervening, quite right, too. Draining the swamp means stopping this contract.</p><p>Now, some are trying to position this as political interference. \"The New York Times\" dredged up a former Federal procurement official who said it would be improper for any president to influence the contracting process. Yes, right. We should leave it to the bureaucrats who are constantly corrupted by lucrative job offers and other bribes from swamp big businesses.</p><p>That is exactly how the swamp works. You scratch my back while you're a government official, and we will take care of you when you leave.</p><p>It's not just appropriate but vital that the President kills this contract. And by the way, this is not about hitting back at Jeff Bezos or helping one of his rivals. I worked on this contracting issue myself in government. Giant monopolized contracts like this are bad policy. Putting all of our defense's Cloud computing in one basket allows for far more corruption and security risks than dividing it up into multiple smaller contracts.</p><p>That also produces competition among the contractors, incentivizing efficiency and innovation. But of course, the swamp doesn't like efficiency and innovation. They like backroom deals and corruption.</p><p>Mr. President, if you want to keep draining the swamp, don't let the Bezos' bailout fill it back up.</p><p>All right, so now the Democrats want to ban cooking with gas. Literally. \"Loony Left\" is next.</p><p>HILTON: All right, Berkeley, California has become the first U.S. city to ban the installation of natural gas lines in new homes. The Democrats war on cooking with gas is this week's \"Loony Left.\"</p><p>This week -- I'm laughing already -- there's more to come. The Berkeley City Council unanimously voted to ban natural gas from new buildings starting January the first next year requiring an electric infrastructure, hoping the regulations will help with pollution and climate change and don't think this is just a local issue.</p><p>California officials claim more than 50 other cities are looking into the ban. And it's only a matter of time before more states jump on the turn- off-the-gas bandwagon.</p><p>Tammy, I heard this and I just thought they just never stop this relentless -- they are going to keep coming for everything.</p><p>BRUCE: Yes, they've got to -- once they start, they can't stop, especially if there's no Republicans, they have no opposition to have them stop and think about these things. So, they will literally never end.</p><p>But this is what's so ironic about this is that starting next year, also, besides this, California is going to require every new home built to have solar panels. Now, all of this involves electricity like they're going to go from gas to electric stoves.</p><p>And liberals generally don't know that you get electricity, not from a key on a kite being flown by someone, but from coal. And so it was Hillary and the liberal and the left and the Democrats wanted to, you know, put all the coal miners out of business. What would we do with the electric stoves if the coal miners were out of business?</p><p>So, this is where the contradiction themselves. They don't understand their own contradictions that if they talk about this as about saving the environment, they're creating an environment that requires more coal and more fossil fuels. The grid relies -- the electric grid relies on fossil fuels. And this though, is their excuse, but it is an excuse they really don't understand.</p><p>It's like in some meeting where they've had some Prosecco and maybe some pot, and they think it sounds like a good idea. I'm not kidding. And that's what they met about.</p><p>HILTON: I like the sound of that meeting, first of all, but just not the conclusions. There was more nonsense from that meeting, I think it was this week, wasn't it?</p><p>LAHREN: Liberals, especially in California where liberals are at their worst or their best in their eyes. They want to do everything that makes them feel nice. Like for example, we no longer want to discriminate against road infrastructures, so we are no longer calling manholes, manholes, there now maintenance holes.</p><p>HILTON: That was this week, the same place, Berkeley --</p><p>LAHREN: Oh, yes, I mean, that's -- policing words is of the utmost importance. But not only that pregnant women in the Municipal Code will no longer be called pregnant women, it's just pregnant person. This is from the party that loves science.</p><p>You know, they call us climate change deniers, but they're actually telling us that you can't be a pregnant woman anymore, you're just a pregnant person. I don't know how to explain that one.</p><p>HILTON: Are these real?</p><p>LAHREN: No, it's absolutely real. And that's how bad it is in this state. But it's outlined words, because it makes them feel nice, but they don't even understand, like you said, the ramifications of the things that they're doing.</p><p>HILTON: I mean, I don't know. It's just a never ending source of amazement. I mean, it just gets -- but it seems to be accelerating, this looniness.</p><p>OLSEN: Oh, yes. It's like -- what was it? A month ago when San Francisco just voted to paint over a mural of George Washington in one of the schools because why would we like the founder of our country? And it seems that they're just jumping off the cliff farther and farther and the rest of America is watching and rolling their eyeballs.</p><p>HILTON: And it's infecting the mainstream Democrats. You can't tell this is just Berkley, but it's not. I mean, it's infecting all of them.</p><p>BRUCE: Yeah, there's -- I think that there's this set -- of course, they're running primary, so they've got to appeal to their party. But clearly the people running for President think their party is peopled with idiots, with people who are completely disconnected.</p><p>There seems to be no presumption. This is a worry with Democratic leadership, that there are normal people in the party. And Tomi, you made this note before about who's on Twitter, right, that Twitter's gone -- Twitter are the extremists. The average Democrat is not on Twitter. It's a person who is quiet, who is more moderate. And that's why you see Biden in the lead with these polls. But in the end, Biden's not going to be the nominee.</p><p>HILTON: Well, it's very nice of you to mention Joe Biden, because we're going to be talking about him next. He's done another interview. Yes. Oh, you can start laughing now. We'll show you the tape after the break. Don't go away.</p><p>HILTON: All right, we're back with our 2020 update. Now, Joe Biden thinks he knows what America was. Remember this? A couple of weeks ago in an interview, here is what he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think the American people want a President who has some dignity.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILTON: As part of his Crusade for dignity; this week, Joe Biden said this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKA BRZEZINSKI, MSNBC HOST: But what do you do? You make it to the general, you're on the debate stage, he is lying. He is saying we're doing great. That's his brand. We're stronger than ever. He starts making fun of your age, your mental state, starts going after you in ways that this is -- I mean --</p><p>BIDEN: I'd say, come on, Donald. Come on, man. How many pushups you want to do here, pal? I'm joking, right.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILTON: Okay, so he is challenging him to pushups. But then Biden also said this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BIDEN: Look, what I don't want to do is I don't want to be taking on other people in terms of whether or not they're -- what they're saying and how they're saying it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILTON: He doesn't want to be taking on -- he wants to challenge them to pushups, doesn't want to be taking on people. I mean, talk about, you know, Mika was concerned there about his mental capacities. I think that was not reassuring.</p><p>BRUCE: Look, I think that he's not going to be in that position. So, it's nice that they're fighting about this, right, with the general election. He won't be the nominee. Obviously, we see some polls when it comes to the Democratic primaries.</p><p>But I think that -- and he'll probably win some, but he won't be the nominee because this is a Civil War going on in the Democratic Party. And I think that the individuals who might present something that's a move more to a moderate framework, they understand that they, you know, Americans in general want a moderate person if they have to think about the general election, and we'll start seeing that.</p><p>And there's I think the next debate is going to be much more, even more aggressive. And you won't see Joe Biden do well. He is not used -- this as a problem with the establishment characters, as we discussed a little earlier about the left, they aren't used to being challenged, even amongst their own.</p><p>And you saw how surprised. Biden said he was surprised that Kamala Harris went after him. Because they don't do this.</p><p>HILTON: It's only a debate.</p><p>BRUCE: I mean, you mean, you're really going to debate me? They're not used to it, and you're going to see -- he's from a generation where they're just not prepared for it. And I think that it's cute that they're arguing about what he'd do in the general, but he's not going to have to worry about that.</p><p>HILTON: So I'm torn because I kind of want him to keep going and get the nomination because he is so ridiculous and funny.</p><p>LAHREN: I know, I kind of disagree with you, because I think there's a chance for him to get the nomination. That's how bad the Democratic Party is right now and then also talking about just in California, because that's a big state for Democrats. Pete Buttigieg has raised more in California than Kamala Harris, who has raised more than Joe Biden. So, here we are, they're all competing to lose to Donald Trump.</p><p>HILTON: Henry?</p><p>OLSEN: Look, Donald Trump is finishing his best two-month run in popularity of his administration.</p><p>HILTON: By the way, that's based on the data, isn't it?</p><p>OLSEN: That's on the data of Real Clear Politics. He is finishing his best two-month round of his presidency. His job approval is inching up, the net disapproval is inching down. Poll shows that he would win by six points against the Democrat who was considered to be a socialist. They can have their arguments all they want, but slowly, Donald Trump is winning the argument.</p><p>HILTON: Well, in that case, I mean, what's going to happen in terms of the -- because I don't see anyone else there, to your point, Tammy that even sort of pretending to be moderate. I mean, like they're not -- they're going to end up with someone, it looks like they're going to end up someone like Henry is describing --</p><p>BRUCE: Yes, right. And that's the Civil War now. What they're really fighting over is who is going to be the leader in 2024? Because there's no leadership. That's why we see the chaos in the House, right, between Nancy Pelosi and AOC plus three is that they -- this is a fight for supremacy in the party itself. Democrats -- average Democrats, and even in her district, there's no enthusiasm. Eleven percent of Democrats voted in her district -- 11 percent, and she won by 4,000 votes. There's no enthusiasm anywhere.</p><p>So Democrats are -- they're going have to figure out how to -- and they think by trying to divide us and calling the President a racist in all of this is going to somehow enthuse their base. That alone is insulting if they think the average Democrat wants that.</p><p>LAHREN: It enthuses people on Twitter, but not when they actually go out and vote because these people generally don't vote.</p><p>HILTON: In the real world, they are -- we will leave that there.

The DOJ plans to propose that Congress force titans \u2014 such as Google , Facebook and Twitter \u2014 to take more responsibility for managing content on their sites, The Wall Street Journal reports .   This comes after congressional Republicans drew up a bill that would amend Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act , which was enacted in the 1990s to prevent companies from being held responsible for users' content. For example, internet companies are considered to be platforms, and not held to the same standards as the press.   The law has been one of the primary cornerstones of modern internet policy. It lets big companies like Google and Facebook \u2014 along with the small fry \u2014 avoid many legal disputes.   The Republicans bill would also limit the kind of content that platforms could remove, by changing the phrase \"otherwise objectionable\" content in the original law to content that is \"promoting self-harm, promoting terrorism, or unlawful.\"   Similarly, the Trump administration\u2019s proposal encourages online platforms to actively address illicit conduct and manage content on their sites in fair and consistent ways. Trump\u2019s interest in the latter grew after social media sites policed some of his questionable statements. In May, Twitter applied a fact-checking notice to a Trump post about voter fraud, saying it was not substantiated by the facts.   Trump and GOP lawmakers have criticized Big Tech, alleging there have been biased decisions to censor social-media posts or block certain users. Democrats, including presidential candidate Joe Biden, argue that social media platforms need to do more to curb the spread of false information and hate speech.   In other words, Republicans and Democrats do not agree on what the problem is with the social media world.   However, they do agree on targeting online platforms that facilitate criminal activity, the Journal reports. The DOJ proposal does take aim at that issue and calls for amending the 1990s law \u2014 which shields internet platforms from legal liability related to users\u2019 actions, except in very limited circumstances.   Under the Trump plan, companies could lose legal protections if they find out about unlawful activities, but don\u2019t restrict and report it.   \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014    LIVE PYMNTS TV OCTOBER SERIES: POWERING THE DIGITAL SHIFT \u2013 B2B PAYMENTS 2021      Banks, corporates and even regulators now recognize the imperative to modernize \u2014 not just digitize \u2014the infrastructures and workflows that move money and data between businesses domestically and cross-border.

I'm Shannon Bream in Washington.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Wall Street and many in D.C. are telling the Trump administration as being tough or reckless with China by playing a high stakes game of chicken over tariffs. But many of the same critics say the president isn't being tough enough with Russia even after a new round of sanctions directly squarely -- directed squarely at President Vladimir Putin's inner circle. We're taking a close look at the president's policies on both fronts tonight. We've got team coverage. Gillian Turner, examining the latest round of Russian sanctions. And chief national correspondent, Ed Henry is here with the latest on the tariffs patch rattling the markets. Ed.</p><p>ED HENRY, FOX NEWS CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Shannon, the fact that President Trump promised over and over in the campaign to get tough on China is pretty straightforward. What's complicated is that by keeping that promise, there could be some real economic costs, as we saw with the markets today and some political ones in the fall with the midterms. The president did a radio interview here in New York today, which he said this talk of a trade war is silly. In many ways, we already lost the war. China's cheating, he said, has been ignored by Republican and Democratic administrations. He added, it killed thousands of American factories, millions of American jobs and now we're stuck with a $500 billion trade deficit with China.</p><p>Here's the thing, even anti-Trump columnist and commentator, Fareed Zakaria, acknowledged today in the Washington Post, \"President Trump is right. China is a trade cheat. Previous administration exerted pressure privately, worked within the system and tried to get allies on board with limited results.\" Getting tough on China, he writes, is a case where I'm willing to give Trump's unconventional methods a try. Nothing else has worked.</p><p>But the markets were rattled in part by confusing signals by the president's own team. His treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin today, flat out admitted there is in fact a potential for a new trade war. Even as the president's new chief economic advisor, Larry Kudlow keeps trying to calm everyone down by suggesting all of this is just a careful negotiation to use threats that might get China to make even minor concessions that struck a level playing field. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL: We are considering adding tariff pressures. Considering. I don't want to disrupt the economy. The president doesn't want to disrupt the economy. We need not disrupt the economy. This is a moderate tempered approach that we are taking. It is moderate, temperate, and proportional. This is not a trade war.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: But we're going to have a much stronger country when we're finished. And that's what I'm all about. We have to do things that other people wouldn't do. So we may take a hit. You know what? Ultimately, we're going to be much stronger for it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HENRY: Well, all of that contributed to the rollercoaster markets along with this statement from the Chinese government. \"The Chinese side will follow through to the end and will not hesitate to fight back at any cost. We're prepared and have already formulated very detailed counter measures.</p><p>Well, those measures are where the midterms come in play. China is being very crafty about directing their fury at Midwestern battlegrounds, yes, in Trump country. States where soybeans, corn, tobacco farmers may take a hit not just in 2018, but last I heard, Shannon, there's another election coming in 2020.</p><p>BREAM: So there is. All right, Ed. Thank you very much. Some on Wall Street are calling it the tariff tantrum. The latest wild swing in the market attributed to an uptick in trade tension between the U.S. and China. All three stock market indices losing at least two percent today and all closing lower for the week. Industrial stocks, especially those with big stakes and China's growing industrial economy like Caterpillar, Boeing and Deere were among the Dow's hardest hits. Always important to remember, there's time for Beijing and the Trump administration to reach an agreement before a made deadline, but traders appear to be pricing in a worst-case scenario which would be an all-out trade war.</p><p>Well, Moscow responding tonight as President Trump's last new sanctions on dozens of Russian oligarchs and government officials. Some companies there as well. Gillian Turner is monitoring it all, joins us with the latest. Good evening, Gillian.</p><p>GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: The new round of sanctions are intended to severe 17 senior Russian government officials, seven oligarchs and 12 companies from the international financial system and prevent Americans from doing business with any of them. They also include targets intended to hit close to home for President Putin. One of the key targets is his very own son-in-law, a high profile oil executive married into Putin family in 2013 and shortly thereafter became a billionaire.</p><p>Another key target, a close childhood friend of Putin. Now an oil executive and long-time head of Gazprom. The Russian state controlled their natural gas giant. The White House touting the moves as proof President Trump is prepared to get tough on the Kremlins.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The totality of the administration's actions which are in keeping with Congress's wishes prove the president is absolutely correct when he says no one has been tougher on Russia.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TURNER: One of the oligarch's named in the sanction is Oleg Deripaska, a one-time colleague of Paul Manafort. President Trump's former campaign manager and adviser. In the wake of the U.S. announcement, shares in Deripaska's energy company took a tumble. And he had some harsh words for the sanctions calling them groundless, ridiculous, and absurd.</p><p>The Russian embassy in Washington put out its own scathing response with an official statement reading, \"Washington has delivered yet another blow to Russian-U.S. relations. Now, the sanctions cover captains of Russian business refuse to play to Washington's scenario.\"</p><p>Some Democratic lawmakers used the sanctions announcement as an opportunity to point out President Trump's seeming reluctant to take a hard line on Putin himself.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. GERRY CONNOLLY (D), VIRGINIA: This president has been sending mixed messages to the Russians and to Vladimir Putin personally that make you wonder, is there a consistent policy?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TURNER: Administration officials however were quick to defend the president's stance.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NIKKI HALEY, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS: Russia is never going to be our friend. But having said that, that doesn't mean we don't want to work with them. But we work with them when we need to and we slap them when we need to. That's just the way it needs to be.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TURNER: The treasury department says these sanctions are a direct response to Russia's arming of the Assad regime and Syria's ongoing civil war and Russian cyber operations. All of this comes, Shannon, just days after American diplomats expelled from Russian, landed back home here on U.S. soil. Shannon.</p><p>BREAM: All right. Gillian, thank you very much for the update. Well, the president claimed back in February via Twitter that he's been tougher on Russia than President Obama ever was. So, is it true? Let's talk about it with Juan Williams, co-host of \"THE FIVE.\" And former Utah congressman, Fox New contributor, Jason Chaffetz. Great to have you both tonight, gentlemen.</p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Nice to be with you.</p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Thanks, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM: OK. So let's start on the left. Scott Dworkin this. He's from the Dem Coalition. He says the weakest -- he says to the president, \"You're the weakest president ever. The B.S. sanctions. But he spelled it out. You place on select Russians and companies can't be trusted. Nothing you do can. This is all so you can act like you're tough on Russia when in reality, we all know you promised Putin something in return. Jason?</p><p>CHAFFETZ: I don't know who that Dworkin is, but it sounds like a pretty ridiculous statement. Factually, President Obama was very weak on Russia. It started when he pulled out the missile defense from Poland. That was viewed as a gift to the Russian people. They tried to do this fictitious reset with Russia. They mocked Mitt Romney for his comments about the severity of the Russian thread. They really didn't do anything. But President Trump has done a lot, including a $100 billion plus-up in our military, which the Russians can't keep up with and these new rounds of sanctions that have gone on. And it was the Russians, by the way, that were accused of actually poisoning somebody there in the U.K. We're supporting our NATO allies. We've built a bigger, broader coalition and had more of an effect on Russia than anything Barack Obama ever did.</p><p>BREAM: OK. Let's bring in Juan here. Now, Juan, Byron York wrote a piece about this and he said, when this conversation came up, I reached out to a GOP lawmaker who immediately sent me this list. Bombing Syria, Russia's main client, unleashing the U.S. military in Syria, including against Russians when necessary, arming Ukraine, browbeating NATO allies to increase defense spending, adding low-yield nukes to our arsenal, starting research and development on an INF non-compliant missile and shutting down Russia's San Francisco consulate. So, what do you think in comparison to the Obama years?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I think the best case for Donald Trump is to say I've been tougher in my first term than Barack Obama was in his first term. But I think that if you start to look at the record and this is not just a matter of my opinion, when you go look at PolitiFact, the Washington Post, the New York Times, they all say that when President Trump, President Trump first said, I'm tougher than Obama ever was, then in fact this was not true. Why do they say it's not true, Shannon? They say it's not true because if you look at an issue like for example, Ukraine, the United States government, under President Obama was quite aggressive in telling President Putin to get out, sending forces. In fact, we sent our CIA director over there to help the Ukrainian forces. Secondly, congressman Chaffetz mentioned --</p><p>CHAFFETZ: But that's not what happened, Juan. They took Crimea. And they kept it.</p><p>WILLIAMS: No. But let me just say that what happened there was they were going to expand to take Ukraine. They --</p><p>CHAFFETZ: But they didn't take Crimea and they did not pull back.</p><p>WILLIAMS: But they didn't, congressman, because President Obama was tough and the threat of U.S. tough military power laid them back off.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Didn't push them out of Georgia either. They took 25 percent of that country.</p><p>WILLIAMS: OK. And then you mentioned the missile defense. Again, we moved the missile defense from Poland and guess what, Putin cried bloody murder, he said that we were in fact expanding NATO, coming into his orbit and that it was too aggressive. That was President Obama.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: But he pulled it back, Juan. We're already under George W. Bush, we were going to put the missile defense in Poland. One of the first things Obama did is pull it back.</p><p>WILLIAMS: No. In fact, we included Poland in NATO and we moved the missile defense. So it was still effective in countering all of the Russian missiles which is why Putin was so upset. But again, this is about -- I think the real argument here is President Trump always trying to vilify President Obama, compare himself to Obama. That shouldn't be the point. The point should be that he should speak aggressively against Putin at this moment and he never said a word moment about Putin's meddling and interference in our 2016 election.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: I agree.</p><p>BREAM: And maybe that with you two on that point of agreement, I mean, that is one of the issues too that Byron brought up in his piece. He said, for some people who are critical of Trump on the issue of Russia, is that they haven't seen the kind of reaction they want to see with regard to election issues. But when you look at the list of the other things, there is a debate to be had and you guys had a good one.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I love it. I can talk with Jason Chaffetz either. He's a smart guy.</p><p>BREAM: I know. He probably feels the exact same way about you.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Thanks, Juan. I probably not going to tweet that up.</p><p>WILLIAMS: No, don't do that. We want to protect your base, brother.</p><p>BREAM: We got to protect both of your guys. Juan and Jason, the two Js. Have a great weekend. Thank you both.</p><p>WILLIAMS: You too, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM: All right. The first of 4,000 national guardsmen ordered by President Trump to the Mexico border are now deploying. Arizona and Texas each offering up hundreds of guardsmen in a first wave.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIG. GEN. TRACY NORRIS, ASSISTANT DEPUTY ADJUTANT GENERAL OF THE TEXAS MILITARY DEPARTMENT: This initial phase of deployment will include command and control, coordination cells and operational planning as requested in support of the federal entities already on the border. Follow-on forces will move to the border once mission requirements and locations are finalized. As early as tomorrow, notifications will go out to soldiers who will be called up as part of the follow on phase. This notification will allow guardsmen, soldiers and airmen to notify their families and employers and the corporations to report as early as next week.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM: Well, Texas already has 100 guardsmen deployed as part of an existing state mission at the border.</p><p>Tech giants including Facebook, Google and Twitter being sued by survivors of the Pulse nightclub massacre for allegedly providing support and resources to ISIS. Trace is going to join us with that story.</p><p>And Facebook Sheryl Sandberg apologizes for the Cambridge Analytica fiasco. Saying the company was wrong, they're changing things and they hope to get it right moving forward.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHERYL SANDBERG, COO, FACEBOOK: We did not do enough to protect people's data. I'm really sorry for that. Mark is really sorry for that. And now we're taking very strong action to get ahead of the problem.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM: And Apple's CEO, Tim Cook defending his company's decision to stream NRA TV but with a warning, coming up.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE: You can bet that we continue to monitor and if it walks into the path of hate speech or some of these other things, then we're cutting it off.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM: Next week shaping up to be a big one Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. He's already under fire from Congressmen Anna Eshoo who represents his home district. The company is also facing a new lawsuit and new criticism over its basic business practices. Trace Gallagher has more details for us tonight. Trace?</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Shannon, even if you're worth $60 billion, sometimes you got to feel the heat. And members of Congress are planning in putting Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg's feet to the fire. His appearance comes on the heels of the Cambridge Analytica scandal that exploited the information of some 90 million Facebook users. And so privacy will likely be the primary topic. Iowa GOP Senator Chuck Grassley, chair of the Judiciary Committee says \"with all of the data exchanged over Facebook and other platforms, users deserve to know how their information is shared and secured.\" And Zuckerberg can forget hometown favoritism. Democratic Congresswoman Anna Eshoo whose district includes Facebook says she plans to how to ask how Facebook was used to \"damaged our Democracy\" and how the company has shaked politics. Zuckerberg will also be asked about plans to make sure and information is disseminated fairly and that political sources are fully vetted.</p><p>And while next week's stands to be tough on Zuckerberg, this week hasn't exactly been a cake walk. Facebook along with Google and Twitter are being sued by 16 survivors of the Pulse Nightclub massacre in Orlando, Florida. The sued alleges the tech company has violated the anti terrorism act and profited by allowing ISIS to spread propaganda. And a group of civil society organizations in Maynmar are now blaming Facebook for the spread of hates speech that may have put thousands in danger. They're referring to two separate chain letters that warned impending attacks by Muslims and Buddhists.</p><p>The group has alleged that Facebook never picked up on the fake letters until they were alerted. And even then it took days to take down the phony information. And then there were the leaked comments made by Facebook Vice President Andrew Bosworth in a 2016 memo where he wrote that connecting people was paramount no matter the consequences. \"Maybe it cost a life by exposing someone to bullies, maybe someone dies in the terrorist attack coordinated on our tools and still we connect people.\" Mark Zuckerberg says he strongly disagrees with the memo. Shannon?</p><p>BREAM: All right. Trace, thank you very much. So feeling the heat, Facebook today announced new policies aimed at increasing transparency and accountability in their so called issue ads. But will that satisfy the tech company's growing course of critics. Let's bring in tonight's panel, Julian Epstein, former chief counsel for the House Judiciary Committee. Sarah Westwood, the Washington Examiner's White House Correspondent, and Vince Coglianese, the editorial director for the Daily Caller among many other things. All of you have many multiple jobs. So thank you for taking time out to visit with us tonight.</p><p>VINCE COGLIANESE, EDITORIAL DIRECTOR, THE DAILY CALLER: Thank you.</p><p>BREAM: Good to have you all. OK. So, let's talk about one of these things that Trace, in light of those comments back five, six, seven years ago from one of the Facebook executives, this new lawsuit that's been filed by the Pulse survivors saying this, they say, without the sentence, Twitter, Facebook, and Google, YouTube, the explosive growth of ISIS over the last few years into the most feared terrorist group in the world would not have been possible. They say the company refused to actively monitored networks to block ISIS's use of the service. Julian, you're an accomplished lawyer. Does this go anywhere?</p><p>JULIAN EPSTEIN, FORMER CHIEF COUNSEL, HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: Maybe not this case but this is one of a number of cases that have been made, arguments that have been made. Congress just passed a law because many critics were saying that Facebook and these big tech companies were used to enable sex trafficking. So Congress just passed overwhelmingly a bipartisan law. And most of these companies, people don't know it, your viewers don't know it, have immunity from many of the laws that would otherwise hold them liable.</p><p>So, there is a large party of critics that has said Facebook and Google have enable terrorism, sex trafficking, the theft of television content, movie content, music content and enabled all kinds of other antisocial activity. I suspect the parent company of t his Fox News core is very concern about Facebook's stealing, enabling the stealing of television content and posting it on their sites for free. This is one of the many problems that big tech has. Privacy is a big problem, the enablement of antisocial conduct like sex trafficking, like terrorism, another problem. Lots of critics saying they have anti-competitive abuses. This is not just a privacy problem they have. They're in a world of hurt. Sheryl Sandberg didn't help this morning with her interview.</p><p>BREAM: Well, I want to play a little bit of what she had to say today on some of the issues.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SANDBERG: If you are running not just an election ad, so you're a candidate but you're running an issue ad and we're going to publish a list of issues, we're going to verify who you are. You're going to have to tell us your location, your identity. If you won't tell us that or we don't think it's correct, we're not going to let you run.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM: Sarah, those were comments to our Dana Perino today. What do you make of it?</p><p>SARAH WESTWOOD, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, WASHINGTON EXAMINER: Well, I think, look, like Julian said, we're sort of having this conversation as a society about what responsibility these social media platforms have to their users, have to shield them from content that could be offensive to police, illegal activity and what responsibilities users have to be responsible for their own data, to take steps to protect their own information. We're learning that maybe, you know, social media companies don't have your best interests at heart at the end of the day and that you do need to take steps to protect yourself. It's interesting though because a lot of these social media practices have been in use since at least the 2008 election but they're only now sort of coming into the spotlight because of the severity with which they were exploited during the 2016 election. And there is a bit partisanship injected into the debate now.</p><p>BREAM: Well, Vince, what do you think? Do you think that there would be this aggression in cleaning house over some of these issues had Hillary Clinton won?</p><p>COGLIANESE: No. Not at all.</p><p>BREAM: Seriously?</p><p>COGLIANESE: I don't. I don't think there would be any sort of push like this toward social media companies that Hillary Clinton won. The reason for that is we've known all along what Facebook does. It gathers -- the reason we use it for free is because we're trading our privacy for access to it. We've been doing it for years. And no one has really made a stink out of it. I mean, there are -- probably a couple of people who noticed of it. Never had a Congressional level. The reason it's gotten to this moment now is because it all started a couple weeks ago with the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The fact that that organization was connected to Donald Trump has been used as yet another pretext for why Donald Trump won the election rather than just simply beating Hillary Clinton in a political contest. Now Mark Zuckerberg is being called to the Hill. Would he be called to the Hill for testimony net week, were not for the fact that a Trump-associated organization in any way was connected to this? No, I don't think so. This is I think nakedly partisan because -- and -- but it's about time that we look hard at the access to which these companies have to our privacy.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>EPSTEIN: I think there were lots of criticism about social media practices before Trump won and even before Cambridge Analytica came on. I think to your point, it's interesting. Steve Bannon is the person who's out there saying that big tech ought to be treated like utilities. Lots of criticism coming from the right about censorship concerns.</p><p>COGLIANESE: Yes, yes.</p><p>BREAM: Right.</p><p>EPSTEIN: I think rather than partisan , it maybe -- the -- Cambridge Analytica might be partisan but there's a growing bipartisan chorus of voices on the left and right saying that needs to be regulation, these guys need to be held accountable.</p><p>BREAM: Well, we'll get two days of it next week up on the Hill when Zuckerberg is there. Thank you panel. Please stick around because we got more hot topics for you. In the meantime, coming up. A sky high murder rate. London beseech by violent crime stabbings and homicides. The mayor says he needs help.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SADIQ KHAN, MAYOR OF LONDON: The Prime Minister meet with me and the Commissioner to try and fund the national solution to these national problems, she said no. I'm also looking today to meet with me and the commissioner to see if we can solve this together.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM: And a two-year-old in a fight for his life. His parents say they've got hope. But the hospital says time's up even the pope is waiting. Penny Nance says it is time to push back against government decisions that should be left to parents. She joins us live when we return.</p><p>BREAM: One year ago, London's mayor boasted his city was the safest in the world. Now it's getting more dangerous by the day. What happened? Here's Senior Foreign Affairs Correspondent Greg Palkot.</p><p>GREG PALKOT, FOX NEWS SENIOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Shannon, for a city long known for its civilized behavior, the bobby on the beat, London has a problem. The murder rate here for February and March was -- believe it or not ahead of New York's. The city of similar size and population and quite a history. With guns harder to get here, 35 of London's 55 homicide cases in 2018 were knife incidents. Many in the rougher areas of the city. Scotland Yard on Friday holding an emergency sessions with authorities and community leaders. Center-left Labour London Mayor Sadiq Khan was on the defense of this week. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KHAN: To families, I'm incredibly sorry. I mean, particularly, one loss is one -- too many, many bereaved families attended to funerals. It's deeply, deeply upsetting.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PALKOT: What's behind this increase? The center-right conservative government in the U.K. has made some pretty big across the board 20 percent cuts in recent years, not just in policing but also social services. Expert says that could have an impact on this. Also, as in the State, the stop and search approach to dealing with suspects has been sharply curtailed amid an increase in crime overall in the U.K.</p><p>Still, even with New York's murder rate way down from the old days, London will still have a way to go to match that. Last year in 2017, New York saw 290 killed. Here in London, the figure was 134. Shannon.</p><p>BREAM: Greg, thank you very much. Well, a 2 year old boy is caught in a middle of a legal battle over his life. Alfie Evans is suffering from a degenerative neurological condition. He's been hospitalized for more than a year in England.</p><p>Well, hospital official says there is no hope of recovery. And they've gone to court to get permission to remove any life-sustaining measures. Alfie's parent say, he's been increasingly responsive and they've been searching for alternative treatment options. They say they've been talking about that with the hospital, so now they feel blind-sided about the hospital's request to end Alfie's life.</p><p>The case has many similarities to the last year's Charlie Gard case. That little boy died in London after a legal battle over his care. And both cases, the pope has weighed in publicly, supporting the parents and their fight to try to take their children elsewhere for care.</p><p>Penny Nance, president, and CEO of Concerned Women for America worked to help Charlie Gard's parents last year. She joins us now to talk about these new case with Alfie Evans. Thanks for coming in.</p><p>PENNY NANCE, PRESIDENT, CONCERNED WOMEN FOR AMERICA: A heartbreaking case.</p><p>BREAM: I mean, this is really difficult because -- let me read you at the hospital has said about why they think it's the end. They say, \"We always aim to reach agreement with parents about the most appropriate palliative care plan for their child but sadly, in this case, we have not been able to do this. Consequently, we must return to the High Court, as we are legally required to do, for guidance about a date on which to draw treatment from Alfie.\" Now, the parents say, they've just been in the meeting with the hospital --</p><p>NANCE: Right.</p><p>BREAM: -- and they thought they were going to have a chance to maybe take him somewhere else.</p><p>NANCE: Right, they felt completely blind-sided by this, you know. The standard for you surfing parental rights in the U.K. is a lower standard than here. And that's part of the conversation that's going on now. But it's a serious issue and it continues. And by the way, you know, doctors don't always get it right, and parents love their children the most, more than any all these well-intentioned medical experts.</p><p>There was a case three years ago, His name is Eisha King, a little 5 year old boy who had a cancer's brain tumor. And his (INAUDIBLE) for being told they couldn't have the treatment that they were seeking, a specialized treatment, they took him and ran. They ran just -- they went to Spain first. So, it tipped off this like national -- this international incident. They were arrested, held for 48 hours.</p><p>Finally, the U.K. backed down, they took him to the Czech Republic. He got the treatment the parents were seeking, and he's been -- he's been cleared of cancer now. And they just interviewed him and he said he wants to grow up to be a chef.</p><p>So, least that was a happy ending, and maybe it wouldn't be a happy ending. But the issue is parental rights. What rights do the parents had have versus the heavy-handed government, which in this case is the political health system and the U.K. And parents are losing.</p><p>BREAM: Well, and this is what the mother said. This is a statement on Facebook that attributed to her after the meeting she had with the hospital. She said, \"They said they would review the new evidence and they put aside the talks of end of life until the new medical evidence would be reviewed and we were able to seek a second opinion. We are disgusted in what they've done and how they can get away with this.\" And they'd -- like Charlie Gard's family --</p><p>NANCE: Right.</p><p>BREAM: -- they've crowdsourced funding --</p><p>NANCE: Right.</p><p>BREAM: -- so that they could take them somewhere else. And a lot of people -- regardless of where they are on socialized medicine or anything else --</p><p>NANCE: Sure.</p><p>BREAM: -- are kind of like -- listen, if the parents think there's a shot somewhere and they raised the money and they're not asking the government to pay for it, why not let them go?</p><p>NANCE: And this was shocking, all right, this is the U.K., this is isn't third world dictatorship. They have socialized medicine and they have can complete control. Even though Charlie Gard's parents raised 1.3 million pounds and these parents raised 50,000 pounds, they had hospitals both cases that were willing to continue treatment in this case with Alfie -- little Alfie. The Vatican's hospital in Italy said, \"Bring him, we'll try to continue to help him.\" The parents need to be respected and there is a real right to life issue, but there's also a real parental rights issue in this cases.</p><p>BREAM: Well, and a lot of people come question whether -- you know, it's expensive to keep this child alive.</p><p>NANCE: Correct.</p><p>BREAM: In a place where medical care is very carefully --</p><p>NANCE: Rationed.</p><p>BREAM: I don't want to use the word, rationed, but you know, I mean, they have to make tough decisions about who gets treatment that's playing in this case, as well. Penny, thank you for coming in.</p><p>NANCE: Thank you.</p><p>BREAM: We'll keep an eye on this case, and let us know if you hearing anything.</p><p>NANCE: Sure, I will.</p><p>BREAM: All right. When we return, Obama looks back on the 2016 presidential election. That's First Lady Michelle Obama, and she is still unhappy with you, the American voter.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICHELLE OBAMA, FORMER FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED STATES: The best-qualified candidate in this last race was a woman. And she wasn't perfect, but she was way more perfect than many of the alternatives.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>OBAMA: The eight years that Barack was president, it was sort of like having the good parent at home. And now perhaps, we have the other parent in the House. And we thought it feel fun. Maybe it feels fun to some for now because we can eat candy all day.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM: Former First Lady Michelle Obama, making some waves comparing President Trump to an irresponsible called fun parent. So, let's talk about it with our panel tonight. Julian, Sarah, and Vince are back. All right, Sarah, I will start with you. You know, that's how some people feel.</p><p>WESTWOOD: Certainly, I think a lot of critics read that comment as condescending, sort of part and parcel of how the left has viewed a lot of Trump supporters. All these two plus years now that President Trump has been on the political scene that Democrats have treated people who support him and treated his ideas with condescension. A sort of try to invalidate them or something that just sort of totally beneath the reasonable discourse. And as long as Democrats continue to do that and they don't try to engage with Trump and his supporters in a meaningful way, then they're leaving themselves vulnerable to Republicans and Trumpism to continue to dominate because they just don't understand -- they still don't understand what is sort of fuelling his popularity.</p><p>BREAM: Well, this is what Tony Shaffer, had to say in a tweet with the London Center for Policy Research, our viewers will recognize and know Tony. He says, \"We're not children, the metaphor is sickening and demeaning, and shows how little they thought of the American people. Michelle Obama: My husband was the good parent compared to Trump. Vince?</p><p>COGLIANESE: Yes, I agree. I don't think the issues viewed as condescending. I think it is condescending because -- I think it portrays sort of the perspective of the Obama family. Which is that the presidency is one in which they're the parents to the American people. They are in charge, they tell you when bedtime is, they tell you I need your vegetables, they tell you when to shut up and what you should be doing with your life.</p><p>And I think, the average American voter views it very differently that they're in charge, actually. And that the -- we elect the president of the United States to serve us, the sorts to be civil servants.</p><p>And she also sort of -- I think she forgets why Donald Trump was elected and the role her husband played in building the momentum towards his election. She's just -- she's making a scene like we sleepwalk into the Trump presidency, we didn't. And then, the trump presidency is an answer in very many ways to her husband's presidency.</p><p>BREAM: What do you make of it Julian? May does it minimize the serious policy things that President Trump has attempted to do and the things he has gotten done like the tax cuts?</p><p>EPSTEIN: Well, so, I wouldn't have used the metaphor, but I think you can get lost in the analysis of the metaphor and miss the larger point. I think the larger point that she was making is that he does tend to act very unpresidential. And she's not the only person that made it, the Republican leader of the Senate, Mitch McConnell has made that point, Bob Corker has made that point, and number of Republicans in the House and Senate have made that point.</p><p>It's not really all that much different from what many Republicans have said. It's not really all that much different from what the American people said. 60 to 70 percent of the American people think that he acts unpresidential. So, I mean, I think I would have found a different way to say it, but I think there is that point. And I think whether it's the scandals or whether it's the daily tweets acting like a triumph to the insult dog and assaulting everybody that disagrees with you, criticize with you --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BREAM: But there were you -- but there are millions of people who --</p><p>EPSTEIN: I don't really think -- I don't think that's hurting the Democrats. I think right now the wave is moving in the other direction. I don't see any evidence that (INAUDIBLE) Democrats.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COGLIANESE: There's a difference -- there's a difference from being upset with the tone of the president and the behavior of the president. And what -- by that, I mean, President Obama, had an imperial presidency. He expanded the power of the executive in a way that no other President before him had. The use of executive power going after the press in real ways, not calling them fake news. Using the Justice Department to go after The New York Times, going after the associated press --</p><p>BREAM: James Rosen.</p><p>COGLIANESE: James Rosen, time and time again.</p><p>EPSTEIN: We can have that debate.</p><p>COGLIANESE: It is a debate because there's the actions of a president and the tone of a president. And while you may disagree with President Trump's tone, President Obama's behavior, I think warrants a lot more scrutiny and is very -- is a lot of more troubling to the American people.</p><p>BREAM: All right. I want to get to our next topic. And Sarah, since you covered the White House, again, we'll start with you. The president looks like for a second year in a row will not be attend -- attending the White House Correspondents' dinner. It's a tradition here in D.C., but he is not besties with the press.</p><p>WESTWOOD: Absolutely not. It would force him to share a stage with specific journalist who he has attacked for spreading so-called fake news. I think it would be sort of, disingenuous for him to move from attacking members of the presses he called them novelist today.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BREAM: He do. He said they're novelists who don't have sources to makes it well.</p><p>WESTWOOD: People who invent sources, sources who -- you know, rubbing elbows with them in the swampiest of environments, obviously, you know. The dinner is a great opportunity to celebrate the first amendment. To celebrate -- you know, people who cover the White House, but also, I think it's very much not in keeping with the Trump brand, so it makes sense for him to stop.</p><p>EPSTEIN: I think it's a good point but I think, it also overlooks another point, which is that I think, I somewhat sympathize with what Trump -- how Trump feels about the White House Correspondents' dinner. It's kind of a narcissistic celebration of self by the Washington political class. And to your point about being out of touch with Middle America, I mean, I think that resonates well.</p><p>WESTWOOD: It does.</p><p>EPSTEIN: And a few word just to say it like that and leave it at that, I think he would do well. But he takes it too far, and he says, \"I'm going to engage in this war on the media.\" And you know, all of the polls show that he's losing that war with the media, most of the American people, if you put him at a head to head matchup, Donald Trump versus Fox News, they believe Fox News. Donald Trump versus CNN, they believe CNN. Donald Trump versus MSNBC, they believe MSNBC.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BREAM: But we've -- but we have seen -- we have seen about the polling. We've seen polling as well --</p><p>EPSTEIN: The polling all bears it out. It's not an argument that he's winning.</p><p>BREAM: -- that says the American people have a great distrust of the media.</p><p>EPSTEIN: Yes. But the point is -- that's exactly the point, they do and the distrust has been growing.</p><p>BREAM: Right.</p><p>EPSTEIN: But as he attacks the media, he's losing that debate with the American people.</p><p>COGLIANESE: The approval rate -- the approval rate in the media is clearly rock bottom. Also I found it interesting this week that the Monmouth University released a poll said that when people think of fake news, they often actually think of the editorial judgments of these news organizations and not explicitly fake facts. They don't like that they're spending all these times in stories that they think that the American -- the American -- the average American doesn't care about.</p><p>BREAM: Yes, trust me, our Tweeter feed folks weigh-in every night and we love to hear from you and we love to hear from our panel. We are out of time but thank you all for giving us your Friday night. Good to see you.</p><p>EPSTEIN: Thank you.</p><p>BREAM: All right, the Second Amendment under attack. While a Chicago suburb has banned assault weapons and many other firearms and magazines as well, now residents are fighting back. There is a freshly filed lawsuit.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When you want to disarm your citizens because you do not trust them, you go against everything that our Constitution is about.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM: All right, tonight, we take it to \"NIGHT COURT.\" Our attorneys are standing by to present their cases. You are the jury at \"NIGHT COURT\" when we return.</p><p>BREAM: Time now for \"NIGHT COURT.\" We pass no judgment on these stories but present them to you, the jury, for your consideration. On the docket, this Monday Deerfield Village in Illinois voted unanimously to outlaw possessions, sale and manufacturing of what they're calling assault weapons, many other firearms and some magazines as well. The new ordinance also fines gun owners up to $1,000 a day if they don't turn in their weapons or get rid of them by the June 13th deadline. Now, one resident of the town and two gun owners advocacy group are filing suits. So our legal eagles are here to break down the case. David Bruno, a Criminal Defense Attorney who is arguing for the ban to be upheld and Emily Compagno, a former Criminal Defense Attorney who is arguing against the assault weapons ban. Welcome to you both.</p><p>DAVID BRUNO, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Hi Shannon!</p><p>EMILY COMPAGNO, FORMER CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Thank you.</p><p>BREAM: OK, I want to start by reading a little bit of what we got from the Second Amendment foundation that one of the plaintiffs in the case, they say this. While the village is trying to disguise this as an amendment to an existing ordinance, it is in fact a new law that entirely bans possession of legally owned semi-auto firearms with no exception for guns previously owned or any provisions for self-defense. It certainly puts lie to the claims by anti-gunners that nobody is coming to take your guns. David?</p><p>BRUNO: Yes, the fact of the matter is there is precedent on this. And it comes from the same state in the Circuit Court's 7th Circuit. And that in essence said that yes, they can legislate and ban assault weapons. There's a United States Supreme Court case Heller that dealt with handguns at a D.C. and that did not squarely answer that question. So when this court is going to have to decide, they're going to have to look to that seventh circuit precedent that -- and they'll have to follow it, and this is a Constitutional law therefore.</p><p>BREAM: Well, David, one of the crazy things that I was reading about in this case is that one of the plaintiffs actually he lives in a neighboring town where they passed a similar ordinance. So he picked up and moved because he didn't want to get rid of all his guns. He's an instructor. He's is licensed and permitted gun owner. So he moved to Deerfield Village and now they have outlawed -- you know, the reason he moved there. This is what he said. He's said to require lawful owners who have been background checked multiple times to dispose of lawfully owned property is not the way do this. We are literally the safest members of your community.</p><p>BRUNO: Yes, here's the interesting point about that. He should move and go somewhere else. There's a whole United States.</p><p>BREAM: He's going to keep it, the gun laws will follow him.</p><p>BRUNO: Keep on going. You know, there are a number of states that outlaw assault weapons and particularly in this state, not every single municipality has this ban. So he should pick up and leave.</p><p>BEAM: OK. Emily, this is what the village attorney said when this was introduced and they voted on. He said it's any opinion it's entirely lawful, this draft ordinance, under the Second Amendment, as a valid regulation of assault weapons, and as a valid home rule ordinance to amend the villages prior regulation of assault weapons to ban assault weapons, the possession, manufacture and sale of them in within the village of Deerfield. He says it's going to hold up to legal scrutiny. You heard the case that David cited.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Right, now, this ordinance is undeniably unconstitutional and here's why. In part, it defines high capacity as any ammunition feeding device that can accept higher than ten rounds. So in effect, it includes most hand guns. Now, David is right to cite the Heller case from the United States Supreme Court but in fact it does squarely fit here with precedence. They reasoned that the Washington D.C. ban on handguns and regulation that lawfully owned rifles and shotguns was unconstitutional because as they ruled, the Second Amendment protects an individual's right to possess lawful firearms unconnected with the militia for traditionally lawful purposes such as defending themselves in the home. Now, obviously Washington D.C. is federal jurisdiction so in 2010, the Supreme Court ruled that yes, it does apply to the states. Which means here the states cannot infringe on an individual second amendment right. This will not pass muster.</p><p>BREAM: All right, well, the Major there says this. We hope that our local decision helps spur states and national leaders to take steps to make our communities safer. She has said, that's Harriet Rosenthal, that she really hope this will inspire other places to do the same thing. We know that the neighboring town did it. That's why the plaintiff moved to this one. David says he hopes that he continues on. I mean, Emily, what do you think are long term implications of this if the court upholds this ordinance and says yes, this is fine, townships can do this?</p><p>COMPAGNO: If the United States Supreme Court upholds this, yes, we will see that starting to spread but they won't simply because again, merely seven years ago the court ruled that this is unconstitutional. And this isn't about -- and I will say, too, let me interrupt myself to say that the overbroad language of the ordinance simply won't fly either. Given that the court, the United States Supreme Court has issued and ruled so specifically and so strongly that the Second Amendment is protected, there's no way that any exception could be carved out with the broad language that this ordinance states, including again that definition of high capacity ammunition. So here nothing will fly.</p><p>BREAM: Well, and David, I thought it was interesting. I went through and read the ordinance. It's several pages long and there was a specific provision that used to be in their local ordinance that said there's no legal liability if you use one of the guns for self-protection for yourself, you know, threat of bodily harm or someone else. They completely axed that out. That's completely taken out now. So I mean, obviously the idea is they say you have to get rid of your guns or destroy them. Police can take possession of them if they're used as evidence and then destroy them. I mean, they're really saying, you know, they're not confiscating them per se. You just have to get rid of them. They'll take them if you don't get rid of them. For a lot of folks that feels like a real threat to their Second Amendment right.</p><p>BRUNO: No, I agree. But you know what, this is much bigger than Deerfield. This is about the Second Amendment and whether or not it applies to assault weapon. And to rebut Emily's point here. Those arguments were raised in the Seventh Circuit Cause and the U.S. Supreme Court had the opportunity to take this case and decide.</p><p>BREAM: Yes, they didn't.</p><p>BRUNO: The Third was denied. Justice Thomas wrote a descending opinion there. They had the opportunity, they passed.</p><p>BREAM: Yes, we got to leave it there. We'll see because there's a lot of people who want the Supreme Court to step in on these and to wave but --</p><p>BRUNO: Sure. We need some certainty here.</p><p>BREAM: -- without four votes of four Justices, it's not going to happen. All right, guys, thanks very much. Great to see you tonight. And please tweet us @ShannonBream or either of our legal eagles to let us know how you'd rule in the case if you were sitting on the jury. In the meantime, most watch, most trusted, most grateful that you spent the evening with us. Have a fantastic weekend.

He also said that the Trump administration was ''not comfortable'' with Facebook's plans to begin a digital payment system, called Libra. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  The warnings come after similar comments by President Trump, who said in a series of Twitter posts last week that he was ''not a fan'' of cryptocurrencies and that their value was volatile and ''based on thin air.'' Mr. Trump warned Facebook that it must seek a banking charter and follow all bank regulations if it wants to be in the digital currency business.</p><p>  The Trump administration has said little about cryptocurrencies in the past two years, despite their growing popularity. Mr. Mnuchin has largely described the new technology for creating, moving and storing money as a potential consumer protection issue rather than a threat to the financial system. Regulators have long focused on how to minimize crime in the cryptocurrency industry, but it has tended to be a wonky issue that has not attracted much public attention.</p><p>  But Facebook's announcement of Libra has spurred Washington's interest in cryptocurrencies.</p><p>  The chair of the Federal Reserve, Jerome H. Powell, said last week that the central bank had ''serious concerns'' about Libra and had been in contact with Facebook regarding its project.</p><p>  This week, the House and Senate will hold hearings to examine Libra, and lawmakers plan to grill David Marcus, the Facebook executive who is overseeing the project. Facebook was asked to cease work on the project until it addresses lawmakers' concerns.</p><p>Facebook's crypto foray has renewed attention on the thousands of cryptocurrencies that flourished after the original digital currency, Bitcoin, which was released in 2009 and envisioned as a new kind of money that would not be controlled by any government or central authority.</p><p>  Bitcoin was presented by its mysterious creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, as a largely political project, aimed at challenging central banks and governments.</p><p>  But from the early days, Bitcoin gained traction among people looking to make illegal transactions online. The Silk Road, an online market for illegal drugs, was started in 2011 and became a booming business, with every payment sent in Bitcoin.</p><p>  In recent years, there have been many legitimate businesses set up around cryptocurrencies. Most of these businesses are focused on using Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as investment products, similar to gold.</p><p>  Several large financial institutions, including Goldman Sachs and Fidelity, have begun to offer products related to Bitcoin to their customers.</p><p>  This mainstream validation has helped give Bitcoin a sheen of legitimacy and pushed up the price of the digital token. But it has also led to increased volatility in the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.</p><p>  The price of a single Bitcoin soared to nearly $20,000 in early 2018. Since then, it crashed to $3,000, but has risen swiftly again in recent months to around $12,000.</p><p>  Bitcoin has also become the standard currency for ransomware operations in which victims lose control of their computer to remote hackers. Victims are able to get back their files only if they send a Bitcoin payment. Many cities have lost control of their computer networks in these kinds of attacks.</p><p>  On Monday, Mr. Mnuchin cited the use of Bitcoin in terrorist financing, tax evasion and human trafficking, though so far, law enforcement officials have brought few cases in those areas.</p><p>  ''The Treasury Department has expressed very serious concerns that Libra could be misused by money launderers and terrorist financiers,'' he said, adding that ''we will not tolerate the use of the cryptocurrencies in support of illicit activities.''</p><p>Facebook does not intend to release the currency until next year, but the company has big ambitions for the project, which it hopes will become a new global currency and the foundation for an alternative global financial system.</p><p>  Those ambitions -- and Facebook's broader reputational problems -- have made the project such a lightning rod for controversy.</p><p>  ''We know we need to take the time to get this right,'' Mr. Marcus, the Facebook executive, said in testimony released ahead of the Senate Banking Committee hearing. ''And I want to be clear: Facebook will not offer the Libra digital currency until we have fully addressed regulatory concerns and received appropriate approvals.''</p><p>Facebook has designed Libra so that it will be run by a Swiss association governed by at least a hundred companies and other partners, rather than just Facebook itself.</p><p>  When Facebook announced Libra, it said it already had 27 partners, including big players like Uber, Mastercard, Visa and Spotify. But so far those partners have largely remained silent and Facebook has borne the brunt of the scrutiny facing Libra.</p><p>  It is clear that Facebook will be facing a raft of new regulations and public scrutiny as it proceeds.</p><p>  Mr. Mnuchin said that cryptocurrencies must comply with the Bank Secrecy Act and register with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. They must also meet the same anti-money laundering and counterfeiting standards as traditional financial firms.</p><p>  The Treasury secretary also expressed concerns about the speculative nature of Bitcoin and about Facebook's problems protecting the privacy of its users.</p><p>  ''Our overriding goal is to maintain the integrity of our financial system and protect it from abuse,'' Mr. Mnuchin said.</p><p>  The Trump administration's concerns about Libra appear to be bound up in the president's broader distrust of the social networking giant. Mr. Trump tweeted about Libra soon after a social media summit meeting in which he criticized Facebook and other big tech companies, accusing them of silencing conservative voices, including his.</p><p>  Mr. Mnuchin insisted the administration was not trying to retaliate against Facebook. ''No, we're not going to target any one entity,'' he said. ''Everybody is playing by the same rules.''</p><p>  Mr. Powell, the Fed chair, expressed similar concerns about Libra last week, telling lawmakers it could not go forward ''without their being broad satisfaction with the way the company has addressed money laundering, all those things.'' He also raised data privacy and consumer protection concerns, saying, ''All of those things will need to be addressed very thoroughly, and carefully, in a deliberate process that will not be a sprint to implementation.''</p><p>  Skepticism about Libra, and cryptocurrencies more broadly, represent a rare issue where the Trump administration and some Democrats are united. Last week, Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, called on the Fed to protect consumers from Facebook's ''Monopoly money.''</p><p>  ''The largest banks and the largest tech companies do not act in the interest of working Americans, but in the interest of themselves and their investors,'' Mr. Brown said. ''The Fed must take a proactive role to ensure that the payments system remains accountable to the public.''</p><p>  However, Republicans have tended to be more sympathetic to the cryptocurrency industry, and have positioned it as something that the government should be working to protect as a check against government and corporate power.</p><p>  Just this week, Representative Kevin McCarthy, the House minority leader, argued in a New York Times op-ed article that cryptocurrencies and the networks they create could provide an answer to the privacy scandals facing the internet giants.</p><p>  Mr. Trump's acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, has been a vocal advocate of Bitcoin in the past.</p><p>  This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.         </p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: Steven Mnuchin (PHOTOGRAPH BY ANNA MONEYMAKER/THE NEW YORK TIMES)       </p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYT-125350190716</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WK7-54J1-DXY4-X10G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6742</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1338\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The New York Times Company</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times</publicationName><edition>Late Edition - Final</edition><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/15/us/politics/mnuchin-facebook-libra-risk.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/15/us/politics/mnuchin-facebook-libra-risk.html</url><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 16, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001RKX</classCode><className>GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

I'm Nick Watt and you're watching CNN NEWSROOM. Ahead this hour, lots of tough talk but so far few details to back it up. U.S. lawmakers push the Trump Administration for specifics why exactly the hardline on Iran.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus, blast Donald Trump escalates tensions with China by targeting its biggest name in tech. Huawei is now effectively banned from doing business in the United States. And world leaders and tech executives team up to fight extremism online but the U.S. refuses to sign on.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Donald Trump might now be turning to Switzerland as a potential back- channel negotiator to ease growing tensions with Iran. Mr. Trump will meet in the coming days with the Swiss president who might help Mr. Trump who says he wants to talk to Tehran. The U.S. State Department meanwhile, citing an imminent threat from Iran and it's proxies ordering all non-emergency workers to leave Iraq from the embassy in Baghdad and the consulate in Erbil.</p><p>Many in Congress are demanding answers, details about those alleged threats from Iran that spurred the U.S. military buildup in the region. The Trump administration is scheduled to brief top lawmakers in the day ahead and more now on the Pentagon's planning from CNN's Barbara Starr.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARBARA STARR, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: Updated military options for possible war against Iran include detailed destruction of the regime's massive missile inventory and air defenses before moving to attack nuclear sites. It would take months of buildup and more than 100,000 U.S. troops fighting from the air, land, and sea according to U.S. officials.</p><p>That option has been briefed to senior officials including John Bolton, the National Security Adviser, a longtime Iran hawk. But would President Trump who wants to reduce overseas troop levels take the U.S. to war against Iran? DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We have not planned for that. Hopefully, we're not going to have to plan for that.</p><p>STARR: The immediate focus gets Iran to back off from what the Pentagon believes is a plan to possibly attack U.S. forces in the region. But so far, the U.S. offering little to no public evidence.</p><p>COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: What makes me skeptical is the fact that a lot of the intelligence that has been revealed so far seems to be very normal. The red line would have to be either an actual attack or no kidding, actual information that they are about to commit an attack.</p><p>STARR: All this as a top British General, the Deputy Commander in Iraq publicly expressed his skepticism.</p><p>MAJ. GEN. CHRISTOPHER GHIKA, BRITISH ARMY: Am I concerned about the danger, no not really.</p><p>STARR: In an extraordinary statement the U.S. pushed back saying the general's views run counter to the identified credible threats. Iran supreme leader insists his country does not want war.</p><p>AL KHAMENEI, SUPREME LEADER, IRAN: There won't be any war with the help of God. We don't seek war.</p><p>STARR: U.S. officials are adamant that the threat is very real. Some U.S. diplomats have now been ordered out of Iraq but still no word on what might have caused damage, five to ten-foot holes in the holes of four tankers in the Gulf. Barbara Starr, CNN the Pentagon.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WATT: And as for that blast British general we heard from in Barbara Starr's report, the British government seems to be backtracking on his dismissal of increased threats from Iran. U.S. officials say the British government knows he was wrong and they acknowledge the heightened threat level.</p><p>Samantha Vinograd is a CNN National Security Analyst. She joins me now from New York. Now, Sam, the State Department announced Wednesday they're going to pull all non-essential diplomatic staff out of Baghdad and Senator Bob Menendez had something to say about that. Let's just take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. BOB MENENDEZ (D-NJ): There are only two reasons for ordering their departure. We have credible intelligence that our people are at risk or in preparation for military action in Iran.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATT: So which do you think it is? Is the really credible intelligence of threats or is the U.S. preparing for war or both? SAMANTHA VINOGRAD, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Well, I actually don't think the options are mutually exclusive. It is entirely possible that there is increased threat reporting against our personnel in Iraq and that the United States is seriously considering military action in Iran or enhanced military action against Iranian proxies in Iraq and in the region.</p><p>[01:05:13] But there's a pretty simple way to answer this question with respect to Congress. The intelligence chiefs and military planners can go and brief the United States Congress. They actually have a legal responsibility to do so with respect to what this increased threat reporting is against our assets in Iraq.</p><p>I serve for a year in Iraq. I saw the Iranian threat front and center. I ducked and covered from Iranian rockets and lost colleagues. This threat is very real and has increased and decreased at various points throughout our history in the Iraq theater.</p><p>So what needs to happen right now is their Intel chiefs and our military planners need to go to the Hill and explain what's happening. And there are plans reportedly to send the Secretary of State but he's non-intelligence chief any longer and he's not a Defense Department professional either.</p><p>WATT: That was going to be my next question. I mean, we have heard that there is going to be some kind of briefing Thursday in Washington for Intel Committee people and Chiefs, but my question was going to be do you think we're going to get any more clarity out of that?</p><p>VINOGRAD: I think it really depends who goes. Secretary of State Pompeo should be representing the diplomatic track in the interests of Department of State personnel that were either deployed in Iraq, are leaving Iraq, and/or staying there because they're considered essential staff.</p><p>But we have a Director of National Intelligence, we have a Defense Intelligence Agency in the United States which really looks at intelligence related to our military assets deployed overseas. These intelligence professionals should go and brief members of Congress on the threat.</p><p>And perhaps if Secretary of State Pompeo wants to be there I think that makes sense. But him going by himself, to me as a former member of the national security team, does not check the box with respect to keeping Congress fully and currently informed on threat assessments.</p><p>WATT: And in terms of what's actually going on within the administration, I mean President Trump said on Wednesday there are no divisions within the administration on our policy towards the Middle East. But president Trump is essentially a neo-isolationist and John Bolton is in his ear, and John Bolton is perhaps the most hawkish man in America. How can there not be a division between those two essentially ideologies?</p><p>VINOGRAD: Well, to state the obvious, when President Trump says something, you kind of have to assume the opposite is true. So if he said there aren't divisions, it's probably likely that there are. But you know, it is not unusual for there to be divisions within the national security team when it comes to something as dramatic as potential military action in a theater.</p><p>I was at the National Security Council when the Syria war started and I can tell you there are a lot of divisions with respect to what we should do and whether we should use military force on the ground in Syria. I wish that we had. It is entirely possible that the Secretary of State is the chief diplomat of the United States does not want to use military force and that he is open to some kind of diplomatic track with Iran.</p><p>But John Bolton's job as National Security Adviser is to present all those different views to the president and recommendations from each cabinet member on what to do to counter this alleged increased threat and then for the president to make a decision. John Bolton as national security adviser should not be censoring options from the president. Various National Security Advisors have weighed in with their own recommendation when asked. I've seen National Security Advisors doing it both ways.</p><p>So the real question is, is Bolton in some way censoring the content that reaches the president. Is he whispering in his ear and saying that a military option with Iran is the only way to go, or someone like Secretary of State Pompeo who really has been in the lead on this issue, the one who's speaking with the president in saying that maybe it is time to open up some kind of diplomatic contact with the Iranians to try to de-escalate the situation.</p><p>WATT: I mean, Trump did tweet on Wednesday. He said, I'm sure that Iran will want to talk soon. But earlier in the week we heard from Ayatollah Khamenei who said we will not talk about the nuclear deal. Such negotiations are poison. Is he going to cave? Will they talk?</p><p>VINOGRAD: Having worked on the back-channel negotiations with Iran through the Omanis when they first started, both sides are going to say a lot of things publicly while there is potential -- the possibility or even the possibility that back-channel negotiations are happening right now.</p><p>The Iranian regime has egg on its face based upon the fact that they gave something up. They gave up their nuclear program as part of the Iran deal, sanctions were lifted, and then the United States violated that. They have their own domestic politics and hardliners to deal with when it comes to resuming any potential negotiations with the United States.</p><p>On the other hand, President Trump assumes that everybody wants to talk to him. At this point, it is unclear to me that the Iranians view the United States as a credible interlocutor. So in addition to the domestic pressure, there's really no -- there's really no likelihood that they trust that even if they sit down with President Trump that he's going to keep his word because he breaks it so often.</p><p>So he's hoping perhaps that they talk because things are rising so quickly and escalating so quickly, but I don't know that diplomacy is on the table from the Iranian perspective at this point.</p><p>WATT: Sam Vinograd, thank you very much for your insights.</p><p>VINOGRAD: Thank you.</p><p>WATT: Meanwhile, amid the escalating trade war with China, President Trump is now taking aim at China's leading networking company, Huawei. He signed an executive order barring U.S. companies from buying telecom gear from companies that pose a national security threat. He didn't actually name Huawei.</p><p>But for more on this, Sherisse Pham joins us now from Hong Kong. Sherisse, this is just another salvo in the trade war?</p><p>SHERISSE PHAM, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: This is another salvo in the trade war and it is a development that is not going to go down well in Beijing. Huawei is a national tech champion. It is the world's largest telecommunications company, and the number two or number three smartphone maker depending on which quarter you look at.</p><p>This is a company, one of the very few Chinese tech companies, Chinese companies of altogether of tech or otherwise, that is a truly global, international company. And this executive order coming down really kind of puts a dent in their -- in their brand -- important the context though, that Huawei has effectively been banned in the United States since 2012, ever since a U.S. congressional report said that Huawei equipment could pose a national security risk, allegations that hallway has repeatedly denied.</p><p>And Huawei responded to the executive order today saying that this is not in the interest of U.S. consumers or U.S. businesses and will only harm and delay the deployment of 5G in the United States. Because let's not forget that trade war is rooted in technology. The Trump administration doesn't China leading the technologies of the future and Trump himself has identified one of those technologies as 5G. Huawei is a leader when it comes to 5G.</p><p>But the fear of course in the United States is that the Chinese Communist Party could compel Huawei to use its equipment to spy on other nations. Now our own CNN's Matt Rivers asked founder Ren Zhengfei about this in an interview back in March. Have a listen to what he had to say.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REN ZHENGFEI, FOUNDER, HUAWEI (through translator): I'd rather shut down the company. In our 30-year history, we have never received such requests. If there are future requests, I'm making it clear today, I'll firmly reject them.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PHAM: So he said that he would never accept a request from Beijing to spy on other nations. Of course, the criticism is that they -- you know, Washington says that if Beijing asked Huawei for access to its equipment, the company couldn't say no. So we're looking ahead to Beijing this afternoon to see what their response is going to be to this latest development. We got a little bit of hint of it yesterday when official was asked about it and he called the U.S. actions distrustful and abusive and really kind of indicated that retaliation could be coming, Nick.</p><p>WATT: I mean, Huawei has offered the U.S. and other Western countries, they've offered to sign what they call I think like a no- spy agreement. I mean would that be worth the paper is written on?</p><p>PHAM: It's really hard to prove a negative though, right. So if you could sign this agreement saying we are not going to spy on other countries, but again, there is a law in place in China that if Beijing needs to access technology, or equipment, or products from Chinese companies in the interest of national security, it is within their rights to do that, and those companies would have to obey or they'd be going against the law.</p><p>Huawei has said that it would be suicide for them to follow orders from Beijing to spy on other nations. But of course the counter- argument for that is it would be suicide for Huawei to disobey an order from Beijing.</p><p>WATT: Sherisse, thank you very much for your time. Meanwhile, tech companies and governments team up to fight the spread of extremism online. But one major world power opted out of the initiative.</p><p>And Alabama's governor has signed into law the most restrictive anti- abortion law in the U.S. Later this hour, our people on both sides of this most controversial issue are reacting.</p><p>[01:15:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WATT: Thousands of Brazilians marched on Wednesday against cuts to education. The government has said it's freezing nearly a quarter of discretionary spending on universities and this is the first national protest since President Jair Bolsonaro took office in January.</p><p>He calls it a partisan ploy, calling the protestors, useful idiots. Mr. Bolsonaro has been losing support as Brazil's struggles with a weak economy and rising unemployment.</p><p>In Sudan, talks aimed at moving the country towards civilian rule have been suspended for 72 hours. The head of Sudan's Transitional Military Council says talks with opposition leaders are on hold until there is, \"an appropriate climate for completing an agreement.\"</p><p>The country has been scarred by turmoil since the military ousted long-time President Omar al-Bashir last month. On Wednesday, at least 14 people were injured in Khartoum after Sudanese soldiers stormed barricades and opened fire at the site of a sitting demonstration, this, according to the Sudan Doctors Committee.</p><p>And more than two dozen world and business leaders have pledged to do more to rid the internet of violent extremist content. America's biggest tech firms such as Facebook, Google and Twitter joined the initiative, but the U.S. government stayed away. Nina dos Santos reports from Paris.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NINA DOS SANTOS, CNN EUROPE EDITOR: Big tech and big government putting on a united front against extremism online. In a summit dubbed the Christchurch call, French President Emmanuel Macron and New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, welcomed heads of state and Silicon Valley to Paris, and pledged the commitment from 26 parties to try and curb the viral spread of violent content.</p><p>JACINDA ARDERN, PRIME MINISTER OF NEW ZEALAND: The Christchurch call to action, an action plan for change, is a global response to a tragedy that occurred on the shores of my country, but was ultimately felt around the world. It ultimately commits us all to build a more humane internet.</p><p>DOS SANTOS: Part of the effort will come from countries reinforcing existing laws, with Canada, the U.K., Ireland and others, signing up to the pledge.</p><p>EMMANUEL MACRON, PRESIDENT OF FRANCE (through translator): For the first time, countries from all over the world were present, and secondly, it is an appeal which brings together not just governments and social and tech companies, but also the civil society. And we expect tangible results.</p><p>[01:20:01] DOS SANTOS: The White House declined to join the call. But U.S. tech titans did throw their weight behind it, from Facebook to Google, and Amazon to YouTube, committing to identifying offensive material sooner and making sure isn't amplified by algorithms.</p><p>The summit was organized in the wake of the mass shooting of 51 people in Christchurch, which was live-streamed and shared millions of times thereafter.</p><p>Facebook, whose checks and balances struggled to cope with the spread of the video, issued a separate statement, announcing a new one strike policy for those who misuse the live streaming tool. The Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, who met Macron alone, last week, was absent.</p><p>NICK CLEGG, VICE PRESIDENT FOR GLOBAL AFFAIRS AND COMMUNICATIONS, FACEBOOK: So, I think we all recognize in this -- in this meeting that this is not something that any company can do on its own. It's not something the industry, as a whole, can do on its own.</p><p>DOS SANTOS: This was a high-profile gathering, but many will question what was actually achieved. The recommendations have broadened nonbinding, and some have been heard before.</p><p>It will take more than a day (INAUDIBLE) to clean up the dark corners of the internet, starting to work together is, at least, a first step towards fixing its flaws.</p><p>Nina dos Santos, CNN, Paris.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) WATT: Joining me now from San Francisco, California, is TechCrunch Editor-at-large, Josh Constine, Josh, we've just heard Nina there, used the words broad and nonbinding, is there any meat here, any teeth? Is this actually going to make any difference?</p><p>JOSH CONSTINE, EDITOR-AT-LARGE, TECHCRUNCH (via Skype): Unfortunately, this is not a real regulation, this is just a request for governments in companies around the world to stand up and pledge that they will do more.</p><p>And that's why it's so disappointing that the U.S. refused to sign on, because it wasn't meaning they would have to commit to anything, it was just a show of support, and still, Donald Trump decided against it.</p><p>WATT: I mean, I'm going to read you now. There was a tweet that came out from the White House today, if I can read my bad handwriting. It reads, the Trump administration is fighting for free speech online. No matter your views, if you suspect political bias has caused you to be censored of silenced online, we want to hear about it.</p><p>I mean, is that -- if you are a Jihadi who has been thrown off Facebook, you know, called the White House switchboard, I don't know what to make of that, do you?</p><p>CONSTINE: This is really just another play by Donald Trump to rile up his base and cast doubt on the real truth that is actually sometimes purveyed by social media. He wants to make his followers believe that he can save them from the consequences of misuse and abuse on these platforms.</p><p>And if somebody harasses somebody else, they shouldn't say oh, it's political bias, they got my content taken down. It was them, being a terrible human being.</p><p>WATT: I mean, is there -- let's just go back to what these people who met in Paris are trying to achieve. I mean, is there anything that can realistically be done? I mean, listen, we're talking about multiple jurisdictions, obviously, across the world, the internet, very difficult to police. Is there anything that we can really, meaningfully, do to cut down on this kind of content?</p><p>CONSTINE: The problem is with human nature, not with these algorithms. What we need to do is predict the way that they will be misused and safeguard against them without presuming the guilt of people who are using these platforms. Otherwise, we will stray into censorship.</p><p>But the way that these platforms are being used by terrorists, don't amount to free speech, they amount to abuse of the public. And that's why these things should not be conflated. We need to understand that the terrorists can be prevented from misusing these platforms without hindering the average person's ability to speak freely.</p><p>And these are private companies, and they are not, in any way, forced to abide by free speech laws. They are doing what they think is best for their service, in a lot of cases, that means not allowing hate.</p><p>WATT: And, I think it was Facebook that was saying, that if you abuse some of their core laws, you'll be banned for 30 days. I mean, is that really much of a deterrent?</p><p>CONSTINE: Well, they are not saying it specifically 30 days, or what the exact threshold that gets someone with this ban is, because they don't want people to just come up, just up to the line, and tow that line of problematic content.</p><p>But, I do think that this will ensure that somebody who was been obviously misusing social media, can't take advantage of the most powerful medium for live broadcasting, in order to share their messages of hate. That's not going to stop somebody from starting a new account and misusing live broadcasting, but it's a good start.</p><p>WATT: A good start. Tell me, there's going to be a good ending somewhere? I mean, are you hopeful, optimistic?</p><p>[01:25:03] CONSTINE: Unfortunately, I'm rarely that optimistic about when you combine the anonymity of the internet with the tendency of human nature to seek that attention. We are creatures of vanity, even the worst of us, and so when we give someone the platform to share, if they have hate in their heart, that is what they're going to share.</p><p>And so, instead, I think these social networks need to be thinking about not what is best for their bottomless growth, but what is best for the safety of their platform, as a whole, without impeding unfair speech.</p><p>WATT: And, perhaps, what's best for the world, Josh, thank you very much for your time.</p><p>CONSTINE: My pleasure.</p><p>WATT: Still to come on CNN NEWSROOM, a new abortion battle. Alabama's governor just signed America's toughest abortion measure into law, many are outraged.</p><p>WATT: You are watching CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Nick Watt, with the headlines this hour. President Donald Trump is perhaps now looking to Switzerland to help ease tensions with Iran. Mr. Trump will meet with the Swiss president in the coming days, a possible back channel negotiator. The U.S. has announced the military build-up in the Middle East to counter what it calls, imminent threats, from Iran.</p><p>And President Trump signed an Executive Order that basically bars U.S. telecommunications companies from buying equipment made by China's, Huawei. Washington believes Huawei's equipment could be used by the Chinese to spy. The move comes during the escalating U.S.-China trade war.</p><p>And Alabama Governor, Kay Ivey, has signed into law, a bill that bans abortions in almost all cases in her state, even for victims of rape and incest. Critics are calling this an appalling attack on women's rights. CNN's Dianne Gallagher has the reaction from both sides of this controversial issue.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEN. LINDA COLEMAN-MADISON (D-AL): You don't control this, you don't own this!</p><p>DIANNE GALLAGHER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Democratic lawmakers outraged.</p><p>SEN. VIVIAN FIGURES (D-AL): You know there is no law in this country, on the books, that says what a man can or cannot do with his body.</p><p>GALLAGHER: An abortion rights advocates calling for a nationwide response today, the nation's most restrictive abortion law, all hose in favor, Republican men.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Life is precious. Life is a gift of our creator.</p><p>COLEMAN-MADISON: Now you are in my womb. I want you out.</p><p>[01:30:00]</p><p>GALLAGHER: The law effectively bans abortion, by making it a felony punishable by up to 99 years or life in prison for performing the procedure.</p><p>The law does include very limited exceptions such as serious health risks to the mother. Democrats attempted to add an amendment to exempt victims of rape and incest but that failed.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So you get raped and have to have that child based on an Alabama law? Just because we want to legislate morality.</p><p>GALLAGHER: This fight now potentially setting up a Supreme Court showdown. The ACLU and Planned Parenthood have already said they plan to challenge this in court which supporters of the law admit mid is kind of the point.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We will never get a Heartbeat Bill to be constitutional until Roe versus Wade is decided in reverse. And so, I think everybody understood that.</p><p>GALLAGHER: Alabama is one of 16 states to introduce or pass restrictive abortion legislations, sometimes called Heartbeat Bills this year.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We are now back on the bill</p><p>GALLAGHER: According to the Pew Research Center, 58 percent of Americans say abortion should be legal in all or most cases. For Republicans, those numbers are flipped with 59 percent saying abortion should be illegal in all or most cases.</p><p>SENATOR KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND (NY), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This is a plan by the Republican Party, make no mistake, to overturn Roe v Wade. GALLAGHER: 2020 Democratic candidates quick to condemn the Alabama law on Twitter and the campaign trail calling it dangerous and unconstitutional.</p><p>Now Alabama Governor Kay Ivey released a statement when she announced that she had signed this into the law, and in it she acknowledges that there is already a law very similar to this on the books in Alabama and that it is unenforceable because of Roe v. Wade.</p><p>She says that we have to respect the authority of the Supreme Court, but she says -- and this is the key line here -- that the sponsors of this bill believe that it is time, once again, for the U.S. Supreme Court to revisit this important matter and they believe this act may bring about the best opportunity for this to occur.</p><p>Again, Planned Parenthood and the ACLU have already said they planned to challenge this in court. Even though she signed it into law today This cannot take effect until six months from this moment and it will likely be in court long before that day.</p><p>Diane Gallagher, CNN -- Montgomery, Alabama.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NICK WATT, CNN ANCHOR: CNN legal analyst Areva Martin joins us now from Los Angeles. Areva -- let's jus get this straight. So if this bill becomes law let's take a horrific hypothetical -- if a 13-year- old girl in Alabama was raised by her uncle under this law should have to carry that baby to term and give birth -- right?</p><p>AREVA MARTIN, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: Absolutely Nick.</p><p>This law is so restrictive that it doesn't even provide for young girls or any age women that might be raped. It doesn't provide exceptions for incest. The only exception is if there is some, you know, possible harm to the mother with respect to carrying the child.</p><p>And I think what's so appalling to so many is that the governor made it clear this wasn't about ending abortion or implementing this law in the state of Alabama. This was about taking this fight to the United States Supreme Court. That is the strategy of these Alabama male lawmakers, just as it is the strategy of lawmakers in many states, in many southern states and also in many Midwestern states. There is an all out attack on women's reproductive rights, but also, a very deliberately legal strategy to pass these laws in order for them to be challenged to get to the Supreme Court to have the Supreme Court overturn Roe v Wade.</p><p>WATT: Yes. I mean Areva, the governor of Alabama is blatant, I mean I will read a bit of her statement. She says many Americans, myself included, disagree when Roe versus Wade was handed down in 1973. The sponsors of this bill believe that it is time once again for the U.S. Supreme Court to revisit this important matter and they believe this act may bring about the best opportunity for this to occur.</p><p>Now, of course, Areva, the Supreme Court -- President Trump has nominated two justices. It's now five -- four, conservative. What is going to happen? What would happen when this lands on their desk?</p><p>MARTIN: Well, that's a good questions, Nick. You know, the issue is going to probably come down to Chief Justice Roberts. He is going to be the deciding vote. And what we know about Chief Justice Roberts is that he believes in precedents. He has made it very clear that he is not going to do something that, I think, is going to be a jolt to the American legal system.</p><p>So, I'm not so confident that the strategy, this very deliberate strategy that the southern lawmakers and some of the Midwest have is going to work out in the way that they have planned.</p><p>[01:35:01] But we do know that Donald Trump, when he ran for president, he made it very clear that a big part of his platform was overturning Roe v Wade, appointing conservative judges to the federal court so that they could be in position to take on this fight. And we have seen these Democratic hopefuls, you know, running for president, everyone from Senator Kamala Harris, Senator Elizabeth Warren -- make it very clear that this is not something that women and Democrats and progressives around this country are going to take sitting down. There is going to be massive protests.</p><p>We are already seeing that happening as we speak, and we should expect to see even more. Women and men and progressive coming forth and fighting for the rights of women to make decisions and to control their own reproductive health.</p><p>WATT: Areva, you have a strange colleague who agrees with you, that this might not work in the Supreme Court. That's televangelist Pat Robertson. Let's take a listen to what he had to say about this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PAT ROBERTSON, TELEVANGELIST: I think Alabama has gone too far. They have passed a law that would give a 99 year prison sentence to people who commit abortion. There is no exceptions for rape or incest. It's an extreme law, and they want to challenge Roe versus Wade, but my humble opinion is that this is not the case we want to bring to the Supreme Court because I think this one will lose.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATT: So, he just thinks this is the wrong bill to bring to the Supreme Court.</p><p>MARTIN: Yes, Nick, you are right. I'm not often in agreement with Pat Robertson but I do agree with him that this is complete overreach to say that a physician, you know, individuals who have dedicated their lives to saving lives, that they will face not misdemeanor charges but felony charges that could land them in prison for life for administering, as we saw that doctor speaking to Anderson Cooper say something that is very safe. A very safe, surgical procedure.</p><p>It's a complete overreach and I tend to agree with Pat Robertson that this is the wrong case. This is not the case where these Republican lawmakers want to, I think, stake their whole, you know, strategy and plan to deny women the right over their reproductive, you know, health. I think the case is not going to, you know, have the intended outcome.</p><p>WATT: And is this, I mean we have alluded to this a little bit earlier, but is this going to be one of the defining issues of the 2020 presidential campaign?</p><p>MARTIN: You know, it's interesting, Nick. I was reading some reports that says the American people, the whole issue of abortion -- it's been decided. There is not a majority of Americans that believe that Roe v Wade should be overturned.</p><p>So, Americans are concerned about health care. They are concerned about tax breaks for the middle-class. They're concerned about pay raise for teachers.</p><p>The abortion issue has already been litigated, so I'm not so certain to get it. The Republicans, the strategy of trying to overturn Roe -- I don't think the American people go to bed at night thinking about Roe v Wade, because Roe v Wade has been settled law for now, you know 40 years. I think it's a mistake on their part, and I don't think it's going to be successful in terms of Trump's you know, reelection campaign or senators or other elected officials who, you know, are trying to make this a seminal issue or a primary issue for the 2020 campaign.</p><p>WATT: Areva -- thanks, as always.</p><p>MARTIN: Thanks -- Nick.</p><p>WATT: Congressional Democrats are fuming over White House refusal to turn over requested documents. The House Judiciary Committee following up in the Mueller report is investigating possible obstruction of justice and abuse of power by the administration.</p><p>On Wednesday, a White House attorney formerly rejected the committee's requests for documents from dozens of individuals.</p><p>CNN's Jim Acosta has the latest from the White House.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JIM ACOSTA, CNN CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: As the President praised the nation's law enforcement community at the Capitol his White House counsel all but told House Democrats to get lost in their investigation into whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice in the Russia probe.</p><p>In a letter to House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerry Nadler, White House counsel Pat Cipollone said Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation should be enough. Adding, congressional investigations are intended to obtain information to aid in evaluating potential legislation. Not to harass political opponents or to pursue an unauthorized do over of exhaustive law enforcement investigation conducted by the Department of Justice.</p><p>Nadler fired back to CNN.</p><p>REP. JERRY NADLER (D), NEW YORK: This is the White House claiming that the President is king. This is the White House saying that the Justice Department says they can't hold the President accountable can he can indict a president and now they're saying neither can congress. The President is totally unaccountable and above the law.</p><p>[08:39:54] ACOSTA: Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin also sounded defiant when asked whether the IRS will ever hand over the President's long-secret tax returns to lawmakers.</p><p>STEVE MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY: The Democrats are trying to weaponize the IRS and it's a very, very dangerous issue which is why we are taking this issue very seriously.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you -- sir.</p><p>ACOSTA: Aides to the President say he is eager to cut deals with Congress as Mr. Trump is expected to reveal his new immigration plan on Thursday.</p><p>The President is set to call for a new merit system for legal immigrants coming into the U.S. that rewards the wealthier and well- educated while building a wall on the border and creating a new process to expedite claims for asylum seekers.</p><p>But the plan at the moment does not address the fate of the millions of undocumented people in the U.S. including the young so-called dreamers in the DACA program as well as the thousands of family separations carried out by the administration.</p><p>The proposals is a renewed push for a merit based system that the White House immigration hardliner Stephen Miller promoted nearly two years ago.</p><p>Aren't you trying to change what it means to be an immigrant coming into this country? If you're telling them, you have to speak English. Can't people learn how to speak English when they get here?</p><p>STEPHEN MILLER, SENIOR WHITE HOUSE ADVISOR: Well, first of all, right now, it's a requirement that to be naturalized you had speak English. So the notion that speaking English wouldn't be a part of the immigration system would be actually very ahistorical.</p><p>Ten years, 20 years, 30 years from now we want to have an immigration system that takes care of the people who are coming here and people who are already living here by having standards.</p><p>ACOSTA: GOP officials told CNN that Republican senators briefed on the proposal by the President's son-in-law Jared Kushner wee quote, \"underwhelmed\" by the prime. But the White House is anxious to hit the reset button on the issue even as the President is previewing his plan with heated rhetoric.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: To end deadly sanctuary cities; to stop the visa lottery program where they take lottery systems and a country will put you into a lottery. And then deposit you into the United States. I don't think most countries are giving us their finest.</p><p>ACOSTA: The President is expected to roll out his immigration plan at the White House on Thursday. Senior administration officials acknowledged this proposal may not really go anywhere as it will certainly run into a wall of opposition among Democrats in congress.</p><p>As one official said, the White House is hoping to unite Republicans on immigration even as some GOP lawmakers are questioning the President's approach to the issue.</p><p>Jim Acosta, CNN -- the White House.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WATT: And next on CNN NEWSROOM a man who once aspired to join al Qaeda now discouraging others from making that mistake.</p><p>[01:42:36](COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WATT: A British broadcaster has canceled a daytime talk show after a guest died a week after appearing on the program. The \"Jeremy Kyle Show\" was known for its tabloid style and rowdy confrontation between feuding couples and friends. British lawmakers now plan to open an investigation into reality television in the wake of the guests death and the deaths of two contestants on another show to see whether shows like this need more regulation of their formats.</p><p>All this week CNN has been bringing you stories of people striving to make the world a better place. In today's installment of \"Champions for Change\", a former Islamic militant now using his experience to discourage other young men from becoming terrorists.</p><p>CNN's Jim Sciutto has our report.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ASSAD (ph): With my father's death, I took that very, very badly.</p><p>JIM SCIUTTO, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL SECURITY APPLICANTS : Assad (ph) is a kid who was one step away from hopping on a flight to Syria to fight.</p><p>ASSAD: The only goal at that time, without my dad, was to get to him quicker.</p><p>SCIUTTO: To die?</p><p>ASSAD: Yes.</p><p>SCIUTTO: He wanted to be a martyr. He wanted to be a suicide bomber.</p><p>ASSAD: I possibly would have just ended my life and killed a lot of innocent -- innocent people. For what? And, you know, I would have been -- my book would have been closed, basically. HANIF QADIR, CHIEF EXECUTIVE, ACTIVE CHANGE FOUNDATION: He was just in this vicious whirlpool of grievance.</p><p>SCIUTTO: I first met Hanif more than ten years ago in London.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Former militant Hanif Qadir told us, rich or poor, educated or not, extremism doesn't discriminate.</p><p>QADIR: Everybody's vulnerable one of them.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Hanif is a \"Champion for Change\" because he's trying to fight terrorism before it happens, long before it happens, before young kids, young Muslims, make the choice to become a terrorist.</p><p>Hanif.</p><p>QADIR: Hey, Jim.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Long time.</p><p>QADIR: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>SCIUTTO: How you been?</p><p>QADIR: A very long time.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Good to see you.</p><p>QADIR: And you -- and you, my friend, and you.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Do you have a sense of how many young people you helped during that time?</p><p>QADIR: We made a huge amount of difference over the years. And we -- we grew from a very small organization to delivering into 11, 12 different parts of the country and abroad in Pakistan. We've helped people understand that they've got a stake in society and in life, to do things differently.</p><p>ASSAD: I won't be able to describe how much -- how grateful I am towards him.</p><p>QADIR: It took us a bit of time, but it was just about having the conversation with this guy about what would your father have wanted you to do? Did your father really want you to go on this journey, or did your father want you to take care of the affairs of the family, help your mom, help your brother and sisters and be a decent, law abiding citizen and a God fearing individual.</p><p>ASSAD: I mean now I'm working every day, six days a week, providing for my family, which I would -- I wouldn't -- I wouldn't do none of these things before.</p><p>SCIUTTO: When he talked to you about going to Syria, you listened. You trusted him.</p><p>ASSAD: Yes.</p><p>SCIUTTO: This is personal for you because --</p><p>QADIR: Of course it is.</p><p>SCIUTTO: You had your own experience.</p><p>QADIR: Yes.</p><p>SCIUTTO: When he was a young man, he left the U.K. to go to Pakistan to join al Qaeda. It sounds incredible to say that. But when he got there, he saw the violence that they were planning, that they were carrying out. He saw it up close. He saw it personal. And he decided, that's not Islam in his view. He didn't want any part of it.</p><p>QADIR: It was an experience of taking things personally about the way that the war on terror was -- was conducted in Afghanistan, especially where innocent women and children were being killed. And I dwelled on that.</p><p>For some reason, those kids reminded my own children and I wanted to be the one to help them. But I also wanted to prevent that. So I traveled abroad to join al Qaeda. But then seeing the same thing happen to those children by members of al Qaeda, using them as suicide bombers, also was something that I was not going to tolerate, was not going to take.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Does that give you credibility as you're counselling young men that they know that you've been there?</p><p>QADIR: Absolutely. I talk to them and I'm taking them through a journey they're going on without them even opening their mouths. And that's, for them, it's like, how the hell does he know this?</p><p>And it's still relevant today when I talk to people who are thinking of going to Syria or thinking of going to Palestine and fighting the Israelis or thinking they're going to Iraq or to Pakistan. I say, look, this is what you're feeling, this is what you're going through. And I know -- and I know this.</p><p>[09:50:15] SCIUTTO: The loudest voices are the extremist voices.</p><p>QADIR: Absolutely. Absolutely.</p><p>SCIUTTO: When I met him ten years ago, his center was just buzzing with activity. He had hundreds of kids coming there over the weekend.</p><p>It's a shame to see it empty now. The last time I was here, it was buzzing.</p><p>QADIR: Yes, yes, yes.</p><p>SCIUTTO: You know?</p><p>QADIR: It's depressing when you come in. SCIUTTO: Now, today, he's lost the funding, the support that he used to get from the British government. It became a political issue in the U.K.</p><p>[01:50:03] And he warns, he's worried that a lot of the kids that he would have stopped going down this path, that they don't have the support network anymore.</p><p>QADIR: The challenge will not get any easier, especially with the perception that ISIS is gone and al Qaeda is gone. This is -- this is just as fake as --</p><p>SCIUTTO: It's not gone.</p><p>QADIR: They're not gone. They're reemerging.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Tell me about \"I Want Out.\"</p><p>QADIR: This is the campaign that I'm pinning all my hopes on, to tell you the truth. Working with a lot of young people, extremist networks and, you know, thinking about getting involved in terrorism or gang violence.</p><p>And when you really speak to them and it's like -- you know, and you get to know them, then you say, I want out.</p><p>Just give me a chance. Just, I want out. You know, understand me. People can change and we need to give them the opportunity to change.</p><p>SCIUTTO: He is not deterred. He's going to stick with it. He's told me repeatedly, \"I'm going to keep fighting\".</p><p>QADIR: The day you start to look at these young people as if they were your own, that's when you will always step forward. I'm not going to let this go without the biggest fight of my life.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WATT: And we'll keep sharing these inspiring stories all week and tune in on Sunday morning at 8:00 a.m. in Hong Kong for an hour \"CHAMPION FOR CHANGE\" special. We will be back in a moment.</p><p>WATT: The city of light shining just little bit brighter. Paris celebrating the 130th birthday of the Eiffel Tower. The spectacular laser light show playing out across the structure facade every evening this week.</p><p>The tower for the 1889 was the tallest building in the world when it was built in the 1889 World Fair. Now about seven million tours visit the Paris landmark every year.</p><p>And the art world is celebrating two record hammer drops. First the most money paid for a work by a living artist. The very much alive Jeff Koons is 64, created his stainless sculpture \"Rabbit\" in 1986. The whimsical piece just sold at Christie's for more than 91 million dollars.</p><p>And a nearly 130-year old work by the French Master Claude Monet just commanded the highest price ever for an impressionist's artwork. $110 million dollars after just eight minutes of bidding at Sotheby's in New York.</p><p>Beware, there's some the wordplay ahead. Here it goes. Plant-based burgers have found a recipe for success. And investors want a bite of the action.</p><p>CNN's Clare Sebastian gets a taste of this meatless revolution.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The unmistakable sizzle of meat on the grill. The real meat and the Beyond Meat.</p><p>NICK BUCCIERO, BAREBURGER: We have our Beyond Burger over here. And we have are beef burger over here. Once you dress them up it's impossible to tell the difference.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: At this Bare Burger) restaurant in Manhattan, burgers made some plant protein make up a meaty portion of the sales.</p><p>[01:55:01] UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The response has been great. It's been so great in fact that or our menu is now 50 percent vegan.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: For first timers it takes a little getting it used to.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Little smoky.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's crispy.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And very good for you. But it doesn't taste like a real burger at all.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Investors though had no trouble taking their first bite. Beyond Meat's beefy IPO scored 160 percent on its first day of trading on May 2nd. The best IPO jump of a major U.S. company since the financial crisis.</p><p>Analysts believe it's part of a veggie revolution that is just getting started.</p><p>ALEXA HOWARD, EQUITE ANALYST, BERNSTEIN &amp; CO: If it follows the same path that the plant-based beverage market followed, you'd see it growing from roughly $13 billion, $14 billion today up to potentially over $ 40 billion over the next decade.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: While Beyond Meat is not yet profitable it's revenues are up more than 130 percent in each of the past three years. And it's expanding into new products categories like meatless sausage.</p><p>ETHAN BROWN, CEO, BEYOND MEAT: It's not just vegans and vegetarians that are interested in this. In fact 93 percent of the people that are putting the Beyond Burger in their cart at the nation's largest grocer are also putting in (INAUDIBLE) in their cart. It's a tremendous sign that we are able to grow the business.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Thank you very much. Now the Beyond Burger does have some competition mainly from this one which is the Impossible Burger from Impossible Foods.</p><p>That's already on the menu at Burger King which is rolling out the Impossible Whopper. MacDonald is also selling a meatless burger in Germany made by Nestle and Tyson Food is one of the world's biggest meat producers is also set to launch the fake meat.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: They both smell like meat. After my first bite well, it felt like eating a burger, just a little less beefy. I quite like them.</p><p>I quite like them. They're not exactly like meat but they are something interesting. And I do think this might be a taste of things to come.</p><p>Clare Sebastian, CNN -- New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WATT: You are watching CNN NEWSROOM.</p><p>I'm Nick Watt.

This came as yet another move by the Trump administration after the President became enmeshed in a war of words with tech giants.</p><p><br/> The goal of the proposal, which is being finalized, is to push tech companies to address criminal content on their platforms such as child exploitation, terrorism or cyberstalking, and boost transparency for users when the outlets take down lawful material, the Justice Department official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.<br/> For the proposal to become law, U.S. lawmakers would need to submit and approve a bill.<br/> \"These reforms are targeted at platforms to make certain they are appropriately addressing illegal and exploitive content while continuing to preserve a vibrant, open and competitive internet,\" Attorney General William Barr said in a statement.<br/> Trump warned the tech platforms of consequences when various social media questioned him, including Twitter and Snapchat on the credibility of his posts. He said that he would propose legislation to dilute the law shielding the tech giants. This came as an extraordinary attempt to regulate outlets where he has been criticized.<br/> Trump said he sought to \"remove or change\" Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which generally exempts platforms from responsibility for what their users' post and allows them to moderate the content of their sites as they wish.<br/> The Justice Department proposal would mandate platforms to \"address\" illicit content online, such as the material that violates federal criminal law, the department said. <br/> It would also seek to require the companies to be upfront about content moderation decisions and prevent the big online platforms from invoking Section 230 in antitrust cases.<br/>Facebook policy chief Nick Clegg told reporters that Section 230 enables the company to remove hate speech and that big changes would, \"in the end, mean less speech of all kinds appearing online.\"<br/> The White House welcomed the Justice Department proposal. The spokesperson Judd Deere said: \"The president expressly called on DOJ to develop such model legislation in the Executive Order signed recently, and yes, President Trump is pleased to see the department following through.\"<br/> The Republicans are also mulling on introducing a bill that would allow people to sue social media platforms in case if they feel that their speech has been censored.<br/> In a letter to Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Hawley referenced a dispute with the conservative website The Federalist, saying that Google's threat to demonetize the site because of comments made about Black Lives Matter protests was \"profoundly disingenuous.\" <br/> Hawley said Google sought to hold The Federalist responsible for its readers' comments even though Google's YouTube is not held accountable for comments because of Section 230.<br/> \"In short, Google demands minimum oversight for itself, but maximum power over those who use its platform,\" Hawley wrote, Reuters mentioned in its report.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSLIN-A400908</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSLIN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:605B-G2R1-JBYT-H1MG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402751</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"534\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Business Line</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 18, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Politics is about talking about the issue, making your base think you support them (the Republicans excel at unfulfilled promises), and raising a lot of money for your side. There is no money, no high paying lobbying or campaign jobs in a resolved problem.\u00a0Donald Trump won because he found a customer base that was not being served. That customer is blue collar workers in the Midwest in states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin. In these areas, Obama era environmental regulations and decades long global outsourcing left a lot of Americans with no jobs.\u00a0 There was a Democrat 'strategist' whose name I do not recall who stated the reason why Hillary Clinton lost is because the Democrats were so focused on their politics that they forgot the average American was trying to put food on the table. She was right. The ruling elites, of both political parties, in this country are so far removed from what life is like on Main Street. Nor do they care about our plight. It is a good thing the bailouts saved Wall Street's Hamptons' homes.\u00a0 There are billions of dollars at play in the existing Washington DC Swamp.

The answer is the latter.Donald Trump defied all political wisdom to win the Republican nomination and then the presidency. </p><p>He is a businessman who demands and produces results. Politics is about talking about the issue, making your base think you support them (the Republicans excel at unfulfilled promises), and raising a lot of money for your side. There is no money, no high paying lobbying or campaign jobs in a resolved problem.Donald Trump won because he found a customer base that was not being served. That customer is blue collar workers in the Midwest in states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin. In these areas, Obama era environmental regulations and decades long global outsourcing left a lot of Americans with no jobs. There was a Democrat 'strategist' whose name I do not recall who stated the reason why Hillary Clinton lost is because the Democrats were so focused on their politics that they forgot the average American was trying to put food on the table. She was right. The ruling elites, of both political parties, in this country are so far removed from what life is like on Main Street. Nor do they care about our plight. It is a good thing the bailouts saved Wall Street's Hamptons' homes. There are billions of dollars at play in the existing Washington DC Swamp. The people making this money know Donald Trump is out for them. They rightfully feel their livelihood is threatened. Given how they manipulate the system for their own gain, they will do anything to protect their way of life. Anything and everything will go. People are outraged over payments from Candidate Donald Trump, but do not complain about the $17 million paid out to settle sexual harassment claims against Congressmen. Leftists destroyed Donald Trump's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame while ignoring Bill Cosby and Kevin Spacey. What about all the former law enforcement officials (such as Robert Mueller and James Comey) who cash in their classified access for millions? President Trump wants to put an end to that practice. Apple cart upset. I can spend days showing the hypocrisy in politics. That however is not the point. I have witnessed this first hand in my time in politics. 'Everybody's got a price.'

Like Tony Blair in his heyday, he seems effortlessly to combine a business-friendly agenda with a determination to ensure it's bent to a social purpose. As with Blair, it may be more rhetoric than substance; more than likely, he'll end up stymied by traditional French intransigence. But for now he presses all the right buttons, he captures the mood, and he's got that precious thing - charisma.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To bankers and business leaders, he seems the perfect mix and, as a former banker himself, he's widely praised. Politically, he's managed to recapture the high ground from the populists and, to the Davos crowd, that's an achievement in itself.</p><p>Sadly, the same thing cannot be said about our own Theresa May.</p><p>Apparently, British officials had to virtually lay siege to the White House to ensure that Donald Trump granted her a meeting while in Davos.

Thank you!\"</p><p>Hours later, the micro-messaging platform hid the tweet behind a message that said it \"violates our policies regarding the glorification of violence based on the historical context of the last line, its connection to violence, and the risk it could inspire similar actions today.\"</p><p>\"As is standard with this notice, engagements with the Tweet will be limited. People will not be able to Like, Reply or Retweet it.\"</p><p>Users could still click through and view the full unedited tweet.</p><p>Trump, who has more than 80 million followers on Twitter, lashed out at the platform on Thursday, signing an executive order seeking to strip social media giants of legal immunity for content they carry.</p><p>Millions of users</p><p>The order calls on government regulators to evaluate if they should be eligible for liability protection for content posted by their millions of users.</p><p>The move, which was slammed by critics as a legally dubious act of political revenge, came after Twitter labelled two earlier Trump tweets, on the increasingly contentious topic of mail-in voting, as misleading.</p><p>If enforced, the action would upend decades of precedent and treat internet platforms as \"publishers\" potentially liable for user-generated content.</p><p>Trump told reporters at the White House he acted because big tech firms \"have had unchecked power to censor, restrict, edit, shape, hide, alter any form of communication between private citizens or large public audiences.\"</p><p>\"We can't let this continue to happen,\" Trump said.</p><p>Inaccurate posts</p><p>The spat comes days after Twitter bylined another tweet of the US president.</p><p>After long resisting calls to censure Trump over his frequent factually inaccurate posts, Twitter on Tuesday flagged the president for the first time for making false claims.</p><p>Trump had tweeted, without any evidence, that more mail-in voting would lead to what he called a \"Rigged Election\" this November.</p><p>Twitter then put a link to \"get the facts about mail-in balloting,\" \u00a0which immediately drew the ire of the president, saying \"social media\" could be subjected to regulation.</p><p>Political theatre</p><p>Critics said however Trump has no authority to regulate private internet operators or change the law, known as Section 230, which backers say has allowed online platforms like Facebook and Twitter to flourish.</p><p>The American Civil Liberties Union called Trump's order \"a blatant and unconstitutional threat to punish social media companies that displease the president.\"</p><p>Eric Goldman, director of the High-Tech Law Institute at Santa Clara University, said the order was \"more about political theater than about changing the law.\"</p><p>The order \"is not legally supportable -- it flies in the face of more than 900 court decisions,\" Goldman said.</p><p>Executive order</p><p>The White House seeks to sidestep the provisions giving internet firms immunity by treating them as publishers operating in part of a \"public square.\"</p><p>\"Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube wield immense, if not unprecedented, power to shape the interpretation of public events; to censor, delete, or disappear information; and to control what people see or do not see,\" the executive order said.</p><p>While the Trump order would not prevent platforms from moderating content, it</p><p>could open them up to a flood of lawsuits from anyone who claims to be harmed by content posted online.</p><p>Critics said the action represents a dangerous effort by the government to regulate online speech.</p><p>\"Social media can be frustrating. But an Executive Order that would turn the Federal\u00a0Communications Commission (FCC,) which regulates US media,\u00a0into the President's speech police is not the answer,\" said Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democratic member of FCC that itself would be tasked with enforcing the executive order.</p><p>More videos available on <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.english.rfi.fr\">http://www.english.rfi.fr</url>/</p><p>Radio France Internationale - All rights of reproduction and distribution reserved.  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RFIENG-175674567</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RFIENG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6013-GY61-F11P-X257-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">407847</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"790\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Radio France Internationale - All rights of reproduction and distribution reserved.

In May 2010, O'Keefe and three others pleaded guilty in federal court to a misdemeanor in a scheme in which they posed as telephone repairmen in Sen. Mary Landrieu's New Orleans district office.</p><p>\"He's not controversial, he's truthful,\" Trump insisted of O'Keefe.</p><p>Playing to the friendly crowd in the East Room, Trump was at ease, joking about everything from his spelling in tweets (blaming his thumbs, not his brain, for any mistakes) to his hair (saying the rainy weather at his July 4 outdoor speech at least proved his hair was real.)</p><p>\"With amazing creativity and determination, you are bypassing the corrupt establishment, and it is corrupt,\" Trump said. \"And you're bypassing the very, very corrupt media.\"</p><p>In lengthy remarks, he said: \"You're challenging the media gatekeepers and corporate censors to bring the truth to the American people. ... You communicate directly with our citizens without going through the fake news filter.\"</p><p>Earlier Thursday, Trump sent a stream of Twitter messages lashing out at social media companies and the press, familiar targets that resonate with his conservative base.</p><p>The meeting represented an escalation of Trump's battle with companies like Facebook, Google and even his preferred communications outlet, Twitter, where he has an estimated 61 million followers. The president has claimed, without evidence, that the companies are \"against me\" and even suggested U.S. regulators should sue them on grounds of anti-conservative bias.</p><p>He announced Thursday that he is directing his administration to explore \"all regulatory and legislative solutions to protect free speech and the free-speech rights of all Americans.\"</p><p>And Trump said he is inviting executives from major social media platforms to join him at the White House over the next month or so.</p><p>The firms already are under closer scrutiny than ever by regulators and in Congress following a stream of scandals, including Facebook's lapses opening the personal data of millions of users to Trump's 2016 campaign. A bipartisan push for new data privacy legislation has emerged in Congress. Regulators at the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are pursuing antitrust investigations of Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon.</p><p>Trump unleased a volley of Twitter messages Thursday leading up to the conference. The targets were familiar - \"certain companies,\" the press and his Democratic rivals. The president predicted, without foundation, the demise of the press and the social media platforms if he loses to a Democrat in 2020.</p><p>After the conference, Trump published a series of tweets slamming Bitcoin and other types of digital currency - including Facebook's recently announced Libra.</p><p>Among the other conservative organizations participating in the White House meeting were Turning Point USA, a nonprofit; PragerU, short for Prager University, which puts out short videos with a conservative perspective on politics and economics; the Media Research Center; and the Heritage Foundation, a Washington think tank.</p><p>Accusations commonly leveled by conservatives against the social media platforms include anti-religious bias, a tilt against abortion foes and censorship of conservative political views.</p><p>Trump has made it a priority to reach out to voters who oppose abortion. The anti-abortion groups Live Action and Susan B. Anthony List say Twitter has blocked their advertising. Twitter policy prohibits paid ads with content \"that is inflammatory or provocative and is likely to evoke a strong negative reaction.\"</p><p>Lila Rose, president of Live Action, said at the event that her group has been banned from advertising on Twitter while Planned Parenthood is allowed to do so. Pinterest also suspended the group from its platform, she said.</p><p>\"This double standard and bias is a growing problem in big tech,\" Rose said.</p><p>While some Silicon Valley company executives may lean liberal, they have asserted that their products are without political bias.</p><p>Representatives for Facebook, Google and Twitter have declined to comment specifically on the White House meeting. The Internet Association, the industry's major trade group representing Facebook, Google and dozens of other companies, said online platforms \"are the best tool for promoting voices from all political perspectives in history.\"</p><p>\"Internet companies are not biased against any political ideology, and conservative voices in particular have used social media to great effect,\" the group's president Michael Beckerman said in a statement Thursday.</p><p>Facebook has banned extremist figures such as Alex Jones of Infowars and Louis Farrakhan of the Nation of Islam. Twitter has banned hate speech on the basis of someone's race, gender and other categories. Twitter broadened its policy this week to include banning language that dehumanizes others based on religion, and the company said it may also ban similar language aimed at other groups, such as those defined by gender, race and sexual orientation.</p><p>\"I've never seen evidence of tech firm bias against conservatives,\" said Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., who has been sharply critical of the big companies because of their market dominance and effect on competition.

In May 2010, O'Keefe and three others pleaded guilty in federal court to a misdemeanor in a scheme in which they posed as telephone repairmen in Sen. Mary Landrieu's New Orleans district office.</p><p>\"He's not controversial, he's truthful,\" Trump insisted of O'Keefe.</p><p>Playing to the friendly crowd in the East Room, Trump was at ease, joking about everything from his spelling in tweets (blaming his thumbs, not his brain, for any mistakes) to his hair (saying the rainy weather at his July 4 outdoor speech at least proved his hair was real.)</p><p>\"With amazing creativity and determination, you are bypassing the corrupt establishment, and it is corrupt,\" Trump said. \"And you're bypassing the very, very corrupt media.\"</p><p>In lengthy remarks, he said: \"You're challenging the media gatekeepers and corporate censors to bring the truth to the American people. ... You communicate directly with our citizens without going through the fake news filter.\"</p><p>Earlier Thursday, Trump sent a stream of Twitter messages lashing out at social media companies and the press, familiar targets that resonate with his conservative base.</p><p>The meeting represented an escalation of Trump's battle with companies like Facebook, Google and even his preferred communications outlet, Twitter, where he has an estimated 61 million followers. The president has claimed, without evidence, that the companies are \"against me\" and even suggested U.S. regulators should sue them on grounds of anti-conservative bias.</p><p>He announced Thursday that he is directing his administration to explore \"all regulatory and legislative solutions to protect free speech and the free-speech rights of all Americans.\"</p><p>And Trump said he is inviting executives from major social media platforms to join him at the White House over the next month or so.</p><p>The firms already are under closer scrutiny than ever by regulators and in Congress following a stream of scandals, including Facebook's lapses opening the personal data of millions of users to Trump's 2016 campaign. A bipartisan push for new data privacy legislation has emerged in Congress. Regulators at the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are pursuing antitrust investigations of Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon.</p><p>Trump unleased a volley of Twitter messages Thursday leading up to the conference. The targets were familiar - \"certain companies,\" the press and his Democratic rivals. The president predicted, without foundation, the demise of the press and the social media platforms if he loses to a Democrat in 2020.</p><p>After the conference, Trump published a series of tweets slamming Bitcoin and other types of digital currency - including Facebook's recently announced Libra.</p><p>Among the other conservative organizations participating in the White House meeting were Turning Point USA, a nonprofit; PragerU, short for Prager University, which puts out short videos with a conservative perspective on politics and economics; the Media Research Center; and the Heritage Foundation, a Washington think tank.</p><p>Accusations commonly leveled by conservatives against the social media platforms include anti-religious bias, a tilt against abortion foes and censorship of conservative political views.</p><p>Trump has made it a priority to reach out to voters who oppose abortion. The anti-abortion groups Live Action and Susan B. Anthony List say Twitter has blocked their advertising. Twitter policy prohibits paid ads with content \"that is inflammatory or provocative and is likely to evoke a strong negative reaction.\"</p><p>Lila Rose, president of Live Action, said at the event that her group has been banned from advertising on Twitter while Planned Parenthood is allowed to do so. Pinterest also suspended the group from its platform, she said.</p><p>\"This double standard and bias is a growing problem in big tech,\" Rose said.</p><p>While some Silicon Valley company executives may lean liberal, they have asserted that their products are without political bias.</p><p>Representatives for Facebook, Google and Twitter have declined to comment specifically on the White House meeting. The Internet Association, the industry's major trade group representing Facebook, Google and dozens of other companies, said online platforms \"are the best tool for promoting voices from all political perspectives in history.\"</p><p>\"Internet companies are not biased against any political ideology, and conservative voices in particular have used social media to great effect,\" the group's president Michael Beckerman said in a statement Thursday.</p><p>Facebook has banned extremist figures such as <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/AlexJones\">Alex Jones of Infowars</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/LouisFarrakhan\">Louis Farrakhan of the Nation of Islam.</url>Twitter has banned hate speech on the basis of someone's race, gender and other categories.

In May 2010, O'Keefe and three others pleaded guilty in federal court to a misdemeanor in a scheme in which they posed as telephone repairmen in Sen. Mary Landrieu's New Orleans district office.</p><p>\"He's not controversial, he's truthful,\" Trump insisted of O'Keefe.</p><p>Playing to the friendly crowd in the East Room, Trump was at ease, joking about everything from his spelling in tweets (blaming his thumbs, not his brain, for any mistakes) to his hair (saying the rainy weather at his July 4 outdoor speech at least proved his hair was real.)</p><p>\"With amazing creativity and determination, you are bypassing the corrupt establishment, and it is corrupt,\" Trump said. \"And you're bypassing the very, very corrupt media.\"</p><p>In lengthy remarks, he said: \"You're challenging the media gatekeepers and corporate censors to bring the truth to the American people. ... You communicate directly with our citizens without going through the fake news filter.\"</p><p>Earlier Thursday, Trump sent a stream of Twitter messages lashing out at social media companies and the press, familiar targets that resonate with his conservative base.</p><p>The meeting represented an escalation of Trump's battle with companies like Facebook, Google and even his preferred communications outlet, Twitter, where he has an estimated 61 million followers. The president has claimed, without evidence, that the companies are \"against me\" and even suggested U.S. regulators should sue them on grounds of anti-conservative bias.</p><p>He announced Thursday that he is directing his administration to explore \"all regulatory and legislative solutions to protect free speech and the free-speech rights of all Americans.\"</p><p>And Trump said he is inviting executives from major social media platforms to join him at the White House over the next month or so.</p><p>The firms already are under closer scrutiny than ever by regulators and in Congress following a stream of scandals, including Facebook's lapses opening the personal data of millions of users to Trump's 2016 campaign. A bipartisan push for new data privacy legislation has emerged in Congress. Regulators at the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are pursuing antitrust investigations of Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon.</p><p>Trump unleased a volley of Twitter messages Thursday leading up to the conference. The targets were familiar - \"certain companies,\" the press and his Democratic rivals. The president predicted, without foundation, the demise of the press and the social media platforms if he loses to a Democrat in 2020.</p><p>After the conference, Trump published a series of tweets slamming Bitcoin and other types of digital currency - including Facebook's recently announced Libra.</p><p>Among the other conservative organizations participating in the White House meeting were Turning Point USA, a nonprofit; PragerU, short for Prager University, which puts out short videos with a conservative perspective on politics and economics; the Media Research Center; and the Heritage Foundation, a Washington think tank.</p><p>Accusations commonly leveled by conservatives against the social media platforms include anti-religious bias, a tilt against abortion foes and censorship of conservative political views.</p><p>Trump has made it a priority to reach out to voters who oppose abortion. The anti-abortion groups Live Action and Susan B. Anthony List say Twitter has blocked their advertising. Twitter policy prohibits paid ads with content \"that is inflammatory or provocative and is likely to evoke a strong negative reaction.\"</p><p>Lila Rose, president of Live Action, said at the event that her group has been banned from advertising on Twitter while Planned Parenthood is allowed to do so. Pinterest also suspended the group from its platform, she said.</p><p>\"This double standard and bias is a growing problem in big tech,\" Rose said.</p><p>While some Silicon Valley company executives may lean liberal, they have asserted that their products are without political bias.</p><p>Representatives for Facebook, Google and Twitter have declined to comment specifically on the White House meeting. The Internet Association, the industry's major trade group representing Facebook, Google and dozens of other companies, said online platforms \"are the best tool for promoting voices from all political perspectives in history.\"</p><p>\"Internet companies are not biased against any political ideology, and conservative voices in particular have used social media to great effect,\" the group's president Michael Beckerman said in a statement Thursday.</p><p>Facebook has banned extremist figures such as Alex Jones of Infowars and Louis Farrakhan of the Nation of Islam. Twitter has banned hate speech on the basis of someone's race, gender and other categories.

In May 2010, O'Keefe and three others pleaded guilty in federal court to a misdemeanor in a scheme in which they posed as telephone repairmen in Sen. Mary Landrieu's New Orleans district office.</p><p>\"He's not controversial, he's truthful,\" Trump insisted of O'Keefe.</p><p>Playing to the friendly crowd in the East Room, Trump was at ease, joking about everything from his spelling in tweets (blaming his thumbs, not his brain, for any mistakes) to his hair (saying the rainy weather at his July 4 outdoor speech at least proved his hair was real.)</p><p>\"With amazing creativity and determination, you are bypassing the corrupt establishment, and it is corrupt,\" Trump said. \"And you're bypassing the very, very corrupt media.\"</p><p>In lengthy remarks, he said: \"You're challenging the media gatekeepers and corporate censors to bring the truth to the American people. ... You communicate directly with our citizens without going through the fake news filter.\"</p><p>Earlier Thursday, Trump sent a stream of Twitter messages lashing out at social media companies and the press, familiar targets that resonate with his conservative base.</p><p>The meeting represented an escalation of Trump's battle with companies like Facebook, Google and even his preferred communications outlet, Twitter, where he has an estimated 61 million followers. The president has claimed, without evidence, that the companies are \"against me\" and even suggested U.S. regulators should sue them on grounds of anti-conservative bias.</p><p>He announced Thursday that he is directing his administration to explore \"all regulatory and legislative solutions to protect free speech and the free-speech rights of all Americans.\"</p><p>And Trump said he is inviting executives from major social media platforms to join him at the White House over the next month or so.</p><p>The firms already are under closer scrutiny than ever by regulators and in Congress following a stream of scandals, including Facebook's lapses opening the personal data of millions of users to Trump's 2016 campaign. A bipartisan push for new data privacy legislation has emerged in Congress. Regulators at the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are pursuing antitrust investigations of Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon.</p><p>Trump unleased a volley of Twitter messages Thursday leading up to the conference. The targets were familiar - \"certain companies,\" the press and his Democratic rivals. The president predicted, without foundation, the demise of the press and the social media platforms if he loses to a Democrat in 2020.</p><p>After the conference, Trump published a series of tweets slamming Bitcoin and other types of digital currency - including Facebook's recently announced Libra.</p><p>Among the other conservative organizations participating in the White House meeting were Turning Point USA, a nonprofit; PragerU, short for Prager University, which puts out short videos with a conservative perspective on politics and economics; the Media Research Center; and the Heritage Foundation, a Washington think tank.</p><p>Accusations commonly leveled by conservatives against the social media platforms include anti-religious bias, a tilt against abortion foes and censorship of conservative political views.</p><p>Trump has made it a priority to reach out to voters who oppose abortion. The anti-abortion groups Live Action and Susan B. Anthony List say Twitter has blocked their advertising. Twitter policy prohibits paid ads with content \"that is inflammatory or provocative and is likely to evoke a strong negative reaction.\"</p><p>Lila Rose, president of Live Action, said at the event that her group has been banned from advertising on Twitter while Planned Parenthood is allowed to do so. Pinterest also suspended the group from its platform, she said.</p><p>\"This double standard and bias is a growing problem in big tech,\" Rose said.</p><p>While some Silicon Valley company executives may lean liberal, they have asserted that their products are without political bias.</p><p>Representatives for Facebook, Google and Twitter have declined to comment specifically on the White House meeting. The Internet Association, the industry's major trade group representing Facebook, Google and dozens of other companies, said online platforms \"are the best tool for promoting voices from all political perspectives in history.\"</p><p>\"Internet companies are not biased against any political ideology, and conservative voices in particular have used social media to great effect,\" the group's president Michael Beckerman said in a statement Thursday.</p><p>Facebook has banned extremist figures such as Alex Jones of Infowars and Louis Farrakhan of the Nation of Islam. Twitter has banned hate speech on the basis of someone's race, gender and other categories.

In May 2010, O'Keefe and three others pleaded guilty in federal court to a misdemeanor in a scheme in which they posed as telephone repairmen in Sen. Mary Landrieu's New Orleans district office.</p><p>\"He's not controversial, he's truthful,\" Trump insisted of O'Keefe.</p><p>Playing to the friendly crowd in the East Room, Trump was at ease, joking about everything from his spelling in tweets (blaming his thumbs, not his brain, for any mistakes) to his hair (saying the rainy weather at his July 4 outdoor speech at least proved his hair was real.)</p><p>\"With amazing creativity and determination, you are bypassing the corrupt establishment, and it is corrupt,\" Trump said. \"And you're bypassing the very, very corrupt media.\"</p><p>In lengthy remarks, he said: \"You're challenging the media gatekeepers and corporate censors to bring the truth to the American people. ... You communicate directly with our citizens without going through the fake news filter.\"</p><p>Earlier Thursday, Trump sent a stream of Twitter messages lashing out at social media companies and the press, familiar targets that resonate with his conservative base.</p><p>The meeting represented an escalation of Trump's battle with companies like Facebook, Google and even his preferred communications outlet, Twitter, where he has an estimated 61 million followers. The president has claimed, without evidence, that the companies are \"against me\" and even suggested U.S. regulators should sue them on grounds of anti-conservative bias.</p><p>He announced Thursday that he is directing his administration to explore \"all regulatory and legislative solutions to protect free speech and the free-speech rights of all Americans.\"</p><p>And Trump said he's inviting executives from major social media platforms to join him at the White House over the next month or so.</p><p>The firms already are under closer scrutiny than ever by regulators and in Congress following a stream of scandals, including Facebook's lapses opening the personal data of millions of users to Trump's 2016 campaign. A bipartisan push for new data privacy legislation has emerged in Congress. Regulators at the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are pursuing antitrust investigations of Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon.</p><p>Trump's volley of Twitter messages Thursday had familiar targets - \"certain companies,\" the press and his Democratic rivals. The president predicted, without foundation, the demise of the press and the social media platforms if he loses to a Democrat in 2020.</p><p>Among the other conservative organizations and individuals participating in the White House meeting were Ali Alexander, who questioned the racial background of California Sen. Kamala Harris, a Democratic presidential contender, in a tweet which was shared by Donald Trump Jr.; Turning Point USA, a nonprofit; PragerU, short for Prager University, which puts out short videos with a conservative perspective on politics and economics; radio host and former Trump aide Sebastian Gorka; anti-abortion activist Lila Rose, founder of Live Action; the video bloggers known as Diamond and Silk; the Media Research Center; and the Heritage Foundation, a Washington think tank.</p><p>The White House did not release a full list.</p><p>Accusations commonly leveled by conservatives against the social media platforms include anti-religious bias, a tilt against abortion foes and censorship of conservative political views.</p><p>Trump has made it a priority to reach out to voters who oppose abortion. The anti-abortion groups Live Action and Susan B. Anthony List say Twitter has blocked their advertising. Twitter policy prohibits paid ads with content \"that is inflammatory or provocative and is likely to evoke a strong negative reaction.\"</p><p>While some Silicon Valley company executives may lean liberal, they have asserted that their products are without political bias.</p><p>Representatives for Facebook, Google and Twitter have declined to comment specifically on the White House meeting. The Internet Association, the industry's major trade group representing Facebook, Google and dozens of other companies, said online platforms \"are the best tool for promoting voices from all political perspectives in history.\"</p><p>\"Internet companies are not biased against any political ideology, and conservative voices in particular have used social media to great effect,\" the group's president Michael Beckerman said in a statement Thursday. \"Internet companies depend upon their users' trust from across the political spectrum to grow and succeed.\"</p><p>Facebook has banned extremist figures such as Twitter has banned hate speech on the basis of someone's race, gender and other categories. Twitter broadened its policy this week to include banning language that dehumanizes others based on religion, and the company said it may also ban similar language aimed at other groups, such as those defined by gender, race and sexual orientation.</p><p>\"I've never seen evidence of tech firm bias against conservatives,\" said Rep.

In May 2010, O'Keefe and three others pleaded guilty in federal court to a misdemeanour in a scheme in which they posed as telephone repairmen in Sen. Mary Landrieu's New Orleans district office.</p><p>\"He's not controversial, he's truthful,\" Trump insisted of O'Keefe.</p><p>Playing to the friendly crowd in the East Room, Trump was at ease, joking about everything from his spelling in tweets (blaming his thumbs, not his brain, for any mistakes) to his hair (saying the rainy weather at his July 4 outdoor speech at least proved his hair was real.)</p><p>\"With amazing creativity and determination, you are bypassing the corrupt establishment, and it is corrupt,\" Trump said. \"And you're bypassing the very, very corrupt media.\"</p><p>In lengthy remarks, he said: \"You're challenging the media gatekeepers and corporate censors to bring the truth to the American people. ... You communicate directly with our citizens without going through the fake news filter.\"</p><p>Earlier Thursday, Trump sent a stream of Twitter messages lashing out at social media companies and the press, familiar targets that resonate with his conservative base.</p><p>The meeting represented an escalation of Trump's battle with companies like Facebook, Google and even his preferred communications outlet, Twitter, where he has an estimated 61 million followers. The president has claimed, without evidence, that the companies are \"against me\" and even suggested U.S. regulators should sue them on grounds of anti-conservative bias.</p><p>He announced Thursday that he is directing his administration to explore \"all regulatory and legislative solutions to protect free speech and the free-speech rights of all Americans.\"</p><p>And Trump said he is inviting executives from major social media platforms to join him at the White House over the next month or so.</p><p>The firms already are under closer scrutiny than ever by regulators and in Congress following a stream of scandals, including Facebook's lapses opening the personal data of millions of users to Trump's 2016 campaign. A bipartisan push for new data privacy legislation has emerged in Congress. Regulators at the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are pursuing antitrust investigations of Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon.</p><p>Trump unleased a volley of Twitter messages Thursday leading up to the conference. The targets were familiar - \"certain companies,\" the press and his Democratic rivals. The president predicted, without foundation, the demise of the press and the social media platforms if he loses to a Democrat in 2020.</p><p>After the conference, Trump published a series of tweets slamming Bitcoin and other types of digital currency - including Facebook's recently announced Libra.</p><p>Among the other conservative organizations participating in the White House meeting were Turning Point USA, a non-profit; PragerU, short for Prager University, which puts out short videos with a conservative perspective on politics and economics; the Media Research Center; and the Heritage Foundation, a Washington think-tank .</p><p>Accusations commonly levelled by conservatives against the social media platforms include anti-religious bias, a tilt against abortion foes and censorship of conservative political views.</p><p>Trump has made it a priority to reach out to voters who oppose abortion. The anti-abortion groups Live Action and Susan B. Anthony List say Twitter has blocked their advertising. Twitter policy prohibits paid ads with content \"that is inflammatory or provocative and is likely to evoke a strong negative reaction.\"</p><p>Lila Rose, president of Live Action, said at the event that her group has been banned from advertising on Twitter while Planned Parenthood is allowed to do so. Pinterest also suspended the group from its platform, she said.</p><p>\"This double standard and bias is a growing problem in big tech,\" Rose said.</p><p>While some Silicon Valley company executives may lean liberal, they have asserted that their products are without political bias.</p><p>Representatives for Facebook, Google and Twitter have declined to comment specifically on the White House meeting. The Internet Association, the industry's major trade group representing Facebook, Google and dozens of other companies, said online platforms \"are the best tool for promoting voices from all political perspectives in history.\"</p><p>\"Internet companies are not biased against any political ideology, and conservative voices in particular have used social media to great effect,\" the group's president Michael Beckerman said in a statement Thursday.</p><p>Facebook has banned extremist figures such as Alex Jones of Infowars and Louis Farrakhan of the Nation of Islam. Twitter has banned hate speech on the basis of someone's race, gender and other categories. Twitter broadened its policy this week to include banning language that dehumanizes others based on religion, and the company said it may also ban similar language aimed at other groups, such as those defined by gender, race and sexual orientation.</p><p>\"I've never seen evidence of tech firm bias against conservatives,\" said Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., who has been sharply critical of the big companies because of their market dominance and effect on competition. He leads a House Judiciary subcommittee that has opened a bipartisan probe into the tech giants' market conduct.</p><p>\"If someone wants to show me some empirical data, instead of some alt-right member's paranoid claims, I'd appreciate it,\" Cicilline said in a statement Wednesday.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-6bffba9456e5419190a5478117b30607</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJD-Y0R1-JBVR-31T8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1044\"/><timeReceived>08:35 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 11, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Trump, who has weaponized social media to eviscerate opponents and promote himself, led a \"social media summit\" of like-minded critics of Big Tech, excluding representatives from the very platforms he exploits. The president used the event to air grievances over his treatment by Big Tech, but also to praise some of the most caustic voices on the right, who help energize Trump's political base. </p><p>\"Some of you guys are out there,\" he told them. \"I mean it's genius, but it's bad.\" Trump singled out for praise James O'Keefe, the right-wing activist whose Project Veritas organization once tried to plant a false story in The Washington Post. In May 2010, O'Keefe and three others pleaded guilty in federal court to a misdemeanor in a scheme in which they posed as telephone repairmen in Sen. Mary Landrieu's New Orleans district office. \"He's not controversial, he's truthful,\" Trump insisted of O'Keefe. Playing to the friendly crowd in the East Room, Trump joked about everything from his spelling in tweets (blaming his thumbs, not his brain, for any mistakes) to his hair (saying the rainy weather at his July 4 outdoor speech at least proved his hair was real.) \"With amazing creativity and determination, you are bypassing the corrupt establishment, and it is corrupt,\" Trump said. \"And you're bypassing the very, very corrupt media.\" In lengthy remarks, he said: \"You're challenging the media gatekeepers and corporate censors to bring the truth to the American people. ... You communicate directly with our citizens without going through the fake news filter.\" Earlier Thursday, Trump sent a stream of tweets lashing out at social media companies and the press, familiar targets that resonate with his conservative base. The meeting represented an escalation of Trump's battle with companies like Facebook, Google and even his preferred communications outlet, Twitter, where he has more than 61 million followers. The president has claimed, without evidence, that the companies are \"against me\" and even suggested U.S. regulators should sue them on grounds of anti-conservative bias. He announced Thursday that he is directing his administration to explore \"all regulatory and legislative solutions to protect free speech and the free-speech rights of all Americans.\" And Trump said he is inviting executives from major social media platforms to join him at the White House over the next month or so. Among the other conservative organizations participating in the White House meeting were Turning Point USA, a nonprofit founded by Prospect Heights native Charlie Kirk; PragerU, which puts out short videos with a conservative perspective on politics and economics; the Media Research Center; and the Heritage Foundation, a Washington think tank.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Associated Press Invited guests take photos as President Donald Trump speaks during the \"Presidential Social Media Summit\" in the East Room of the White House on Thursday.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHDLY-0001079162</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHDLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJD-R2H1-JBRC-V4TC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">163823</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"490\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Paddock Publications, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Chicago Daily Herald</publicationName><edition>WEB EditionNC1 EditionNC2 EditionMF12 EditionNC3 EditionNM1 EditionNC EditionNC14 EditionMC1 EditionMC3 EditionMD1 EditionML2 EditionNL1 EditionNC14C EditionNC4 EditionCLFM EditioneBlast Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 12, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS517311 WIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

I'm Christine Romans.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> BRIGGS:  I'm Dave Briggs.</p><p> I've been waiting all morning for you to speak some French.</p><p> ROMANS:  I had to pull out the French.</p><p> BRIGGS:  Finally, you delivered. </p><p> It is 11:30 in Paris.  Just hours from now, in Paris, President Trump holds a news conference alongside French President Emmanuel Macron. It will be the first chance for reporters to question the president publicly since the revelation Donald Trump, Jr. met with a Russian lawyer hoping to get dirt on Hillary Clinton.</p><p> In advance of that news conference, President Trump tells Reuters he was unaware of the meeting Don, Jr. agreed to, only learning about it a couple of days ago.</p><p> ROMANS:  A Republican source says the president has privately expressed dismay his son agreed to the meeting but believes Don, Jr. did nothing illegal.  That source also says the president is annoyed the story has become a distraction from the overseas trip last week to Poland and Germany, a trip the White House sees as a success.  So how will all of this affect the president's trip to France?  </p><p>CNN's Melissa Bell joins us this morning from Paris.  Good morning.</p><p> MELISSA BELL, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning.  What's going to be extremely interesting once we see both presidents get out together -- and it has yet to happen although Donald Trump has been in Paris for more than two hours now, Christine -- is going to be the body language between these two men.</p><p> So much has been made of the fact that Emmanuel Macron was, in many respects, the anti-Donald Trump.  So different are their worldviews and yet, there is so much that unites them.  They are both political outsiders, they are both plain-speaking, they are both pretty tough men who defend their worldviews vigorously and seem to have a certain respect for one another.</p><p> Emmanuel Macron certainly believes he's been watching, you know, this growing isolation of Donald Trump on the world stage.  He feels that there's an opportunity for him here to try and bring him back into the fold.</p><p> There will be an awful lot in the way these two men square up to one another in front of the cameras.  And, of course, you mentioned that crucial press conference that the American press, in particular, are waiting to get so much from.</p><p> I think with this particular visit and its timing, coming as it does in the middle of all these troubles for Donald Trump in Washington, there is perhaps even more of an opportunity for Emmanuel Macron to find a partner with whom he can do business, getting him to realize the importance of the historical ties that bind Europe and the United States because that world stage that one would have imagined Donald Trump shying away from in the early days of his presidency might well be one that he is actually relieved to be able to seek out today in Paris, leaving behind him, in many respects, all this cloud of the last few days in Washington.</p><p> ROMANS:  All right, thank you for that.  It's nice to see you this morning.  You've got a lot of work ahead of you over the next few hours, no question.</p><p> BRIGGS:  No doubt about that.</p><p> Joining us to help break down the politics of all of this, \"CNN POLITICS\" reporter Tal Kopan in Washington, and CNN political analyst Julian Zelizer, historian and a professor at Princeton.  Good morning to both of you.</p><p> ROMANS:  Hi, guys.</p><p> BRIGGS:  I want to point your attention to an interesting op-ed appearing this morning in \"The New York Times\" from the president's top two advisers -- his National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster, his Chief Economic Adviser Gary Cohn.  And, in a sense --</p><p> ROMANS:  In \"The New York Time,\" you say?</p><p> BRIGGS:  Yes, let's talk about that.</p><p> ROMANS:  In \"The New York Time,\" you say?</p><p> BRIGGS:  It is in \"The New York Times.\"  It is 6,000 characters versus 140 characters where the president prefers to speak in.</p><p> But, Julian Zelizer, let me ask you about that.  It's the failing \"New York Times.\"  It's often derided as fake news.  When you're top two advisers take to \"The New York Times\" to write a very eloquent and passionate piece on American leadership, what does it say about those very knocks against the media before we even get to the content of it?</p><p> JULIAN ZELIZER, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST:  Well, it says that despite what the president says, at least some people in the administration understand the importance of all these media institutions that they disparage.  </p><p> And this is an effort by two top policymakers in the administration to outline some kind of doctrine and to make some kind of sense about President Trump's overseas policies when the Twitter account won't do that for them.</p><p> ROMANS:  You sometimes hear people talk about MMT&amp;C -- the grown-ups, McMaster, Mattis, Tillerson, and Cohn.  The people who are trying to executive this 'America First' worldview -- this op-ed, \"The Trump Vision for America Abroad.\"</p><p> [05:35:05]  You know, it talks about agreement at the G20 about open trade but it has to be fair.  What I see when I hear them talk about open trade that has to be fair, I see other countries running around excluding the United States.  I see Mexico and China talking about doing a deal.  I see the E.U. and Japan doing a deal.  </p><p> Is the United States' 'America First' policy, as it is so far, mean America alone?</p><p> ZELIZER:  Yes.  What the critics will say is that the U.S. is isolating itself.  So with trade agreements we are now further removed from key deals and from regions like Asia where you can see some of the effects on issues like North Korea.  Also the climate change.  </p><p> We are now standing alone, in many ways, from the rest of the world. So the 'America First' strategy can be very detrimental and it assumes 'America First' doesn't include the interest in curbing --</p><p> ROMANS:  Right.</p><p> ZELIZER:  -- climate change.  So it's a very particular understanding of what that means.</p><p> BRIGGS:  So from this interesting op-ed in \"The New York Times,\" Tal, to a very important press conference that we call a two-and-two -- two questions from the American media and two from the French.  Certainly, one has to be about Don, Jr. -- this meeting he took with the Russian lawyer.  </p><p> And we got a hint of how the president might play this in an interview with Reuters when the president said, quote, \"I think many people would have held that meeting and you have to understand when that took place this was before Russia fever.  There was no Russia fever back then.  That was at the beginning of the campaign, more or less.  There was no Russia fever.\"</p><p> Well, there certainly is now, but even then that was an American adversary, arguably our greatest on the planet.  Twelve o'clock Eastern time we will learn how the president plays this.</p><p> Is this the typical line you'd expect from the president relating to that meeting?</p><p> TAL KOPAN, CNN POLITICS REPORTER:  I think so.  I think that what we saw in that Reuters article is a good preview of what we're going to see from him.  You know, the famous self-proclaimed counterpuncher who does not suffer anything he perceives as an attack against him.</p><p> And, you know, you mentioned pivoting from \"The New York Times\" op-ed. I think that they're actually connected and they're connected in the sense that time and time again we see that no one can really speak for the president's vision but the president.  </p><p> I mean, his aides have struggled over and over to keep up with his changing explanations of things.  They'll come out one day in the press conference and give an answer and then the president, himself, will undercut them in an interview.  And, certainly, he has two polls in the White House sort of pulling him in different directions, at home and abroad, on policy.  </p><p> And so, this press conference is going to be our opportunity to hear from the president himself how he sees himself moving forward.  And, you know, to the point that he keeps undercutting his aides, there's sort of no one else who can articulate his vision but himself, and so it's an incredibly important time to hear directly from him.</p><p> ROMANS:  There's also, you know, legislation.  There's a big explosive agenda -- aggressive agenda that he wanted to do.  Tax reform, health care reform, infrastructure.  </p><p> Julian Zelizer, you've got Republicans still trying to work on health care.</p><p> ZELIZER:  Yes.</p><p> ROMANS:  Still trying to work on tax reform, frankly, and it's sort of been overshadowed by all of this.</p><p> Listen to what the president said to Pat Robertson yesterday about the health bill.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I'm sitting, waiting for that bill to come to my desk.  I hope that they do it.  They've been promising it for years.  </p><p> They've been promising it ever since Obamacare, which is failed.  It's a failed experiment.  It is totally done.  It's out of business and we have to get this done -- repeal and replace.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ROMANS:  The president goes on to say he's angry.</p><p> BRIGGS:  Angry.</p><p> ROMANS:  Angry if they don't get this thing done.</p><p> What role should he have in this?</p><p> ZELIZER:  Well, he should have had a much stronger role.  I think there's many Republicans on the Hill who feel he's been a hindrance. Every time they're trying to build momentum for the legislation the news turns back to the Russia scandal, not because of the media but because of him.</p><p> ROMANS:  And that's what Republicans think.  Republicans think --</p><p> ZELIZER:  Yes.</p><p> ROMANS:  -- this is not a media-created hoax.  They think that the president has misplayed.</p><p> ZELIZER:  Exactly, and he hasn't really done much to whip up the vote, which presidents can do, to try to help build the coalition on Capitol Hill, nor has he used the bully pulpit to try to explain why this bill is good.  </p><p> So most people hear it's going to cut Medicaid benefits, which it will.  It will remove regulations.  So it's incumbent on the president to offer a different explanation, but all we hear is he'll be mad if it doesn't comment and he --</p><p> BRIGGS:  It's strange to see his absence on this given that 84 percent of Republicans still approve, Tal Kopan, of the job the president is doing.  His base is very much still behind him.  </p><p> So is the president's absence on health care, by design, and b) what do you expect is the future of this health care bill?  We understand they want a vote by late next week.</p><p> [05:40:03]  KOPAN:  Yes, that's right, Dave.  So, a) I think it is somewhat by design.  Keep in mind that when the House was doing this Trump did try to be actively involved and sort of got in the way.  </p><p> He goes into meetings with Republicans and starts to make some promises to them about negotiating the bill.  And every time leadership thought they were in sort of a good place there would come a message that Trump actually wants it to -- he told the conservatives he wants it to go their way or he told the moderates it would go their way.  </p><p> And remember he -- then, after they passed it and they held a Rose Garden press conference celebrating it he confirmed, himself, that in a closed meeting he called the bill mean.  </p><p> And so, when it came time for the Senate to do its work -- you know, McConnell has generally run a much more closed process than Paul Ryan was willing to run, and so the president not being actively involved in that may be something that they actually asked for.</p><p> In terms of its passage, look, it's not looking good.  It hasn't looked good.  They have never shown any ability to get to actually 50 votes and being able to build a coalition of moderates and conservatives within the Republican Party to support this bill.</p><p> I'll never declare anything dead because I've seen Congress do amazing things but it doesn't look good is the bottom line.</p><p> ROMANS:  Yes, and now they're talking about taxes on the rich.  You know, leaving the taxes on the rich in that -- gets you a couple hundred billion dollars but it might lose you some real fiscal conservatives there.  People who don't want -- who are anti-tax, anyway.</p><p> It's just fascinating stuff, guys.  All right.  Thanks for being here with this morning.  A lot to talk about.  </p><p> And I just -- I mean, the fact that Emmanuel Macron did a -- did a video in English saying make the planet great again, and now he's hosting the president who wants to make America great again.  It's just a really interesting --</p><p> BRIGGS:  And said, out of the G20, our world has never been so divided, and many thought that was a veiled shot at President Trump. So, interesting dynamics ahead of this meeting in Paris.</p><p> ROMANS:  Forty-two minutes past the hour.</p><p> Remains of several people found under 12 feet of concrete after an exhaustive search in Pennsylvania.  What police are saying about the suspect, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> [05:46:20]  BRIGGS:  A sad discovery in the search for four men missing in Pennsylvania.  The body of at least one of the four has been identified, found buried on a property in Bucks County.  That's about an hour from Philadelphia.</p><p> Joining us now with the latest, CNN's Brynn Gingras.  Good morning to you.</p><p> ROMANS:  Good morning, Brynn.</p><p> BRIGGS:  A story that just gets more disturbing by the hour.</p><p> BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  I mean, this was a missing persons case and then this grim discovery.  It's just terrifying and awful.</p><p> The Bucks County district attorney says the remains were found in a 12-1/2 foot deep grave.  The D.A. says the body has been identified and is that of Dean Finocchiaro.   Now, there are additional remains in that common grave that have not yet been identified but the worst fears, of course, are that they belong to the other three that were missing last week, these three men -- Jimi Patrick, Thomas Meo, and Mark Sturgis.  All four, again, went missing last week.</p><p> Police have arrested 20-year-old Cosmo DiNardo.  The bodies were found after police dug through concrete recently poured on land owned by DiNardo's family.  And then, DiNardo had been arrested on Monday on an unrelated gun charge, was released on $1 million bail, but then he was arrested again yesterday after police say he tried to sell a car belonging to one of the missing men.</p><p> Bucks County D.A. Matt Weintraub, who held a news conference at midnight, says he hopes that arrest is going to give him and his investigators enough time to now bring homicide charges.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MATT WEINTRAUB, DISTRICT ATTORNEY, BUCKS COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA:  I feel that we bought ourself a little bit of time in charging Mr. DiNardo with the stolen car case today and getting that $5 million bail.  It is my hope that he does not post that but that's his prerogative, of course, if he can post it.  </p><p> But we're going to start looking seriously at the homicide charges and, in fact, we already have pursued that option.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GINGRAS:  A lot of work still be done.  The district attorney says cadaver dogs helped to locate the remains, even 12-1/2 feet below ground under concrete.  </p><p> The big question though, guys, is that investigators are still trying to figure out a motive, still trying to figure out how these guys are all connected.  Two separate investigations going on on the property and also, again, just figuring out what happened here.</p><p> BRIGGS:  Wow.</p><p> ROMANS:  Sad story.</p><p> BRIGGS:  More press conferences we expect today?</p><p> GINGRAS:  Yes, we should get more news.</p><p> BRIGGS:  Maybe some more information.  Brynn, thanks so much.</p><p> ROMANS:  All right.  Internet companies, big and small, banning together to preserve net neutrality, Dave's favorite phrase.</p><p> BRIGGS:  I hate that saying.</p><p> ROMANS:  We'll tell you what it means, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> [05:52:57]  BRIGGS:  Welcome back.</p><p> Scientists are examining the causes and effects of an enormous iceberg breaking away from the Antarctic Peninsula.  The 2,200-square-mile floating block of ice represents one of the biggest such events ever recorded.  It's getting global attention for its significance in climate change.</p><p>CNN's Kyung Lah has more.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> KYUNG LAH, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  A crack more than 120 miles long on the east side of the Antarctic Peninsula finally breaking off, creating a spectacular iceberg weighing more than a trillion metric tons, roughly the size of Delaware.</p><p> ARADHNA TRIPATI, UCLA PROFESSOR:  It's one of the largest icebergs in human history.  </p><p> LAH:  UCLA professor Aradhna Tripati has spent her career studying Antarctic ice, traveling to the very peninsula where the ice shelf called Larsen C broke off.  </p><p> Professor Tripati has seen two other big sections of the Peninsula break off and dissolve, the first in 1995 and then another in 2002. She watched as this crack grew for years, caught off guard that this break happened so soon.</p><p> What this latest break means is something scientists aren't yet agreed on.  Antarctica, the coldest place on earth, is a continent covered in ice and icebergs have been breaking away from ice shelves for millions of years.  </p><p> But at the end of the 20th century, the peninsula was one of the fastest-warming places on the planet.  That warming has slowed or reversed slightly in this century.</p><p> LAH (on camera):  You learn all of this just from samples of ice.</p><p> TRIPATI:  You learn it from samples of ice and samples of rock.</p><p> LAH (voice-over):  This geochemist says the overall trends in the Arctic point to global warming.</p><p> TRIPATI:  The fact that we've had seven out of the 12 ice shelves on Antarctica collapse in the last few decades, and this one appears to be ready to go with a breaking off of this major iceberg, that -- it's hard to attribute to anything else.</p><p> LAH:  For now, scientists will track the new iceberg to see if and when it melts.  And maps, they'll have to be redrawn for the ever- changing geography in Antarctica.</p><p> [05:55:10]  Kyung Lah, CNN, Los Angeles. (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> ROMANS:  All right.  Let's get a check on \"CNN Money Stream\" this morning.</p><p> Global stock markets are higher after the Fed Chief Janet Yellen -- after her Capitol Hill testimony.  It sent Wall Street to new record highs.</p><p> She signaled the Fed may be more cautious about future rate hikes and that boosted bond prices and stocks.  The Dow closing at an all-time high.  Right now, futures are higher again.</p><p> The data of six million Verizon customers has leaked online.  We're talking phone numbers, names, some pin codes.  Verizon says the breach was caused by a problem with its cloud server.  I hate that when that happens.  It has since been closed, we're told.</p><p>Verizon also says there was no theft of customer information but security experts say Verizon customers, you should update your pin codes.  Do it now.</p><p> Internet companies are banning together to preserve net neutrality. More than 80,000 Web sites, including Facebook, Google, Netflix, Amazon -- they are participating in this protest to changes in net neutrality rules.</p><p> Net neutrality requires broadband providers to treat all content equally, essentially preventing them from selling access to speedier Internet.  The rule went into effect in 2015.  </p><p> It's seen as Internet fairness but the new FCC chairman wants to repeal the rule.  He was appointed by President Trump in January.  He says net neutrality kills innovation.</p><p> A lot of big tech players today.  You will find ways, big and small, they are protesting this.</p><p> BRIGGS:  You say it's seen as Internet fairness.  That would be easier for people to consume and get behind the notion of this.  But until people understand it, it's going to be tough.</p><p> ROMANS:  You know, I saw something yesterday --</p><p> BRIGGS:  That's palatable.</p><p> ROMANS:  -- from one of these tech gurus who said if you're not freaking out today about net neutrality, you should be.</p><p> BRIGGS:  Yes.</p><p> ROMANS:  All right, thanks for joining us.  I'm Christine Romans.</p><p> BRIGGS:  I'm Dave Briggs.  \"NEW DAY\" has a big day, given the president is in Paris.  We'll see you tomorrow.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  It is time to put our great country before Paris, France.</p><p> EMMANUEL MACRON, PRESIDENT OF FRANCE:  Make our planet great again.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is a chance for Donald Trump to escape the kind of political heat he's been facing in Washington.  </p><p> REP. MIKE QUIGLEY (D), ILLINOIS:  At best, it's naivete.  At worst, it's something along the lines of an element of a conspiracy.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's always dangerous to jump to conclusions without knowing the entire story.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You don't take foreign campaign contributions, either monetary or of another sort.</p><p> TRUMP:  He wants what's good for Russia and I want what's good for the United States.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I don't think you have to worry about whether Russia's a friend or foe.  Just assume they're a foe.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ANNOUNCER:  This is NEW DAY with Chris Cuomo and Alisyn Camerota.</p><p> ALISYN CAMEROTA, CNN ANCHOR:  We want to welcome our viewers in the United States and around the world.

The president hoping for a boost of pageantry.  He hopes that will change the conversation.</p><p> But the big focus today will be on how Mr. Trump answers questions about his son's meeting with that Russian lawyer when the president holds his first press conference since the controversy.</p><p> Now, before heading overseas the president gave two revealing interviews.  President Trump dismisses reports that his administration is paralyzed by the Russia revelations and he comes to his son's defense.  And he maintains that there was, quote, \"zero coordination with the Kremlin and his campaign.\"</p><p> BERMAN:  Now, while that's happening, Congressional investigators want to question the president's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort. The Senate Judiciary Committee -- its leaders say they will subpoena him if necessary.  This is part of their Russian interference investigation. And Senate Republicans are set to unveil the latest version of their health care bill today.  What is in it, can it pass?  Those answers known maybe by the end of today.</p><p> We have it all covered.  Let's begin with CNN's Sara Murray live for us in Paris.

I'm Christine Romans.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BRIGGS: I'm Dave Briggs.</p><p>I've been waiting all morning for you to speak some French.</p><p>ROMANS: I had to pull out the French.</p><p>BRIGGS: Finally, you delivered.</p><p>It is 11:30 in Paris. Just hours from now, in Paris, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>holds a news conference alongside French President <person><nameText>Emmanuel Macron. </nameText></person>It will be the first chance for reporters to question the president publicly since the revelation <person><nameText>Donald Trump, Jr. </nameText></person>met with a Russian lawyer hoping to get dirt on <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton.</nameText></person></p><p>In advance of that news conference, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>tells Reuters he was unaware of the meeting Don, Jr. agreed to, only learning about it a couple of days ago.</p><p>ROMANS: A Republican source says the president has privately expressed dismay his son agreed to the meeting but believes Don, Jr. did nothing illegal. That source also says the president is annoyed the story has become a distraction from the overseas trip last week to Poland and Germany, a trip the White House sees as a success. So how will all of this affect the president's trip to France?</p><p>CNN's Melissa Bell joins us this morning from Paris. Good morning.</p><p>MELISSA BELL, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Good morning. What's going to be extremely interesting once we see both presidents get out together -- and it has yet to happen although <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>has been in Paris for more than two hours now, Christine -- is going to be the body language between these two men.</p><p>So much has been made of the fact that <person><nameText>Emmanuel Macron </nameText></person>was, in many respects, the anti-<person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>So different are their worldviews and yet, there is so much that unites them. They are both political outsiders, they are both plain-speaking, they are both pretty tough men who defend their worldviews vigorously and seem to have a certain respect for one another.</p><p><person><nameText>Emmanuel Macron </nameText></person>certainly believes he's been watching, you know, this growing isolation of <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>on the world stage. He feels that there's an opportunity for him here to try and bring him back into the fold.</p><p>There will be an awful lot in the way these two men square up to one another in front of the cameras. And, of course, you mentioned that crucial press conference that the American press, in particular, are waiting to get so much from.</p><p>I think with this particular visit and its timing, coming as it does in the middle of all these troubles for <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>in Washington, there is perhaps even more of an opportunity for <person><nameText>Emmanuel Macron </nameText></person>to find a partner with whom he can do business, getting him to realize the importance of the historical ties that bind Europe and the United States because that world stage that one would have imagined <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>shying away from in the early days of his presidency might well be one that he is actually relieved to be able to seek out today in Paris, leaving behind him, in many respects, all this cloud of the last few days in Washington.</p><p>ROMANS: All right, thank you for that. It's nice to see you this morning. You've got a lot of work ahead of you over the next few hours, no question.</p><p>BRIGGS: No doubt about that.</p><p>Joining us to help break down the politics of all of this, \"CNN POLITICS\" reporter Tal Kopan in Washington, and CNN political analyst Julian Zelizer, historian and a professor at Princeton. Good morning to both of you.</p><p>ROMANS: Hi, guys.</p><p>BRIGGS: I want to point your attention to an interesting op-ed appearing this morning in \"The New York Times\" from the president's top two advisers -- his National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster, his Chief Economic Adviser Gary Cohn. And, in a sense --</p><p>ROMANS: In \"The New York Time,\" you say?</p><p>BRIGGS: Yes, let's talk about that.</p><p>ROMANS: In \"The New York Time,\" you say?</p><p>BRIGGS: It is in \"The New York Times.\" It is 6,000 characters versus 140 characters where the president prefers to speak in.</p><p>But, Julian Zelizer, let me ask you about that. It's the failing \"New York Times.\" It's often derided as fake news. When you're top two advisers take to \"The New York Times\" to write a very eloquent and passionate piece on American leadership, what does it say about those very knocks against the media before we even get to the content of it?</p><p>JULIAN ZELIZER, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, it says that despite what the president says, at least some people in the administration understand the importance of all these media institutions that they disparage.</p><p>And this is an effort by two top policymakers in the administration to outline some kind of doctrine and to make some kind of sense about <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>overseas policies when the Twitter account won't do that for them.</p><p>ROMANS: You sometimes hear people talk about MMT&amp;C -- the grown-ups, McMaster, Mattis, Tillerson, and Cohn. The people who are trying to executive this 'America First' worldview -- this op-ed, \"The Trump Vision for America Abroad.\"</p><p>[05:35:05] You know, it talks about agreement at the G20 about open trade but it has to be fair. What I see when I hear them talk about open trade that has to be fair, I see other countries running around excluding the United States. I see Mexico and China talking about doing a deal. I see the E.U. and Japan doing a deal.</p><p>Is the United States' 'America First' policy, as it is so far, mean America alone?</p><p>ZELIZER: Yes. What the critics will say is that the U.S. is isolating itself. So with trade agreements we are now further removed from key deals and from regions like Asia where you can see some of the effects on issues like North Korea. Also the climate change.</p><p>We are now standing alone, in many ways, from the rest of the world. So the 'America First' strategy can be very detrimental and it assumes 'America First' doesn't include the interest in curbing --</p><p>ROMANS: Right.</p><p>ZELIZER: -- climate change. So it's a very particular understanding of what that means.</p><p>BRIGGS: So from this interesting op-ed in \"The New York Times,\" Tal, to a very important press conference that we call a two-and-two -- two questions from the American media and two from the French. Certainly, one has to be about Don, Jr. -- this meeting he took with the Russian lawyer.</p><p>And we got a hint of how the president might play this in an interview with Reuters when the president said, quote, \"I think many people would have held that meeting and you have to understand when that took place this was before Russia fever. There was no Russia fever back then. That was at the beginning of the campaign, more or less. There was no Russia fever.\"</p><p>Well, there certainly is now, but even then that was an American adversary, arguably our greatest on the planet. Twelve o'clock Eastern time we will learn how the president plays this.</p><p>Is this the typical line you'd expect from the president relating to that meeting?</p><p>TAL KOPAN, CNN POLITICS REPORTER: I think so. I think that what we saw in that Reuters article is a good preview of what we're going to see from him. You know, the famous self-proclaimed counterpuncher who does not suffer anything he perceives as an attack against him.</p><p>And, you know, you mentioned pivoting from \"The New York Times\" op-ed. I think that they're actually connected and they're connected in the sense that time and time again we see that no one can really speak for the president's vision but the president.</p><p>I mean, his aides have struggled over and over to keep up with his changing explanations of things. They'll come out one day in the press conference and give an answer and then the president, himself, will undercut them in an interview. And, certainly, he has two polls in the White House sort of pulling him in different directions, at home and abroad, on policy.</p><p>And so, this press conference is going to be our opportunity to hear from the president himself how he sees himself moving forward. And, you know, to the point that he keeps undercutting his aides, there's sort of no one else who can articulate his vision but himself, and so it's an incredibly important time to hear directly from him.</p><p>ROMANS: There's also, you know, legislation. There's a big explosive agenda -- aggressive agenda that he wanted to do. Tax reform, health care reform, infrastructure.</p><p>Julian Zelizer, you've got Republicans still trying to work on health care.</p><p>ZELIZER: Yes.</p><p>ROMANS: Still trying to work on tax reform, frankly, and it's sort of been overshadowed by all of this.</p><p>Listen to what the president said to Pat Robertson yesterday about the health bill.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP, </nameText></person>PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I'm sitting, waiting for that bill to come to my desk. I hope that they do it. They've been promising it for years.</p><p>They've been promising it ever since Obamacare, which is failed. It's a failed experiment. It is totally done. It's out of business and we have to get this done -- repeal and replace.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: The president goes on to say he's angry.</p><p>BRIGGS: Angry.</p><p>ROMANS: Angry if they don't get this thing done.</p><p>What role should he have in this?</p><p>ZELIZER: Well, he should have had a much stronger role. I think there's many Republicans on the Hill who feel he's been a hindrance. Every time they're trying to build momentum for the legislation the news turns back to the Russia scandal, not because of the media but because of him.</p><p>ROMANS: And that's what Republicans think. Republicans think --</p><p>ZELIZER: Yes.</p><p>ROMANS: -- this is not a media-created hoax. They think that the president has misplayed.</p><p>ZELIZER: Exactly, and he hasn't really done much to whip up the vote, which presidents can do, to try to help build the coalition on Capitol Hill, nor has he used the bully pulpit to try to explain why this bill is good.</p><p>So most people hear it's going to cut Medicaid benefits, which it will. It will remove regulations. So it's incumbent on the president to offer a different explanation, but all we hear is he'll be mad if it doesn't comment and he --</p><p>BRIGGS: It's strange to see his absence on this given that 84 percent of Republicans still approve, Tal Kopan, of the job the president is doing. His base is very much still behind him.</p><p>So is the president's absence on health care, by design, and b) what do you expect is the future of this health care bill? We understand they want a vote by late next week.</p><p>[05:40:03] KOPAN: Yes, that's right, Dave. So, a) I think it is somewhat by design. Keep in mind that when the House was doing this Trump did try to be actively involved and sort of got in the way.</p><p>He goes into meetings with Republicans and starts to make some promises to them about negotiating the bill. And every time leadership thought they were in sort of a good place there would come a message that Trump actually wants it to -- he told the conservatives he wants it to go their way or he told the moderates it would go their way.</p><p>And remember he -- then, after they passed it and they held a Rose Garden press conference celebrating it he confirmed, himself, that in a closed meeting he called the bill mean.</p><p>And so, when it came time for the Senate to do its work -- you know, McConnell has generally run a much more closed process than Paul Ryan was willing to run, and so the president not being actively involved in that may be something that they actually asked for.</p><p>In terms of its passage, look, it's not looking good. It hasn't looked good. They have never shown any ability to get to actually 50 votes and being able to build a coalition of moderates and conservatives within the Republican Party to support this bill.</p><p>I'll never declare anything dead because I've seen Congress do amazing things but it doesn't look good is the bottom line.</p><p>ROMANS: Yes, and now they're talking about taxes on the rich. You know, leaving the taxes on the rich in that -- gets you a couple hundred billion dollars but it might lose you some real fiscal conservatives there. People who don't want -- who are anti-tax, anyway.</p><p>It's just fascinating stuff, guys. All right. Thanks for being here with this morning. A lot to talk about.</p><p>And I just -- I mean, the fact that <person><nameText>Emmanuel Macron </nameText></person>did a -- did a video in English saying make the planet great again, and now he's hosting the president who wants to make America great again. It's just a really interesting --</p><p>BRIGGS: And said, out of the G20, our world has never been so divided, and many thought that was a veiled shot at <person><nameText>President Trump. </nameText></person>So, interesting dynamics ahead of this meeting in Paris.</p><p>ROMANS: Forty-two minutes past the hour.</p><p>Remains of several people found under 12 feet of concrete after an exhaustive search in Pennsylvania. What police are saying about the suspect, next.</p><p>[05:46:20] BRIGGS: A sad discovery in the search for four men missing in Pennsylvania. The body of at least one of the four has been identified, found buried on a property in Bucks County. That's about an hour from Philadelphia.</p><p>Joining us now with the latest, CNN's Brynn Gingras. Good morning to you.</p><p>ROMANS: Good morning, Brynn.</p><p>BRIGGS: A story that just gets more disturbing by the hour.</p><p>BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. I mean, this was a missing persons case and then this grim discovery. It's just terrifying and awful.</p><p>The Bucks County district attorney says the remains were found in a 12-1/2 foot deep grave. The D.A. says the body has been identified and is that of Dean Finocchiaro. Now, there are additional remains in that common grave that have not yet been identified but the worst fears, of course, are that they belong to the other three that were missing last week, these three men -- Jimi Patrick, Thomas Meo, and Mark Sturgis. All four, again, went missing last week.</p><p>Police have arrested 20-year-old Cosmo DiNardo. The bodies were found after police dug through concrete recently poured on land owned by DiNardo's family. And then, DiNardo had been arrested on Monday on an unrelated gun charge, was released on $1 million bail, but then he was arrested again yesterday after police say he tried to sell a car belonging to one of the missing men.</p><p>Bucks County D.A. Matt Weintraub, who held a news conference at midnight, says he hopes that arrest is going to give him and his investigators enough time to now bring homicide charges.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATT WEINTRAUB, DISTRICT ATTORNEY, BUCKS COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA: I feel that we bought ourself a little bit of time in charging Mr. DiNardo with the stolen car case today and getting that $5 million bail. It is my hope that he does not post that but that's his prerogative, of course, if he can post it.</p><p>But we're going to start looking seriously at the homicide charges and, in fact, we already have pursued that option.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GINGRAS: A lot of work still be done. The district attorney says cadaver dogs helped to locate the remains, even 12-1/2 feet below ground under concrete.</p><p>The big question though, guys, is that investigators are still trying to figure out a motive, still trying to figure out how these guys are all connected. Two separate investigations going on on the property and also, again, just figuring out what happened here.</p><p>BRIGGS: Wow.</p><p>ROMANS: Sad story.</p><p>BRIGGS: More press conferences we expect today?</p><p>GINGRAS: Yes, we should get more news.</p><p>BRIGGS: Maybe some more information. Brynn, thanks so much.</p><p>ROMANS: All right. Internet companies, big and small, banning together to preserve net neutrality, Dave's favorite phrase.</p><p>BRIGGS: I hate that saying.</p><p>ROMANS: We'll tell you what it means, next.</p><p>[05:52:57] BRIGGS: Welcome back.</p><p>Scientists are examining the causes and effects of an enormous iceberg breaking away from the Antarctic Peninsula. The 2,200-square-mile floating block of ice represents one of the biggest such events ever recorded. It's getting global attention for its significance in climate change.</p><p>CNN's Kyung Lah has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KYUNG LAH, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A crack more than 120 miles long on the east side of the Antarctic Peninsula finally breaking off, creating a spectacular iceberg weighing more than a trillion metric tons, roughly the size of Delaware.</p><p>ARADHNA TRIPATI, UCLA PROFESSOR: It's one of the largest icebergs in human history.</p><p>LAH: UCLA professor Aradhna Tripati has spent her career studying Antarctic ice, traveling to the very peninsula where the ice shelf called Larsen C broke off.</p><p>Professor Tripati has seen two other big sections of the Peninsula break off and dissolve, the first in 1995 and then another in 2002.

The 57-page petition from the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, a branch of the U.S. Department of Commerce, requests that the FCC provide more concrete guardrails for when web platforms' moderation activities are considered overreaching. The petition specifically asks that the FCC extend transparency requirements that usually apply to internet service providers to websites.  \"The FCC should use its authorities to clarify ambiguities in Section 230 so as to make its interpretation appropriate to the current internet marketplace and provide clearer guidance to courts, platforms and users,\" the petition says.  Monday marked the 60th day since a White House executive order laid out plans to direct the FCC to consider whether it can crack down on perceived online censorship. In May, the Trump administration said it planned to ask the FCC within two months to examine its jurisdiction over platforms like Facebook and Twitter through the lens of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.  The provision's original purpose was to protect websites that use reasonable moderation practices from being held responsible for controversial content that users post. But in recent weeks, the Trump administration has characterized Section 230 as a bulwark that platforms can hide behind while censoring conservative views.  FCC Democratic Commissioners Jessica Rosenworcel and Geoffrey Starks said they believe online content issues fall outside of the FCC's jurisdiction, and legal insiders told Law360 that the FCC isn't obligated to act on the petition. Starks noted in a Monday evening statement that \"NTIA has not made the case that Congress gave the FCC any role here.\"  For his part, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai has been tight-lipped about whether he sees a path forward for the Trump administration's request. In a July 16 letter to four Republican members of Congress, he wrote that \"it would not be appropriate for me to weigh in on the merits of the petition before it is filed, but I can assure you that we will carefully review it.\"  In a Newsweek op-ed on Monday, however, one FCC commissioner made clear that he does see a role for his agency to play in reining in the perceived power over users that big tech platforms yield.  Republican FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr, who has been outspoken on the intersection of free speech and online platforms, wrote that \"conservatives should work towards change in three main areas: transparency, accountability and user empowerment.\"  He suggested it's important for regulators to open up the \"black box\" and examine why big tech platforms make certain decisions that feed into Google's search result rankings, Twitter's banned content and accounts and sees YouTube content creators stripped of their ability to make money on the site.  To curb this lack of transparency, Carr suggested the FCC could apply an element of its net neutrality deregulation to online platforms as well as internet service providers, which currently requires that ISPs \"provide detailed disclosures about any practices that would shape internet traffic \u2014 from blocking to prioritizing or discriminating against content.\"  Any behavior that goes against the ISPs' stated policies could be subject to enforcement actions from the Federal Trade Commission, a consumer watchdog.  \"The FCC and FTC should apply that same approach to Big Tech. This would ensure that all internet users, from entrepreneurs to small businesses, have the information they need to make informed choices,\" Carr wrote.  Carr's suggestion for provider transparency disclosures echoes language in the NTIA petition, which calls for mandatory disclosures \"for internet transparency similar to that required of other internet companies, such as broadband service providers.\"  A Senate Commerce subcommittee is on track to lead a broader discussion on Section 230 reform on Tuesday morning, including four witnesses that represent free speech advocates, big tech platforms and academia. The discussion will center, in part, on \"ways to ensure platforms are accountable for their content moderation practices,\" the committee said.  --Editing by Nicole Bleier.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42702373785</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60FW-YM61-F07F-82C8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"784\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Law360</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 28, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NATIONAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS &amp;

He wasn't a fan of John McCain. While that was running you were going, why? Why?</p><p>FINNEY: Because that's -- he's dead. I mean, my God, have some respect. And also that clip of Meghan McCain, having grieved my own father for the last three years, I can't imagine the pain that it must cause her every single time, and I can't imagine (AUDIO GAP).</p><p>And, yes, there's no -- as much as he's telling us to move on from the Mueller report, you want to say, why don't you move on. I can't imagine having worked for presidents and senators and all kinds of people having to work for someone who is so thin-skinned you would dare to try to ask the military to move a ship? I mean, it's insane. And as you pointed out, he took another jab at him when he really didn't even need to.</p><p>TAPPER: He took another jab at him. This one subtle, when he put out a tweet mourning the loss -- the death of Senator Thad Cochran who died earlier today. He tweeted: Very sad to hear the news on the passing of my friend, Senator Thad Cochran. He was a real senator with incredible values. Even flew back to Senate from Mississippi for important health care vote when he was desperately ill. Thad never let my country or me down.</p><p>Unmistakable that he's suggesting there that Senator John McCain did let the country and him down with a different vote on health care.</p><p>Why do you think McCain bothers him so much? Do you agree with Meghan McCain's assessment that it's because he knows he can never be like John McCain?</p><p>BILL KRISTOL, DIRECTOR, DEFENDEING DEMOCRACY TOGETHER: Yes. Could never have the respect John McCain had. The narcissism is extraordinary about the tweet about Thad Cochran. He never let the country or, parenths, or me, close parenths.</p><p>TAPPER: Right.</p><p>KRISTOL: What does he have to do? What does Trump had to do? Thad Cochran was a senator for what? Thirty-five years or something like that. Trump was president for the last two years of Cochran's being a senator. It has nothing to do with Trump. He can't just have a nice tweet saying thank you for your service and after he dies and he has to bring himself into it.</p><p>But it does turn out that Trump is very easily triggered. He's more easily triggered than some undergraduate at Overland (ph) or something -- no offense to the huge number of CNN viewers went to Overland.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TAPPER: The move of his staffers to move the ship or whatever they wanted to do to hide the ship is part of a larger pattern. \"The New York Times\" reported that Mick Mulvaney, acting chief of staff told them not to discuss the Russia probe in front of the president to avoid working them up. \"Politico\" detailed how aides try to make sure Trump only has access to positive newspaper articles.</p><p>I mean, they really try to shield him. I mean, the presidency is a bubble no matter what. And you are surrounded by sycophants no matter what.</p><p>But this seems to be taking to a new level.</p><p>NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL REPORTER: Yes. I mean, the president has a fragile ego. I mean, he's deeply insecure. In terms of the John McCain thing, it does seem he's jealous of this man's accomplishment, his service to the country, his sacrifice.</p><p>The idea he could have escaped being a POW for so long if he was able to trade on his family name. He was able to do that. He declined to do that.</p><p>You obviously saw the president trade on his wealth and maybe family name in getting out of going to Vietnam. So, yes, but it is striking that there is sort of this bubble around the president, staffers who were paid by taxpayers whose job is to protect the president and kind of insulate him and protect the fragility of his ego. This was a really stunning story that I think a disturbing window into the president's psyche and just how insecure he is.</p><p>TAPPER: And that clip of him saying I prefer people who weren't captured, which is smearing not just senator McCain but all prisoners of war. That was 2015. That's four years later. It remains stunningly obscene that he said that.</p><p>HENDERSON: He said that in 1999 about John McCain in an interview with Dan Rather. So, this goes back awhile.</p><p>TAPPER: All right. Coming up, how one state is trying to use government regulations to shut down its only remaining legal abortion clinic.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>[16:38:45] TAPPER: In our national lead, Louisiana is the latest red state to pass a ban on almost all abortions. Last night, the state house in Baton Rouge sent to the governor a bill banning abortions as early as six weeks into a pregnancy, before many women would even know they're pregnant. Louisiana joining other conservative states such as Georgia which is now facing a blowback from two of the biggest production companies, Disney and Netflix, which are considering pulling their business if the state's abortion ban takes effect.</p><p>While in Missouri, a court battle is under way to keep the last legal and functioning abortion clinic in the state from closing tomorrow.</p><p>CNN's Alexandra Field reports now from St. Louis where abortion rights supporters are accusing the state government of weaponizing regulations to take away a right that the Supreme Court ruled on in 1973.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ALEXANDRA FIELD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Abortion rights protesters on the streets of Missouri as the state prepares to possibly lose its last remaining abortion clinic. The drama playing out today in court after Planned Parenthood filed a lawsuit against the state claiming Missouri has placed numerous medically irrelevant restrictions on abortion that have severely limited access and reduced the number of health centers.</p><p>Planned Parenthood's St. Louis clinic, the state's only abortion clinic, is asking a judge to allow it to keep performing abortions.</p><p>[16:40:06] Its license expires tomorrow.</p><p>DR. DAVID EISENBERG, DIRECTOR OF ST. LOUISPLANNED PARENTHOOD: The state has effectively weaponized the regulatory system within the state to regulate abortion out of existence.</p><p>FIELD: The state says it hasn't renewed the license because of an investigation into some of the clinic's medical records.</p><p>GOV. MIKE PARSON (R-MO): Planned Parenthood has until Friday to comply with state law in order to receive its renewal license. No one is receiving special treatment.</p><p>FIELD: This court battle comes a week after Governor Mike Parsons signed a new law ban abortions after eight weeks without exception for rape or incest.</p><p>PARSON: We have the opportunity to be one of the strongest pro-life states in the country.</p><p>FIELD: Missouri following in the footsteps of several states that have recently passed some kind of abortion ban. The latest, Louisiana, which just last night passed a law stricter than Missouri's. And the state's Democratic governor plans to sign it.</p><p>GOV. JOHN BEL EDWARDS (D), LOUISIANA: We will continue to fight for the next generation of Louisianans.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FIELD: Jake, none of those new laws has gone into effect yet. They're all likely to face legal challenges. As for the court battle unfolding right here in Missouri, well, Planned Parenthood says they are expecting a decision from the judge by some time tomorrow before the license to operate that clinic expires at the end of the day.</p><p>No matter what happens, though, Jake, Planned Parenthood will continue to provide all of the other services that the women who go there have come to count on.</p><p>TAPPER: Alexandra Field in St. Louis, Missouri, thank you so much.</p><p>In our 2020 lead, Elizabeth Warren's six-word mantra that may now be paying off with voters.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>[16:45:00] JAKE TAPPER, CNN HOST: In our \"2020 LEAD\" today. Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren has released far more policy proposals than any of her opponents. She will be visiting her 20th state on the campaign trail next week and today she's making a barrage of media appearances pushing her new childcare cost calculator. CNN's Jeff Zeleny now looks at the question about whether Warren strategy is paying off.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JEFF ZELENY, CNN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Elizabeth Warren is getting results by grinding it out. More often than not these days she's driving the conversation in the Democratic presidential race.</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: If he were anyone other than President of the United States, he would be in handcuffs.</p><p>ZELENY: She's been out front on impeachment.</p><p>WARREN: It's not politics. There are some issues that are bigger than political convenience and this is one of them. You know, my view is make everybody vote.</p><p>ZELENY: And a host of policy ideas like a new childcare cost calculator. WARREN: Put in how many kids you have or even how you're planning to have and you can see how much money you will save under this plan.</p><p>ZELENY: The Massachusetts senator stock is rising from single digits in March to double digits now in some national polls. And she's been one of the few rivals willing to take on frontrunner Joe Biden even reigniting an old feud with the former vice president over bankruptcy laws.</p><p>WARREN: I got in that fight because they just didn't have any. And Joe Biden is on side of credit-card companies.</p><p>ZELENY: Since her formal announcement in February where she took the stage to Dolly Parton's working-class anthem 9:00 to 5:00, Warren has been working far longer than that, and she's putting on the miles already visiting 18 states and Puerto Rico. Her campaign stops are often policy addresses from the opioid scourge in West Virginia in Ohio to protecting public lands in Colorado and Utah.</p><p>She's headed to Indiana and Michigan next week to deliver an economic message which will put 20 states on Warren's map.</p><p>WARREN: I've got a plan for that.</p><p>ZELENY: Those six words have become a soundtrack of her candidacy. From proposing to break up big technology companies to forgiving most student loan debt. The campaign trail has become Warren's classroom explaining ideas like the professor she once was, promising to pay for all of these plans with a wealth tax.</p><p>WARREN: Do we think that the two cents should stay with the top one- tenth of one percent? They can't pitch in two cents on the 50 million and first dollar?</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ZELENY: Now, Warren's advisers have been tight-lipped about one of the biggest questions looming over her campaign. Can she raise enough money to sustain the expensive operation she's building in Iowa and other early voting states?</p><p>Now, Jake, Democrats we talked to say she is encroaching on Bernie Sanders in terms of supporters. Now her challenge is doing the same in fundraising. Jake?</p><p>TAPPER: All right, Jeff Zeleny, thanks so much. So let's take a look at the some of the policies Warren has proposed, student debt relief, free public higher education, breaking up big tech companies, universal health care. She's proposed this ultra-millionaire tax.</p><p>We are beginning to see an optic, a degree in the polls for her. Is it going to be enough and why haven't we seen -- she was I mean, unequivocally one of the biggest names running and she's really had a struggle but she's raising a little bit but rising a little bit but what's going on with her? KAREN FINNEY, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: You know what I think people like is she's actually talking about things that affect them instead of you know, we spent how much time talking about the President talking about himself. And I think people actually like to hear ideas about how their lives could be better. And then this idea -- this like saying I got a plan for that, people like that right.</p><p>And I think though -- she said from the beginning in her announcement, she said every race she's never run she kind of starts from behind and kind of just is like slow and steady wins the race and perhaps that's part of what we're seeing I here again.</p><p>[16:50:11] TAPPER: I got to say, I can't wait to see Warren and Biden debating some of these issues that they've been feuding about for years if not decades in the Democratic debates. It should be interesting.</p><p>BILL KRISTOL, EDITOR AT LARGE, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: I think the bankruptcy issue was a real issue. Biden knows the issue well because there are all these credit card companies in Delaware and he was the senior senator and he made the case for what they wanted. They had to put it to simply probably on bankruptcy and Warren led the opposition from outside the Senate I guess first, then in the Senate. So that would be an interesting debate. You should arrange for them both to be on the same stage.</p><p>NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, CNN SENIOR POLITICS REPORTER: I know.</p><p>KRISTOL: You can do this behind the scenes.</p><p>TAPPER: So much but only on MSNBC's debate. Nia, I want to ask you about a column you wrote today about Bernie Sanders sinking in the polls and how his ride or die supporters are fading because Warren does seem to be taking some of his supporters.</p><p>Now you wrote -- you talk to some of those voters and you found \"several people described their 2016 vote for Sanders is more of a protest ballot that they cast knowing the Clinton would likely be the nominee and they suggested in 2020 practicality would be much more of a factor.\" So is that why we see him going down.</p><p>HENDERSON: In some ways, yes. I think they are looking at practicality, they're looking at electability. Several of the folks I talked to a worried about what a Sanders in a general election would be. What would be the conversation he would need to have with voters in Rust Belt States about the socialism tag that you know that this President if he was to run against Bernie Sanders, it would be all about socialism.</p><p>So that was really interesting to hear, but it's also this idea that Bernie Sanders now has clones in the race, right. He has very much changed the conversation whether it comes to health care, whether it comes to student loan debt, so there are a lot of different choices now particularly somebody like Elizabeth Warren who has so many plans for so many different things. So they're shopping at this point. They're not dedicated to him in the way that they were before. TAPPER: And Michael, and there's somebody else going after Joe Biden. Cory Booker taking a very indirect swing at Biden today in a Huffington Post article attacking Biden's 1994 crime bill. He said, I sincerely love Joe Biden. Good people signed onto that bill, people make mistakes, but let's hold them to that. That crime bill was shameful what it did to black and brown communities like mine. What do you make of that?</p><p>MICHAEL WARREN, CNN POLITICAL REPORTER: It shows that Biden does have a weakness. He does have pretty good numbers across the Democratic field, but there are these issues whether that's credit cards, whether it's the crime bill. Biden has been around for so long he's -- the issues have changed. As the Democratic Party's positions on those issues have changed, he's found himself on every side of a lot of those issues. That's a problem for him.</p><p>TAPPER: All right, great. Everyone stick around. How a newly discovered hard drive could impact a major U.S. Supreme Court case. That's next.</p><p>[16:55:00] TAPPER: We have some breaking news this afternoon. Surprising new evidence surfaced publicly today that could possibly prove that raw partisan politics are behind the Trump administration's plan to add a controversial new question to the census on citizenship. Critics charge of the new question asking respondents if they are U.S. citizens was designed to discourage Hispanic councils from answering and being counted.</p><p>It's a key question because it's how the makeup of congressional districts are decided and it ultimately could benefit Republicans. CNN's Ariane de Vogue joins me now with the new evidence. Ariane, what was found?</p><p>ARIANE DE VOGUE, CNN SUPREME COURT REPORTER: Well, it was a new trove of documents found on a hard drive that critics say show that this decision was politically motivated, right. It came from a man who they say played a significant role. His name is Thomas Hoffler. He's since died but in 2015 he wrote a study. And in that study, he said that citizenship data could be advantageous to Republicans and non- Hispanic whites.</p><p>And keep in mind, the administration has all along argued that this information was important to comply with the Voting Rights Act. They always have pushed back that it was politically motivated. But now critics say this could be the first concrete evidence of the true motivation.</p><p>Remember, Jake, every lower court ruled against the administration here, but the Supreme Court heard arguments in April and this could be one of the biggest cases of the term.</p><p>TAPPER: So we're only weeks away from the Supreme Court ruling on this. How might it impact the vote? VOGUE: Well, what's interesting during that hearing it looked like -- and you never can be sure -- but it looked like it was going to be 5- 4. And the Liberal justices went hard at the motivation, what was behind this decision. That's what they cared about particularly Justice Kagan, Justice Sotomayor.</p><p>But the Conservative justices they didn't care as much about the motivation here, they cared about Secretary Ross' discretion in this area. Justice Kavanaugh said, doesn't he have wide discretion? And Chief Justice John Roberts said, look, the Voting Rights Act this kind of information is necessary, isn't it?</p><p>So if those five Conservatives don't care so much about the motivation behind this and they're just focusing on Secretary Ross' discretion, they may not at the end of the day care about this. But it certainly causes a wrinkle in a case that's already been argued and probably will be decided by the end of June.</p><p>TAPPER: All right, Ariane de Vogue, fascinating. Thank you so much. I really appreciate it. You can follow me on Facebook and Twitter @JAKETAPPER, you can tweet the show @THELEADCNN. Our coverage on CNN continues right now. Thanks for watching.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2019053002CNV40</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W7K-YD01-JB20-G1Y6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3045\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 30, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>PLANNED PARENTHOOD FEDERATION OF AMERICA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>John McCain</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>USS John S.

We are live. Good morning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Welcome back to EARLY START. I'm Christine Romans.</p><p>BERMAN: I'm John Berman. Thirty minutes past the hour right now, and this morning it does seems like it is a new-old <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>on the campaign trail. Right after his big win here in New York, Trump was more succinct, more refined, less nasty. Many wondered whether that was a version of Trump we would see on the campaign trail from now on.</p><p>But overnight, Trump held a big rally in Maryland and the clear answer was no, as you will see in a moment. Tonight Trump will be in Pennsylvania. This is all part of the mid-Atlanta war Acela primary next Tuesday, which is super in its own right.</p><p>CNN's Jim Acosta is with the Trump campaign in Maryland. He has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JIM ACOSTA, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: John and Christine, <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is back on the attack, laying into his archrival Ted Cruz and previewing the one-liners that were used to go after <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton. </nameText></person>Trump ditched the softer tone that was on display at his election night event in New York Tuesday night and adopted some of his toughest rhetoric yet.</p><p>The GOP front-runner suggested as president he will investigate Clinton's e-mail practices and return to the nickname he uses for Cruz. Here's what he had to say.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP </nameText></person>(R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I mean, honestly, do you think this happens with lyin' Ted Cruz, believe me. First of all, the crowd would be about 25 people. That would be a problem. Then they'd start falling asleep listening to this guy with the dramatics. We will fight. We will, oh please. Ay Yi Yi. Lyin' Ted Cruz -- you know, he walks in the bible held high, right? The bible held high. He puts it down, comes over here, starts ranting and raving, and he starts lying, right?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ACOSTA: Trump and his advisers are feeling much more confident about his chances to reach that magic number of delegates needed to clinch the nomination. In an internal memo obtained by CNN the campaign boldly predicts Trump could have 1,400 delegates by the start of the Republican convention in July. That is well ahead of the 1,237 he needs -- John and Christine.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROMANS: That dancing guy behind there is mesmerizing, I've got to tell you. All right, on the Democratic side, <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>also taking the momentum from her big New York win on the campaign trail to Pennsylvania. Less than a week before that state's primary Clinton is beating Sanders in a brand new poll by 13 points. Overnight, Clinton staged a big rally in Philadelphia and that's where we find Joe Johns.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOE JOHNS, CNN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: John and Christine, two stops for <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>here in Philadelphia after her big win in New York. The first at an African-American church -- an event on guns and violence featuring among others, mothers of victims along with former attorney general Eric Holder, a long-time supporter of <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton.</nameText></person></p><p>The second stop here at The Fillmore in Philadelphia, an organizing event. <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>talked among things about her connections to Pennsylvania, including the fact that her father is from Scranton. She also, once again, touched on that issue of guns and violence, which polls so well for her in urban areas.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>HILLARY CLINTON </nameText></person>(D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I read the news before I got here today. You had 12 shootings in Philadelphia over the weekend. Four people killed, a police officer shot. And the story that was just so heartbreaking was the father handling his gun and it went off and killed his 4-year-old daughter. Because of those 33,000 deaths -- we have homicides, we have suicides, and we have all these tragic avoidable accidents. So we have work to do to save lives.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHNS: A handful of African-American protestors after the fashion of the Black Lives Matters movement were seen in the room holding up signs and chanting. They were removed by police officers in plain clothes wearing armbands. They did not cause much disruption because the crowd noise in the room for <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>was so loud. John and Christine -- (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BERMAN: All right, joining us now to talk about the next Super Tuesday, the Acela Tuesday, and all the strategies at play, CNN politics managing editor Zach Wolfe. Good morning, Zach. Since we just finished with the Democrats, let's start with them. I think there's been a really interesting development overnight, and that's the question of what does <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders </nameText></person>do now? What does he want? How does he want to approach this campaign?</p><p>His campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, said that they are likely going to now work on switching superdelegates. Convincing superdelegates to switch from <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>to <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders </nameText></person>before the convention. We heard from MoveOn.org, though, overnight, which is a key group that has endorsed <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders </nameText></person>and worked to get <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders </nameText></person>elected.</p><p>[05:35:00] And that group now says that that's not a good idea, switching superdelegates. \"Superdelegates should not overrule the will of the Democratic grassroots,\" said the director of MoveOn.org from Washington. \"If the primary and caucus winner is <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton, </nameText></person>then Clinton should be the nominee.\" This shows the pressure that <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders </nameText></person>is under this morning.</p><p>ZACHARY WOLF, CNN POLITICS, MANAGING EDITOR: Yes, he's at a moment where he really does need to start thinking about the future of his campaign. What he's going to do there. The contests left, of course -- you talked about the Acela corridor primaries that are coming up next Tuesday. But then there are primaries out on the west coast. <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders </nameText></person>will potentially do better on those.</p><p>The days where he could have good nights are not over, but he can look at the end of the day and see it's not likely that he's going to be able to beat her numerically before the convention. So then, you havea grassroots candidate wondering what he should do if he doesn't have grassroots support at that point.</p><p>I mean, that MoveOn statement is pretty remarkable. It's basically getting to be decision time, so this is the point where we'll start to see what Sanders really wants to get out of this campaign.</p><p>ROMANS: It's just so remarkable. I mean, here we are heading into late April and we're still talking about whether people can get the number of delegates to get to the convention. It's just been a really crazy, interesting election year.</p><p>No question in primary season, no question -- and last night you had <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>on the eastern shore of Maryland having another town hall -- a big rally, frankly.And that new tone some of us thought you might see yesterday, no. He was really out there hitting his party hard, calling it a rigged system. Even, Zach, as he tries to play that game, he is criticizing the game. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Politics is a very dirty, dirty dishonest business, folks, and I've never seen anything like it. And we're running now for office and it's a rigged deal. This whole thing with delegates is rigged. It's a rig. Where I win Louisiana and I don't get as many delegates as some guy that lost?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: Now, if you're <person><nameText>Reince Priebus, </nameText></person>the chairman of the RNC, every day you're listening to your front-runner attack you and your process. <person><nameText>Reince Priebus </nameText></person>sat down with Jamie Gangel and had this really interesting conversation about where these two men are in this very public fight. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMIE GANGEL, CNN SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT: Are you conspiring against <person><nameText>Donald Trump?</nameText></person></p><p><person><nameText>REINCE PRIEBUS, </nameText></person>CHAIRMAN, RNC: Of course not, of course not. It's insanity.</p><p>GANGEL: Is there a plan to steal the nomination?</p><p>PRIEBUS: No, there's nothing to steal. Either you have the votes or you don't.</p><p>GANGEL: And you will be peace if he is the nominee.</p><p>PRIEBUS: I'm going to be at peace with whoever the nominee is because I know that whoever the nominee is is going to beat <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton.</nameText></person></p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: I've got to say, it was a pretty remarkable interview, Zach.</p><p>WOLF: It is, and from <person><nameText>Reince Priebus</nameText></person>' standpoint he might be being accused of a conspiracy, but looking at it from the outside it would not a very well-planned conspiracy. We have all these 50 states and six territories -- they all have different rules. It's not like there's one guy, <person><nameText>Reince Priebus, </nameText></person>who's writing all these rules and saying this is what's going to happen.</p><p>Wait until Pennsylvania this week where they vote, and most of the delegates there aren't required to vote for who the state supports. So, the rules are strange and getting stranger, and <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is going to have a lot to talk about in a week or two here.</p><p>BERMAN: Strange and getting stranger, election 2106. Zach Wolf, great to have you with us this morning. Thanks so much.</p><p>ROMANS: Nice to see you. Thanks for getting up so early. All right, <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders </nameText></person>outraised Hilary Clinton for the third straight month in March. New numbers filed with the Federal Election Commission show Sanders hauled in $44 million. Last month he spent most of that. His campaign had $17 million in cash on hand heading in April.</p><p><person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>raised $28 million and marched into the month with $29 million cash on hand. The Pro-Hillary Super PAC also raked in more than $11 million. It's already preparing for the general election, buying tens of millions of dollars of T.V. ad space ahead of time.</p><p>Ted Cruz raised $12.4 million, John Kasich $4.4 million, his best month so far after winning the Ohio primary. <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>collected $2.7 million and lent himself another $11.5 million. Trump also loaned himself more than $35 million for his campaign so far. He outspent both his rivals in March.</p><p>BERMAN: And there are reports that he's willing to spend $20 million more between now and the end of the primaries.</p><p>ROMANS: The numbers are crazy. Yesterday, I was looking at these T.V. ad spending numbers. There's half a billion dollars all month almost on ad spending so far this election cycle. About $100 million is negative ads against the front-runners.</p><p>BERMAN: Good for the economy.</p><p>ROMANS: Yes.</p><p>BERMAN: Criminal charges filed in the Flint water crisis and more could be coming. That's next.</p><p>[07:44:00] BERMAN: Three government employees were the first to face criminal charges in connection with the Flint water contamination crisis. Two members of the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality and one Flint city worker are facing felony and misdemeanor charges that could lead to jail time. The state attorney general says this is only the beginning.</p><p>Let's get more from CNN's Sara Ganim in Flint.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SARA GANIM, CNN CORRESPONDENT: John and Christine, after 18 months of residents here being called liars and complainers about their water, this was a significant day for the people of Flint. Officials of the state Department of Environmental Quality, Steven Bush and Mike Prysby, now facing charges of official misconduct, tampering with evidence, and violation of the state's drinking water act.</p><p>Prosecutors say they deliberately failed to treat the water properly, leading to high lead levels, bacteria, and disease. In addition, a city official who worked at the water plant has also been charged with tampering with evidence and neglect. Mike Glasgow talked to me last month in his first sit-down interview. He told me that the tried to do the right thing, but says Bush and Prysby convinced him to change a crucial water quality report in January of 2015.</p><p>[05:45:00]</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GANIM: So, you changed the report with the lead numbers in Flint residences. Did you do that to try to cover up what was happening? MIKE GLASGOW, CITY OF FLINT EMPLOYEE: No, I only did it because I was instructed to.</p><p>GANIM: Did you ever argue with them on whether or not you should change it?</p><p>GLASGOW: No, I just asked the question why and they cited some, I guess, solidified reasoning to remove a couple of items so I didn't question it much further.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GAMIN: Glasgow told me he believed he was changing the report for technical reasons. He thought it was because some homes only had partial lead piping. He says he didn't feel he had the power to overrule their decision, but prosecutors say that simply isn't enough. Even comparing his defense to Nazi war criminals.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That defense didn't work in several places when you're ordered to do something, right? Nuremberg and the like. That's a tough, tough situation with regards to Mr. Glasgow, but when you did a criminal act, an overt act, and you had the corrupt mind to do that act, you're going to be charged.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GANIM: Now, Steven Bush and Mike Prysby were both arraigned today and pleaded not guilty to the charges against them. Mike Glasgow has yet to be arraigned. It's important to note that there are many state officials above these three men who made significant decisions over the course of this crisis. Prosecutors saying that they're not done. Their investigation continues. They expect more charges to be filed and they say they are ruling no one out, not even the governor -- John and Christine.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROMANS: And Sara, I know you'll be following that for us as you have been. Let's take a look at what's coming up on \"NEW DAY\" this morning. Michaela Pereira joins us this morning. Hi, Michaela.</p><p>BERMAN: We've got to talk to Michaela while we can.</p><p>MICHAELA PEREIRA, CNN ANCHOR, \"NEW DAY\": You have a week and a day, John Berman, Christine.</p><p>ROMANS: I refuse to --</p><p>PEREIRA: Are you both in denial?</p><p>ROMANS: I can't even recognize --</p><p>PEREIRA: Are you currently residing in a state of denial?</p><p>ROMANS: Yes.</p><p>PEREIRA: It's OK. Let me tell you what's happening on our show today on \"NEW DAY\". <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>returning to form, unloading on Ted Cruz and <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>a day after his landslide victory in New York. Cruz, for his part, dismissing the Trump win, saying it's clear the Republican race will be decided at a contested convention. We have an exclusive interview with RNC chief, <person><nameText>Reince Priebus, </nameText></person>about the delegate drama.</p><p>Meanwhile, <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>is looking to seal the deal with another big showing in next week's Super Tuesday primaries in the northeast. However, <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders </nameText></person>says he plans to fight on. Fight on to the Democratic convention. We are going to hear from both campaigns about what is in store.</p><p>ROMANS: All right, Michaela. Nice to see you. We'll talk to you again very, very soon.</p><p>PEREIRA: You got it.</p><p>ROMANS: People might know why we're crying. She's going to get a big fancy show of her own in just a few weeks on HLN.</p><p>BERMAN: She's leaving us. She dumped us.</p><p>ROMANS: All right, unloyal. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closing in on a major milestone. Folks, if you haven't been watching your 401K, I have some good news for you. An early start on your money next.</p><p>Facebook wants to be more compassionate and empathetic. It wants to help you deal with your latest breakup. But how does a tech giant program feelings? Laurie Segall sits down with Facebooks V.P. of growth.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LAURIE SEGALL, CNN SENIOR TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT: With more than 20 percent of the world's population on Facebook, there's a new question the multi-billion dollar tech company is asking themselves. How do you make text more human?</p><p>ALEX SCHULTZ, VICE PRESIDENT OF GROWTH, FACEBOOK: We're trying to build more compassionate products.</p><p>SEGALL: Alex Schultz is Facebook's vice president of growth. His team's goal is to help code compassion. They're behind a new Facebook feature you've likely seen, reactions.</p><p>SCHULTZ: The reactions product is our response to having a dislike button. You can show someone a heart if you really love something. There's a little sad face if it's a sad memory where you can show your support.</p><p>SEGALL: Facebook is also trying to use algorithms to make your breakup a little less pain in the digital era. Historically, anyone who's gone through a breakup goes on Facebook, and I was like oh, I don't want to see this person but I might not be ready to let him go.</p><p>KELLY WINTER, FACEBOOK: So you can still stay friends but you won't see their posts in your newsfeed. The second one is where you can say I don't want this person to see anything that I post.</p><p>SEGALL: Despite all these initiatives it's hard not to see technology, like Facebook, as standing in the way of real-world relationships. Is technology making us a little bit less empathetic?</p><p>SCHULTZ: I actually think it's quite the reverse. I came to Silicon Valley 10 years ago and I'm gay, and when I came out there was an interesting group of people who I expected to be homophobic who were actually really supportive. And the reason they changed their mind was because they'd seen enough of my life that they could actually have empathy for me and see that their point of view on being homophobic was not right.</p><p>We've allowed people to connect more and I really believe that actually drives empathy. It doesn't bring us further apart. It doesn't make us colder.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>[05:54:00] BERMAN: All right, just moments ago the high priestess did what she had to do. The first stop -- the first key ritual on the road to the Olympic games. The Olympic torch lit in Olympia in Greece.</p><p>Our Atika Shubert was there to see it all. Atika --</p><p>ATIKA SHUBERT, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: That's right. A round of applause from the crowd as she lit the Olympic flame with a concave mirror, using the light of the sun's rays to do that. Now what she's going to do is move across and light the Olympic torch. But before she does that she's going to snip off a piece of olive branch, and this is symbolic of peace, victory, and honor.</p><p>Then she's going to light the first runner for the Olympic torch and he's going to begin what will be a 6-day relay across Greece with a stop at a refugee camp, actually, where a Syrian refugee is also likely to run with the torch. And then on April 27th it will be handed over to the Rio 2016 organizing committee and they will bring the Olympic torch to Brazil.</p><p>So, with this ceremony now going on it basically starts that whole process -- that whole ritual that begins the Olympic Games, John.</p><p>BERMAN: And you will see that torch moving across the world starting now. All right, Atika Shubert in Olympia. A beautiful ceremony to see there. Thanks so much.</p><p>ROMANS: All right, let's get an early start on your money this Thursday morning. Dow futures up slightly, oil a little change but it had a big gain yesterday. There, you can see stocks markets in Europe are lower. Asia closing mostly higher overnight.</p><p>The Dow hit a record high way back in May of last year, 18,351. And almost exactly a year later, only 255 points away from that high right now. An incredible run from the bottom in February when I sank below 16,000.</p><p><person><nameText>Bernie Sanders </nameText></person>is apparently the favorite candidate of Silicon Valley, at least if you go by the campaign donations. Four of Sanders' top five biggest donor groups are employees of the big tech firms. Sanders raised more than $250,000 from employees at Google's parent company, Alphabet. He's pulled in $95,000 from workers at Microsoft, $85,000 from employees at Apple. Another $63,000 from people who work at Amazon.</p><p>This is according to the Center for Responsive Politics. No other candidate, on either side, has a single Silicon Valley company in their total top 10 donor groups.</p><p>It could be a hot spring for the housing market. Existing home sales jumped 5.1 percent in March after a little slump in February. Economists say that drop was due to simply lack of affordability. People couldn't find homes they wanted for sale in their price range. The median sale price nationwide now $222,700. That's up 5.7 percent over the past year. Good luck trying to find that median home price on either coast.</p><p>Mortgage rates still historically low. That should help move properties during the busy spring and summer buying season. Demand is strong. Inventory is lower. But as prices keep ticking higher in most major markets more people could list their properties and help meet that demand. How's the housing market where you live?</p><p>BERMAN: There are houses on the market. There is inventory, to be sure.</p><p>ROMANS: Yes, rates are very low but people aren't really finding what they want, I guess, in the price range.</p><p>BERMAN: All right, the candidates in the race for president, they are in new states with new strategies. Can the front-runners stay out in front? \"NEW DAY\" starts right now.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I made a decision not to run for president.</p><p>TRUMP: Lyin' Ted lies. Oh, he lies.</p><p>SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is not getting to 1,237. Nobody's getting to 1,237.</p><p>TRUMP: It's a rigged system.</p><p>CRUZ: Donald, right now, is terrified.</p><p>GOV. JOHN KASICH (R-OH), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: If we pick these two guys are going to get creamed.</p><p>TRUMP: Hillary, you're fired.</p><p>CLINTON: They want to turn the clock back on every right we have.</p><p>SEN. <person><nameText>BERNIE SANDERS </nameText></person>(I-VT), DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Don't tell me that we cannot transform this country.</p><p>CLINTON: It's not enough to diagnose the problem. You've got to know how to solve the problem.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The troubled state of U.S.-Saudi relations.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We have some critical, critical things we need to work out.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The Saudi government has nothing to hide.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANNOUNCER: This is NEW DAY with Chris Cuomo, Alisyn Camerota, and Michaela Pereira.</p><p>CHRIS CUOMO, CNN ANCHOR: Good morning. Welcome to your new day. It's Thursday, April 21st, 6:00 in the east.</p><p>PEREIRA: Who's the cute blonde?</p><p>CUOMO: Alisyn is off. She's in Italy.

Same time every day. It's weird. It's very weird.</p><p>KEILAR: Strange.</p><p>CUOMO: Up first, <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>back at it again. The Republican front-runner back to his taunting rhetoric -- crooked Hillary, lyin' Ted -- just hours after sounding more presidential. His closest rival, Sen. Ted Cruz, declaring to fight for the GOP nomination, definitely going to a contested convention. This, as Cruz and John Kasich try to woo RNC members at the party's spring meeting in Florida.</p><p>KEILAR: And on the Democratic side, <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>looking to seal the deal in next Tuesday's northeast primaries. <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders</nameText></person>' campaign is at a crossroads, back on the campaign trail today after a day of recharging in Vermont. Sanders vowing to keep fighting all the way to the convention. We've got the 2016 race covered only the way that CNN can. Let's begin now with Jason Carroll -- Jason.</p><p>JASON CARROLL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well Brianna, it could be said Trump was just being himself. Trump touching on some familiar scenes last night.

Another way of putting it: the President needs to bring in temps now that his plan to cheat Federal workers out of their promised 2019 pay raise fell apart.</p><p><br/> This latest assault on Federal employees by the White House comes in the form of a meeting held Monday between lawmakers and representatives from several technology companies. According to a report from The Washington Post, the purpose of the gathering was to convince big tech bosses to come up with policies making it easier for employees to take a leave of absence to temporarily work for the government.<br/> According to The Post, White House deputy chief of staff for policy coordination Christopher Liddell said:<br/> The country benefits when patriotic citizens with technical expertise choose to serve at the federal, state or local level.<br/> This statement indicates the Trump administration is framing this as a voluntary civic duty, like picking up litter or voting. But is it really patriotic? Let's take a deeper look<br/> On President Donald Trump's third day in office he signed an executive order freezing pay for Federal employees. It's the kind of move you expect from a new CEO taking the reigns of a company running in the red. Unfortunately, as the President's learned in the time since, the US isn't a business.<br/> It's part business, of course. Capitalism is a large part of what the US is made of, but it's not the entire recipe. So the President's plan, which we assume was simply to get a handle on spending, was effective from a fiscal standpoint (think in terms of quarterly reports). And the move likely motivated lawmakers to consider the country's budgetary concerns under Trump differently, which is a political win.<br/> But, there's an important distinction between the US government and a corporation. Just like the difference between angels and humans - in the Christian bible - only the latter has free will.<br/> If your company makes vodka with your name on it, for example, and your business acumen has led you to a point where you can no longer afford to make vodka with your name on it, you can pivot to another endeavor - like creating a university with your name on it.<br/> In the business world, the only thing holding you back is your imagination - some would argue this is especially true when it comes to dealing with government regulations.<br/> Because, if businesses are the free-willed humans in this analogy, then government represents the angels beholden to the will of their master: in this case, instead of God, the US Constitution.<br/> We can try to run the country like a business, but at the end of the day there are certain protections the people have in place which require the government to spend money, even if it doesn't turn a profit. Just because the President finds a loophole, or a way around spending money on certain budget line-items, it doesn't mean he's doing our nation any favors.<br/> President Trump has a lot of wiggle room when it comes to the machinations of government, but he also has to contend with Federal hiring and pay practices that have evolved over centuries. And, while it may not be a law, he also has an obligation to ensure the government keeps certain promises it's made to one of its most vulnerable populations: veterans. It'll hurt veterans<br/> There have been times throughout our nation's history when the popularity of veterans in the public eye has waxed and waned. Vets who served during the Vietnam conflict, for example, were ostracized by the public in many areas of the country. And there remains a stigma surrounding combat veterans: many people aren't comfortable hiring someone who has been exposed to war for fear we'll \"snap.\"<br/> The US government, however, disproportionately hires military veterans because it's promised to do so. We're told from the earliest days of our basic training that our service will always be remembered and honored by our leaders, and that we'll receive support when its time to reenter the civilian workforce.<br/> Veterans make up more than 30 percent of the Federal workforce. And the Department of Defense employs more US veterans than any other entity, government or civilian, in the world. So, it's not an exaggeration to say that any policies which affect Federal workers directly affect veterans today, and the future prospects for military service members currently on active duty or in the reserves. Who benefits?<br/> Borrowing people from Amazon, Google, or Microsoft is a tourniquet, not a solution. Especially considering that the most important question may be whether these temp workers are going to have access to classified information.<br/> This is an incredibly important question. If the answer is \"no\" it's obvious this is an attempt to package lowered pay for Federal workers (and less jobs for veterans) as patriotic duty for high-payed tech experts. We already have computer experts working for the government. You don't need a Microsoft employee on site to perform Office upgrades or other similar technology endeavors, for example.<br/> This wouldn't be any different than threatening to replace workers with robots. The result is the same: people who rely on these jobs won't be doing them. Instead, someone who has already won the job lottery by getting hired at one of the largest technology companies in the country gets the work.<br/> What if the answer is yes and it turns out these projects will involve classified information? Then we need to know who will pay for the lengthy background checks for the on-loan workers. Let's assume the government won't. Doing so would defeat the purpose of using temp workers instead of hiring a veteran or other qualified candidate from the job pool because it would cost more.<br/> That just leaves big tech to pay for those clearances. And that means there are going to be strings attached whether the government can see it or not. It's like inviting a fox into your hen house because it knows more about eggs than you.<br/> The bottom line is that the White House needs to keep its promises, and protect our interests, even if that means it'll have to find other ways to pay for Trump's tax cuts.<br/> Bringing in experts on loan, instead of properly staffing the Federal government, won't fix the gaping holes that already exist in this administration's science and technology departments. But it will hurt veterans.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITNEXT-n10710943</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITNEXT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TJY-1801-JBYT-H0JH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">410719</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1075\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>IT Next</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 24, 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS517311 WIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>GHC (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>Relations With Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwNzQwQkYzMTI5NEFCMTkyMDM3QzFCNzE2MUE4MUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N551112MM</classCode><className>HOLDING COMPANIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000303</classCode><className>CIVIL SERVICES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921100MM</classCode><className>US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkM1MTYwRDE0NkJBNEVFMEIxQjM3RUE2NDRFQUFEODY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA</classCode><className>Federal Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DNV7</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001813</classCode><className>WAGES &amp;

Another way of putting it: the President needs to bring in temps now that his plan to cheat Federal workers out of their promised 2019 pay raise fell apart[1]. This latest assault on Federal employees by the White House comes in the form of a meeting held Monday between lawmakers and representatives from several technology companies. According to a report[2] fromThe Washington Post, the purpose of the gathering was to convince big tech bosses to come up with policies making it easier for employees to take a leave of absence to temporarily work for the government.According to The Post,White House deputy chief of staff for policy coordination Christopher Liddellsaid: The country benefits when patriotic citizens with technical expertise choose to serve at the federal, state or local level. This statement indicates the Trump[3] administration is framing this as a voluntary civic duty, like picking up litter or voting. </p><p>But is it really patriotic?Let's take a deeper lookOn President Donald Trump's third day in office he signed[4] an executive order freezing pay for Federal employees. It's the kind of move you expect from a new CEO taking the reigns of a company running in the red. Unfortunately, as the President's learned in the time since, the US isn't a business. It's part business, of course. Capitalism is a large part of what the US is made of, but it's not the entire recipe. So the President's plan, which we assume was simply to get a handle on spending, was effective from a fiscal standpoint (think in terms of quarterly reports). And the move likely motivated lawmakers to consider the country's budgetary concerns under Trump differently, which is a political win. But, there's an important distinction between the US government and a corporation. Just like the difference between angels and humans - in the Christian bible - only the latter has free will. If your company makes vodka with your name on it, for example, and your business acumen[5] has led you to a point where you can no longer afford to make vodka with your name on it, you can pivot to another endeavor \u2014 like creating a university with your name on it. In the business world, the only thing holding you back is your imagination - some would argue this is especially true when it comes to dealing with government regulations. Because, ifbusinesses are the free-willedhumans in this analogy, then government represents the angels beholden to the will of their master: in this case, instead of God, the US Constitution. We can try to run the country like a business, but at the end of the day there are certain protections the people have in place which require the government to spend money, even if it doesn't turn a profit. Just because the President finds a loophole, or a way around spending money on certain budget line-items, it doesn't mean he's doing our nation any favors. President Trump has a lot of wiggle room when it comes to the machinations of government, but he also has to contend with Federal hiring and pay practices that have evolved over centuries. And, while it may not be a law, he also has an obligation to ensure the government keeps certain promises it's made to one of its most vulnerable populations: veterans.It'll hurt veteransThere have been times throughout our nation's history when the popularity of veterans in the public eye has waxed and waned. Vets who served during the Vietnam conflict, for example, were ostracized by the public in many areas of the country. And there remains a stigma surrounding combat veterans: many people aren't comfortable hiring someone who has been exposed to war for fear we'll 'snap.' The US government, however, disproportionately hires[6] military veterans because it's promised to do so. We're told from the earliest days of our basic training that our service will always be remembered and honored by our leaders, and that we'll receive support when its time to reenter the civilian workforce. Veterans make up more than 30 percent of the Federal workforce. And the Department of Defense[7] employs more US veterans than any other entity, government or civilian, in the world. So, it's not an exaggeration to say that any policies which affect Federal workers directly affect veterans today, and the future prospects for military service members currently on active duty or in the reserves.Who benefits?Borrowing people from Amazon, Google, or Microsoft is a tourniquet, not a solution. Especially considering that the most important question may be whether these temp workers are going to have access toclassified information. This is an incredibly important question. If the answer is 'no' it's obvious this is an attempt to package lowered pay for Federal workers (and less jobs for veterans) as patriotic duty for high-payed tech experts. We already have computer experts working for the government. You don't need aMicrosoft employee on site to perform Office upgrades or other similar technology endeavors, for example. This wouldn't be any different than threatening to replace workers with robots. The result is the same: people who rely on these jobs won't be doing them. Instead, someone who has already won the job lottery by getting hired at one of the largest technology companies in the country gets the work. What if the answer is yes and it turns out these projects will involve classified information? Then we need to know who will pay for the lengthy background checks for the on-loan workers. Let's assume the government won't. Doing so would defeat the purpose of using temp workers instead of hiring a veteran or other qualified candidate from the job pool because it would cost more. That just leaves big tech to pay for those clearances. And that means there are going to be strings attached whether the government can see it or not. It's like inviting a fox into your hen house because it knows more about eggs than you. The bottom line is that the White House needs to keep its promises, and protect our interests, even if that means it'll have to find other ways to pay for Trump's tax cuts. Bringing in experts on loan, instead of properly staffing the Federal government, won't fix the gaping holes[8] that already exist in this administration's science and technology departments. But it will hurt veterans.

'It's inappropriate. Now, we have to take the people and do something, we have to do something, and we're really not very equipped as a government to be doing that kind of work.'According toDepartment of Housing and Urban Development data released in 2018[8], the national rate of homelessness has actually trended downward for the past decade.From 2007 to 2018, it dropped by 15%.However, major U.S. cities are indeed struggling with homelessness. According to point-in-time counts[9] of the homeless population conducted annually, San Francisco has seen a 17% increase in homelessness over the past two years, while Los Angeles saw a 16% jump within just the past year.A December 2018HUD report[10] showed that in New York City, homelessness increased nearly 3% from 2017 to 2018.Trump implied in his interview that he had solved homelessness in Washington, D.C., at the start of his presidency, but provided no evidence to support that claim.A May 2019 report[11] from the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments, a nonprofit organization of area leaders, counted nearly 10,000 homeless people in the city.

Trish Regan,  to you! </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TRISH REGAN, FBN HOST:  All right.  Thanks so much, Neil. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">President-Elect Donald Trump taking on government waste today, blasting  Boeing for wasting taxpayer dollars on a new presidential plane, Air Force  One. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I am Trish Regan.  Welcome everyone to \"The Intelligence Report\". </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The ultimate businessman putting Boeing on notice, calling for the  cancellation of the new Air Force One tweeting that Boeing costs are out of  control., he elaborated on that a short time ago to reporters.  Watch. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT-ELECT:  It's going to be over $4 billion.  It's  for Air Force One program.  And, I think it's ridiculous.  I think Boeing  is doing a little bit of a number.  We want Boeing to make a lot of money  but not that much money. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>REGAN:  All right.  We've got more on Trump's push to rein in government  spending and what it's going to mean for the likes of Boeing and other  companies.  You know, you think about some of these companies that have  been given blank checks for decades, things might change. </p><p>Now, amid the Boeing controversy, Mr. Trump is meeting with advisers today  at Trump Tower.  You're looking at a live picture coming into us right now,  a lot of people going in and out.  He's still searching for a Secretary of  State. </p><p>Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson met him at Trump Tower and remains a contender for  the job alongside Mitt Romney, Rudy Giuliani and a new one John Huntsman. </p><p>Former Ronald Reagan Attorney General, Edwin Meese, is here.  He's going to  going to join me in just a moment with his predictions for Trump's cabinet. </p><p>And on the other side, you've got the Democrats that seem to be spiraling  out of control here.  Right now they're poised to pick a radical, left-wing  extremist, Keith Ellison, to lead their party.  Has this party not learned  anything from the election? </p><p>The esteemed Alan Dershowitz is here with why the Democrats just don't get  it and why Ellison a man who has ties to the nation of Islam and the Muslim  brotherhood is about as bad as it can get for the Democratic Party. </p><p>But first, let's head out to Trump Tower.  Blake Burman is joining us right  now with the latest on the hunt for our Secretary of State.  Blake?  </p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS:  Hi there, Trish!  And it's been a busy one  here at Trump Tower, actually a first today you just talked about it a  little bit.  After the president-elect sent out that tweet saying that the  Air Force One order should be canceled.  He actually came down to the lobby  himself to speak with reporters, briefly talked about it saying that that  situation is out of control, in his words. </p><p>Most of the action now taking place upstairs in the tower as the interviews  continue and the one that is seeming to gain most of the attention is the  ExxonMobil CEO, Rex Tillerson.  He met with the president-elect.    Tillerson has already come and gone. </p><p>That Secretary of State search appears to be expanding the Trump transition  folks, though, when they were talking about it today, seemed to pump the  brakes at least on the notion or at least the thinking that many of the  people attached to the job are, indeed, interviewing for the job. </p><p>They also say that the president-elect likes to seek advice from many other  people that he speaks with and talks to here at Trump Tower. </p><p>By the way, Mr. Trump is set to leave the tower here in a couple hours.  He  will head to North Carolina for the second stop of what he is calling his  \"Thank You\" tour.  Trish back to you. </p><p>REGAN:  That's right.  We'll be watching, right here on Fox Business  tonight.  Thank you so much, Blake. </p><p>For more on the transition team, I am joined by Former Attorney General  under Ronald Reagan, Edwin Meese, and Tom Fitton, the President of Judicial  Watch.  Good to see both of you. </p><p>First of all, Mr. Meese, lots to talk about here today, but I'd like to  know what you think about as far of the appointments Donald Trump has made. </p><p>EDWIN MEESE, FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL UNDER REAGAN:  I think they've been  absolutely excellent.  I was particularly impressed with Jeff Sessions  being one of the first appointments.  I've known Jeff for a long time.  We  worked together in the Department of Justice when I was attorney general. </p><p>He was an outstanding attorney general of Alabama, he's been an outstanding  senator, and I can't think you could do better than Jeff Sessions.   Likewise I think all of the other appointments have been excellent as well.   Ms. Devos, Ben Carson, I could go down the list.  Every one of them has  just been first class, and I think America should be very proud of what Mr.  Trump has done so far. </p><p>REGAN:  Mr. Meese, do you anticipate a lot of pushback from Democrats?  I  mean, we're already hearing rumblings, there are a lot of folks out there  that are going to try and make life difficult anyway, but a lot of them  specifically are taking issue with Jeff Sessions.  What do you say to that? </p><p>MEESE:  Well, I would hope that the Democrats would rise above this  politicization.  You know, I wish they would treat the nominees by  President-Elect Trump the way the Republicans treated the nominees that  were put forth by President Obama.  And I think fairness would indicate  particularly with Jeff Sessions.  He's got an impeccable record. </p><p>And this phony idea that somehow there's something wrong with his views on  race are absolutely untrue.  We're totally disproved years ago, have  totally been proved by his record ever since. </p><p>REGAN:  What about Mitt Romney?  What are your thoughts on Mitt Romney? </p><p>MEESE:  Well, Mr. Romney is, has been a very good member of the Republican  Party.  I don't know enough about him, frankly, to really render an  opinion. </p><p>REGAN:  A lot of people feel like he hasn't exactly been loyal, perhaps  that's the understatement of the year, but, you know, he came out pretty  aggressively against Donald Trump in the weeks and days before that  election.  It's not clear that he even voted for him.  So some are  scratching their heads saying why on earth is this guy being considered for  the top job?  Do you think, Mr. Meese, there are better contenders there?   They're talking about Jon Huntsman, possibly Mr. Tillerson from Exxon, and  there some others on that list including Rudy Giuliani who's been there  from the beginning. </p><p>MEESE:  Well, and you've left out one that I think is one of the best  candidates, and that's John Bolton.  John Bolton worked with me in the  Justice Department.  He was outstanding.  He was the assistant attorney  general for Legislative Liaison.  He was the head of the civil division.   And I think he would be also and excellent prospect. </p><p>But, of course, it's really up to Mr. Trump on these issues, and I'm sure  he'll make as good a choice for Secretary's of States as he has done in the  other appointments. </p><p>REGAN:  I want to come back to you, Mr. Meese on Donald Trump, but let me  go to over Tom for a moment because I know that you were both involved  today in a panel called the First Hundred Days, the anti-corruption agenda. </p><p>You know, some of the things that I've heard and seen and witnessed over  the last several years and some of the things that have come out concerning  the potential pay-to-play scandal with the Clinton Foundation, Tom, have  been quite concerning.  How do we make sure that there is no corruption in  government?  How do we ensure transparency?  What are your ideas for that  right now in this new administration? </p><p>TOM FITTON, JUDICIAL WATCH PRESIDENT:  Well, it needs to be a priority of  the president, and it needs to be a priority of his appointees.  Jeff  Sessions is a rule of law guy, a law and order appointee.  I expect he'll  enforce the rule of law on immigration and matters like that on the Clinton  corruption issues.  They should consider a special prosecutor or in the  least get the thumb, the political thumb off the scales of justice.  Get  politics out of the Clinton investigation and let it go forward because  politics is preventing . </p><p>REGAN:  OK.  So you want to see this investigation continue, because  there's been sort of a hands-off approach, at least most recently, where it  doesn't seem as though we're going to see a whole lot in the way of an  investigation for Hillary Clinton and the foundation.  You want that to  change, Tom? </p><p>FITTON:  Yeah, I think it has to continue.  Mr. Trump promised that there  would be a serious investigation, and Jeff Sessions is, I think, the prime  candidate to make sure it's done.  And it's not doing anything unusual,  it's just allowing the FBI to do its job and getting the Justice Department  to stop obstructing the FBI investigation.  Supposedly, the Clinton  Foundation, the FBI can't get interviews, can't get subpoenas, can't get  grand juries.  That's out of the ordinary and its needs to stop. </p><p>REGAN:  And yet, Ed, you know, many feel like that's going backwards,  right?  There are so much that's got to be done.  We've got to get this  economy going again.  How do we deal with the Clinton Foundation if there's  some bad stuff there and, you know, there certainly some evidence that Tom  has been instrumental in bringing forward that suggests there could have  been some questionable ethics involved.  You know, you don't want to let  that go, but at the same time we've got a lot to do in terms of getting the  country back on its feet again.  Where do you come out, Ed? </p><p>MEESE:  Well, I think we ought to handle the Clinton Foundation  investigation like we would any other case, and that is that whatever  evidence is there that calls for the investigation and Tom has done an  excellent job and the judicial watch is just, it's amazing to me.  They've  gotten more information than either the federal government or the news  media, quite frankly, about what's going on in some of these conflicts and  some of these corruption cases. </p><p>REGAN:  Yeah.  They've been out in front of it, for sure. </p><p>MEESE:  So I think we got to follow the rule of law, have an honest,  legitimate, non-politicized investigation and then see where the chips fall  after all the facts are out. </p><p>REGAN:  All right.  Well, and I guess you're counting on Jeff Sessions to  do it.  Ed and Tom, thank you very much.  Good to have you guys here today,  appreciate it. </p><p>All right, on the other side of the aisle, you've got Vice President Joe  Biden saying he's running for president in 2020.  He's going to be 78.  I  mean, I'm no ageist or anything, but this guy has been around a while,  right?  So what it tells you?  Really, is that when it comes to the left,  they've got no new blood.  I mean, take a listen here, I want you to hear  party leader Nancy Pelosi who has led the Democratic caucus for the last 14  years.  Here she is way back when. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>NANCY PELOSI, HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:  Well, I don't think that people want  a new direction.  Our values unify us, and our values are about supporting  America's working families.  That is one that everyone is in agreement on. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>REGAN:  Actually, that was from just this past Sunday, but she's been  saying that over and over and over again.  I mean, that's been the whole  theme, right?  Working families?  But you know what, working families they  sure don't feel like they've been supported in the last eight years, which  is why the Democrats lost, isn't it? </p><p>Joining me right now, Washington Examiner Senior Political Columnist, Tim  Carney.  Tim, good to see you. </p><p>What's happening to the Democratic Party?  Where are the new faces?  </p><p>TIM CARNEY, WASHINGTON EXAMINER:  Well, they've known for a while that they  had a shallow bench.  That was one of the concerns coming into the 2016  election, and, in fact, they had trouble recruiting some good candidates.   But the consolation prize was going to be that for four or eight years they  had the White House.  They'd be able to build up a bench through cabinet  jobs, through just the power of the presidency.  Well, that's not there,  and now they're in the real trouble, and as Nancy Pelosi said, most  Democrats don't think they need a new direction, two thirds of the  congressional Democrats voted her for minority leader.  Most of the primary  voters voted Hillary Clinton to be the nominee, so they seem to be happy  continuing on the path that they're on which has led them to a minority. </p><p>REGAN:  To a certain extent, isn't this a kind of cronyism?  I mean the  fact that they put Clinton in the spot that she got when -- they had, by  the way, they like Sanders and I'm not socialist I'm no Sanders fan, but my  goodness, he really started to captivate people.  They had Joe Biden. </p><p>CARNEY:  Yeah. </p><p>REGAN:  . by the way who really, you know, and obviously, he went through a  personal tragedy, but he also suffered, of course, as a result of the party  saying, no, it's her time.  This is her opportunity, we're going to get the  first woman president, and, you know, the reality is she just isn't that  good a candidate. </p><p>CARNEY:  No, and she -- everybody knew that she was not going to be liked.   And if they're keeping Pelosi in there as well, to me it's a sign that  they're not actually that interested in building a majority that it's  protecting what they have going.  One way we put in an examiner editorials  maybe they elected Pelosi because they wanted to save space for liberals  there on Capitol Hill, that each space is not away to hear outside ideas,  it's what . </p><p>REGAN:  Yeah, no, and look . </p><p>CARNEY:  It's happening on College campuses and happening on the hill. </p><p>REGAN:  I hear you.  And she's from a very wealthy part of San Francisco, a  very wealthy woman herself, you know, in part family money there.  And I  think has grown increasingly distant from sort of the core Democratic voter  who may be out there in the Midwest and is dealing with the hard times of  jobs moving overseas. </p><p>And so, until you start to tap into that, you know what, you're going to  continue losing, and that's what we saw in this election cycle.  It looks  like they really aren't helping themselves as much either with the likes of  Keith Ellison which we're going to talk about in a minute. </p><p>Tim Carney, good to have you here, thank you very much. </p><p>All right, everyone, Donald Trump making good on his vow to take aim at  government waste, he's going after Boeing for what he calls out of control  spending on the new Air Force One plane.  Four billion dollars, is what  we're talking about, way too much, says Donald Trump.  Boeing is being put  on notice, watch. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  The plane is totally out of control.  It's going to be over $4  billion.  It's for Air Force One program.  And I think it's ridiculous. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>REGAN:  All right, you know, just this morning -- it was an interesting  morning I can tell you, the President-Elect Donald Trump was out there  criticizing a government contract with Boeing claiming it's going to cost  taxpayers $4 billion to build the next Air Force One plane.  Trump  originally tweeted that he would cancel the deal, and now he's doubling  down on his comments.  Take a listen to him just a short time ago at Trump  Tower. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  The plane is totally out of control.  It's going to be over $4  billion.  It's for Air Force One program and I think it's ridiculous.  I  think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number.  We want Boeing to make a  lot of money but not that much money. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>REGAN:  All right, this comes as new report say the State Department buried  information that exposed $125 billion in government waste.  According to  this study, the back office bureaucracy at the Pentagon is so overstaffed  that it has almost as many people working desk jobs as it does active duty  troops. </p><p>Joining me right now from Americans for Prosperity, the president of it,  Tim Phillips.  Good to see you, good to have you here. </p><p>TIM PHILLIPS, AMERICANS FOR PROSPERITY, PRESIDENT:  Good to be here. </p><p>REGAN:  How scared do you think Boeing is right now as a result of today's  movements? </p><p>PHILLIPS:  It's good to keep these contractors on their toes, right?  I  mean, these political leaders, Trump in this case, it's good to see we're  going to check every contract.  We're going to look at every dollar you  spent because it's taxpayer dollars.  I think it's a good thing.  And I  hope it gives pause to everyone out there doing business with the  government.  You've got stay within cost to do your job. </p><p>REGAN:  Well, I'll tell you, I don't think Boeing knows what to make of  this. </p><p>PHILLIPS:  Right. </p><p>REGAN:  They issued a statement today, let me just share it with the  viewers.  It's basically what you call a big old nothing statement.  I read  it and kind of laughed because they're not actually even addressing the  elephant in the room.  They say, \"We are currently under contract for $170  million to help determine the capability of these complex military aircraft  that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States,\"  and they go on to say, \"We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force  on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes  to the President, the best value of the American tax payer.\" </p><p>So they're basically saying, hey, guess what?  I mean we work for the  government, we're working on this plane, and we hope to give you the best  value.  But they, they don't really address what's at issue here which is  this concern that costs . </p><p>PHILLIPS:  Right. </p><p>REGAN:  . have gotten completely out of control.  You watch this, what are  some of the most egregious examples? </p><p>PHILLIPS:  Well, we have debt at $20 trillion, so it's across the board,  but it seems like contractors see the initial contract just as a starting  point for negotiation, right?  They get that authorization, maybe it's a  billion or two, and it starts skyrocketing.  We see this across the board  whether it's export-import bank which has gone dramatically over, over the  years or just bureaucracy after bureaucracy.  But it's good to hold these  guys accountable on the consistent basis to the original terms of the  contract.  In the private sector, that's what's happening, that's what  government should do. </p><p>REGAN:  You're Boeing.  Can we show shares of Boeing right now to the  viewer?  Let's take a look at the stock price it was down about 1 percent . </p><p>PHILLIPS:  Yeah. </p><p>REGAN:  . in the pre-market and was stumbling a bit throughout the margin  (ph) of the market has changed course, and we're now in positive territory  overall for the Dow. </p><p>Nonetheless, you see Boeing still trading off about a tenth of a percent.   You know, it used to be, basically, with these big government contracts it  always has been, you know, you kind of get free rein, you walk in near . </p><p>PHILLIPS:  Right. </p><p>REGAN:  . if you're Boeing, I mean who else is going to build Air Force  One? </p><p>PHILLIPS:  Right. </p><p>REGAN:  And so, you can almost charge whatever you want.  Have that  changed? </p><p>PHILLIPS:  Not enough.  Right now they're getting ready to have a lame duck  session wrap up.  They're going to have thousands of special interest  exemptions in the tax code for group after group whether it's bourbon  distillery folks or whether it's horse racing folks, they all get their  chunks because of the special interest groups that they pay for, basically.   And that's got to be stopped.  We need lower flatter rates across the  board, and when you actually get a government contract, it should be openly  bid on, and you  have to have live up to the terms of the original  contract. </p><p>REGAN:  Hey, let me quickly ask you, $125 billion . </p><p>PHILLIPS:  Yeah, and hidden away.  They buried this report $125 billion,  over just five years.  Internal report, they asked for it, they paid for  it.  Imagine, Trish, I'm going to say paid for this report.  And it looks  like they buried it, have it do anything about it because they're afraid  about . </p><p>REGAN:  Can you say, you say good for Trump on exposing all of this stuff,  what do you mean by that? </p><p>PHILLIPS:  I think that political officials, elected leaders, ought to be  willing to hold every single federal contractor accountable to stay within  cost.  The private sector does that, it's time the government does it, so  good for them in this regard. </p><p>REGAN:  This is what people liked about him, they like . </p><p>PHILLIPS:  Yeah. </p><p>REGAN:  . the idea that they were getting a businessman who would come to  office and say, look, let's get some accountability here.  Good to see you,  Tim. </p><p>PHILLIPS:  Absolutely. </p><p>REGAN:  thank you so much. </p><p>All right, Democrats seemingly poised to select Keith Ellison to lead the  DNC after Howard Dean drops out of the running.  OK, let me just make sure  I got this right because you've got a party that's been abandoned by white,  blue collar voters and in response it wants to appoint a radical and  extreme left-wing ideologue with ties to Louis Farrakhan?  Legal legend  Alan Dershowitz is in the house.  He says this is totally nuts, stay with  me.  See you here. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>REGAN:  Well, Democrats seem poised anyway at this point to pick a far-left  extremist for the DNC, Keith Ellison, a congressman from Minnesota.  He may  be heading out to the DNC now that Howard Dean has pulled out.  But after  the party was beaten badly and we're talking very badly at the polls and  lost of the support of white working class Americans, why on earth are they  after picking someone like Ellison?  I mean this is someone who at one time  supported and worked with the nation of Islam and Louis Farrakhan.  Here's  Farrakhan, the guy he was working alongside just a year ago blasting white  people.  Watch.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>LOUIS FARRAKHAN, NATION OF ISLAM, GROUP LEADER:  Everywhere the white man - - his nature drove him to kill.  Kill the brown.  Kill the red.  Kill the  yellow.  Kill my own white brother.  And kill the black and make sure that  the black never rise again. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>REGAN:  All right, joining me right now on the prospect of Ellison at the  DNC, famed legal scholar, Alan Dershowitz, the legend himself.  Good to say  you, good to have you here. </p><p>ALAN DERSHOWITZ, HARVARD LAW PROFESSOR:  Thank you, Trish. </p><p>REGAN:  You think this is crazy, right, to have somebody like Ellison? </p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  It's about the dumbest thing among many dumb things the  Democrats have done.  After losing white, middle class, working class  people in the Midwest, you're going to pick somebody who for nine years was  associated with a hate America, anti-American, anti-western person?  It's  just nuts.  And they're going to lose a lot of Democrats if they appoint  him. </p><p>REGAN:  They're trying to double down.   I mean they clearly were wrong in  their approach to this election which they, you know, still don't really  want to admit, because for some reason it's about women not supporting  women, et cetera, et cetera.  People just being misogynistic or this that  and the other, but do they just not want to admit it, Alan?  I mean, what's  going on here?  Why would you double down on the strategy that didn't work? </p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  Well, it's one thing to have lost this election because you  couldn't have anticipated how badly the Democrats could do in the Rust Belt  in the Midwest.  But now that you know that, you pick as leader of the  Democratic Party the worst possible person to bring them back. </p><p>If I were a Republican strategist and I would given the choice to pick the  head of the Democratic National Committee, I'd say pick Ellison.  He would  be great for the Republicans, and he's going to be great for the  Republicans.  Already high (inaudible), he was a major contributor to the  Democratic Party has said, essentially, don't count on me anymore.  He is  going to lose many, many Democrats.  He's going to lose many pro-Israel  Democrats, many pro-American Democrats.  Forget about Farrakhan's anti- semitism and the fact that this guy was part of that for years.  Do you  know what he said at one point to somebody when he was a student at the  Minnesota Law School? </p><p>REGAN:  Tell us. </p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  He said to somebody who was a woman and Jewish, I can have no  respect for you, this is Ellison saying this, not Farrakhan, I can have no  respect for you because you're Jewish and you're a woman.  And as a woman,  you shouldn't be working, you should be home, and . </p><p>REGAN:  Oh my goodness. </p><p>REGAN:  . this is a guy who bought into every negative aspect and now he's  a member of Congress, and his voting record is abominable.  He said Israel  shouldn't be financed to have the iron dome.  That protects Israeli  citizens from rocket attacks, from Gaza.  He voted against that.  He's one  of only eight senators who's voted against Israel . </p><p>REGAN:  More people speaking out?  Good for you, but why are more people  saying, my goodness, is this really where you want to take the party,  because it's going to disintegrate. </p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  It's not going to disintegrate.  It's going to do what's going  all over the world.  The left is moving far, far, far, far more to the  left.  It's going to turn the Democratic Party into the British Labour  Party.  The British Labour Party is headed by a guy named Corbin, and they  can't win an election to dogcatcher.  And now the Democrats are going to  have their, essentially, Corbin -- he's not as bad as Corbin, but he's  pretty darn bad as the head of the Democratic Party, and you're going to a  get a lot of centrists saying, I'm no longer Democrat, I'm not going to  register as Democrat, I'm not going to . </p><p>REGAN:  Listen, I meet them all the time here on the show, I mean I've meet  quite a few that liked what they heard from say  Joe Biden,, like what they  heard -- even from Bernie Sanders to a certain extent and they said, look,  I can't be part of this party anymore.  As I said, who would you, by the  way, put in Ellison's place? </p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  Well, Jennifer Granholm, with the former governor of Michigan,  who comes from that part of the country, who has tremendous appeal to  middle class people.  If Joe Biden would take it, he would be fantastic . </p><p>REGAN:  He may be running for president, Alan. </p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  But you gave me a list of a 1000 people, I'd put Ellison a  1001. </p><p>REGAN:  Yeah. </p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  He was the worst possible person at this point in the history  of the Democratic Party to pick.  And I hope the Democratic leaders will  come to their senses and say, all right, we put him out there, that was a  sap we sent to the Sanders, knees tease, to the hard left of the party, now  let's begin to think about how to win.  And you don't win with Ellison. </p><p>REGAN:  Hopefully, they're watching you right now, thank you so much. </p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  Thank you. </p><p>REGAN:  Alan, good to have you here. </p><p>All right, we're going to talk more about this very issue, Madonna's wing  and on the Trump victory blaming women for Hillary Clinton's defeat saying,  \"women hate women and that's why Clinton didn't win.\"  Well, you know what,  that's just wrong.  She thinks because you're female you've got to vote for  the female?  The Democrats keep missing this one, because I'm telling you,  the days of identity politics, they are over.  We've got more on it next. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>REGAN:  OK, we've got some breaking news for you right now.  Donald Trump  just moments ago came out there to the lobby of Trump Tower with some news.   Some news that the SoftBank group founder and CEO is going to be making a  big investment, roughly affiliate $50 billion in the United States, the  goal to create 50,000 jobs, Japanese company, he then sent a couple of  tweets.  He said Masa, which is SoftBank, of Japan has agreed to invest $50  billion in the U.S., towards businesses 50,000 new job.  And then he  tweeted this said, the company would never do this had we, meaning Trump,  not won the election. </p><p>With the very latest, I want to go to Blake Burman at Trump Tower.  A  little bit of surprise, there from Donald Trump there this afternoon.  I  understand he just spoke with some of you there in the lobby.  Tell us  about it. </p><p>BURMAN:  Yeah, just spoke with Masayoshi Son the CEO of SoftBank.  And put  it to him, Trish, point-blank, I said if Donald Trump were not the next  president of the United States.  Would you not have made this pledge, the  $50 billion and 50,000 jobs?  And he looked to me and he said that's right.   That is indeed the case.  I asked him how would these 50,000 jobs come  about are you just going to hire a bunch of folks or how is that come  about?  And he says, Son did that, they will invest in start-ups and that  will be the goal to create jobs from there on out.  He cited deregulation  as a reason for this investment, and he also said that business people are  energized.  That's one of the reasons why he has come to this. </p><p>He also told me the he approached the President-Elect Mr. Trump with this  pledge, I guess if that's the way you want to put it this commitment.  And  should also note, Trish, this is now the second time that Mr. Trump has  come to the lobby today to speak with reporters.  On the second occasion  now, pretty big announcement. </p><p>REGAN:  Pretty big and, you know, but -- them related to the economy,  related to business, you know, first obviously in the case of Boeing  basically saying, look, you know, $4 billion is too much . </p><p>BURMAN:  Right. </p><p>REGAN:  . for that plane.  And now here saying he's got a company a  Japanese company that's going to put some money into the U.S. and create  jobs.  So, look, it's good to hear people are looking for some kind of  reason to be optimistic about the economy right now, Blake? </p><p>BURMAN:  Yeah, absolutely that -- you know, that's a great connection to  put those two together with Boeing and now with this announcement from  SoftBank.  It is the first time we've heard from the president-elect here  in New York City speaking to the media.  So clearly, he thinks these are  two big issues that he wants to get his voice out off. </p><p>REGAN:  Business top of the agenda, the economy matters, jobs, jobs, jobs. </p><p>BURMAN:  Right. </p><p>REGAN:  Thank you so much Blake.  We'll keep checking in with you. </p><p>Turning right now to Democrats that are still up in arms over Donald  Trump's election, and Hollywood being forced to come to terms with the idea  that, you know what, no one really cares what they think. </p><p>Madonna tells one magazine that she feels like someone died.  It's like a  nightmare, she says, and she just can't believe Donald Trump is president.   But instead of blaming a terrible campaign in a flat candidate, guess what?   She's blaming women.  This is Madonna.  She says, \"Women hate women, that's  what I think this is.  Women's nature is not to support other women.  It's  really sad.  Men protect each other, and women protect their men and  children.\"  Really?  She lost because women hate women?  Are one on the  Democrats just going to get overall this identity politics, because I'll  tell you what the reality is, women are not bounds by just that.  They want  whoever, male or female, is best for their future and yes their children  and their husband's future.  It's not all about what gender you are.  And  the sooner the Democrats can realize that, the better off they'll be. </p><p>Anyway, joining me right now on the issue, we have Republican strategist,  Mercedes Schlapp, and Democratic strategist, Brian king.  Good to see you  guys. </p><p>BRIAN KING, DEMOCRAT STRATEGIST:  Hey. </p><p>REGAN:  You know, Mercedes, you are woman, you're Hispanic and you voted  for Donald Trump.  What is it that Madonna doesn't get about all your  identities there?  </p><p>MERCEDES SCHLAPP, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  And so did my mother and my aunt  and my sister and my sister-in-law, they all voted for Donald Trump.  Well  here's the thing, I think for Madonna she's expressing her inner Secretary  Madeleine Albright comment of those women that don't vote for Hillary  Clinton, how the special place in hell.  We need to remember that women are  not monolithic.  We vote and understand that there are issues that are  important to us.  And the Democrats have been stuck in the 1970s-1980s  politics of well it's about reproductive rights. </p><p>Well its not just about reproductive rights, it's about the economy, it's  about health care, it's about education for our families.  And I think that  when you compare the two candidates in this election, Donald Trump came out  with a very strong economic message for families for women that would boost  the economy.  And we're obviously starting to see this beginning to roll  out even before he has been sworn into office. </p><p>REGAN:  Yeah,  he made two economic announcements today.  One criticizing  some of the waste he sees at Boeings.  And the other that Japan is going to  make this big investment via SoftBank creating 50,000 new jobs.  And are  our Blake Burman spoke to the CEO of SoftBank who said, look, this is very  much tied to Donald Trump being there and I call them up they want to do  this because he's there and I see it as a more pro-business, less  regulatory heavy environment right now.  Brian. </p><p>KING:  Yes. </p><p>REGAN:  What do you think about your party, right now?  We just had Alan  Dershowitz on saying, you know, he's saying is well this stuff has end to.   I mean, they're going to put Keith Ellison as head of the DNC.  </p><p>KING:  Well as pretty this way, and I think Trish we're probably all in  agreement that what's amazing, you know, is actually Democrats that  understood back in 1992 that it's the economy, stupid.  And we knew that  and actually we kept winning elections when we said that.  And that really  is what this is about.  And I think, you know, we just saw that a news  update.  It's the economy stupid that's what we need to keep talking about  that's what the . </p><p>REGAN:  All right, but that's not what they're talking about, Mercedes,  right now ... </p><p>KING:  Right. </p><p>REGAN:  . it still identity politics, you know, as usual . </p><p>KING:  And here's what I think is this. </p><p>REGAN:  . and that Keith Ellison thing. </p><p>KING:  Here's what I think is so amusing which is, we haven't talked about  Madonna since what, 1982.  And so, here she comes like what on earth we're  talking about Madonna. </p><p>REGAN:  Maybe she's just trying to make herself relevant. </p><p>KING:  Right. </p><p>REGAN:  Maybe that is what this is about.  You know, she wants to sell a  few albums.  You go ahead Mercedes. </p><p>KING:  But quite frankly we should be talking more Springsteen if you want  to talk about the economy.  </p><p>REGAN:  Mercedes. </p><p>SCHLAPP:  But this is part of the problem I think with Hollywood and itself  and I would say a number of the Democrats is the fact that, that being  disconnected from the struggle of the American worker. </p><p>And so, I think when you bring back a Nancy Pelosi, for example, as leading  your party in the House where she's a San Francisco liberal, you know, not  necessarily understanding what's happening in the middle of the heart of  America where so many companies have left communities leaving individuals  and families devastated.  I think that's where the disconnect has happened  with the Democratic Party. </p><p>And what we've seen as a party move further to the left without necessarily  providing the economic solutions, and I think . </p><p>REGAN:  Yeah. </p><p>SCHLAPP:  . that's why Donald Trump has come in and said, look, I am not  the politician, I'm a businessman, I want to negotiate these deals, I want  to work with the parties to push forward a strong economic agenda. </p><p>REGAN:  It's really interesting to see and it's just going to get even more  interesting from here, Mercedes and Brian, thank you so much. </p><p>KING:  Thank you Trish. </p><p>SCHLAPP:  Thank you Trish. </p><p>REGAN:  All right, everyone, we got some web giants out there like Youtube,  Facebook, Twitter and Microsoft all bonding together right now today to  remove extremist contents and terrorist propaganda from their sites.  OK.   Sounds good.  But where they're then?  Right?  I mean why didn't they do  this a whole long time ago?  Could it be because Donald Trump is now in  office, about to be in office that these companies are suddenly trying to  clean up their acts?  We're on the story next. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>REGAN:  All right.  Let's check out this market which is now in positive  territory, again, market moving higher here. but fairly up 19 points, there  on the Dow.  S&amp;P also in the green as well.  The NASDAQ Composite Index to  get energy companies, however, struggling a bit more as the price of oil  really had lower today after a four day long rally, but still above that  key $50 level.  You see oil closing out the day just a moment ago. </p><p>All right, let's turn right now to the Supreme Court with deciding with  Samsung and its high-profile patent dispute with Apple over the design of  the iPhone.  The justices today throwing out nearly $400 million judgment  against Samsung.  The court said Samsung can't be forced to pay all the  profits because the copied parts are only a tiny fraction of the devices. </p><p>We are going to be right back.  And we're going to have a look at this  social media websites like Google, Microsoft that seemed to be willing to  finally step up to fight terror, what took so long? </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>REGAN:  Our news today that Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and Youtube are  all coming together to try to stop the spread of online terror.  They plan  on using a shared database that will catch potential terrorist activity and  remove it from their websites.  Hopefully also report it to the FBI. </p><p>Facebook released a statement today reading, \"We hope this collaboration  will lead to greater efficiency as we continue to enforce our policies to  help curb the pressing global issue of terrorist content online.\"  OK.   Good!  Right?  I guess the question here though is what the heck took them  so long? </p><p>Joining me right now we have Fox News Strategist Analyst, Colonel Ralph  Peters, and former Treasury Attach, for Saudi Arabia, Morgan Ortagus. </p><p>I know you guys have bolt pen all over this.  But none of us here on this  panel has ever understood why the social media companies have not been more  proactive.  Is this a sign of potentially more good things to come, Colonel  Peters?   </p><p>LT. COL. RALPH PETERS, (RET.) FOXS NEWS STRATEGIC ANALYST:  Well, let us  hope.  But I think it's easy explained why the tech companies have done  nothing, greed, raw greed at the expense of human lives.  They have  positioned themselves, marketed themselves as great benefactors of  humanity.  But the big tech companies, you know, Facebook, Google,  Microsoft, or Youtube, they have been the number one enabler of ISIS and  other terrorist groups.  And all ,by the way, let's not forget fake news  which result which has resulted in a gunman walking into a pizzeria in  Washington, D.C.</p><p>REGAN:  Yeah. </p><p>PETERS:  So, it's a long way -- they have a long way to go to make good.   They've got a lot of blood on their hands. </p><p>REGAN:  You know, one of the things I never kind of understood, Morgan, you  know, not my fault, not my problem.  You know, we can't entirely control  and we don't want to have to limit the communication between these people  to which I'd just say, you know, don't you have some kind of national duty?   You are American companies, you've gotten your start in this country and  all the benefits that come with that.  Don't you have an obligation to help  protect the citizens of the United States of America? </p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, FMR. STATE DEPARTMENT PRESS OFFICER:  Absolutely, Trish,  and I'm glad that they're finally speaking up and doing something about it.   This has been a problem . </p><p>PETERS:  Yeah. </p><p>ORTAGUS:  . mainly because ISIS is, you know, how millennials do terror so  to speak.  They know, because these are millennials actually running the  media machines within ISIS.  These are very sophisticated things that the  people can find online.  They know how to distribute, they know how to make  videos, they know how to distribute the videos, they know how to package it  for a young audience and to get the most maximum media attention. </p><p>So, when you look at these social media companies, if there is any like  child pornography, for example, that goes onto their website, that stuff  gets taken down right away.  So, I've been arguing for the past year, if  you're able to find the resources and algorithms and manpower to remove  content which is horrible such as child pornography.  You should also be  able to do that with terrorism-related activities. </p><p>REGAN:  Yeah.  It looks it's a no-brainer. </p><p>ORTAGUS:  Totally. </p><p>REGAN:  Colonel Peters, you know, you think back historically to how we  have been as a country.  And you think back, you know, to previous wars,  you know, look, the allies cracked enigma and had a central role in really  decoding what the enemy was doing.  Don't we need social media companies to  step up all over the world, frankly, and really work to decode the enemy  which, in this case, is extremism, Islamic extremism online? </p><p>PETERS:  Well, we certainly do, but let's remember, you referenced enigma  in World War II.  American industry had conscience.  They were CEO'S that  went to work for a dollar a year, the dollar a year made.  We rallied  behind our troops.  But these big tech companies do not feel that they're  really American citizens or citizens of the world, they have no sense of  responsibility, and again, they've got enormous amount of blood in their  hands and they won't face up to it.  And we'll see . </p><p>REGAN:  Or maybe they're going to have to.  Because, you know, Donald Trump  is there right now, and he's made it very clear Morgan, that he's not going  to stand for this.  It's one of the reasons, by the way, a lot of this tech  companies have been suffering ever since he was announced. </p><p>ORTAGUS:  That's a good point Trish.  It's also reputational risk, you  know, whenever you're in Facebook or Twitter, whomever and whenever ISIS is  using your medium in order to kill people in Syria to cause genocide, to  cause mass civil war, that's a mass of reputational risk from a business  perspective. </p><p>REGAN:  Yeah.  They need to worry about that a little bit more, because . </p><p>ORTAGUS:  Absolutely. </p><p>REGAN:  . a lot of them are communicating right now.  And I hope they . </p><p>ORTAGUS:  They are. </p><p>REGAN:  . start to care more about their reputational work, and I hope that  our president . </p><p>ORTAGUS:  Yeah. </p><p>REGAN:  . forces them to start to care a little bit more about it.  Morgan  and Colonel Peters, thank you so much. </p><p>ORTAGUS:  OK </p><p>REGAN:  We're taking a quick break.  I'll see you right back here in two. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  Ladies and gentlemen, this is Masa of SoftBank from Japan and he's  just agreed to invest $50 billion in the United States and 50,000 jobs.   And he's one of the great men of industry.  So I just want to thank you. </p><p>MASAYOSHI SON, SOFTBANK, CEO:  Thank you. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>REGAN:  All right, that news just breaking just a short time ago.  You saw  Donald Trump there in the lobby of Trump Tower with the CEO of SoftBank,  said SoftBank is going to be putting $50 billion creating 50,000 jobs into  the U.S. economy.  Here with more is the author of \"The Coming Collapse of  China\" Gordon Chang, a big critic of China over the years.  Gordon, good to  see you. </p><p>What is this signal to China right now the fact that Japan is going to be  putting 50 billion for give me in. </p><p>GORDON CHANG, \"NUCLEAR SHOWDOWN\" AUTHOR:  This is what they really worry  about Donald Trump.  They worry, of course, about the phone call with Tsai  Ing-wen, the Taiwan president.  But really this is it, because, first of  all, you have investments that would have gone into China but now they're  coming to the United States.  You know, if Trump is successful in reducing  taxes and reducing regulation, he's going create that 4 percent growth.   That's going to create pressure on the Renminbi, the Chinese currency.   That's a real problem for China right now. </p><p>REGAN:  So the China would have liked to see in Softbank put 50 billion  into their economy. </p><p>CHANG:  Absolutely. </p><p>REGAN:  OK. </p><p>CHANG:  And because SoftBank does have relations with China, this is  important for them.  So, you have a continuing stream of investments.  So  got to go somewhere, you know, and they're starting to divert away from  China for various reasons, some are going to India, some are going to  Bangladesh and Vietnam.  But we're now starting to see the stream of money  coming to the U.S. because of the optimism.  You know, the Dow, 11 straight  . </p><p>REGAN:  I know. </p><p>CHANG:  .records. </p><p>REGAN:  And it's up again right now, up 22 points as you can see. </p><p>CHANG:  So this is something that's got to worry China because they've got  very fragile economy right now and, you know, they're dependent on us. </p><p>REGAN:  In other words what you're telling me is, you know, the pie is only  so -- to a certain extent only so big and another if we're going to  continue to get more of it, it's going to come or they may see this as its  coming at their expense. </p><p>CHANG:  Certainly, you know, we're not in one of those robust global  environments.  You know, global GDP their share will increase 1 percent,  maybe 1.5 percent.  You know, trade is going to be very, very low if  there's an increase and at very well when be heading into a de-linking of  economies. </p><p>So, right now, you know, China for instance last year their economy de- linked from the global economy.  They had 8.0 percent less trade.  This  year it's going to be down about 7.5 percent.  So, tie it right now is in  fragile. </p><p>REGAN:  But what does it all mean?  I mean, are they going to have to, you  know, knock it off with some of the tariffs that are on our good that are  coming in to their economy?  How does this change?  Are they going to have  to stop, you know, depreciating their currency? </p><p>CHANG:  You would think so, but Xi Jinping the Chinese ruler believes in  China first.  He has been closing off the Chinese market to foreign  companies.  This has been going on now for about three years. </p><p>REGAN:  And this is one reason why you say that phone call was kind of a  good thing because it sort of the destabilized of the situation in just a  little tiny way enough to, you know, throw them off their game? </p><p>CHANG:  Well, you know, what's happening here is that, you know, Trump has  signaled that he has going to change foreign policy 100 percent. </p><p>REGAN:  Isn't it amazing, amazing.  Gordon Chang, thank you so much.  We're  going to be right back.  </p><p>CHANG:  Thanks Trish. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>REGAN:  All right, it's only 3:00 and we've already heard from Donald Trump  twice there in Trump Tower, just most recently, moments ago saying that he  has secured a pledge from SoftBank, the Japanese company, to put $50  billion into the U.S. economy creating 50,000 jobs. </p><p>President Obama is going to be arriving in Florida today.  He's expected to  thank some of the country's special operations forces and deliver his last  national security speech while in office.  It's all going to happen in just  about 30 minutes from now.  So stay tuned for that.  Liz will have it. </p><p>END </p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

We've got more on Trump's push to rein in government spending and what it's going to mean for the likes of Boeingand other companies. You know, you think about some of these companies that have been given blank checks for decades, things might change.</p><p>Now, amid the Boeingcontroversy, Mr. Trump is meeting with advisers today at Trump Tower.

Blake Burman is joining us right now with the latest on the hunt for our Secretary of State. Blake?</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS: Hi there, Trish! And it's been a busy one here at Trump Tower, actually a first today you just talked about it a little bit. After the president-elect sent out that tweet saying that the Air Force One order should be canceled. He actually came down to the lobby himself to speak with reporters, briefly talked about it saying that that situation is out of control, in his words.</p><p>Most of the action now taking place upstairs in the tower as the interviews continue and the one that is seeming to gain most of the attention is the ExxonMobil CEO, <person><nameText>Rex Tillerson. </nameText></person>He met with the president-elect. Tillerson has already come and gone.</p><p>That Secretary of State search appears to be expanding the Trump transition folks, though, when they were talking about it today, seemed to pump the brakes at least on the notion or at least the thinking that many of the people attached to the job are, indeed, interviewing for the job.</p><p>They also say that the president-elect likes to seek advice from many other people that he speaks with and talks to here at Trump Tower.</p><p>By the way, Mr. Trump is set to leave the tower here in a couple hours. He will head to North Carolina for the second stop of what he is calling his \"Thank You\" tour. Trish back to you.</p><p>REGAN: That's right. We'll be watching, right here on Fox Business tonight. Thank you so much, Blake.</p><p>For more on the transition team, I am joined by Former Attorney General under <person><nameText>Ronald Reagan, </nameText></person>Edwin Meese, and Tom Fitton, the President of Judicial Watch. Good to see both of you.</p><p>First of all, Mr. Meese, lots to talk about here today, but I'd like to know what you think about as far of the appointments <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>has made.</p><p>EDWIN MEESE, FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL UNDER REAGAN: I think they've been absolutely excellent. I was particularly impressed with Jeff Sessions being one of the first appointments. I've known Jeff for a long time. We worked together in the Department of Justice when I was attorney general.</p><p>He was an outstanding attorney general of Alabama, he's been an outstanding senator, and I can't think you could do better than Jeff Sessions. Likewise I think all of the other appointments have been excellent as well. Ms. Devos, Ben Carson, I could go down the list. Every one of them has just been first class, and I think America should be very proud of what Mr. Trump has done so far.</p><p>REGAN: Mr. Meese, do you anticipate a lot of pushback from Democrats? I mean, we're already hearing rumblings, there are a lot of folks out there that are going to try and make life difficult anyway, but a lot of them specifically are taking issue with Jeff Sessions. What do you say to that?</p><p>MEESE: Well, I would hope that the Democrats would rise above this politicization. You know, I wish they would treat the nominees by President-Elect Trump the way the Republicans treated the nominees that were put forth by President Obama. And I think fairness would indicate particularly with Jeff Sessions. He's got an impeccable record.</p><p>And this phony idea that somehow there's something wrong with his views on race are absolutely untrue. We're totally disproved years ago, have totally been proved by his record ever since.</p><p>REGAN: What about <person><nameText>Mitt Romney? </nameText></person>What are your thoughts on <person><nameText>Mitt Romney?</nameText></person></p><p>MEESE: Well, Mr. Romney is, has been a very good member of the Republican Party. I don't know enough about him, frankly, to really render an opinion.</p><p>REGAN: A lot of people feel like he hasn't exactly been loyal, perhaps that's the understatement of the year, but, you know, he came out pretty aggressively against <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>in the weeks and days before that election. It's not clear that he even voted for him. So some are scratching their heads saying why on earth is this guy being considered for the top job? Do you think, Mr. Meese, there are better contenders there? They're talking about Jon Huntsman, possibly Mr. Tillerson from Exxon, and there some others on that list including Rudy Giuliani who's been there from the beginning.</p><p>MEESE: Well, and you've left out one that I think is one of the best candidates, and that's John Bolton. John Bolton worked with me in the Justice Department. He was outstanding. He was the assistant attorney general for Legislative Liaison. He was the head of the civil division. And I think he would be also and excellent prospect.</p><p>But, of course, it's really up to Mr. Trump on these issues, and I'm sure he'll make as good a choice for Secretary's of States as he has done in the other appointments.</p><p>REGAN: I want to come back to you, Mr. Meese on <person><nameText>Donald Trump, </nameText></person>but let me go to over Tom for a moment because I know that you were both involved today in a panel called the First Hundred Days, the anti-corruption agenda.</p><p>You know, some of the things that I've heard and seen and witnessed over the last several years and some of the things that have come out concerning the potential pay-to-play scandal with the Clinton Foundation, Tom, have been quite concerning. How do we make sure that there is no corruption in government? How do we ensure transparency? What are your ideas for that right now in this new administration?</p><p>TOM FITTON, JUDICIAL WATCH PRESIDENT: Well, it needs to be a priority of the president, and it needs to be a priority of his appointees. Jeff Sessions is a rule of law guy, a law and order appointee. I expect he'll enforce the rule of law on immigration and matters like that on the Clinton corruption issues. They should consider a special prosecutor or in the least get the thumb, the political thumb off the scales of justice. Get politics out of the Clinton investigation and let it go forward because politics is preventing .</p><p>REGAN: OK. So you want to see this investigation continue, because there's been sort of a hands-off approach, at least most recently, where it doesn't seem as though we're going to see a whole lot in the way of an investigation for Hillary Clinton and the foundation. You want that to change, Tom?</p><p>FITTON: Yeah, I think it has to continue. Mr. Trump promised that there would be a serious investigation, and Jeff Sessions is, I think, the prime candidate to make sure it's done. And it's not doing anything unusual, it's just allowing the FBI to do its job and getting the Justice Department to stop obstructing the FBI investigation. Supposedly, the Clinton Foundation, the FBI can't get interviews, can't get subpoenas, can't get grand juries. That's out of the ordinary and its needs to stop.</p><p>REGAN: And yet, Ed, you know, many feel like that's going backwards, right? There are so much that's got to be done. We've got to get this economy going again. How do we deal with the Clinton Foundation if there's some bad stuff there and, you know, there certainly some evidence that Tom has been instrumental in bringing forward that suggests there could have been some questionable ethics involved. You know, you don't want to let that go, but at the same time we've got a lot to do in terms of getting the country back on its feet again. Where do you come out, Ed?</p><p>MEESE: Well, I think we ought to handle the Clinton Foundation investigation like we would any other case, and that is that whatever evidence is there that calls for the investigation and Tom has done an excellent job and the judicial watch is just, it's amazing to me. They've gotten more information than either the federal government or the news media, quite frankly, about what's going on in some of these conflicts and some of these corruption cases.</p><p>REGAN: Yeah. They've been out in front of it, for sure.</p><p>MEESE: So I think we got to follow the rule of law, have an honest, legitimate, non-politicized investigation and then see where the chips fall after all the facts are out.</p><p>REGAN: All right. Well, and I guess you're counting on Jeff Sessions to do it. Ed and Tom, thank you very much. Good to have you guys here today, appreciate it.</p><p>All right, on the other side of the aisle, you've got Vice President <person><nameText>Joe Biden </nameText></person>saying he's running for president in 2020. He's going to be 78. I mean, I'm no ageist or anything, but this guy has been around a while, right? So what it tells you? Really, is that when it comes to the left, they've got no new blood. I mean, take a listen here, I want you to hear party leader Nancy Pelosi who has led the Democratic caucus for the last 14 years. Here she is way back when.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NANCY PELOSI, HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: Well, I don't think that people want a new direction. Our values unify us, and our values are about supporting America's working families. That is one that everyone is in agreement on.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REGAN: Actually, that was from just this past Sunday, but she's been saying that over and over and over again. I mean, that's been the whole theme, right? Working families? But you know what, working families they sure don't feel like they've been supported in the last eight years, which is why the Democrats lost, isn't it?</p><p>Joining me right now, Washington Examiner Senior Political Columnist, Tim Carney. Tim, good to see you.</p><p>What's happening to the Democratic Party? Where are the new faces?</p><p>TIM CARNEY, WASHINGTON EXAMINER: Well, they've known for a while that they had a shallow bench. That was one of the concerns coming into the 2016 election, and, in fact, they had trouble recruiting some good candidates. But the consolation prize was going to be that for four or eight years they had the White House. They'd be able to build up a bench through cabinet jobs, through just the power of the presidency. Well, that's not there, and now they're in the real trouble, and as Nancy Pelosi said, most Democrats don't think they need a new direction, two thirds of the congressional Democrats voted her for minority leader. Most of the primary voters voted Hillary Clinton to be the nominee, so they seem to be happy continuing on the path that they're on which has led them to a minority.</p><p>REGAN: To a certain extent, isn't this a kind of cronyism? I mean the fact that they put Clinton in the spot that she got when -- they had, by the way, they like Sanders and I'm not socialist I'm no Sanders fan, but my goodness, he really started to captivate people. They had <person><nameText>Joe Biden.</nameText></person></p><p>CARNEY: Yeah.</p><p>REGAN: . by the way who really, you know, and obviously, he went through a personal tragedy, but he also suffered, of course, as a result of the party saying, no, it's her time. This is her opportunity, we're going to get the first woman president, and, you know, the reality is she just isn't that good a candidate.</p><p>CARNEY: No, and she -- everybody knew that she was not going to be liked. And if they're keeping Pelosi in there as well, to me it's a sign that they're not actually that interested in building a majority that it's protecting what they have going. One way we put in an examiner editorials maybe they elected Pelosi because they wanted to save space for liberals there on Capitol Hill, that each space is not away to hear outside ideas, it's what .</p><p>REGAN: Yeah, no, and look .</p><p>CARNEY: It's happening on College campuses and happening on the hill.</p><p>REGAN: I hear you. And she's from a very wealthy part of San Francisco, a very wealthy woman herself, you know, in part family money there. And I think has grown increasingly distant from sort of the core Democratic voter who may be out there in the Midwest and is dealing with the hard times of jobs moving overseas.</p><p>And so, until you start to tap into that, you know what, you're going to continue losing, and that's what we saw in this election cycle. It looks like they really aren't helping themselves as much either with the likes of Keith Ellison which we're going to talk about in a minute.</p><p>Tim Carney, good to have you here, thank you very much.</p><p>All right, everyone, <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>making good on his vow to take aim at government waste, he's going after Boeingfor what he calls out of control spending on the new Air Force One plane. Four billion dollars, is what we're talking about, way too much, says <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>Boeingis being put on notice, watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: The plane is totally out of control. It's going to be over $4 billion. It's for Air Force One program. And I think it's ridiculous.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REGAN: All right, you know, just this morning -- it was an interesting morning I can tell you, the President-Elect <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>was out there criticizing a government contract with Boeingclaiming it's going to cost taxpayers $4 billion to build the next Air Force One plane. Trump originally tweeted that he would cancel the deal, and now he's doubling down on his comments. Take a listen to him just a short time ago at Trump Tower.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: The plane is totally out of control. It's going to be over $4 billion. It's for Air Force One program and I think it's ridiculous. I think Boeingis doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeingto make a lot of money but not that much money.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REGAN: All right, this comes as new report say the State Department buried information that exposed $125 billion in government waste. According to this study, the back office bureaucracy at the Pentagon is so overstaffed that it has almost as many people working desk jobs as it does active duty troops.</p><p>Joining me right now from Americans for Prosperity, the president of it, Tim Phillips. Good to see you, good to have you here.</p><p>TIM PHILLIPS, AMERICANS FOR PROSPERITY, PRESIDENT: Good to be here.</p><p>REGAN: How scared do you think Boeingis right now as a result of today's movements?</p><p>PHILLIPS: It's good to keep these contractors on their toes, right? I mean, these political leaders, Trump in this case, it's good to see we're going to check every contract. We're going to look at every dollar you spent because it's taxpayer dollars. I think it's a good thing. And I hope it gives pause to everyone out there doing business with the government. You've got stay within cost to do your job.</p><p>REGAN: Well, I'll tell you, I don't think Boeingknows what to make of this.</p><p>PHILLIPS: Right.</p><p>REGAN: They issued a statement today, let me just share it with the viewers. It's basically what you call a big old nothing statement. I read it and kind of laughed because they're not actually even addressing the elephant in the room. They say, \"We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capability of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States,\" and they go on to say, \"We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes to the President, the best value of the American tax payer.\"</p><p>So they're basically saying, hey, guess what? I mean we work for the government, we're working on this plane, and we hope to give you the best value. But they, they don't really address what's at issue here which is this concern that costs .</p><p>PHILLIPS: Right.</p><p>REGAN: . have gotten completely out of control. You watch this, what are some of the most egregious examples?</p><p>PHILLIPS: Well, we have debt at $20 trillion, so it's across the board, but it seems like contractors see the initial contract just as a starting point for negotiation, right? They get that authorization, maybe it's a billion or two, and it starts skyrocketing. We see this across the board whether it's export-import bank which has gone dramatically over, over the years or just bureaucracy after bureaucracy. But it's good to hold these guys accountable on the consistent basis to the original terms of the contract. In the private sector, that's what's happening, that's what government should do.</p><p>REGAN: You're Boeing. Can we show shares of Boeingright now to the viewer? Let's take a look at the stock price it was down about 1 percent .</p><p>PHILLIPS: Yeah.</p><p>REGAN: . in the pre-market and was stumbling a bit throughout the margin (ph) of the market has changed course, and we're now in positive territory overall for the Dow.</p><p>Nonetheless, you see Boeingstill trading off about a tenth of a percent. You know, it used to be, basically, with these big government contracts it always has been, you know, you kind of get free rein, you walk in near .</p><p>PHILLIPS: Right.</p><p>REGAN: . if you're Boeing, I mean who else is going to build Air Force One?</p><p>PHILLIPS: Right.</p><p>REGAN: And so, you can almost charge whatever you want. Have that changed?</p><p>PHILLIPS: Not enough. Right now they're getting ready to have a lame duck session wrap up. They're going to have thousands of special interest exemptions in the tax code for group after group whether it's bourbon distillery folks or whether it's horse racing folks, they all get their chunks because of the special interest groups that they pay for, basically. And that's got to be stopped. We need lower flatter rates across the board, and when you actually get a government contract, it should be openly bid on, and you have to have live up to the terms of the original contract.</p><p>REGAN: Hey, let me quickly ask you, $125 billion .</p><p>PHILLIPS: Yeah, and hidden away. They buried this report $125 billion, over just five years. Internal report, they asked for it, they paid for it. Imagine, Trish, I'm going to say paid for this report. And it looks like they buried it, have it do anything about it because they're afraid about .</p><p>REGAN: Can you say, you say good for Trump on exposing all of this stuff, what do you mean by that?</p><p>PHILLIPS: I think that political officials, elected leaders, ought to be willing to hold every single federal contractor accountable to stay within cost. The private sector does that, it's time the government does it, so good for them in this regard.</p><p>REGAN: This is what people liked about him, they like .</p><p>PHILLIPS: Yeah.</p><p>REGAN: . the idea that they were getting a businessman who would come to office and say, look, let's get some accountability here. Good to see you, Tim.</p><p>PHILLIPS: Absolutely.</p><p>REGAN: thank you so much.</p><p>All right, Democrats seemingly poised to select Keith Ellison to lead the DNC after Howard Dean drops out of the running. OK, let me just make sure I got this right because you've got a party that's been abandoned by white, blue collar voters and in response it wants to appoint a radical and extreme left-wing ideologue with ties to Louis Farrakhan? Legal legend Alan Dershowitz is in the house. He says this is totally nuts, stay with me. See you here.</p><p>REGAN: Well, Democrats seem poised anyway at this point to pick a far-left extremist for the DNC, Keith Ellison, a congressman from Minnesota. He may be heading out to the DNC now that Howard Dean has pulled out. But after the party was beaten badly and we're talking very badly at the polls and lost of the support of white working class Americans, why on earth are they after picking someone like Ellison? I mean this is someone who at one time supported and worked with the nation of Islam and Louis Farrakhan. Here's Farrakhan, the guy he was working alongside just a year ago blasting white people. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LOUIS FARRAKHAN, NATION OF ISLAM, GROUP LEADER: Everywhere the white man - - his nature drove him to kill. Kill the brown. Kill the red. Kill the yellow. Kill my own white brother. And kill the black and make sure that the black never rise again.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REGAN: All right, joining me right now on the prospect of Ellison at the DNC, famed legal scholar, Alan Dershowitz, the legend himself. Good to say you, good to have you here.</p><p>ALAN DERSHOWITZ, HARVARD LAW PROFESSOR: Thank you, Trish.</p><p>REGAN: You think this is crazy, right, to have somebody like Ellison?</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: It's about the dumbest thing among many dumb things the Democrats have done. After losing white, middle class, working class people in the Midwest, you're going to pick somebody who for nine years was associated with a hate America, anti-American, anti-western person? It's just nuts. And they're going to lose a lot of Democrats if they appoint him.</p><p>REGAN: They're trying to double down. I mean they clearly were wrong in their approach to this election which they, you know, still don't really want to admit, because for some reason it's about women not supporting women, et cetera, et cetera. People just being misogynistic or this that and the other, but do they just not want to admit it, Alan? I mean, what's going on here? Why would you double down on the strategy that didn't work?</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: Well, it's one thing to have lost this election because you couldn't have anticipated how badly the Democrats could do in the Rust Belt in the Midwest. But now that you know that, you pick as leader of the Democratic Party the worst possible person to bring them back.</p><p>If I were a Republican strategist and I would given the choice to pick the head of the Democratic National Committee, I'd say pick Ellison. He would be great for the Republicans, and he's going to be great for the Republicans. Already high (inaudible), he was a major contributor to the Democratic Party has said, essentially, don't count on me anymore. He is going to lose many, many Democrats. He's going to lose many pro-Israel Democrats, many pro-American Democrats. Forget about Farrakhan's anti- semitism and the fact that this guy was part of that for years. Do you know what he said at one point to somebody when he was a student at the Minnesota Law School?</p><p>REGAN: Tell us.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: He said to somebody who was a woman and Jewish, I can have no respect for you, this is Ellison saying this, not Farrakhan, I can have no respect for you because you're Jewish and you're a woman. And as a woman, you shouldn't be working, you should be home, and .</p><p>REGAN: Oh my goodness.</p><p>REGAN: . this is a guy who bought into every negative aspect and now he's a member of Congress, and his voting record is abominable. He said Israel shouldn't be financed to have the iron dome. That protects Israeli citizens from rocket attacks, from Gaza. He voted against that. He's one of only eight senators who's voted against Israel .</p><p>REGAN: More people speaking out? Good for you, but why are more people saying, my goodness, is this really where you want to take the party, because it's going to disintegrate.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: It's not going to disintegrate. It's going to do what's going all over the world. The left is moving far, far, far, far more to the left. It's going to turn the Democratic Party into the British Labour Party. The British Labour Party is headed by a guy named Corbin, and they can't win an election to dogcatcher. And now the Democrats are going to have their, essentially, Corbin -- he's not as bad as Corbin, but he's pretty darn bad as the head of the Democratic Party, and you're going to a get a lot of centrists saying, I'm no longer Democrat, I'm not going to register as Democrat, I'm not going to .</p><p>REGAN: Listen, I meet them all the time here on the show, I mean I've meet quite a few that liked what they heard from say <person><nameText>Joe Biden,, </nameText></person>like what they heard -- even from Bernie Sanders to a certain extent and they said, look, I can't be part of this party anymore. As I said, who would you, by the way, put in Ellison's place?</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: Well, Jennifer Granholm, with the former governor of Michigan, who comes from that part of the country, who has tremendous appeal to middle class people. If <person><nameText>Joe Biden </nameText></person>would take it, he would be fantastic .</p><p>REGAN: He may be running for president, Alan.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: But you gave me a list of a 1000 people, I'd put Ellison a 1001.</p><p>REGAN: Yeah.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: He was the worst possible person at this point in the history of the Democratic Party to pick. And I hope the Democratic leaders will come to their senses and say, all right, we put him out there, that was a sap we sent to the Sanders, knees tease, to the hard left of the party, now let's begin to think about how to win. And you don't win with Ellison.</p><p>REGAN: Hopefully, they're watching you right now, thank you so much.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: Thank you.</p><p>REGAN: Alan, good to have you here.</p><p>All right, we're going to talk more about this very issue, <person><nameText>Madonna's </nameText></person>wing and on the Trump victory blaming women for Hillary Clinton's defeat saying, \"women hate women and that's why Clinton didn't win.\" Well, you know what, that's just wrong. She thinks because you're female you've got to vote for the female? The Democrats keep missing this one, because I'm telling you, the days of identity politics, they are over. We've got more on it next.</p><p>REGAN: OK, we've got some breaking news for you right now. <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>just moments ago came out there to the lobby of Trump Tower with some news. Some news that the SoftBank group founder and CEO is going to be making a big investment, roughly affiliate $50 billion in the United States, the goal to create 50,000 jobs, Japanese company, he then sent a couple of tweets. He said Masa, which is SoftBank, of Japan has agreed to invest $50 billion in the U.S., towards businesses 50,000 new job. And then he tweeted this said, the company would never do this had we, meaning Trump, not won the election.</p><p>With the very latest, I want to go to Blake Burman at Trump Tower. A little bit of surprise, there from <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>there this afternoon. I understand he just spoke with some of you there in the lobby. Tell us about it.</p><p>BURMAN: Yeah, just spoke with Masayoshi Son the CEO of SoftBank. And put it to him, Trish, point-blank, I said if <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>were not the next president of the United States. Would you not have made this pledge, the $50 billion and 50,000 jobs? And he looked to me and he said that's right. That is indeed the case. I asked him how would these 50,000 jobs come about are you just going to hire a bunch of folks or how is that come about? And he says, Son did that, they will invest in start-ups and that will be the goal to create jobs from there on out. He cited deregulation as a reason for this investment, and he also said that business people are energized. That's one of the reasons why he has come to this.</p><p>He also told me the he approached the President-Elect Mr. Trump with this pledge, I guess if that's the way you want to put it this commitment. And should also note, Trish, this is now the second time that Mr. Trump has come to the lobby today to speak with reporters. On the second occasion now, pretty big announcement.</p><p>REGAN: Pretty big and, you know, but -- them related to the economy, related to business, you know, first obviously in the case of Boeingbasically saying, look, you know, $4 billion is too much .</p><p>BURMAN: Right.</p><p>REGAN: . for that plane. And now here saying he's got a company a Japanese company that's going to put some money into the U.S. and create jobs. So, look, it's good to hear people are looking for some kind of reason to be optimistic about the economy right now, Blake?</p><p>BURMAN: Yeah, absolutely that -- you know, that's a great connection to put those two together with Boeingand now with this announcement from SoftBank. It is the first time we've heard from the president-elect here in New York City speaking to the media. So clearly, he thinks these are two big issues that he wants to get his voice out off.</p><p>REGAN: Business top of the agenda, the economy matters, jobs, jobs, jobs.</p><p>BURMAN: Right.</p><p>REGAN: Thank you so much Blake. We'll keep checking in with you.</p><p>Turning right now to Democrats that are still up in arms over <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>election, and Hollywood being forced to come to terms with the idea that, you know what, no one really cares what they think.</p><p><person><nameText>Madonna </nameText></person>tells one magazine that she feels like someone died. It's like a nightmare, she says, and she just can't believe <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is president. But instead of blaming a terrible campaign in a flat candidate, guess what? She's blaming women. This is <person><nameText>Madonna. </nameText></person>She says, \"Women hate women, that's what I think this is. Women's nature is not to support other women. It's really sad. Men protect each other, and women protect their men and children.\" Really? She lost because women hate women? Are one on the Democrats just going to get overall this identity politics, because I'll tell you what the reality is, women are not bounds by just that. They want whoever, male or female, is best for their future and yes their children and their husband's future. It's not all about what gender you are. And the sooner the Democrats can realize that, the better off they'll be.</p><p>Anyway, joining me right now on the issue, we have Republican strategist, Mercedes Schlapp, and Democratic strategist, Brian king. Good to see you guys.</p><p>BRIAN KING, DEMOCRAT STRATEGIST: Hey.</p><p>REGAN: You know, Mercedes, you are woman, you're Hispanic and you voted for <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>What is it that <person><nameText>Madonna </nameText></person>doesn't get about all your identities there?</p><p>MERCEDES SCHLAPP, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: And so did my mother and my aunt and my sister and my sister-in-law, they all voted for <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>Well here's the thing, I think for <person><nameText>Madonna </nameText></person>she's expressing her inner Secretary Madeleine Albright comment of those women that don't vote for Hillary Clinton, how the special place in hell. We need to remember that women are not monolithic. We vote and understand that there are issues that are important to us. And the Democrats have been stuck in the 1970s-1980s politics of well it's about reproductive rights.</p><p>Well its not just about reproductive rights, it's about the economy, it's about health care, it's about education for our families. And I think that when you compare the two candidates in this election, <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>came out with a very strong economic message for families for women that would boost the economy. And we're obviously starting to see this beginning to roll out even before he has been sworn into office.</p><p>REGAN: Yeah, he made two economic announcements today. One criticizing some of the waste he sees at Boeings. And the other that Japan is going to make this big investment via SoftBank creating 50,000 new jobs. And are our Blake Burman spoke to the CEO of SoftBank who said, look, this is very much tied to <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>being there and I call them up they want to do this because he's there and I see it as a more pro-business, less regulatory heavy environment right now. Brian.</p><p>KING: Yes.</p><p>REGAN: What do you think about your party, right now? We just had Alan Dershowitz on saying, you know, he's saying is well this stuff has end to. I mean, they're going to put Keith Ellison as head of the DNC.</p><p>KING: Well as pretty this way, and I think Trish we're probably all in agreement that what's amazing, you know, is actually Democrats that understood back in 1992 that it's the economy, stupid. And we knew that and actually we kept winning elections when we said that. And that really is what this is about. And I think, you know, we just saw that a news update. It's the economy stupid that's what we need to keep talking about that's what the .</p><p>REGAN: All right, but that's not what they're talking about, Mercedes, right now ...</p><p>KING: Right.</p><p>REGAN: . it still identity politics, you know, as usual .</p><p>KING: And here's what I think is this.</p><p>REGAN: . and that Keith Ellison thing.</p><p>KING: Here's what I think is so amusing which is, we haven't talked about <person><nameText>Madonna </nameText></person>since what, 1982. And so, here she comes like what on earth we're talking about <person><nameText>Madonna.</nameText></person></p><p>REGAN: Maybe she's just trying to make herself relevant.</p><p>KING: Right.</p><p>REGAN: Maybe that is what this is about. You know, she wants to sell a few albums. You go ahead Mercedes.</p><p>KING: But quite frankly we should be talking more Springsteen if you want to talk about the economy.</p><p>REGAN: Mercedes.</p><p>SCHLAPP: But this is part of the problem I think with Hollywood and itself and I would say a number of the Democrats is the fact that, that being disconnected from the struggle of the American worker.</p><p>And so, I think when you bring back a Nancy Pelosi, for example, as leading your party in the House where she's a San Francisco liberal, you know, not necessarily understanding what's happening in the middle of the heart of America where so many companies have left communities leaving individuals and families devastated. I think that's where the disconnect has happened with the Democratic Party.</p><p>And what we've seen as a party move further to the left without necessarily providing the economic solutions, and I think .</p><p>REGAN: Yeah.</p><p>SCHLAPP: . that's why <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>has come in and said, look, I am not the politician, I'm a businessman, I want to negotiate these deals, I want to work with the parties to push forward a strong economic agenda.</p><p>REGAN: It's really interesting to see and it's just going to get even more interesting from here, Mercedes and Brian, thank you so much.</p><p>KING: Thank you Trish.</p><p>SCHLAPP: Thank you Trish.</p><p>REGAN: All right, everyone, we got some web giants out there like Youtube, Facebook, Twitter and Microsoft all bonding together right now today to remove extremist contents and terrorist propaganda from their sites. OK. Sounds good. But where they're then? Right? I mean why didn't they do this a whole long time ago? Could it be because <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is now in office, about to be in office that these companies are suddenly trying to clean up their acts? We're on the story next.</p><p>REGAN: All right. Let's check out this market which is now in positive territory, again, market moving higher here. but fairly up 19 points, there on the Dow. S&amp;P also in the green as well. The NASDAQ Composite Index to get energy companies, however, struggling a bit more as the price of oil really had lower today after a four day long rally, but still above that key $50 level. You see oil closing out the day just a moment ago.</p><p>All right, let's turn right now to the Supreme Court with deciding with Samsung and its high-profile patent dispute with Apple over the design of the iPhone. The justices today throwing out nearly $400 million judgment against Samsung. The court said Samsung can't be forced to pay all the profits because the copied parts are only a tiny fraction of the devices.</p><p>We are going to be right back. And we're going to have a look at this social media websites like Google, Microsoft that seemed to be willing to finally step up to fight terror, what took so long?</p><p>REGAN: Our news today that Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and Youtube are all coming together to try to stop the spread of online terror. They plan on using a shared database that will catch potential terrorist activity and remove it from their websites. Hopefully also report it to the FBI.</p><p>Facebook released a statement today reading, \"We hope this collaboration will lead to greater efficiency as we continue to enforce our policies to help curb the pressing global issue of terrorist content online.\" OK. Good! Right? I guess the question here though is what the heck took them so long?</p><p>Joining me right now we have Fox News Strategist Analyst, Colonel Ralph Peters, and former Treasury Attach\u201a for Saudi Arabia, Morgan Ortagus.</p><p>I know you guys have bolt pen all over this. But none of us here on this panel has ever understood why the social media companies have not been more proactive. Is this a sign of potentially more good things to come, Colonel Peters?</p><p>LT. COL. RALPH PETERS, (RET.) FOXS NEWS STRATEGIC ANALYST: Well, let us hope. But I think it's easy explained why the tech companies have done nothing, greed, raw greed at the expense of human lives. They have positioned themselves, marketed themselves as great benefactors of humanity. But the big tech companies, you know, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, or Youtube, they have been the number one enabler of ISIS and other terrorist groups. And all ,by the way, let's not forget fake news which result which has resulted in a gunman walking into a pizzeria in Washington, D.C.</p><p>REGAN: Yeah.</p><p>PETERS: So, it's a long way -- they have a long way to go to make good. They've got a lot of blood on their hands.</p><p>REGAN: You know, one of the things I never kind of understood, Morgan, you know, not my fault, not my problem. You know, we can't entirely control and we don't want to have to limit the communication between these people to which I'd just say, you know, don't you have some kind of national duty? You are American companies, you've gotten your start in this country and all the benefits that come with that. Don't you have an obligation to help protect the citizens of the United States of America?</p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, FMR. STATE DEPARTMENT PRESS OFFICER: Absolutely, Trish, and I'm glad that they're finally speaking up and doing something about it. This has been a problem .</p><p>PETERS: Yeah.</p><p>ORTAGUS: . mainly because ISIS is, you know, how millennials do terror so to speak. They know, because these are millennials actually running the media machines within ISIS. These are very sophisticated things that the people can find online. They know how to distribute, they know how to make videos, they know how to distribute the videos, they know how to package it for a young audience and to get the most maximum media attention.</p><p>So, when you look at these social media companies, if there is any like child pornography, for example, that goes onto their website, that stuff gets taken down right away. So, I've been arguing for the past year, if you're able to find the resources and algorithms and manpower to remove content which is horrible such as child pornography. You should also be able to do that with terrorism-related activities.</p><p>REGAN: Yeah. It looks it's a no-brainer.</p><p>ORTAGUS: Totally.</p><p>REGAN: Colonel Peters, you know, you think back historically to how we have been as a country. And you think back, you know, to previous wars, you know, look, the allies cracked enigma and had a central role in really decoding what the enemy was doing. Don't we need social media companies to step up all over the world, frankly, and really work to decode the enemy which, in this case, is extremism, Islamic extremism online?</p><p>PETERS: Well, we certainly do, but let's remember, you referenced enigma in World War II. American industry had conscience. They were CEO'S that went to work for a dollar a year, the dollar a year made. We rallied behind our troops. But these big tech companies do not feel that they're really American citizens or citizens of the world, they have no sense of responsibility, and again, they've got enormous amount of blood in their hands and they won't face up to it. And we'll see .</p><p>REGAN: Or maybe they're going to have to. Because, you know, <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is there right now, and he's made it very clear Morgan, that he's not going to stand for this. It's one of the reasons, by the way, a lot of this tech companies have been suffering ever since he was announced.</p><p>ORTAGUS: That's a good point Trish. It's also reputational risk, you know, whenever you're in Facebook or Twitter, whomever and whenever ISIS is using your medium in order to kill people in Syria to cause genocide, to cause mass civil war, that's a mass of reputational risk from a business perspective.</p><p>REGAN: Yeah. They need to worry about that a little bit more, because .</p><p>ORTAGUS: Absolutely.</p><p>REGAN: . a lot of them are communicating right now. And I hope they .</p><p>ORTAGUS: They are.</p><p>REGAN: . start to care more about their reputational work, and I hope that our president .</p><p>ORTAGUS: Yeah.</p><p>REGAN: . forces them to start to care a little bit more about it. Morgan and Colonel Peters, thank you so much.</p><p>ORTAGUS: OK</p><p>REGAN: We're taking a quick break. I'll see you right back here in two.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Ladies and gentlemen, this is Masa of SoftBank from Japan and he's just agreed to invest $50 billion in the United States and 50,000 jobs. And he's one of the great men of industry. So I just want to thank you.</p><p>MASAYOSHI SON, SOFTBANK, CEO: Thank you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REGAN: All right, that news just breaking just a short time ago. You saw <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>there in the lobby of Trump Tower with the CEO of SoftBank, said SoftBank is going to be putting $50 billion creating 50,000 jobs into the U.S. economy. Here with more is the author of \"The Coming Collapse of China\" Gordon Chang, a big critic of China over the years. Gordon, good to see you.</p><p>What is this signal to China right now the fact that Japan is going to be putting 50 billion for give me in.</p><p>GORDON CHANG, \"NUCLEAR SHOWDOWN\" AUTHOR: This is what they really worry about <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>They worry, of course, about the phone call with Tsai Ing-wen, the Taiwan president. But really this is it, because, first of all, you have investments that would have gone into China but now they're coming to the United States. You know, if Trump is successful in reducing taxes and reducing regulation, he's going create that 4 percent growth. That's going to create pressure on the Renminbi, the Chinese currency. That's a real problem for China right now.</p><p>REGAN: So the China would have liked to see in Softbank put 50 billion into their economy.</p><p>CHANG: Absolutely.</p><p>REGAN: OK.</p><p>CHANG: And because SoftBank does have relations with China, this is important for them. So, you have a continuing stream of investments. So got to go somewhere, you know, and they're starting to divert away from China for various reasons, some are going to India, some are going to Bangladesh and Vietnam. But we're now starting to see the stream of money coming to the U.S. because of the optimism. You know, the Dow, 11 straight .</p><p>REGAN: I know.</p><p>CHANG: .records.</p><p>REGAN: And it's up again right now, up 22 points as you can see.</p><p>CHANG: So this is something that's got to worry China because they've got very fragile economy right now and, you know, they're dependent on us.</p><p>REGAN: In other words what you're telling me is, you know, the pie is only so -- to a certain extent only so big and another if we're going to continue to get more of it, it's going to come or they may see this as its coming at their expense.</p><p>CHANG: Certainly, you know, we're not in one of those robust global environments. You know, global GDP their share will increase 1 percent, maybe 1.5 percent. You know, trade is going to be very, very low if there's an increase and at very well when be heading into a de-linking of economies.</p><p>So, right now, you know, China for instance last year their economy de- linked from the global economy. They had 8.0 percent less trade. This year it's going to be down about 7.5 percent. So, tie it right now is in fragile.</p><p>REGAN: But what does it all mean? I mean, are they going to have to, you know, knock it off with some of the tariffs that are on our good that are coming in to their economy? How does this change? Are they going to have to stop, you know, depreciating their currency?</p><p>CHANG: You would think so, but Xi Jinping the Chinese ruler believes in China first. He has been closing off the Chinese market to foreign companies. This has been going on now for about three years.</p><p>REGAN: And this is one reason why you say that phone call was kind of a good thing because it sort of the destabilized of the situation in just a little tiny way enough to, you know, throw them off their game?</p><p>CHANG: Well, you know, what's happening here is that, you know, Trump has signaled that he has going to change foreign policy 100 percent.</p><p>REGAN: Isn't it amazing, amazing. Gordon Chang, thank you so much. We're going to be right back.</p><p>CHANG: Thanks Trish.</p><p>REGAN: All right, it's only 3:00 and we've already heard from <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>twice there in Trump Tower, just most recently, moments ago saying that he has secured a pledge from SoftBank, the Japanese company, to put $50 billion into the U.S. economy creating 50,000 jobs.</p><p>President Obama is going to be arriving in Florida today. He's expected to thank some of the country's special operations forces and deliver his last national security speech while in office. It's all going to happen in just about 30 minutes from now. So stay tuned for that. Liz will have it.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Not surprisingly, the Dow actually just giving back a little bit, but not  surprisingly, a rousing session.  We have records in all three major  indices and records in Europe.  Let's see if he does justice.  Four, five,  six, seven -- I think that's called over-egging the pudding.  But trading  is over.  Records on the market.  We'll put it all in perspective.  Today  is Tuesday.  It is the 9th of January.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tonight, President Trump goes to Davos.  The president is going to the  World Economic Forum to be amongst the elite he supposedly despises.  A  television exclusive with the chief executive of Ford.  Jim Hackett shares  his plans to build smart cities.  You'll hear that in half an hour.  And  prime mover, Amazon's Jeff Bezos becomes the world's richest man ever.  I'm  Richard Quest, live in the world's financial capital, New York, where, of  course, I mean business.  </p><p>Good evening, tonight we've just shown you U.S. markets have closed at all- time records once again.  And Donald Trump wants to continue the momentum  of his economic America-first message.  He's going to the World Economic  Forum in Davos, and when he does so, he will obviously be boasting about  the state, the speed and the growth of the U.S. economy.  </p><p>But it is the event where he's going that is raising eyebrows.  The annual  meeting of the political elites.  The heads of the global corporations and  the uber-super rich.  Now, you could argue they helped fuel Donald Trump's  populist movement.  Tonight, the president has decided to join them.  The  decision to attend in Davos took everyone by surprise.  The last president  to go was Bill Clinton in 2000.  The White House confirmed the trip in the  last hour.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  The president will  attend, and he welcomes the opportunity to go there and advance his  America-first agenda with world leader and he is very much looking forward  to being part of that process.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  David Gergen is with me, CNN senior political analyst.  You've been  to Davos more than once or twice.  </p><p>DAVID GERGEN, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST:  I think you and I probably  have been too many times.  About 20 times a piece.  </p><p>QUEST:  Absolutely.  OK.  Why is he going?  Because pre-presidency, I would  have said this is the perfect place for a man with golf courses, private  jets, multiple homes.  But this idea of draining the swamp, anti- establishment.  He's going to the heart of it.  </p><p>GERGEN:  Absolutely.  But I think it's a smart move.  Listen, he's going to  have the world stage for 45 minutes to an hour.  Everybody is going to be  tuning in.  And he has a chance to make his case for the American economy  and take credit for these -- you know, these arousing numbers on the stock  market and unemployment rate going down, all the rest you've been reporting  on here.  He thinks he's not getting sufficient credit.  He's not getting  sufficient attention.  He's mired in the Mueller investigation.  Questions  about his fitness in office and all of the rest of it.  This is an  opportunity to try to change the spotlight back to where he wants.  Now, I  do think there's a question.  Is he playing to the home base crowd?  In  which case he's going to be the tough on trade, tough on immigration, or is  he going to try to play to the international.  </p><p>QUEST:  Now, that's the fascinating part about this.  Does he go there to  blow up the house and say a plague on all of you, and America's change  we're no longer going to -- if we look at his recent speeches, they've all  had this message.  Take, for example, we don't care how you vote at the  United Nations.  Which do you think we're going to see?  A blow them up or  we want you with us?  </p><p>GERGEN:  I think he's going to go for pleasing his base.  It's been his  instinct.  </p><p>QUEST:  A plague on all your houses.  </p><p>GERGEN:  Well, yes.  And being tough.  He will say -- he will have some  grace notes.  He'd say we want to get along with everybody, we want to love  you, and America is doing some wonderful things for the world.  But I think  he still sees the most important challenge of his coming year is keeping  control of the House of Representatives, keeping control of Congress so he  can get more of his agenda done.  </p><p>QUEST:  We have seen today an extraordinary meeting.  He's -- </p><p>GERGEN:  Yes.  </p><p>QUEST:  -- on immigration.  He allowed the cameras to stay in there for 45  minutes while he effectively debated his immigration policy with others who  didn't agree with him.  </p><p>[16:05:04] What was behind it?  </p><p>GERGEN:  I thought it was a pretty smart move.  It was weird, but it was a  good weird.  In the sense that it allowed the -- it was like 50 minutes.  </p><p>QUEST:  Yes.  </p><p>GERGEN:  It allowed us all to sort of tune in on what, you know, it was a  cabinet meeting.  Interesting television.  Very importantly, Richard, I  thought was the clips that have come out of it so far have shown Trump  being pretty articulate.  And at a time when people think he may be going  bonkers or he's losing it in there, this helped to put some of that to  rest, I think.  </p><p>QUEST:  That's what this was about, wasn't it?  There was nothing -- there  was nothing accidental about allowing the cameras in.  And it probably was  him who decided to do it.  Because the man is a media mastermind genius.  </p><p>GERGEN:  Yes.  Let's be careful about that word genius.  </p><p>QUEST:  Deliberate.  </p><p>GERGEN:  I know.  He does have a sixth sense.  He is a very good salesman.   That is his strength.  </p><p>QUEST:  So, he shows the world, I'm going to debate, I'm going to engage,  any idea that the time -- I'm losing it, people will see I've got all the  arguments.  </p><p>GERGEN:  Right, right.  And it was enough.  Listen, I am sure there are  other days -- if you go back and read the transcript with the \"New York  Times\" reporter who went in and talked to him, you know, impromptu fashion  at Mar-a-Lago, that's basically incoherent.  And highly repetitive.  The  word collusion comes up, you know, every third word.  There's collusion,  every phrase.  But this Donald Trump was actually, you know, articulate and  he looked like he was in charge.  And it was interesting.  He is -- let's  go back to Davos.  </p><p>QUEST:  Yes, please.  </p><p>GERGEN:  He's taking about half his cabinet with him.  They have a very  large contingent of the economic side of the house, which I think you can  expect secretary of the treasury.  You can expect Gary Cohn, Wilbur Ross  out of commerce.  Lighthizer out of trade.  I think there is going to be a  big delegation.  It's very unusual for America to go with this big a  delegation.  But last year you remember Davos, the big, big speech came  from the leader of China.  </p><p>QUEST:  I was there.  </p><p>GERGEN:  Yes.  And it was pick up the flag, America is retweeting.  We're  going to pick up the flag.  We're going to be in charge of trade.  We're  going to lead the way on trade.  We're going to lead the way on  environment.  And now this is Trump's moment to go head-to-head with Xi as  world leader.  I think he's going to play for his base, as I say, rather  than trying to seize the flag back.  </p><p>QUEST:  You're getting this?  </p><p>GERGEN:  Yes.  </p><p>QUEST:  I shall see you.  </p><p>GERGEN:  I look forward to it.  </p><p>QUEST:  We'll swap tips for keeping warm.  </p><p>GERGEN:  Absolutely.</p><p>QUEST:  Thank you.  </p><p>GERGEN:  OK, thank you.  </p><p>QUEST:  Let's go to the trading post where we need to show exactly what  happed in a day, and remarkable day as David Gergen was saying.  So, we  have records.  First of all, three records.  Green is the order of the day.   Lots of green.  As much green damage you can give me today.  We've got the  Dow of a record.  We've got the S&amp;P at a record.  We've got the Nasdaq at a  record.  So, my first duty, of course, is to change these numbers for you.   So, the Dow now goes to 4.  The S&amp;P and the Nasdaq both go to 6.  But  there's more, because not only did we have records -- so writings not as  good as it should be -- over in Europe.  We have a record on the FTSE,  which goes to 3.  And in Zurich, we have the SMI, which goes to 2.  </p><p>Now, this would be remarkable in any scenario.  But to have 4, 6 and 6  records on the Dow, the Nasdaq and the S&amp;P when we're only in the second  trading day of the year, this is something that clearly has to be dealt  with by Paul La Monica, who understands exactly what we're talking about.   And why we're seeing such remarkable records so quickly.  </p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNNMONEY CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  I think one thing to just  noted obviously, is that we're still waiting for earnings.  That's going to  really kick in later this week, with JPMorgan Chase and some other big  banks.  There is not a heck of a lot of news out there yet, and volume is  low, which I know trades pointed out to you on the \"EXPRESS\" show earlier  today.  So, the reason why I think stocks are still hitting all these  records, though, is that there is legitimate optimism about what profits  are going to look like in 2018.  And it's a combination of tax reform, but  also real fundamentals.  Because this rally is broadening out.  It's not  just tech any more.  </p><p>QUEST:  Right.  </p><p>LA MONICA:  Boeing is at an all-time high.  Union Pacific is at an all-time  high.</p><p>QUEST:  Let's look at Boeing, because we have the Dow higher -- twice as  high as the gain on the Dow as the S&amp;P and Nasdaq.  And Boeing, of course,  is the largest component.  And you see this -- why has Boeing suddenly put  on about 6 or 7 percent in a matter of a few days?  From 296 to 318, 20  since January the 1st.  Why?  </p><p>LA MONICA:  It's a stunning move.  Today they announced that they had  extremely solid deliveries of commercial aircraft last year.  And I think  that's what people were expecting.  </p><p>[16:10:00] Everyone knows that Boeing is doing really well in the aviation  business right now.  And that is something that is going to probably keep  this stock going higher.  I mean, there is the defense side of the Boeing  coin, as well.  But it's just commercial jets.  That business is booming.   And they're stealing share from Airbus, and that's helping them.  </p><p>QUEST:  And they'll get some 6,000 aircraft.  Look at the Dow 30 and give  us an interception.  As we take a look and see exactly how the 30 stocks  within the Dow Jones Industrials have traded.  We see -- oh my goodness,  gracious me.  Dear old GE, the laggard from last year.  It's trying.  It's  trying to do something.  </p><p>LA MONICA:  Yes.  GE, I think there is a hope that under new management  that they will kind of right-size that ship, if you will.  But look at the  rest of the Dow here, and this is a broad rally, again.  You don't see any  big tech leaders there.  You've got Boeing, GE, J&amp;J, United Tech,  Travelers, Caterpillar.  Takes a while before you see where tech did today,  and it's IBM, which is the stodgiest of tech out there in the Dow.  But  tech is off to a hot start this year, as well.  This is a nice rally across  the board.  </p><p>QUEST:  Good to see you.  </p><p>LA MONICA:  Thank you.  </p><p>QUEST:  Thank you very much indeed.  </p><p>I need to bring you some breaking news.  Steve Bannon is stepping down from  Breitbart news.  It's just been announced.  We're not sure the reasons,  whether it was because he was pushed out or decided to step down or the  sponsors decided.  We'll bring you more on that as the program moves on.  </p><p>Staying with the main theme of the day, though, markets and economies, the  World Bank says the global economy is at a turning point.  It just released  its report on global economic prospects.  Shows global growth stronger than  expected.  Franziska Ohnsorge is the banks lead economist on that report.   She joins me from London.  We know that we are seeing synchronistic growth  between the major economies at the moment, which is the first time in a  decade, at least, that we've enjoyed this sort of thing.  But if I  understand your report right, it's going to get faster.  </p><p>FRANZISKA OHNSORGE, WORLD BANK DEVELOPMENT PROSPECTS GROUP:  Yes.  Global  growth has solid momentum now.  We expect it to tick up a little bit in  2018 to 3.1 percent.  The broader line last year was 3 percent.  And it's a  broad-based recovery, as investment led by advanced economies.  But it's a  cyclical recovery.  And cyclical recoveries come, and they do eventually  fade.  What our main concern is, where growth ends up once this cyclical  recovery fades.  </p><p>QUEST:  But hang on.  A cyclical recovery is the norm.  You get a cyclical  recovery after a period of recession or downturn.  We arguably -- I know  what the point you're making is, that we should be seeing more of a  structural recovery.  But arguably, that already happened in the '09, '10,  '11 post-recession.  </p><p>OHNSORGE:  Yes, this recovery from this post-crisis low in 2016 of 2.4  percent growth has taken longer to materialize than we had expected.  For  years we had to revise our forecast downward and we were disappointed.   Finally, now, there seems to be a turning point where we have to revise our  forecasts up.  But it will fade.  And when it fades, and growth returns to  its long-term sustainable growth, our concern is that kind of growth would  be about a percentage point less than it was ten years ago.  </p><p>QUEST:  Right.  But it's inevitable.  The faster rate of growth will  dwindle.  That is inevitable.  I'm not sure what it is that the World Bank  now wants to ensure a higher level of sustainable growth.  </p><p>OHNSORGE:  It is inevitable that it fades.  The question is, where does it  fade to?  Ten years ago, we would have thought that, for example, emerging  market and developing economy growth would have faded to about 4.8 percent.   Nowadays, it would be more something like 4.3 percent.  So, there's lots of  room for disappointments.  </p><p>QUEST:  Which is the biggest -- what is the biggest concern for you on the  economic horizon?  Is it firstly, say Brexit and dislocation within the EU?   Is it the U.S. president's trade policies?  Is it something that I'm not  considering?  What is the worry that you have?  </p><p>OHNSORGE:  In the medium to long-term, of course, is potential growth.  But  in the shorter term, there are any number of risks.  And that could be  political risk, that could be -- surprises along the process of Brexit.   The main worry is the financial markets seem very vulnerable to a  correction.  Asset evaluations around the world are very high and bond  yields are at record lows around the world, not just advanced economies.  </p><p>[16:15:00] QUEST:  Yes, but the only problem is, we have been saying that  for the last five years, four years.  And if we had followed the advice of  economists, many of us would not show the gains in pensions and portfolios.  </p><p>OHNSORGE:  It's true that what would have upset -- upset financial markets  five years ago, say geopolitical concerns in Asia, or the talk of  sanctions, now doesn't seem to have any effect on financial markets.  But  there could be a turning point where suddenly they correct.  </p><p>QUEST:  Excellent to have you on the program.  Thank you.  Joining us on  QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, really appreciate it.  Please come back again.  We  need to talk more about these issues.  Thank you.  </p><p>Coming up on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, South Korea's sanctions against the  North could be eased.  Both sides are making Olympic overtures.  We'll have  Will Ripley who is in South Korea after the break.  There is green on all  the markets.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>QUEST:  A dramatic breakthrough in talks between North and South Korea,  which could lead to sanctions on Pyongyang being relaxed.  After the  North's decision to take part in next month's Winter Olympics in Seoul, the  -- in South Korea, the South says it will consider lifting sanctions  temporarily.  Japan has hailed North Korea's decision on the Olympics as a  change in attitude.  Now turn back the clock, and you'll see a pattern of  talks since missile tests back in 2006.  </p><p>Join me at the super screens, and you'll see what I mean.  These are the  lists of North Korea talks.  So, you've got September 2007.  You then have  got July and December 2008.  And a long gap into February 2014, August  2015, and now January 2018.  Will Ripley is near the DMZ, where, I mean, I  sympathize.  It looks freezing there tonight.  The issue -- why are they  talking?  What has driven this?  Is it what everybody says?  Is it the U.S.  hard line?  </p><p>WILL RIPLEY, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  The North Koreans would never admit to  that, Richard.  But clearly, with sanctions kicking in this year, you can't  deny the fact that when you're cutting a country's oil imports and nearly  all of their export revenue.  They need something to change before their  economy takes a drastic hit.  And so, that could be a motivating factor.   Also, the Olympic are maybe perhaps a short window for diplomacy that both  sides recognize.  Which is why we saw those talks take place.  </p><p>QUEST:  You are an expert on North Korea, Will.  Is it your feeling that  they are playing everybody in the sense of let Donald Trump think he is  having a minor victory over this hard line, and then do something with an  atomic blast or a nuclear test or whatever?  </p><p>RIPLEY:  I actually don't think that they're trying to make Donald Trump  think he has a victory.  </p><p>[16:20:00] Because the North Koreans said at the end of yesterday's  meetings that their nuclear weapons are pointed directly at the United  States and not South Korea or China or Russia.  So, if anything, they're  trying to drive a wedge between these countries and the United States as  opposed to trying to appease the United States or making them feel like  they won a victory.  </p><p>QUEST:  All right, Will, finally, just point out where you are and what  might be there.  You're near the DMZ.  What are we looking at?  </p><p>RIPLEY:  Right.  So, the de militarized zone, we're right along the DMZ.   North Korea, just a bit over that way.  It's still dark out here.  We are  just a few minutes away from the Panmunjom truce village, where those talk  were taking place.  This is the location of other talks previously.  The  last time they had talks there, just over two year ago, they lasted 44  hours.  This time around, they hammered out a number of deals in one day.   It's really remarkable.  And it shows that both sides, the North and the  South really came to the table ready to make a deal on the Olympics.  </p><p>QUEST:  It looks very cold there.  I'm sure you should have a hat on in  those cold weather.  All right.  Will Ripley, thank you very much.  Go and  get yourself warm.  At least buy a hat.  Thank you.  </p><p>A new report says North Korea is trying to compensate for the tight  sanctions placed upon it by mining cryptocurrencies.  It suggests software  was installed to channel coins into a server at this North Korean  University.  Chris Doman is a threat engineer at the cybersecurity firm  AlienVault, which was behind the report.  He's in London.  Good to see you,  sir.  This is fascinating.  So, you're saying that the North basically  mined bitcoin or others with a view to what, raising revenue?  </p><p>CHRIS DOMAN, THREAT ENGINEER, ALIENVAULT:  Yes.  This is part of a minor  set of attacks.  We saw this being sent directly to that university in  Pyongyang.  It's unusually direct.  But this comes on the heels of last  week, there was a report that the Korean government.  They saw North Korean  hacker hacking into some networks, and in that case also mining the  cryptocurrency.  And Kaspersky saw some of the things too.  This has been  going on for about a year now.  </p><p>QUEST:  Now when you said they've been mining them, have they been mining  them legitimately.  Is there anything intrinsically wrong with what they  have been doing, other than the fact that it is surprising that North Korea  has been doing it?  </p><p>DOMAN:  It's a really good question.  So, we weren't sure at first.  We saw  it being sent to that center in Pyongyang.  But maybe this was the  university doing it themselves.  It was malicious, they did try to hide.   And then later today someone else found some very closely related malware,  same people, same Monero wallet.  And that was infecting people in South  Korea.  Combined with that, there have been other attacks that have hacked  into networks to install similar software.  </p><p>QUEST:  So, I'm not really fully understanding what they are doing.  Are  they mining legitimately like we visited many bitcoin mines over the years,  or are they going in and stealing other people's bitcoins or some nefarious  version of all?  </p><p>DOMAN:  Yes, it's all three.  So, what we're looking at being sent to that  server at a university that may well be legitimate.  But then it's also  quite clear it's stuff not hacking into people's machines to mine that  Monero.  Then as you said, there has always been hacking into exchanges and  things too to steal the coins once they've already been mined.  So, all  three.  </p><p>QUEST:  When we look at what's happening to cryptocurrencies and the whole  blockchain phenomenon, we are struggling to understand, or at least I am,  struggling to understand what people like yourself believe the true role of  cryptocurrencies is in the future.  </p><p>DOMAN:  Well, I have a very biased perspective.  My job is to look at  malware every day.  And every day I see more and bitcoin malware.  If you  track a graph of the price of bitcoin along with how much malware we see,  targeting bitcoin it's almost a direct correlation.  But I think other  people --</p><p>QUEST:  Explain what you mean by that.  In terms of the relationship  between the malware and the price, or what you're seeing in the bitcoin  market.  </p><p>DOMAN:  Yes.  If you draw that graph, they go together.  So, the higher the  price of bitcoin, the more people move to targeting bitcoin.  So, people  that before when everything was ransomware or trying to steal people's  banking credentials.  Now there mining bitcoin instead or Monero, another  currency.  Because there is more money in doing that than before where they  were doing things like stealing banking credentials.  </p><p>QUEST:  Good to see you, sir.  Thank you for making it understandable and  helping me follow through.  I appreciate it.  </p><p>DOMAN:  Thank you.  </p><p>QUEST:  As we continue tonight on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, from the boardroom  to the red carpet.  You followed the debate over gender equality.  For  women in the developing world, the fight to be treated as equals is every  bit as real.  And their stories are perps maybe even more inspiring.  CNN  is partnering with the European Journalism Center over the coming year.   Together we're going to show you the challenges these women face.  Whether  it's the classroom or the workplace, think of it in politics or in  healthcare.  We're going to see what's being done to bring down barriers  wherever they exist.  And you can, of course, read more about it and join  in.  Log on to CNN.com/AsEquals where you'll find out more.  </p><p>[16:25:00] When we continue after this short break in the news headlines,  Ford brought the car to everyday driver.  Any color, as long as it's black.   Now city streets are jammed, and the Ford chief executive says he has a  solution.  His first TV interview as chief executive, next.  QUEST MEANS  BUSINESS.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[16:27:39] QUEST:  Hello, I'm Richard Quest.  There's more QUEST MEANS  BUSINESS in a moment.  When Ford's chief executive, in an exclusive  interview, tells us how the company will build smart cities of the future.   And a new name on the top best-sellers list.  Jeff Bezos becomes the  richest man in history.  As we continue tonight, this is CNN, and on this  network, the facts always come first.  </p><p>Breitbart News has just put up a story confirming that Steve Bannon has  left.  He has departed from the news site where he served as executive  chairman since 2012.  The story says Bannon and Breitbart will work on an  orderly transition.  </p><p>The U.S. State Department says it welcomes the two Koreas talks on ensuring  a successful Winter Olympics.  A spokeswoman says U.S. and South Korea  won't stop their campaign of maximum pressure on Pyongyang.  North Korea  says it will send a delegation to the games, and has agreed more talks, and  says it won't discuss the nuclear program.  </p><p>The head of Tunisia's General Labor Union is demanding an exceptional  increase to the minimum wage.  Following days of protest that erupted in  several towns in the country against the high cost of living and taxes.   State media says at least one person has been killed when clashes broke out  between protesters and security forces.  </p><p>The relationship between technology, communications and the automobile  industry has become ever closer.  And you need to see it no further than  the example of this company.  Brought us the assembly line, the Ford Motor  Company of Dearborn, Michigan.</p><p>Ford's chief executive, the new chief exec, says he wants to he wants to  change how our cities work.  Jim Hackett spoke exclusively to CNN in his  first broadcast interview as chief exec.</p><p>[16:30:00] Until now, Ford has focused on getting autonomous cars on the  road, and doing so.  And it's been creating safe self-driving technology.   To do that, you have to build trust in the technology that is embedded  within the automobiles and you have to create a viable business model.   Working with Lyft and delivery services like Postmates.  This year, the  three parts come together, and Ford wants to end congestion, calling for  shared networks of vehicles for all types of people and their businesses.   It will have a dramatic effect on our cities and on Ford's business model.  </p><p>Ford's chief executive is Jim Hackett.  He told Samuel Burke the  switchover, it is connected cars, it is coming sooner than we think.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JIM HACKETT, CEO, FORD MOTO COMPANY:  I want to take you back in history.   You know, the computer was never just about the computer.  It also was  about the networks and the software.  In other words, the whole system that  came around it.  The vehicles are going to be the same way.  So, our  opportunity is making these really smart vehicles, and also the follow-on  services that will be counter cyclical.  That won't die down in a  recession.  </p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN MONEY TECH CORRESPONDENT:  So, walk me through some of  those services.  Does that mean you are going to be installing WIFI on  stoplights, so they can talk to your cars?  What does it mean exactly?</p><p>HACKETT:  An early example that we know is super popular, is vehicle can  find parking spaces.  You know, you lose more fuel efficiency trying to  find a parking place than you do just being stuck on a freeway.  So, the  potential in the future is the parking spot is letting the vehicles know  it's available.  And they're communicating.  In fact, there's no meter maid  in the future, because technology is taking care of the time that you're in  the spot if you have to pay for it </p><p>BURKE:  So, are you going to make those sensors and sell them to people, to  cities?</p><p>HACKETT:  The partnership here is that cities need our help in designing  the relationship, the vehicle to those environments.  The city will own a  big part of the revenue.  But they don't have some of the costs they have  today.  So, they enjoy a partnership with us for that reason.  Ford would  profit in a relationship like that.  </p><p>BURKE:  You have just announced a partnership among many partnerships with  Qualcomm, for instance.  Talking about cell signals with cars.  So, what's  going to come out of that type of partnership, and is cell signal really  the future for cars?  </p><p>HACKETT:  So, the challenge in the design of the system in the past was  your vehicle could only see itself, and it was from the driver's  perspective.  So, if you were in a traffic jam, you couldn't ask the cars  five vehicles in front of you what was happening.  In the future, very  soon, the vehicles are in network, and they're communicating back and  forth.  </p><p>BURKE:  How soon?  </p><p>HACKETT:  Well, that's stuff coming, with the announcement with Qualcomm.   We're working on ideas as we speak.  Things are being tested in markets.   There are some regulatory endorsements we need.  But much sooner than you  might think.  </p><p>BURKE:  Do you see yourself becoming a company that makes a majority of its  money or a plurality of its money from those type services, or do you think  your core revenue will always be self-driving cars, like the ones behind  you?  </p><p>HACKETT:  Well, you know, I get up every day as a mustang owner, and get in  that car and feel the power of that -- the noise, the thrust.  That's a  passion for vehicles that Ford is always going to kind of lean towards.  We  love the fact that people love our vehicles.  This other side, the fact  that we now have this vehicle in a bigger system, promises for us that the  vehicle is going to perform better.  Because the system is smarter.  And  the opportunity for profit is outside now just the vehicle sold.  </p><p>BURKE:  But more money from cars, or more money from the kind of cloud  around the cars?  </p><p>HACKETT:  Well, I think it's probably equal.  </p><p>BURKE:  Yes?  50/50.  </p><p>HACKETT:  And all the projections we have done.  One thing I have seen is  that some people estimate this living street idea that we're announcing  today could be over $10 trillion.  And that's because the operating system  in the cities for transportation gets so big.</p><p>BURKE:  It's interesting.  Your predecessor was a very successful guy.   Many people liked him.  They thought he was a good businessman.  You were  brought in after a rather short tenure from your predecessor to be the guy  who makes Ford into a company?  Is that a fair way to describe your  entrance?  </p><p>HACKETT:  Yes.  Mark Fields had a lot of impact on me.  He was an  exceptionally great executive.  He could execute really difficult things.   I think what I bring is that in the industry I came from, it found itself  where the technology had been feathered but eventually, the technology was  driving the way work was done when I ran Steelcase.  In the future, the  technology in the transportation systems and the vehicles are going to be  so closely matched, that it becomes a new design problem.  And that's where  I have expertise, and I think why I was asked to be brought in.  </p><p>BURKE:  So, who becomes your biggest competitor then?  Is it the tech  companies?  Is it a new tech car company like Tesla?  Is that who see as  the main competition going forward?  </p><p>[16:35:00] HACKETT:  The way I think about competition, this is a great  news moment.  We don't have to see this future I'm describing to anybody.   Because everyone has only had a portion of the system's problem, the tech  companies have had communication protocols or the software.  The car  companies have had the vehicles.  </p><p>Which, by the way, are really complex machines.  A lot of tech companies  that announced they were going to make cars have backed out of it.  So, the  challenge is, the system's integration.  That's something I think we have  as big an opportunity as anyone.  </p><p>BURKE:  Look at the ecosystem right now, of all the companies involved in  self-driving cars, I see a lot of partnerships.  A whole lot.  I would even  venture to call you guys promiscuous.  Are you just trying to partner with  everybody that you can right now?  I mean, you're partnering with Dominos,  for instance.  Is it just, say, hey, let's try and do as much as we can and  see what sticks?  </p><p>HACKETT:  Well, the evolution of the object of the vehicle and the system  that it works in means that you need lots of partnerships to buy in the  open nature.  This is actually an open system, won't be owned by Ford.  We  have made early seed investments that are really special in this area to  create the capability.  But the partners, they want to profit and benefit  from this new technology I mean, this is unlike any time in history,  Samuel, where this technology will change business models.</p><p>BURKE:  So, you're talking about a business model.  I see this car right  behind you which is in a partnership with Domino's pizza.  Are you  partnering with them because you're worried that people won't be buying  cars, individuals so it will be a Domino's Pizza Ford Car that goes around  24 hours a day, so those are the type of partnerships you need to build to  replace an average joe like me buying a car?  </p><p>HACKETT:  When we went to Domino's, Patrick Doyle has done a tremendous job  with that company.  It's a tech company unto itself, not a pizza company.   And we found this interesting fact.  In analog world the pizza is in a  vehicle being driven by people.  And we know how big that number is.  They  are able to monitor that.  And we said what if we use robotic capability?   Could we now bring to customers that we couldn't have before?  The  opportunities are really extraordinary.  So, Ford and Domino's have gone to  the next stage of this, and they'll be making announcements in other  markets of big ideas that we have together.  We have some cool insights.   We found out that people really rather get their pizza from the car rather  than somebody hand it to them.  </p><p>BURKE:  Even people who live in high-rise buildings?  </p><p>HACKETT:  Yes.  They found they would rather come down and not have to put  their shoes on, because they you know, they're on, so to speak, with  somebody they don't know.  The vehicle they don't care about.  They don't  have to interact with it, other than to say give me my pizza.  </p><p>BURKE:  And the same type of partnership, in a way, with Postmates is a  delivery company.  So again, you're trying to see just what's going around  24 hours a day instead of the human driver, the human client of yours,  consumer?  </p><p>HACKETT:  Some of the partners might seem oblique is because you've got to  think about the nature of the way goods are moved today and how dependent  they are on the capacity of a vehicle to get it where it needs to go.  In  fact, they sit in piles.  If you're an object to be delivered, you sit in a  pile waiting to be moved.  That's the bane of their existence.  It's called  dwell time.  In the future, these kinds of systems will move goods  continuously.  Really, they don't have to rest.  Because the object of the  robotic technology is to get the product fulfilled to its customers.  Any  kind of transaction that involves logistics is a market opportunity for us.   As partners.  </p><p>(END OF VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST:  See more from Jim Hackett on tomorrow night's program.  And later  tonight I will be speaking to the chief executive of Harmon which unveiled  its own smart cockpit for cars at CES.  </p><p>More on breaking news.  Breitbart's news just put up a story confirming  Steve Bannon has left the building, so to speak.  Our senior media  correspondent, Brian Stelter is with  me.  Pushed?</p><p>BRAIN STELTER, CNN CHIEF MEDIA CORRESPONDENT:  Pushed pretty hard in the  last few days as a result of what he said to Michael Wolff in the book  \"Fire and Fury.\"   Those quotes came out one week ago.  Bannon was quoted saying the president  acts like a child, quoted saying Don Junior behaved in a treasonous way.</p><p>He was quoted tearing down Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner.  The quotes were  stunning, and they caused the split with the White House that was  unrepairable.  24 hours ago, the White House said there is no way back for  Bannon.  And behind the scenes, there were conversations with the Breitbart  board with his financial backers, the Mercers.  It was made clear Bannon  had to go, and now it's being announced as this smooth transition.  But  make no mistake, he's been pushed out of Breitbart.  </p><p>QUEST:  But Bannon arguably and correct me and jump in, is the true  conservative of the ultra-right.  </p><p>STELTER:  He is the nationalist.  He the true believer, yes.  He believes  that Trump is just an imperfect vessel for his nationalist views.  And  frankly he thinks Trump probably isn't going to work out, so I have to go  off on my own.  </p><p>[16:40:00] QUEST:  Has he brought the house down around his ears and whilst  there may be no way back for him with Donald Trump and this White House, I  mean, what's left for Steve Bannon with the alt-right, far right  conservative movement?  </p><p>STELTER:  The spin for Bannon, the positive case for Bannon is he's going  to devote himself to the movement, to politics, to recruiting candidates  and helping them win elections.  We all remember Alabama, where despite  Bannon helping Roy Moore.  We can't underestimate what a fall this is for  Steve Bannon.  A year ago, he was the incoming chief strategist to the  President of the United States as Trump was about to take office.  </p><p>And over the summer, he has to leave when John Kelly takes over.  He goes  back to Breitbart.  That was a demotion, but at least he was still running  the website.  Now here we are in January, only a week into the new year.   He's been forced out of the job.  At least the proximate cause, because he  was really, really honest with a reporter.  </p><p>QUEST:  Is it Teflon Trump?  Whatever he seemingly does, it doesn't stick.   In the sense that you know, the book excoriates executive time, makes him  seem to be lazy.  He plays golf.  Having criticized President Obama, the  trouble is therefore more it.  He makes more time off than his  predecessors.  He has insulted allies.  And as I see it, like today, he  holds a news conference that we put 50 minutes of him and his cabinet  meeting.  </p><p>STELTER:  Trump has a connection to his audience.  That is sometimes  underestimated.  A connection to his fans to his base of supporters.  That  it is so much bigger it supersedes any concern about how much time he's  watching cable news or whether his tweets are unhinged.</p><p>Steve Bannon thought he was bigger than Trump.  The book \"Fire and Fury\"  makes that clear.  Bannon thought he was going to real president and Trump  was going to be the figure head.  But the reality is, and I think Trump is  and I think Breitbart editors know this, Trump is the person that has the  connection to the base.  And that so far has been an unshakable connection.</p><p>As for Steve Bannon, what's he to do?  Launch a new website.  Currently the  reporting is he's going to focus on politics.  But he is in a much, much  weaker position than he was just a week ago.</p><p>QUEST:  Good to see you, sir.  I appreciate it.  Thank you, as always.  As  we come back, nobody has ever been richer, nobody than Jeff Bezos is now.   And in doing so, he changed the world in the process of getting insanely  rich, more than $105 billion.  Imagine that sort of wealth.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[16:45:00] QUEST:  Jeff Bezos is now the richest person of all-time,  according to Bloomberg.  Amazon's booming share price has propelled Bezos'  wealth to $105 billion.  It beats the high point of Bill Gate's gates'  fortune in 1999.  Jeff Bezos launched Amazon from his garage.  The online  bookstore that went on to revolutionize online  Shopping and then came to move into cloud computing.  This was Amazon web  services, first time somebody had done something like this.  It's now  market leader.  </p><p>It is relied upon by all sorts of companies from big retailers to start  ups.  And more recently, Amazon Studios, a major player in the streaming  market, exclusive, expensive shows like \"The Grand Tour.\"  And still Bezos  continues to fund Blue Origin, which plans to fly tourists into space by  April of next year.  So, Brad Stone is the author of \"The Everything  Store,\" he joins me now from San Francisco.  </p><p>Jeff Bezos, I mean -- I remember years ago interviewing him every quarter  when Amazon had results.  Every quarter.  Without fail.  And he would say - - I would ask about profitability.  He would say it will all happen in  time.  It would all happen in time.  Stop being so short-sighted, Richard,  he would say to me.  But he has done it.  I mean, it's extraordinary.  </p><p>BRAD STONE, AUTHOR, \"THE EVERYTHING STORE\":  Well, one thing he hasn't  done, Richard, is continue to come on TV and talk about his quarterly  earnings.  He's almost invisible these days.  But, yes, you're right.  And  that fortune keeps growing.  And look, I mean, you know, retail in the U.S.  in particular is, you know, flat, growing single digits at best.  People  know that every time they go to the local mall.  E-commerce, maybe 14, 15  percent annual growth.  </p><p>Amazon is a company with a 24, 25 percent growth rate.  So, it is vacuuming  up market share in its core business from other parts of retail.  You know,  people are drawn to the selection and ease of use.  So, it's still a small  minnow in the overall retail pie, but continues to grow.  So, what's scary  is that he's probably going to get even wealthier.  </p><p>QUEST:  OK.  I don't for a moment think that it is the money that is  driving him any more than I suspect you would agree with me.  However, when  you look at the range of things that he's done with the money, the space  adventures, the movie studios, on his private fortune, \"The Washington  Post,\" give me an understanding of the man of what his goal and ambition  is.  </p><p>STONE:  I think he's empire-building.  I think he wants Amazon to be a  historic company that is seen as changing the rules of business.  And so,  he talks in terms of having three pillars for the Amazon business.  One is  Amazon Prime.  One is the marketplace, where small businesses can sell on  Amazon and the third is AWS.  He focuses on and what constantly talks about  is adding more pillars.  And so, you have Amazon Studios as you mentioned.  </p><p>Now, the Alexa business, which is basically creating voice computing,  everywhere is another area focus.  And Amazon is also building an  advertising business.  So, you look around and you see Jeff investing his  time and his resources in building new things.  So, he is an inventor.  But  I think, you know, he sees Amazon in historic terms.  And, you know, not  building size for size sake, but I think he's trying to build Amazon into  the kind of company that perhaps we haven't even seen in the history of  business.  </p><p>QUEST:  What is this reticence for interviews and for public speaking?   Now, again, I remember Bill Gate in the early years.  He was pretty  dreadful at doing interviews.  He did them when he had to, and he didn't  really enjoy them at the time.  But the philanthropy element brought him  out when he realized, if he wanted to advance his agenda, he had to speak  out.  Bezos doesn't see the need.</p><p>STONE:  Yes, and the difference is, he's quite good at it.  He's probably  the savviest and persuasive person to speak on Amazon's behalf.  You know I  think that he thinks of his own strategies, his plans as the kind of secret  sauce.  And he's extremely disciplined.  And as a result, when he does talk  he tends to be repetitive, because he's so unwilling to reveal what he's  really thinking, planning.  But the other thing is back in 2001 when he was  appearing all of the time, he had to convince people that Amazon was a  company worth from, and a stock worth buying.  So, he doesn't have to do  that anymore.  Everyone is already on board.</p><p>QUEST:  Brad, $105 billion.  What would be the first thing you would buy?  </p><p>STONE:  I think you have to start giving it away, and that's actually  what's really to come for Jeff, he's tweeted about being more an active  philanthropist.  We saw a lot of pressure on Bill Gates 15 years ago to up  his philanthropy.  Jeff does a lot.  He funnels a lot of that money into  his private space company, Blue Origin, but he hasn't had the impact of  Bill Gates or John Rockefeller really great philanthropists in the past, so  that is his next act.</p><p>[16:50:00] QUEST:  Thank you, good to see you, sir.  I appreciate your  time.  As we continue to car cockpit from the future was unveiled today,  the chief executive from Harmon on his big announcement at CES.  It's  \"QUEST MEANS BUSINESS,\" live from New York.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  Earlier we told you about Ford's plans to expand their self-driving  car technology.  Now a company owned by Samsung technology unveiled its own  autonomous technology, a smart cockpit with 5-g internet connectivity that  you can see here.  </p><p>The chief executive of Harmon is Harman is Dinesh Paliwal and joins me from  Las Vegas.  All of this technology requires 5-g.  But what are going to  enable me to do?</p><p>DINESH PALIWAL, CEO, HARMON:  Well, Richard, I am glad you asked that  because, look, we are at the forefront of so much explosion in technology.   At the same time, we all suffer, whether at home or in the car, that we are  buffering, we are not able to get in a bandwidth.  The pipes are not big  enough.  So 5g, simply put, is 100 times faster than the current 4g and  LTE.</p><p>And that's the essential building block for autonomous or highly automated  driving.  We have a lot of data coming out of the sensors, the cameras  around the car for the surround view or vehicle-to-vehicle.  But we did not  have the pipes big enough so 5g is a necessity and I'm very happy we just  launched our first 5g telematics and we have been awarded the world's first  award on that, so this is a very important part of the industry.</p><p>QUEST:  The autonomous vehicle.  We're seeing more and more.  This is  clearly the future.  I wonder, when do you think, sir, it becomes the norm?  </p><p>PALIWAL:  So, this is a journey, the way I see it, we have technology  available today in a controlled environment.  We could have cars driven  autonomously.  However, for the real-world application we are sometime  away.  So, the will that be lots of incremental and exponential development  happening like here at Samsung Harmon we just launched driveline which is  the first open architecture autonomous platform.</p><p>That means is bringing a lot of inputs from front facing and rear cameras  and the lidar and other sensors, in analyzing it.  And with 5g, with Ota,  over the update from the cloud and cyber security.  These are the building  blocks coming together to allow automation, eventually leading up to fully  autonomous commercial applications.  </p><p>QUEST:  OK.  But this issue of security.  Last night we had the chief  executive of blackberry on program, this issue of security has not been  solved yet, has it?</p><p>[16:25:00] PALIWAL:  It has not been solved.  I'm glad you are raising that  issue. So publicly we need to talk about.  Because we talk about connectivity, but  we seldom talk about cybersecurity, in the throat of unintended intruders  coming in.  So that is the one area where we have a lot of work to do, and  we had Harmon actually for even Samsung acquisitions, invested in Israeli  and American companies for cybersecurity.  And right now, we have 30  million cars on the road which are utilizing this technology.</p><p>QUEST:  Good to see you, Sir.  Congratulations.  Thank you for joining us  from CES.</p><p>PALIWAL:  Great.  Thank you.  </p><p>QUEST:  Let me remind you, before we finish tonight, all three major  indices rose to records, the Dow, S&amp;P and Nasdaq.  For the S&amp;P and Nasdaq,  it was the sixth consecutive day of records.  </p><p>We will take a short break.  And have a Profitable Moment on the other  side.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  Tonight's Profitable Moment.  Klaus Schwab and those WEF must be  absolutely beside themselves with the announcement tonight that Donald  Trump and half the cabinet are going to the World Economic Forum in two  weeks.  So, what to make of it?  Having called that because those who go  there, or Steve Bannon did, the gutless elite.  Now he is joining them.  Is  that what has happened?  Is this the final sand in the eye for Steve  Bannon?  I don't think so.  Not a bit of it.  This is Donald Trump's  victory lap.  He goes to Davos and it is a version that they did at the  United Nations of America first.  We don't care if you don't like it this  is what we are going to do.  Oh, and by the way, I won.  That is what this  is going to be about in Davos.  Come with us, follow us, do what you like,  but the rules have changed with regard to the United States.  That is what  is going to tell them in Davos.  Watch my words.</p><p>And that's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight.  I'm Richard Quest in New  York.  Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead I hope it's profitable.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and programming copyright 2018 Cable News Network, Inc.  ALL  RIGHTS  RESERVED.

Not surprisingly, the Dow actually just giving back a little bit, but not surprisingly, a rousing session. We have records in all three major indices and records in Europe. Let's see if he does justice. Four, five, six, seven -- I think that's called over-egging the pudding. But trading is over. Records on the market. We'll put it all in perspective. Today is Tuesday. It is the 9th of January.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tonight, President Trump goes to Davos. The president is going to the World Economic Forum to be amongst the elite he supposedly despises. A television exclusive with the chief executive of Ford. Jim Hackett shares his plans to build smart cities. You'll hear that in half an hour. And prime mover, Amazon's Jeff Bezos becomes the world's richest man ever. I'm Richard Quest, live in the world's financial capital, New York, where, of course, I mean business.</p><p>Good evening, tonight we've just shown you U.S. markets have closed at all- time records once again. And Donald Trump wants to continue the momentum of his economic America-first message. He's going to the World Economic Forum in Davos, and when he does so, he will obviously be boasting about the state, the speed and the growth of the U.S. economy.</p><p>But it is the event where he's going that is raising eyebrows. The annual meeting of the political elites. The heads of the global corporations and the uber-super rich. Now, you could argue they helped fuel Donald Trump's populist movement. Tonight, the president has decided to join them. The decision to attend in Davos took everyone by surprise. The last president to go was Bill Clinton in 2000. The White House confirmed the trip in the last hour.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The president will attend, and he welcomes the opportunity to go there and advance his America-first agenda with world leader and he is very much looking forward to being part of that process.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: David Gergen is with me, CNN senior political analyst. You've been to Davos more than once or twice.</p><p>DAVID GERGEN, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: I think you and I probably have been too many times. About 20 times a piece.</p><p>QUEST: Absolutely. OK. Why is he going? Because pre-presidency, I would have said this is the perfect place for a man with golf courses, private jets, multiple homes. But this idea of draining the swamp, anti- establishment. He's going to the heart of it.</p><p>GERGEN: Absolutely. But I think it's a smart move. Listen, he's going to have the world stage for 45 minutes to an hour. Everybody is going to be tuning in. And he has a chance to make his case for the American economy and take credit for these -- you know, these arousing numbers on the stock market and unemployment rate going down, all the rest you've been reporting on here. He thinks he's not getting sufficient credit. He's not getting sufficient attention. He's mired in the Mueller investigation. Questions about his fitness in office and all of the rest of it. This is an opportunity to try to change the spotlight back to where he wants. Now, I do think there's a question. Is he playing to the home base crowd? In which case he's going to be the tough on trade, tough on immigration, or is he going to try to play to the international.</p><p>QUEST: Now, that's the fascinating part about this. Does he go there to blow up the house and say a plague on all of you, and America's change we're no longer going to -- if we look at his recent speeches, they've all had this message. Take, for example, we don't care how you vote at the United Nations. Which do you think we're going to see? A blow them up or we want you with us?</p><p>GERGEN: I think he's going to go for pleasing his base. It's been his instinct.</p><p>QUEST: A plague on all your houses.</p><p>GERGEN: Well, yes. And being tough. He will say -- he will have some grace notes. He'd say we want to get along with everybody, we want to love you, and America is doing some wonderful things for the world. But I think he still sees the most important challenge of his coming year is keeping control of the House of Representatives, keeping control of Congress so he can get more of his agenda done.</p><p>QUEST: We have seen today an extraordinary meeting. He's --</p><p>GERGEN: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: -- on immigration. He allowed the cameras to stay in there for 45 minutes while he effectively debated his immigration policy with others who didn't agree with him.</p><p>[16:05:04] What was behind it?</p><p>GERGEN: I thought it was a pretty smart move. It was weird, but it was a good weird. In the sense that it allowed the -- it was like 50 minutes.</p><p>QUEST: Yes.</p><p>GERGEN: It allowed us all to sort of tune in on what, you know, it was a cabinet meeting. Interesting television. Very importantly, Richard, I thought was the clips that have come out of it so far have shown Trump being pretty articulate. And at a time when people think he may be going bonkers or he's losing it in there, this helped to put some of that to rest, I think.</p><p>QUEST: That's what this was about, wasn't it? There was nothing -- there was nothing accidental about allowing the cameras in. And it probably was him who decided to do it. Because the man is a media mastermind genius.</p><p>GERGEN: Yes. Let's be careful about that word genius.</p><p>QUEST: Deliberate.</p><p>GERGEN: I know. He does have a sixth sense. He is a very good salesman. That is his strength.</p><p>QUEST: So, he shows the world, I'm going to debate, I'm going to engage, any idea that the time -- I'm losing it, people will see I've got all the arguments.</p><p>GERGEN: Right, right. And it was enough. Listen, I am sure there are other days -- if you go back and read the transcript with the \"New York Times\" reporter who went in and talked to him, you know, impromptu fashion at Mar-a-Lago, that's basically incoherent. And highly repetitive. The word collusion comes up, you know, every third word. There's collusion, every phrase. But this Donald Trump was actually, you know, articulate and he looked like he was in charge. And it was interesting. He is -- let's go back to Davos.</p><p>QUEST: Yes, please.</p><p>GERGEN: He's taking about half his cabinet with him. They have a very large contingent of the economic side of the house, which I think you can expect secretary of the treasury. You can expect Gary Cohn, Wilbur Ross out of commerce. Lighthizer out of trade. I think there is going to be a big delegation. It's very unusual for America to go with this big a delegation. But last year you remember Davos, the big, big speech came from the leader of China.</p><p>QUEST: I was there.</p><p>GERGEN: Yes. And it was pick up the flag, America is retweeting. We're going to pick up the flag. We're going to be in charge of trade. We're going to lead the way on trade. We're going to lead the way on environment. And now this is Trump's moment to go head-to-head with Xi as world leader. I think he's going to play for his base, as I say, rather than trying to seize the flag back.</p><p>QUEST: You're getting this?</p><p>GERGEN: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: I shall see you.</p><p>GERGEN: I look forward to it.</p><p>QUEST: We'll swap tips for keeping warm.</p><p>GERGEN: Absolutely.</p><p>QUEST: Thank you.</p><p>GERGEN: OK, thank you.</p><p>QUEST: Let's go to the trading post where we need to show exactly what happed in a day, and remarkable day as David Gergen was saying. So, we have records. First of all, three records. Green is the order of the day. Lots of green. As much green damage you can give me today. We've got the Dow of a record. We've got the S&amp;P at a record. We've got the Nasdaq at a record. So, my first duty, of course, is to change these numbers for you. So, the Dow now goes to 4. The S&amp;P and the Nasdaq both go to 6. But there's more, because not only did we have records -- so writings not as good as it should be -- over in Europe. We have a record on the FTSE, which goes to 3. And in Zurich, we have the SMI, which goes to 2.</p><p>Now, this would be remarkable in any scenario. But to have 4, 6 and 6 records on the Dow, the Nasdaq and the S&amp;P when we're only in the second trading day of the year, this is something that clearly has to be dealt with by Paul La Monica, who understands exactly what we're talking about. And why we're seeing such remarkable records so quickly.</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNNMONEY CORRESPONDENT: Yes. I think one thing to just noted obviously, is that we're still waiting for earnings. That's going to really kick in later this week, with JPMorgan Chase and some other big banks. There is not a heck of a lot of news out there yet, and volume is low, which I know trades pointed out to you on the \"EXPRESS\" show earlier today. So, the reason why I think stocks are still hitting all these records, though, is that there is legitimate optimism about what profits are going to look like in 2018. And it's a combination of tax reform, but also real fundamentals. Because this rally is broadening out. It's not just tech any more.</p><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p>LA MONICA: Boeing is at an all-time high. Union Pacific is at an all-time high.</p><p>QUEST: Let's look at Boeing, because we have the Dow higher -- twice as high as the gain on the Dow as the S&amp;P and Nasdaq. And Boeing, of course, is the largest component. And you see this -- why has Boeing suddenly put on about 6 or 7 percent in a matter of a few days? From 296 to 318, 20 since January the 1st. Why?</p><p>LA MONICA: It's a stunning move. Today they announced that they had extremely solid deliveries of commercial aircraft last year. And I think that's what people were expecting.</p><p>[16:10:00] Everyone knows that Boeing is doing really well in the aviation business right now. And that is something that is going to probably keep this stock going higher. I mean, there is the defense side of the Boeing coin, as well. But it's just commercial jets. That business is booming. And they're stealing share from Airbus, and that's helping them.</p><p>QUEST: And they'll get some 6,000 aircraft. Look at the Dow 30 and give us an interception. As we take a look and see exactly how the 30 stocks within the Dow Jones Industrials have traded. We see -- oh my goodness, gracious me. Dear old GE, the laggard from last year. It's trying. It's trying to do something.</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes. GE, I think there is a hope that under new management that they will kind of right-size that ship, if you will. But look at the rest of the Dow here, and this is a broad rally, again. You don't see any big tech leaders there. You've got Boeing, GE, J&amp;J, United Tech, Travelers, Caterpillar. Takes a while before you see where tech did today, and it's IBM, which is the stodgiest of tech out there in the Dow. But tech is off to a hot start this year, as well. This is a nice rally across the board.</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you.</p><p>LA MONICA: Thank you.</p><p>QUEST: Thank you very much indeed.</p><p>I need to bring you some breaking news. Steve Bannon is stepping down from Breitbart news. It's just been announced. We're not sure the reasons, whether it was because he was pushed out or decided to step down or the sponsors decided. We'll bring you more on that as the program moves on.</p><p>Staying with the main theme of the day, though, markets and economies, the World Bank says the global economy is at a turning point. It just released its report on global economic prospects. Shows global growth stronger than expected. Franziska Ohnsorge is the banks lead economist on that report. She joins me from London. We know that we are seeing synchronistic growth between the major economies at the moment, which is the first time in a decade, at least, that we've enjoyed this sort of thing. But if I understand your report right, it's going to get faster.</p><p>FRANZISKA OHNSORGE, WORLD BANK DEVELOPMENT PROSPECTS GROUP: Yes. Global growth has solid momentum now. We expect it to tick up a little bit in 2018 to 3.1 percent. The broader line last year was 3 percent. And it's a broad-based recovery, as investment led by advanced economies. But it's a cyclical recovery. And cyclical recoveries come, and they do eventually fade. What our main concern is, where growth ends up once this cyclical recovery fades.</p><p>QUEST: But hang on. A cyclical recovery is the norm. You get a cyclical recovery after a period of recession or downturn. We arguably -- I know what the point you're making is, that we should be seeing more of a structural recovery. But arguably, that already happened in the '09, '10, '11 post-recession.</p><p>OHNSORGE: Yes, this recovery from this post-crisis low in 2016 of 2.4 percent growth has taken longer to materialize than we had expected. For years we had to revise our forecast downward and we were disappointed. Finally, now, there seems to be a turning point where we have to revise our forecasts up. But it will fade. And when it fades, and growth returns to its long-term sustainable growth, our concern is that kind of growth would be about a percentage point less than it was ten years ago.</p><p>QUEST: Right. But it's inevitable. The faster rate of growth will dwindle. That is inevitable. I'm not sure what it is that the World Bank now wants to ensure a higher level of sustainable growth.</p><p>OHNSORGE: It is inevitable that it fades. The question is, where does it fade to? Ten years ago, we would have thought that, for example, emerging market and developing economy growth would have faded to about 4.8 percent. Nowadays, it would be more something like 4.3 percent. So, there's lots of room for disappointments.</p><p>QUEST: Which is the biggest -- what is the biggest concern for you on the economic horizon? Is it firstly, say Brexit and dislocation within the EU? Is it the U.S. president's trade policies? Is it something that I'm not considering? What is the worry that you have?</p><p>OHNSORGE: In the medium to long-term, of course, is potential growth. But in the shorter term, there are any number of risks. And that could be political risk, that could be -- surprises along the process of Brexit. The main worry is the financial markets seem very vulnerable to a correction. Asset evaluations around the world are very high and bond yields are at record lows around the world, not just advanced economies.</p><p>[16:15:00] QUEST: Yes, but the only problem is, we have been saying that for the last five years, four years. And if we had followed the advice of economists, many of us would not show the gains in pensions and portfolios.</p><p>OHNSORGE: It's true that what would have upset -- upset financial markets five years ago, say geopolitical concerns in Asia, or the talk of sanctions, now doesn't seem to have any effect on financial markets. But there could be a turning point where suddenly they correct.</p><p>QUEST: Excellent to have you on the program. Thank you. Joining us on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, really appreciate it. Please come back again. We need to talk more about these issues. Thank you.</p><p>Coming up on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, South Korea's sanctions against the North could be eased. Both sides are making Olympic overtures. We'll have Will Ripley who is in South Korea after the break. There is green on all the markets.</p><p>QUEST: A dramatic breakthrough in talks between North and South Korea, which could lead to sanctions on Pyongyang being relaxed. After the North's decision to take part in next month's Winter Olympics in Seoul, the -- in South Korea, the South says it will consider lifting sanctions temporarily. Japan has hailed North Korea's decision on the Olympics as a change in attitude. Now turn back the clock, and you'll see a pattern of talks since missile tests back in 2006.</p><p>Join me at the super screens, and you'll see what I mean. These are the lists of North Korea talks. So, you've got September 2007. You then have got July and December 2008. And a long gap into February 2014, August 2015, and now January 2018. Will Ripley is near the DMZ, where, I mean, I sympathize. It looks freezing there tonight. The issue -- why are they talking? What has driven this? Is it what everybody says? Is it the U.S. hard line?</p><p>WILL RIPLEY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The North Koreans would never admit to that, Richard. But clearly, with sanctions kicking in this year, you can't deny the fact that when you're cutting a country's oil imports and nearly all of their export revenue. They need something to change before their economy takes a drastic hit. And so, that could be a motivating factor. Also, the Olympic are maybe perhaps a short window for diplomacy that both sides recognize. Which is why we saw those talks take place.</p><p>QUEST: You are an expert on North Korea, Will. Is it your feeling that they are playing everybody in the sense of let Donald Trump think he is having a minor victory over this hard line, and then do something with an atomic blast or a nuclear test or whatever?</p><p>RIPLEY: I actually don't think that they're trying to make Donald Trump think he has a victory.</p><p>[16:20:00] Because the North Koreans said at the end of yesterday's meetings that their nuclear weapons are pointed directly at the United States and not South Korea or China or Russia. So, if anything, they're trying to drive a wedge between these countries and the United States as opposed to trying to appease the United States or making them feel like they won a victory.</p><p>QUEST: All right, Will, finally, just point out where you are and what might be there. You're near the DMZ. What are we looking at?</p><p>RIPLEY: Right. So, the de militarized zone, we're right along the DMZ. North Korea, just a bit over that way. It's still dark out here. We are just a few minutes away from the Panmunjom truce village, where those talk were taking place. This is the location of other talks previously. The last time they had talks there, just over two year ago, they lasted 44 hours. This time around, they hammered out a number of deals in one day. It's really remarkable. And it shows that both sides, the North and the South really came to the table ready to make a deal on the Olympics.</p><p>QUEST: It looks very cold there. I'm sure you should have a hat on in those cold weather. All right. Will Ripley, thank you very much. Go and get yourself warm. At least buy a hat. Thank you.</p><p>A new report says North Korea is trying to compensate for the tight sanctions placed upon it by mining cryptocurrencies. It suggests software was installed to channel coins into a server at this North Korean University. Chris Doman is a threat engineer at the cybersecurity firm AlienVault, which was behind the report. He's in London. Good to see you, sir. This is fascinating. So, you're saying that the North basically mined bitcoin or others with a view to what, raising revenue?</p><p>CHRIS DOMAN, THREAT ENGINEER, ALIENVAULT: Yes. This is part of a minor set of attacks. We saw this being sent directly to that university in Pyongyang. It's unusually direct. But this comes on the heels of last week, there was a report that the Korean government. They saw North Korean hacker hacking into some networks, and in that case also mining the cryptocurrency. And Kaspersky saw some of the things too. This has been going on for about a year now.</p><p>QUEST: Now when you said they've been mining them, have they been mining them legitimately. Is there anything intrinsically wrong with what they have been doing, other than the fact that it is surprising that North Korea has been doing it?</p><p>DOMAN: It's a really good question. So, we weren't sure at first. We saw it being sent to that center in Pyongyang. But maybe this was the university doing it themselves. It was malicious, they did try to hide. And then later today someone else found some very closely related malware, same people, same Monero wallet. And that was infecting people in South Korea. Combined with that, there have been other attacks that have hacked into networks to install similar software.</p><p>QUEST: So, I'm not really fully understanding what they are doing. Are they mining legitimately like we visited many bitcoin mines over the years, or are they going in and stealing other people's bitcoins or some nefarious version of all?</p><p>DOMAN: Yes, it's all three. So, what we're looking at being sent to that server at a university that may well be legitimate. But then it's also quite clear it's stuff not hacking into people's machines to mine that Monero. Then as you said, there has always been hacking into exchanges and things too to steal the coins once they've already been mined. So, all three.</p><p>QUEST: When we look at what's happening to cryptocurrencies and the whole blockchain phenomenon, we are struggling to understand, or at least I am, struggling to understand what people like yourself believe the true role of cryptocurrencies is in the future.</p><p>DOMAN: Well, I have a very biased perspective. My job is to look at malware every day. And every day I see more and bitcoin malware. If you track a graph of the price of bitcoin along with how much malware we see, targeting bitcoin it's almost a direct correlation. But I think other people --</p><p>QUEST: Explain what you mean by that. In terms of the relationship between the malware and the price, or what you're seeing in the bitcoin market.</p><p>DOMAN: Yes. If you draw that graph, they go together. So, the higher the price of bitcoin, the more people move to targeting bitcoin. So, people that before when everything was ransomware or trying to steal people's banking credentials. Now there mining bitcoin instead or Monero, another currency. Because there is more money in doing that than before where they were doing things like stealing banking credentials.</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you, sir. Thank you for making it understandable and helping me follow through. I appreciate it.</p><p>DOMAN: Thank you.</p><p>QUEST: As we continue tonight on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, from the boardroom to the red carpet. You followed the debate over gender equality. For women in the developing world, the fight to be treated as equals is every bit as real. And their stories are perps maybe even more inspiring. CNN is partnering with the European Journalism Center over the coming year. Together we're going to show you the challenges these women face. Whether it's the classroom or the workplace, think of it in politics or in healthcare. We're going to see what's being done to bring down barriers wherever they exist. And you can, of course, read more about it and join in. Log on to CNN.com/AsEquals where you'll find out more.</p><p>[16:25:00] When we continue after this short break in the news headlines, Ford brought the car to everyday driver. Any color, as long as it's black. Now city streets are jammed, and the Ford chief executive says he has a solution. His first TV interview as chief executive, next. QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p>[16:27:39] QUEST: Hello, I'm Richard Quest. There's more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in a moment. When Ford's chief executive, in an exclusive interview, tells us how the company will build smart cities of the future. And a new name on the top best-sellers list. Jeff Bezos becomes the richest man in history. As we continue tonight, this is CNN, and on this network, the facts always come first.</p><p>Breitbart News has just put up a story confirming that Steve Bannon has left. He has departed from the news site where he served as executive chairman since 2012. The story says Bannon and Breitbart will work on an orderly transition.</p><p>The U.S. State Department says it welcomes the two Koreas talks on ensuring a successful Winter Olympics. A spokeswoman says U.S. and South Korea won't stop their campaign of maximum pressure on Pyongyang. North Korea says it will send a delegation to the games, and has agreed more talks, and says it won't discuss the nuclear program.</p><p>The head of Tunisia's General Labor Union is demanding an exceptional increase to the minimum wage. Following days of protest that erupted in several towns in the country against the high cost of living and taxes. State media says at least one person has been killed when clashes broke out between protesters and security forces.</p><p>The relationship between technology, communications and the automobile industry has become ever closer. And you need to see it no further than the example of this company. Brought us the assembly line, the Ford Motor Company of Dearborn, Michigan.</p><p>Ford's chief executive, the new chief exec, says he wants to he wants to change how our cities work. Jim Hackett spoke exclusively to CNN in his first broadcast interview as chief exec.</p><p>[16:30:00] Until now, Ford has focused on getting autonomous cars on the road, and doing so. And it's been creating safe self-driving technology. To do that, you have to build trust in the technology that is embedded within the automobiles and you have to create a viable business model. Working with Lyft and delivery services like Postmates. This year, the three parts come together, and Ford wants to end congestion, calling for shared networks of vehicles for all types of people and their businesses. It will have a dramatic effect on our cities and on Ford's business model.</p><p>Ford's chief executive is Jim Hackett. He told Samuel Burke the switchover, it is connected cars, it is coming sooner than we think.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JIM HACKETT, CEO, FORD MOTO COMPANY: I want to take you back in history. You know, the computer was never just about the computer. It also was about the networks and the software. In other words, the whole system that came around it. The vehicles are going to be the same way. So, our opportunity is making these really smart vehicles, and also the follow-on services that will be counter cyclical. That won't die down in a recession.</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN MONEY TECH CORRESPONDENT: So, walk me through some of those services. Does that mean you are going to be installing WIFI on stoplights, so they can talk to your cars? What does it mean exactly?</p><p>HACKETT: An early example that we know is super popular, is vehicle can find parking spaces. You know, you lose more fuel efficiency trying to find a parking place than you do just being stuck on a freeway. So, the potential in the future is the parking spot is letting the vehicles know it's available. And they're communicating. In fact, there's no meter maid in the future, because technology is taking care of the time that you're in the spot if you have to pay for it</p><p>BURKE: So, are you going to make those sensors and sell them to people, to cities?</p><p>HACKETT: The partnership here is that cities need our help in designing the relationship, the vehicle to those environments. The city will own a big part of the revenue. But they don't have some of the costs they have today. So, they enjoy a partnership with us for that reason. Ford would profit in a relationship like that.</p><p>BURKE: You have just announced a partnership among many partnerships with Qualcomm, for instance. Talking about cell signals with cars. So, what's going to come out of that type of partnership, and is cell signal really the future for cars?</p><p>HACKETT: So, the challenge in the design of the system in the past was your vehicle could only see itself, and it was from the driver's perspective. So, if you were in a traffic jam, you couldn't ask the cars five vehicles in front of you what was happening. In the future, very soon, the vehicles are in network, and they're communicating back and forth.</p><p>BURKE: How soon?</p><p>HACKETT: Well, that's stuff coming, with the announcement with Qualcomm. We're working on ideas as we speak. Things are being tested in markets. There are some regulatory endorsements we need. But much sooner than you might think.</p><p>BURKE: Do you see yourself becoming a company that makes a majority of its money or a plurality of its money from those type services, or do you think your core revenue will always be self-driving cars, like the ones behind you?</p><p>HACKETT: Well, you know, I get up every day as a mustang owner, and get in that car and feel the power of that -- the noise, the thrust. That's a passion for vehicles that Ford is always going to kind of lean towards. We love the fact that people love our vehicles. This other side, the fact that we now have this vehicle in a bigger system, promises for us that the vehicle is going to perform better. Because the system is smarter. And the opportunity for profit is outside now just the vehicle sold.</p><p>BURKE: But more money from cars, or more money from the kind of cloud around the cars?</p><p>HACKETT: Well, I think it's probably equal.</p><p>BURKE: Yes? 50/50.</p><p>HACKETT: And all the projections we have done. One thing I have seen is that some people estimate this living street idea that we're announcing today could be over $10 trillion. And that's because the operating system in the cities for transportation gets so big.</p><p>BURKE: It's interesting. Your predecessor was a very successful guy. Many people liked him. They thought he was a good businessman. You were brought in after a rather short tenure from your predecessor to be the guy who makes Ford into a company? Is that a fair way to describe your entrance?</p><p>HACKETT: Yes. Mark Fields had a lot of impact on me. He was an exceptionally great executive. He could execute really difficult things. I think what I bring is that in the industry I came from, it found itself where the technology had been feathered but eventually, the technology was driving the way work was done when I ran Steelcase. In the future, the technology in the transportation systems and the vehicles are going to be so closely matched, that it becomes a new design problem. And that's where I have expertise, and I think why I was asked to be brought in.</p><p>BURKE: So, who becomes your biggest competitor then? Is it the tech companies? Is it a new tech car company like Tesla? Is that who see as the main competition going forward?</p><p>[16:35:00] HACKETT: The way I think about competition, this is a great news moment. We don't have to see this future I'm describing to anybody. Because everyone has only had a portion of the system's problem, the tech companies have had communication protocols or the software. The car companies have had the vehicles.</p><p>Which, by the way, are really complex machines. A lot of tech companies that announced they were going to make cars have backed out of it. So, the challenge is, the system's integration. That's something I think we have as big an opportunity as anyone.</p><p>BURKE: Look at the ecosystem right now, of all the companies involved in self-driving cars, I see a lot of partnerships. A whole lot. I would even venture to call you guys promiscuous. Are you just trying to partner with everybody that you can right now? I mean, you're partnering with Dominos, for instance. Is it just, say, hey, let's try and do as much as we can and see what sticks?</p><p>HACKETT: Well, the evolution of the object of the vehicle and the system that it works in means that you need lots of partnerships to buy in the open nature. This is actually an open system, won't be owned by Ford. We have made early seed investments that are really special in this area to create the capability. But the partners, they want to profit and benefit from this new technology I mean, this is unlike any time in history, Samuel, where this technology will change business models.</p><p>BURKE: So, you're talking about a business model. I see this car right behind you which is in a partnership with Domino's pizza. Are you partnering with them because you're worried that people won't be buying cars, individuals so it will be a Domino's Pizza Ford Car that goes around 24 hours a day, so those are the type of partnerships you need to build to replace an average joe like me buying a car?</p><p>HACKETT: When we went to Domino's, Patrick Doyle has done a tremendous job with that company. It's a tech company unto itself, not a pizza company. And we found this interesting fact. In analog world the pizza is in a vehicle being driven by people. And we know how big that number is. They are able to monitor that. And we said what if we use robotic capability? Could we now bring to customers that we couldn't have before? The opportunities are really extraordinary. So, Ford and Domino's have gone to the next stage of this, and they'll be making announcements in other markets of big ideas that we have together. We have some cool insights. We found out that people really rather get their pizza from the car rather than somebody hand it to them.</p><p>BURKE: Even people who live in high-rise buildings?</p><p>HACKETT: Yes. They found they would rather come down and not have to put their shoes on, because they you know, they're on, so to speak, with somebody they don't know. The vehicle they don't care about. They don't have to interact with it, other than to say give me my pizza.</p><p>BURKE: And the same type of partnership, in a way, with Postmates is a delivery company. So again, you're trying to see just what's going around 24 hours a day instead of the human driver, the human client of yours, consumer?</p><p>HACKETT: Some of the partners might seem oblique is because you've got to think about the nature of the way goods are moved today and how dependent they are on the capacity of a vehicle to get it where it needs to go. In fact, they sit in piles. If you're an object to be delivered, you sit in a pile waiting to be moved. That's the bane of their existence. It's called dwell time. In the future, these kinds of systems will move goods continuously. Really, they don't have to rest. Because the object of the robotic technology is to get the product fulfilled to its customers. Any kind of transaction that involves logistics is a market opportunity for us. As partners.</p><p>(END OF VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: See more from Jim Hackett on tomorrow night's program. And later tonight I will be speaking to the chief executive of Harmon which unveiled its own smart cockpit for cars at CES.</p><p>More on breaking news. Breitbart's news just put up a story confirming Steve Bannon has left the building, so to speak. Our senior media correspondent, Brian Stelter is with me. Pushed?</p><p>BRAIN STELTER, CNN CHIEF MEDIA CORRESPONDENT: Pushed pretty hard in the last few days as a result of what he said to Michael Wolff in the book \"Fire and Fury.\" Those quotes came out one week ago. Bannon was quoted saying the president acts like a child, quoted saying Don Junior behaved in a treasonous way.</p><p>He was quoted tearing down Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner. The quotes were stunning, and they caused the split with the White House that was unrepairable. 24 hours ago, the White House said there is no way back for Bannon. And behind the scenes, there were conversations with the Breitbart board with his financial backers, the Mercers. It was made clear Bannon had to go, and now it's being announced as this smooth transition. But make no mistake, he's been pushed out of Breitbart.</p><p>QUEST: But Bannon arguably and correct me and jump in, is the true conservative of the ultra-right.</p><p>STELTER: He is the nationalist. He the true believer, yes. He believes that Trump is just an imperfect vessel for his nationalist views. And frankly he thinks Trump probably isn't going to work out, so I have to go off on my own.</p><p>[16:40:00] QUEST: Has he brought the house down around his ears and whilst there may be no way back for him with Donald Trump and this White House, I mean, what's left for Steve Bannon with the alt-right, far right conservative movement?</p><p>STELTER: The spin for Bannon, the positive case for Bannon is he's going to devote himself to the movement, to politics, to recruiting candidates and helping them win elections. We all remember Alabama, where despite Bannon helping Roy Moore. We can't underestimate what a fall this is for Steve Bannon. A year ago, he was the incoming chief strategist to the President of the United States as Trump was about to take office.</p><p>And over the summer, he has to leave when John Kelly takes over. He goes back to Breitbart. That was a demotion, but at least he was still running the website. Now here we are in January, only a week into the new year. He's been forced out of the job. At least the proximate cause, because he was really, really honest with a reporter.</p><p>QUEST: Is it Teflon Trump? Whatever he seemingly does, it doesn't stick. In the sense that you know, the book excoriates executive time, makes him seem to be lazy. He plays golf. Having criticized President Obama, the trouble is therefore more it. He makes more time off than his predecessors. He has insulted allies. And as I see it, like today, he holds a news conference that we put 50 minutes of him and his cabinet meeting.</p><p>STELTER: Trump has a connection to his audience. That is sometimes underestimated. A connection to his fans to his base of supporters. That it is so much bigger it supersedes any concern about how much time he's watching cable news or whether his tweets are unhinged.</p><p>Steve Bannon thought he was bigger than Trump. The book \"Fire and Fury\" makes that clear. Bannon thought he was going to real president and Trump was going to be the figure head. But the reality is, and I think Trump is and I think Breitbart editors know this, Trump is the person that has the connection to the base. And that so far has been an unshakable connection.</p><p>As for Steve Bannon, what's he to do? Launch a new website. Currently the reporting is he's going to focus on politics. But he is in a much, much weaker position than he was just a week ago.</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you, sir. I appreciate it. Thank you, as always. As we come back, nobody has ever been richer, nobody than Jeff Bezos is now. And in doing so, he changed the world in the process of getting insanely rich, more than $105 billion. Imagine that sort of wealth.</p><p>[16:45:00] QUEST: Jeff Bezos is now the richest person of all-time, according to Bloomberg. Amazon's booming share price has propelled Bezos' wealth to $105 billion. It beats the high point of Bill Gate's gates' fortune in 1999. Jeff Bezos launched Amazon from his garage. The online bookstore that went on to revolutionize online Shopping and then came to move into cloud computing. This was Amazon web services, first time somebody had done something like this. It's now market leader.</p><p>It is relied upon by all sorts of companies from big retailers to start ups. And more recently, Amazon Studios, a major player in the streaming market, exclusive, expensive shows like \"The Grand Tour.\" And still Bezos continues to fund Blue Origin, which plans to fly tourists into space by April of next year. So, Brad Stone is the author of \"The Everything Store,\" he joins me now from San Francisco.</p><p>Jeff Bezos, I mean -- I remember years ago interviewing him every quarter when Amazon had results. Every quarter. Without fail. And he would say - - I would ask about profitability. He would say it will all happen in time. It would all happen in time. Stop being so short-sighted, Richard, he would say to me. But he has done it. I mean, it's extraordinary.</p><p>BRAD STONE, AUTHOR, \"THE EVERYTHING STORE\": Well, one thing he hasn't done, Richard, is continue to come on TV and talk about his quarterly earnings. He's almost invisible these days. But, yes, you're right. And that fortune keeps growing. And look, I mean, you know, retail in the U.S. in particular is, you know, flat, growing single digits at best. People know that every time they go to the local mall. E-commerce, maybe 14, 15 percent annual growth.</p><p>Amazon is a company with a 24, 25 percent growth rate. So, it is vacuuming up market share in its core business from other parts of retail. You know, people are drawn to the selection and ease of use. So, it's still a small minnow in the overall retail pie, but continues to grow. So, what's scary is that he's probably going to get even wealthier.</p><p>QUEST: OK. I don't for a moment think that it is the money that is driving him any more than I suspect you would agree with me. However, when you look at the range of things that he's done with the money, the space adventures, the movie studios, on his private fortune, \"The Washington Post,\" give me an understanding of the man of what his goal and ambition is.</p><p>STONE: I think he's empire-building. I think he wants Amazon to be a historic company that is seen as changing the rules of business. And so, he talks in terms of having three pillars for the Amazon business. One is Amazon Prime. One is the marketplace, where small businesses can sell on Amazon and the third is AWS. He focuses on and what constantly talks about is adding more pillars. And so, you have Amazon Studios as you mentioned.</p><p>Now, the Alexa business, which is basically creating voice computing, everywhere is another area focus. And Amazon is also building an advertising business. So, you look around and you see Jeff investing his time and his resources in building new things. So, he is an inventor. But I think, you know, he sees Amazon in historic terms. And, you know, not building size for size sake, but I think he's trying to build Amazon into the kind of company that perhaps we haven't even seen in the history of business.</p><p>QUEST: What is this reticence for interviews and for public speaking? Now, again, I remember Bill Gate in the early years. He was pretty dreadful at doing interviews. He did them when he had to, and he didn't really enjoy them at the time. But the philanthropy element brought him out when he realized, if he wanted to advance his agenda, he had to speak out. Bezos doesn't see the need.</p><p>STONE: Yes, and the difference is, he's quite good at it. He's probably the savviest and persuasive person to speak on Amazon's behalf. You know I think that he thinks of his own strategies, his plans as the kind of secret sauce. And he's extremely disciplined. And as a result, when he does talk he tends to be repetitive, because he's so unwilling to reveal what he's really thinking, planning. But the other thing is back in 2001 when he was appearing all of the time, he had to convince people that Amazon was a company worth from, and a stock worth buying. So, he doesn't have to do that anymore. Everyone is already on board.</p><p>QUEST: Brad, $105 billion. What would be the first thing you would buy?</p><p>STONE: I think you have to start giving it away, and that's actually what's really to come for Jeff, he's tweeted about being more an active philanthropist. We saw a lot of pressure on Bill Gates 15 years ago to up his philanthropy. Jeff does a lot. He funnels a lot of that money into his private space company, Blue Origin, but he hasn't had the impact of Bill Gates or John Rockefeller really great philanthropists in the past, so that is his next act.</p><p>[16:50:00] QUEST: Thank you, good to see you, sir. I appreciate your time. As we continue to car cockpit from the future was unveiled today, the chief executive from Harmon on his big announcement at CES. It's \"QUEST MEANS BUSINESS,\" live from New York.</p><p>QUEST: Earlier we told you about Ford's plans to expand their self-driving car technology. Now a company owned by Samsung technology unveiled its own autonomous technology, a smart cockpit with 5-g internet connectivity that you can see here.</p><p>The chief executive of Harmon is Harman is Dinesh Paliwal and joins me from Las Vegas. All of this technology requires 5-g. But what are going to enable me to do?</p><p>DINESH PALIWAL, CEO, HARMON: Well, Richard, I am glad you asked that because, look, we are at the forefront of so much explosion in technology. At the same time, we all suffer, whether at home or in the car, that we are buffering, we are not able to get in a bandwidth. The pipes are not big enough. So 5g, simply put, is 100 times faster than the current 4g and LTE.</p><p>And that's the essential building block for autonomous or highly automated driving. We have a lot of data coming out of the sensors, the cameras around the car for the surround view or vehicle-to-vehicle. But we did not have the pipes big enough so 5g is a necessity and I'm very happy we just launched our first 5g telematics and we have been awarded the world's first award on that, so this is a very important part of the industry.</p><p>QUEST: The autonomous vehicle. We're seeing more and more. This is clearly the future. I wonder, when do you think, sir, it becomes the norm?</p><p>PALIWAL: So, this is a journey, the way I see it, we have technology available today in a controlled environment. We could have cars driven autonomously. However, for the real-world application we are sometime away. So, the will that be lots of incremental and exponential development happening like here at Samsung Harmon we just launched driveline which is the first open architecture autonomous platform.</p><p>That means is bringing a lot of inputs from front facing and rear cameras and the lidar and other sensors, in analyzing it. And with 5g, with Ota, over the update from the cloud and cyber security. These are the building blocks coming together to allow automation, eventually leading up to fully autonomous commercial applications.</p><p>QUEST: OK. But this issue of security. Last night we had the chief executive of blackberry on program, this issue of security has not been solved yet, has it?</p><p>[16:25:00] PALIWAL: It has not been solved. I'm glad you are raising that issue. So publicly we need to talk about. Because we talk about connectivity, but we seldom talk about cybersecurity, in the throat of unintended intruders coming in. So that is the one area where we have a lot of work to do, and we had Harmon actually for even Samsung acquisitions, invested in Israeli and American companies for cybersecurity. And right now, we have 30 million cars on the road which are utilizing this technology.</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you, Sir. Congratulations. Thank you for joining us from CES.</p><p>PALIWAL: Great. Thank you.</p><p>QUEST: Let me remind you, before we finish tonight, all three major indices rose to records, the Dow, S&amp;P and Nasdaq. For the S&amp;P and Nasdaq, it was the sixth consecutive day of records.</p><p>We will take a short break. And have a Profitable Moment on the other side.</p><p>QUEST: Tonight's Profitable Moment. Klaus Schwab and those WEF must be absolutely beside themselves with the announcement tonight that Donald Trump and half the cabinet are going to the World Economic Forum in two weeks. So, what to make of it? Having called that because those who go there, or Steve Bannon did, the gutless elite. Now he is joining them. Is that what has happened? Is this the final sand in the eye for Steve Bannon? I don't think so. Not a bit of it. This is Donald Trump's victory lap. He goes to Davos and it is a version that they did at the United Nations of America first. We don't care if you don't like it this is what we are going to do. Oh, and by the way, I won. That is what this is going to be about in Davos. Come with us, follow us, do what you like, but the rules have changed with regard to the United States. That is what is going to tell them in Davos. Watch my words.</p><p>And that's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight. I'm Richard Quest in New York. Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead I hope it's profitable.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2018010901cbk27</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RCG-JM81-JB20-G449-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7776\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"01\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>January 9, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0002J45</classCode><className>FORD MOTOR CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS336112 LIGHT TRUCK &amp;

This includes President Trump, who tweeted last week that Google had \"manipulated from 2.6 million to 16 million votes for Hillary Clinton in 2016 Election.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The president, here, is wrong. Not only is he inaccurately summing up research on the effects of bias in Google's search engine; he is also ignoring some key flaws in that research. But there's a troubling kernel of truth here: Online companies wield powerful technology that shapes our beliefs, how we work and how we live. Their technologies act on all of us, regardless of our gender, race, age or political persuasion.</p><p> So while it's wrong to characterize Google as part of the Democratic Party machine, there's plenty of room to question how it's affecting our democracy and society.</p><p> Trump's tweet refers to research by Robert Epstein, an academic psychologist who testified in Congress in June that Google helped Hillary Clinton win at least 2.6 million votes in 2016 by serving undecided voters with politically biased search results. Epstein, who describes himself as \"center-left,\" claims that his research from the 2018 midterms shows that big tech companies hold the power to control 15 million votes, effectively making \"free and fair election(s) meaningless.\"</p><p> I have been studying the internet's impact on our political, cultural and economic lives across the world for 20 years, and Epstein is a respected colleague of mine. We both agree that the digital systems we use every day are dangerous to democracy. This is because the voices that create and monetize them are extremely limited - paving the way for a few tech billionaires to create the empires that monitor us daily, giving them the potential to manipulate our behavior.</p><p> But if we narrow the scope of tech's influence to partisan politics, we miss the larger issue - that the influence of these systems is profoundly undemocratic. Big tech's reach permeates every aspect of our lives, all the while remaining invisible and unaccountable.</p><p> The allegations against Google ignore real complexities in the voting process. For example, Epstein testified that Google shifted millions of votes from \"undecided\" to the Clinton ledger, but could any of us know for sure that a mere search result is sufficient to determine a person's vote? A liberal skew in search results around health care might make a voter more sympathetic to a Democrat, but it might be the candidates' stances on abortion that determine the person's actual vote. Epstein's research didn't take this into account.</p><p> In addition, how we word our searches might influence the visibility of conservative versus liberal information sources. One person might search for \"terrorist attack\"; another might search for \"Islamic terror.\" Wouldn't this affect what each person sees?</p><p> And of course, not all activity online promotes the Democratic cause. As Trump so often ignores, several entities - from Cambridge Analytica to the Russian government - gamed platforms such as Facebook to support his candidacy. Yes, Facebook labels certain \"news\" stories differently when they come from sponsors on our feeds, but is there any evidence that we really noticed the difference?</p><p> In truth, the pernicious effect of private, corporate technology platforms on our political lives is complex. They are not cheerleaders for a political party; their goal is to keep us glued to their sites and services, all while surveilling us 24/7. They don't do this for fun, or necessarily for political power; they do it because it makes them billions of dollars.</p><p> It's time to demand transparency and accountability on our tech platforms, specifically on what data they collect, why we see the content we see and how we can navigate through the morass of information they claim to make available to us. We think we are searching when we go onto Google, but in fact, the company is searching us. It is surveilling our interests for its own purposes, and we have no control over how these technologies influence our behavior or thinking.</p><p> Ultimately, we should remember that at its infancy, the Internet was funded by taxpayer money. As private corporations reap the spoils of this technological marvel, they owe a debt to the public - they should open themselves up to regulation, audit and competition. Google, Facebook, Amazon and other companies can support democracy by entering into a new social contract, both to serve the public interest and to support our own sovereignty as users.</p><p>Google poses a problem, but not because it's a phantom organ of the Democratic Party. The real issue is that its mysterious workings - as well as those of its fellow tech companies - are hidden far from sight and controlled by a few. It's time for a digital bill of rights - one that ensures that the rest of us and our interests are part of the internet's DNA, as well.</p><p> Srinivasan is a professor at the University of California at Los Angeles in the department of information studies and director of the UC Digital Cultures Lab.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WINSAL-WSJ0030050653</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0EABABD6D47D9085 WINSAL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WWS-TP91-DXVP-V263-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">262894</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"854\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Winston-Salem Journal All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Winston-Salem Journal (North Carolina)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 25, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Your top stories right now, 6:00 a.m.  on the east coast, bringing America  First to the world stage, President Trump and his administration in Davos,  the administration cabinet landing here, the president arriving on  Thursday.  To tout the United States economy and lure new big-name  investors.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin already on the ground at the  World Economic Forum.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY:  We couldn't be happier to be here.   It's all about economic growth, opportunities to invest, free and fair  trade and we are looking forward to it.  I think is going to have lots of  good interaction.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Secretary Mnuchin later said that a weaker dollar is good for  the US economy and trade, what sent to dollars sliding this morning.  Plus,  trickle-down tax reform, Disney detailing plans to pass on the savings from  the new law by giving a $1000 cash bonus to 125,000 employees.  Big news  coming after similar announcements from JPMorgan Chase yesterday in Verizon  as well.</p><p>The very latest wins for American workers coming up this morning.  Earnings  the story in business again this morning.  General Electric, Ford, Comcast  all of the names set to report their fourth-quarter numbers today.  GE  expecting earnings of $0.29 a share, we will bring you those numbers as  soon as they hit the tape throughout the morning.</p><p>Markets this morning look like this.  The Nasdaq surged 52 points yesterday  after Netflix shares jumped 10 percent.  S&amp;P 500 closing at an all-time  high.  These markets continue to be on fire.  Dow industrials down just a  fraction yesterday.  But the Nasdaq with a three-quarter of a percent move  in unchartered territory yet again.  </p><p>This morning here is the story.  Futures indicating the markets will open  like this and we are looking at gains once again.  The momentum continues.   Dow industrials up another 55 points right now.  Nasdaq up 10 points this  morning.  </p><p>In Europe the major indices look like this.  Take a look at the trading  this morning with the major indices lower.  FTSE 100 down 1/4 of a percent.   The other managers flat on the session.</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets close mostly higher.  The best performer there  as you can see in China.  Shanghai composite up a third of a percent.   Japan, Nikkei average down three-quarter of 1 percent.</p><p>King James ground early, Lebron celebrating his new spot in the 30,000 club  before actually making history.  The hilarious reaction to the premature  celebration coming up this morning.  Also coming up this morning joining  us, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen is with us.  Energy  Secretary Rick Perry is with us.  The chairman of UBS, largest wealth  manager in the world, Axel Weber will join me.  The CEO of Bank of America,  Brian Moynihan is here.</p><p>Plus, Dow DuPont chairman and CEO, Andrew Liverus will be with us.  We will  get a sense of business today coming up in a jampacked program.  And we  kick it off right now with this top story bringing America First to Davos.  </p><p>Trump headed here to the World Economic Forum tonight.  The president  firing back at  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer last night for offering and then  rescinding a deal to support border wall funding in exchange for legal  protections for illegal immigrants brought to the United States as  children.  </p><p>The president tweeted this last night, crying Chuck Schumer fully  understands especially after is his humiliating defeat that if there is no  wall there is no DACA.  We must have safety and security together with a  strong military for our great people.</p><p>Joining me now in Davos is the Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen  NielSEN. Great to see you.  Thank you for joining us.  Let's talk about  immigration.  Explain the wall.  Tell us why the wall is important for  security, not just a talking point, but actually security.  </p><p>KIRSTJEN NIELSEN, HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY:  I appreciate that.  The  wall itself is a system.  So, when we talk about the world I really mean a  system.  So, it is infrastructure, which is some sort of physical  structure, but also the personnel and technology that go with it.  So, we  have to need all three together to get the security.</p><p>And I think what we see in the United States with examples in Yuma, Arizona  and San Diego in California, when we put up a wall system, we have actually  decreased illegal border crossings by 95 percent.  So, we have evidence it  works.  There are certain places on the border will be need this.  We work  very closely with state and local when we can, we try to find a dual use,  so we are looking at levees for example, so we have the dual use of  security and helping the community not flood.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What is your response to what Senator Schumer said?  Now he is  withdrawing the immigration offer.  I know that I've heard Schumer and  others talk about the need for security, border security in the past and  last night he changed his tune.  </p><p>NIELSEN:  I can't see what he changed his tune, it's a bit confusing to me  as well.  He's voted for the security fence act in the past as have many  Democrats.  It's a bipartisan issue.  It is a clear need in our country, we  have agreed it is one of the four pillars for discussion.  So hopefully we  come back around and move forward in our discussions.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What is a state of security today?  You've got a lot on your  plate from actual border situations to cyber, so can you give us a status  check in terms of American homeland security?</p><p>NIELSEN:  Absolutely.  So, I think what we are seeing is terrorists, nation  states whether across the board are changing their tune.  So, what we need  to do is we need to continue to evolve and make sure that we can meet the  incoming changing threats.</p><p>And that is why I'm here today.  So, we need to do that in partnership,  there is not one entity that has all the resources and capabilities to  address any of these threats alone.  So, we have to look at it from an  international domestic, from a public-private and certainly within the  United States government, a whole of government approach to address these  threats.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are the threats?  Is it transnational gangs, is it drug  lords, who is coming across the border?  </p><p>NIELSEN:  we do have a large TCO problem, yes.  So transnational criminal  organizations smuggle all things, the smuggle people, drugs, they can  smuggle weapons.  We work very closely with our partners to the south and  within the international community to try to combat that, but we need to do  more within the United States, not only stopping them at the border but  frankly I need the ability to be able to remove them once I do stop them at  the border, and that is part of our discussions right now with Congress.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How much an issue is homegrown terrorism at this point?  We  have seen that obviously people getting inspired by ISIS.  Where we are  not?  </p><p>NIELSEN:  Terrorist used of the Internet is the first thing that comes to  mind when we talk about that, we do see them inspiring, we do see them  recruiting, we see them financing over the Internet, that is something that  we are working with companies here today in Davos to further that  discussion.  It is a problem, so we need to understand what causes one to  become radicalized.  But if there is a way to take them off that path and  give them perhaps a more constructive way forward.  Sort of different parts  of the process that we are working on.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I thought it was really fascinating that even with the  government shutdown, the US was able to kill 150 ISIS fighters in Syria due  to the airstrikes there.  Extraordinary.</p><p>NIELSEN:  Yes, and we must continue to remove their safe haven.  That is a  very important step.  Secretary Mattis if he were here he would tell you  and thank the troops for what they have done and all of our military, but  what we as homeland security no need to do is make sure that they don't,  they fall apart if you will, if they don't have a safe haven to not come to  the United States.  So, we are working with international partners to  increase that screening Internet sure the terrorists not coming to the  United States.</p><p>We released a report last week, we meet seven terrorists a day trying to  come to our country legally, they are on the terrorist watch list.  It is  an ongoing problem.  Need to make sure we have the tools to defend our  country.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you need to do that effectively?  We are having this  debate over funding for the border wall, but also funding in general for  the for the military as the Democrats want what they want in terms of DACA.   Tell us the needs in terms of homeland security.</p><p>NIELSEN:  Some of this as you say is funding.  I think we have been very  clear.  We have a very clear proposal with respect to the wall system, were  that would go and how that would work.  But also need the ability to  promptly remove those that I stop at the border.  This is where I am  confused because this is border security.  If I stop 20 people at the  border but I have to let them into the country, that is not border  security.  So, we need to work with Congress to close the loopholes that  have evolved over time through the courts, so that if someone comes and  they don't have any legal right, they don't have any other claim, for  example such as asylum, I need the ability to be all the remove them at  that point at the border.  Then we don't have an interior problem.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  In other words, you can just send them right back.  </p><p>NIELSEN:  No, ma'am.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why?</p><p>NIELSEN:  A lot of court cases to be honest, it is just the way that the  courts have evolved you find a very sympathetic case, and unfortunately the  law is made around that case, the exception becomes the rule.  And suddenly  the rule is the exception meaning I can't stop anyone.  So, we've given  these proposals to Congress and I'm very hopeful that we can make the case  that is border security, it is not interior security, it is not integration  enforcement, it is border security right there at the border.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What you want to see from corporate America?  I mean companies  in terms of verifying who was working for that company, are there a lot of  stories of companies that hiding illegals?</p><p>NIELSEN:  I don't know about a lot of stories, but we do unfortunately see  bad actors.  We do seek companies who consistently and persistently violate  our laws.  We will have to work on that.  As you have seen with 7 Eleven  recently, that has been a problem in the past, we noticed them.  And so,  then we had to take enforcement action against the company at the company  level.</p><p>E-verify as you know right now is a voluntary program, it enables you to  assure that who you are hiring has the legal right to work in the United  States.  We encourage all employers to use it.  But if you are purposely  evading our laws we will prosecute.  We do need to enforce our laws.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Even sanctuary cities?  I find it extraordinary that California  can just get away with being a sanctuary city.  In just blowing off the  federal law.</p><p>NIELSEN:  Yes, you know what I find really disturbing about that is I can't  find anyone who would tell me they don't want the criminals out.  So, this  is where I get very confused, what at the heart of this discussion of  sanctuary cities is, I can get a criminal, my folks can go get a criminal  in jail which is a safe area, it is a controlled area.  They can pick that  person up.  They can detain them for federal purposes on the way out to be  deported.  </p><p>If a so-called sanctuary city left that person out into the community, my  officials are then forced to go into the community which puts everyone at  risk, not just my officers but frankly the immigrant community as well.   So, I get very confusing people talk about sanctuary city.  It is a  sanctuary for criminals.  It is not a sanctuary for immigrants.  So really  need to work with cities to make sure that we can understand the safest way  to do this is to remove the criminals in a controlled environment.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is there accountability?  Should a city not remove those  criminals?</p><p>NIELSEN:  In my opinion, they should work with ICE and let ICE come pick  them out.  By the way we are not asking them to do anything special, just  before you are going to release someone, 48 hours before you do let us  know.  We will come get them.  If we can't get something we can't get them.   But we would like to try, we would like the ability to be able to take them  in a controlled way so that we can then put them into proceeding.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you that your testimony last week before the senate  judiciary committee when New Jersey Democrat Booker really exploded on you  over language that the president may or may not have used in the oval  office on immigration.  Here's the exchange.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. CORY BOOKER, (D) NEW JERSEY:  The commander-in-chief in an oval office  meeting referring to people from African countries and Haitians with the  most wild and vulgar language.  I had tears of rage when I heard about this  experience in that meeting, you don't remember.  You can't remember the  words of your commander-in-chief.  I find that unacceptable.  Your silence  and amnesia are complicity.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What did you make of Senator Booker's behavior toward you?</p><p>NIELSEN:  To be honest it was a distraction, and it was very frustrating to  me on behalf of the men and women of the Department of Homeland Security,  because I was there to talk about real threats and their needs to do their  job.  That the American people has asked him to do.</p><p>It became 11 minutes of a lecture about a meeting he was not in about one  word and whether or not I heard it.  I said under testimony was that  possible?  Sure.  I just did not hear the word.  There is no story there.   He didn't ask me what I think, he didn't ask me what I think about the  countries, he didn't ask me what I think about immigration policy.  He had  no interest about what the Secretary of Homeland security thinks.  He just  wants to lecture me for 11 minutes.  So, it was unfortunate, it was an  unfortunate waste of all of our time, one recruiter been focused on the  needs and threats.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It felt to me like harassment.  Did you feel harassed?</p><p>NIELSEN:  I felt it was just inappropriate.  That is a workplace  environment, he didn't seem constructive to me, it didn't seem productive.   It wasn't a conversation.  There wasn't any opportunity for me to explain  how I feel which I would think is what he would be interested as the  Secretary of Homeland Security.  And again, he wasn't even in the meeting,  so it was a bit confusing as to why he felt that it was appropriate to tell  me what I heard and didn't hear, when he wasn't even there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It seems obviously like he wanted a platform, so that he could  do a show, maybe he was to run for president.  How is the new job going?   You handled that very well.  Tell us your observations from this that you  have.</p><p>NIELSEN:  I'm so proud of the men and women of DHS.  They put their lives  on the line everyday.  We have a huge portfolio, we have many threats.  But  it is a great job.  It is the order of a lifetime to be able to support  them and protect the American people.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What should we expect from the president tomorrow?</p><p>NIELSEN:  I think what his message is going to be is America First is not  America alone.  We need a partner.  Not one of us has the ability to do  this alone.  We need to partner with the private sector, we need to partner  with our allies.  We see that in discussions about North Korea, Syria,  Iran.  We have to build coalitions to attack these threats together.  That  is what you will hear a lot about.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is there is threat from North Korea currently on the ground,  Homeland Security that we should be aware of?</p><p>NIELSEN:  What we worry about of course is with the missile testing and  ongoing nuke program, with that means for us.  Should they be able to  develop the capability to reach the United States?  I want to make sure we  are prepared.  What does that mean for the homeland?  So that is every  thing from alert and warning systems.  We see lately that we need some work  there to connect, but it also means being prepared for the consequences if  any should occur.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Secretary Nielsen, it's good to have you on the program.</p><p>NIELSEN:  My pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>We will take a break.  When we come back the weak dollar is good  apparently.  That is the word from Treasury Secretary Mnuchin.  We break  down more of his comments and the impact on markets this morning.  Dollar  is lower.</p><p>And all eyes on General Electric after a huge fall, the company reports  quarterly earnings within the hour after a dismal year.  We will bring you  the numbers as soon as they hit the tape.  Stay with us right here live  from Davos.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Gunfire causing panic at another school to  report.  Cheryl Casone with the details.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN HOST:  Good morning to you.  Maria.  A 15-year-old  student opened fire at Marshall County High School killing two fellow  students and injuring 18 others.  Police say the suspect is in custody and  will be charged with two counts of murder, and several counts of attempted  murder.  Officials haven't decided if he'll be tried as an adult.   According to \"The New York Times,\" and this is the 11th school shooting  since January 1st and roughly the 50th of the academic year.  </p><p>The dollar hitting fresh lows this morning after Treasury Secretary Mnuchin  said that he welcomes a weakening dollar because it is good for trade.  The  euro is now hitting a three year high on those comments.  While attending  the World Economic Forum in Davos where you are, Maria, Secretary Mnuchin  also said that America is open for business.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MNUCHIN:  We have a great story to tell, lots of important meetings, all  about economic growth, opportunities to invest in a free and fair trade.   We are looking forward to it.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  This is coming after fair protectionism already push the dollar  lower.  Trump is set to leave the United States for Davos tonight.  The  United States Senate voting Tuesday on President Trump's pick for the  federal reserve.  Jerome Powell was confirmed as the next fed chair in a  landslide vote.  Powell signaled during confirmation hearings that he  agrees with the central bank's current policies, including gradual  increases in interest rates.  He will replace Janet Yellen who was the  first woman to leave the fed, Yellen's for your turn parents officially on  February 3.</p><p>And we are going to get earnings from two Dow components this morning.   Investors in General Electric get ready.  They are bracing for possibly  more bad news after the company recently announced a surprise charge from  its insurance business.  Earnings-per-share expect to fall nearly 38  percent from a year ago.  Those are the estimates.  We should say the stock  was a little bit higher a few moments ago.  It has actually scaled-back it  is up .12 percent.</p><p>And then let's look at United Technologies, they reported actually just a  few minutes ago, posted better than expected results.  Sales rising in all  four of the business units there.  United Technologies stock is up 22  percent from just a year ago.  But obviously all eyes this morning, Maria,  on General Electric.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Already, it also obviously, Steven Mnuchin's comments, we will  talk more about that coming up in the program, thank you.</p><p>The tax plan giveback continues, Verizon, Disney, JPMorgan and Starbucks  all plan financial perks for employees because of the new tax cuts.  I will  speak with Bank of America chairman and CEO, Brian Moynihan, coming up  about the impact.</p><p>Plus, crypto currency is a big topic of discussion here in Davos, but is  the technology behind it, block chain, the much bigger economic game  changer?  We are getting some answers this morning, back in a moment, right  here live.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Verizon announced today that  all of their employees other than a top management will receive 50 shares  of restricted stock.  This amounts to about $2500 per employee.  Employees  will further share in the company's success, Verizon said in a release.  We  are only one year in and the president is just getting started.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders detailing Verizon's  plan to reward employees as a result of President Trump's tax plan.  Not  the only company with a big announcement yesterday.  Disney announced  employee bonuses and JPMorgan Chase raised wages.  My next guest was among  the first to announce plans to give money back to employees.  Bank of  America, chairman and CEO, Brian Moynihan is with us now.  Brian, great to  see you.</p><p>BRIAN MOYNIHAN, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, BANK OF AMERICA:  Good morning.   Wonderful day.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Really is.  You announced employees getting their $1000 bonus  citing the tax bill.</p><p>MOYNIHAN:  It was a broader package.  When the tax bill came out, we  believed we had to share success with our teammates.  It is one of our core  principles.  So, if you earned under $150,000, we gave them a $1000 bonus  that they got in their paychecks by year end.</p><p>But it was on the backs, we moved to $15 an hour last year at this time as  a starting wage.  It employees will work for a company from 2010 to now, it  is in the bracket that we are talking about, has had an average wage  increase of 5 percent per year.  It is a constant war for talent out there  at all levels of our company.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So how long does this go on?  One of your colleagues in the  business said to me, people are looking at this as if it is an overnight  success.  The truth is going to be a lot longer and sustainable than people  think.  How do you see it?</p><p>MOYNIHAN:  We were on a panel yesterday together.  If you think about it,  the tax reform is a month old.  We all had a one-time adjustments we had to  make in our year end financial statements, so we had some programs.  The  question is what we do.  We are increasing our investment and we told our  investors on our earnings call we consider increasing investments, speeding  up the pace stuff that we are doing, more branches in new cities which have  about 10 employees.</p><p>All of those things.  Like companies around the world, it will take a  little while for people to catch up to because it is brand-new.  And so,  they are adjusting business plans and their spending plans, but your  hearing across the board, incremental aggressiveness, incremental focus on  investing on stuff that has a little longer payback.  With an equal balance  if are going to give investments extra earnings, stock buybacks, dividends,  which is it bad either.</p><p>Because that is going to go back in the economy and the investor gets that  is going to have to put it to work with some company that needs more  capital will take it and put it to work.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, let's talk about more capital.  Generally, the regulations  that you have been faced with for the last 10 years, which are beginning to  get brought back.  The Trump administration has announced a pretty good  rollback in regulations but hasn't even impacted the banks yet.  Isn't that  right?</p><p>MOYNIHAN:  Well, if you think about the regulations for banking, we needed  to get the situation right, we had a ton of regulations.  And the  expectation would be they would swing past the point of the middle.  And if  you think about what we need to do going forward, the people running the  agencies and the regulatory process, those people are now in place,  Chairman Powell was approved yesterday.</p><p>That was important.  The second was to new regulations that were  inconsistent, adding on, piling on, whatever the right word you might use.   Because we had fixed everything frankly.  We are kind of done.  And even  Tarullo we did a good job of bringing the regulation forward, declares it  was kind of over.  But we had to stop the momentum.</p><p>And then the third thing is Mnuchin with Craig Phillips and the team in  treasury, working with the industry, people who like the industry and  people who don't like the industry, came up with a roadmap to appropriately  rebalance the regulation.  As one of the largest underwriters of the FDIC  fund with my other banks, putting in money, we have the highest interest in  the safest and soundest banking industry.  Because anytime a bank fails the  industry puts up the money ultimately, and we put up about a 14 or 15  percent share of that.  So, I have a higher interest than a lot of people  to make sure this is safe and sound industry.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What I was getting out it seems like there is a long runway.   You haven't even felt the impact yet.  A big deal for Bank of America and  the entire industry.  </p><p>MOYNIHAN:  I think it will take time.  And you have to do it right, and has  got to be it has got to be carefully done with the right cost benefit  analysis.  We can't keep changing back and forth.  As we fix Volcker, it's  got to have stick to the ribs to it.  It has to have integrity to it that  does the purpose which was intended to stop proprietary trading.  Remove  some of the difficulty in compliance, the sticks to it, so somebody doesn't  have a better idea in two years, because the system requirements and the  fixes for this.  We spent over $1 billion on a resolution plan.  I don't  want that to have to be redone.  That is really money that just goes to  consultants and teammates and other people and systems, but it really  doesn't do anything for our customers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You need certainly, I get that, to plan.  Characterize the  consumer, your business has been going very well.  Growth obviously at Bank  of America.  Can you tell us how the consumer looks in terms of lending,  spending right now?</p><p>MOYNIHAN:  Sure.  If you start the broad thing of what happened last year,  from 2015 to 2016, all the spending in the consumers which is about two and  one quarter trillion dollars, Bank of America grew about three percent.   2016 to 2017 that same spending whether it is checks or debit credit cards,  money out of the ATM, groom at six percent.</p><p>So twice the rate across 2.6 trillion last year.  In January off to start  again.  Consumers  have been spending, it is a little more driven at the implement by  experiences as opposed to things.  Doing stuff as opposed to buying stuff.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Going out to dinner, there spending money there.</p><p>MOYNIHAN:  A vacation.  And as wages continue to rise, as wealth continues  to build a market, you going to see that is one of the attributes of that.   That's very constructive.  On a lending side, we are a prime lender, the  credit statistics are very strong.  The availability of credit is very  strong.  </p><p>Small business we've had record success, meaning new loans so that business  has done well, and the next level up we call business banking.  Also doing  well.  So, the activity is high, can I think is you get the regulatory  certainty for those companies, our clients, in the tax benefits that they  will get.  You will see them be more aggressive, so you will see those  people will grow also.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you believe that this market the end is trading  appropriately?  It sounds really good the 4 percent growth expectations,  the business of course at your bank the people are worried about  complacency in terms of these markets.  You are a markets guy, what do you  think about this incredible performance?</p><p>MOYNIHAN:  Well, I have this -- I have a lot of experts and we have  (INAUDIBLE) in the research team, one of the best in the business and they  have the S&amp;P, you know, growing for the year.  But to say, the target they  put out because of all the enthusiasm, maybe 3,000 or something, and then  so it's all constructive.  </p><p>But the reality is the best (INAUDIBLE) of Bank of America and that's where  my money is.  But if you really think about it, the mark is reflecting  (INAUDIBLE) earnings for the company and there are some excesses, there  always will be.  But broadly across the board that's what's driving  evaluations and our companies are earning well.  Economies are growing and  the world's economy is growing faster.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, OK.  We will leave it there.  Brian, it's great to see you  this morning.</p><p>MOYNIHAN:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  Brian Moynihan is the  Chairman and CEO of Bank of America.  I want to get this breaking news at  right now, General Electric is missing the expectations this morning on its  earnings, $0.27 cents a share, is what the company's reporting right now  versus an estimate of $0.29 cents a share.  Revenue is expected at $34.06  billion for the quarter for General Electric.  </p><p>We're going to put those numbers on right now on the screen, in terms of  revenue for the fourth quarter.  G.E. shares, as you can see this morning,  are up two-thirds of a percent, the stock is down about 40 percent in the  last year.  </p><p>We'll take a quick break here.  King James, king size ego, that's what some  are saying about NBA LeBron James after he congratulated himself on social  media on joining the 30,000 point club.  Back in a minute, right here, live  from Davos.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ANNOUNCER:  Here again is Maria Bartiromo with a special edition of  Mornings with Maria, live, from Davos, Switzerland at the World Economic  Forum.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, happy Wednesday, everybody.  Thanks so much for  joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Wednesday, January 24th, your  top stories right now 6:34 on the East Coast, this morning.  Breaking news  right now, General Electric just reported earnings, the earning came in  below expectations at $0.27 a share versus an estimate of $0.29 cents a  share, revenue at $31.04 billion versus an estimate $34.06 billion.  </p><p>Shares of General Electric are trading higher in the pre-market.  Of  course, the stock is down about 40 percent in the last year, the numbers  hitting the tape, not having a big impact.  </p><p>Putting America first, President Trump will leave for Davos, Switzerland  tonight, as he meets with top names in business here in Davos, at the World  Economic Forum.  I spoke with Homeland Security Secretary Christian  Nielsen, earlier this hour about the President's trip.  </p><p>Meanwhile, the dollar is sliding this morning after Treasury Secretary  Steven Mnuchin said a weaker dollar is good for the U.S. economy and for  trade, during a press conference in Davos.  We will have more on his  comments ahead of the President's visit, as it has, moved markets.</p><p>Stocks, meanwhile, check it out, NASDAQ surged yesterday, again, in  uncharted territory at the close, up 52 points yesterday as Netflix shares  were up 10 percent, towering the NASDAQ.  NASDAQ now at 74.60, S&amp;P 500  also, at an all-time high yesterday, at 28.39, the Dow industrials pulled  back just a fraction yesterday.  </p><p>And this morning, we see momentum continuing, Dow industrials expected to  be up better than 60 points this morning, quarter of a percent higher, S&amp;P  500 up four points, and the NASDAQ also higher this morning, up 10 points.</p><p>In Europe, the major indices are also showing gains.  Take a look at the  European indices, oh, we're seeing reversal here, FT 100 down a third of a  percent, 30 points lower, the CAC Quarante in Paris is lower and the DAX  Index is also fractionally weaker on the session.</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets closed mostly higher, fractional moves across  the board.  Breaking news this morning, General Electric releasing its  fourth-quarter results, earnings of $0.27 cents a share, on revenue of  $31.4 billion, joining me right now on telephone, is Former G.E.  Transportation and Power System CEO and the Former CEO of Home Depot and  Chrysler, Bob Nardelli, Bob, good to talk with you, thanks so much for  weighing in this morning.  You work at G.E. for 30 years, and really was  there in the glory days, your reaction to these numbers this morning.</p><p>BOB NARDELLI, FORMER CEO OF G.E. TRANSPORTATION AND POWER SYSTEM (via  telephone):  Well, good morning, Maria.  I think if you think about this  announcement, gone (INAUDIBLE) you know, obviously, we are able to make  some adjustments (INAUDIBLE) $0.27 cents.  The overall consensus was 28,  the estimate was 29.  I think one of the big concerns was the drop in  earnings from the previous estimate.  I think one of the other big concerns  was in November.  </p><p>They talked about a 3 million -- $3 billion-dollar charge.  It ended up  about being about 6.2 for insurance.  So I think the big underlying word  here with G.E. right now is uncertainty.  As John and his team, you know,  try to navigate through some of the issues that they faced.  </p><p>The power system, unfortunately, was down more than they had anticipated  which is the, you know, the largest segment of the (INAUDIBLE) that they've  talked about with aviation, healthcare and then power system.  </p><p>So I think they have got a lot of work to do, to bring back investment  confidence, cash looks like it was a little bit stronger than they  anticipated, that is good news considering they still, you know, they still  have a dividend, half of what it was.  They've got a pension obligation to  take care of, and they're trying to reinvest in the businesses.  </p><p>You know, the tax -- the new tax policy really doesn't help G.E. a lot.   They've done a fabulous job and fact planning over the years, so well have  to see.  I think -- you know, the big wait and watch will be how John and  them team does in the first quarter of this year.  Down significantly from  last year, right, 17 versus --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NARDELLI:  16 down significantly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, let me bring in Dagen McDowell in New York.  Dagen,  we've missed you, great to see you this morning.  And of course, you know  there has been an expectation out there that given the weakness and the  fall at G.E. that we could actually be talking about a potential split up  of this company at this point.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  Right.  And we will listening for more comments  from the CEO John Flannery on that note because there's been talk, G.E.,  looking at they are looking at exiting that major stake in the oil services  business, Baker Hughes rearranging its board of directors which, I think,  is probably a long time coming at this point, but if you look at the stock  up two percent in pre-market.  </p><p>This has been really the discussion among investors.  At what point is this  a buying opportunity?  This quarter that it reported this morning is a real  morass.  It's a complete mess, maybe even a throwaway, if you will.  The  stock last year lost about half of its value down so far this year.  </p><p>So, again, some investors are willing to step up a little bit and put some  money on G.E. but it remains to be seen what the road ahead looks like for  this company and how much of -- how much of it would really be left quite  frankly?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Bob, what about that, really quick, I know you sold your  position here but the high was, what, 59 and three quarters.  Is 17 and  change a buy here, you think?</p><p>NARDELLI:  Well, you know, we saw the other day fell below 16 which was a  52 (INAUDIBLE) a fifth year low.  I think, you know, it's a wait-and-see  attitude right now, Maria.  I probably would wait and see before I jump in.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we will leave it there, Bob Nardelli, Dagen  McDowell, thank you so much, with the analysis on General Electric.  We've  got lofty ambitions.  Meanwhile, for a hotel empire, just over two years  ago, Marriott International announced plans to take over Starwood, a deal  worth an estimated $14 billion.  </p><p>The merger created what now is the world's largest hotel company, 6400  properties across the world.  Spread out across its 20 brands, Marriott now  has locations in 126 countries and the deal has paid off.  Marriott shares  are up 70 percent plus, in the past year alone.  Look at that chart.   Joining me right now to talk about those successes is Marriott's President  and CEO, Arne Sorenson, Arne, great to see you.</p><p>ARNE SORENSON, CEO OF MARRIOTT INTERNATIONAL:  Nice to see you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  Congratulations on that  success.  Wow.  </p><p>SORENSON:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>SORENSON:  We're off to a good start.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's behind it?</p><p>SORENSON:  Well, the deal is a good deal.  And of course, the market always  worries with big deals that there will be a stumble in the immigration.   And I think there was great relief that we haven't stumbled at least, not  visible yet, and we're off to a good start.  </p><p>But it's a good start, in the sense that it is a multiyear process to take  Starwood and its SPG platform, pull it into Marriott and the Marriott  rewards platform.  Really combine it into one loyalty program.  That will  happen later this year.  But so far, it's gone really well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How tough is it to combine two very different cultures, right?   I mean, Starwood and Marriott, I guess, have similarities in some culture  but overall, people look at these two brands as very different.  So have  you had issues in terms of melding these two cultures?</p><p>SORENSON:  Well, of course, there are always issues that you go through but  the culture is actually are more similar than different.  Both very proud  companies that want to perform really well for the long-term and they want  to win in their space.  </p><p>And you bring those two things together and, sort of, feed them.  And we  get a lot of momentum.  Obviously, the stock price performed well last  year.  That's also a great motivating tool for a team of thousands of  people around the world who are invested in the company.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  When do you expect the integration to be complete (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>SORENSON:  I don't think we will be able to say for another couple of  years, how well it's truly gone.  I thought when we did this deal, it'll be  three to five years, sort of, minimum.  I think we will start to see good  performance from our customers' share of wallet, as the year goes along.   So far, it's been great.  There've been no stumble so, you know, we're  really off to a good start.  But it's a -- it's a big job.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I guess you had a lot of questions from, you know, guests and  investors about the rewards program.  They want to know what happens with  their rewards with the merger.</p><p>SORENSON:  Absolutely.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>SORENSON:  If I'm a -- if I'm a long-time SPG member has been, you know, a  hundred nights a year with Starwood and now, suddenly Marriott's involved.   I had deliberately made a choice and have it, loyalty, all of those things,  maybe drove that choice.  </p><p>Now, suddenly, I've got the earth shifting under me.  What's going to  happen?  And so far, that's been good because we've been reassuring.  But  until we get that completed, you won't able to be as definitive.  I think  they'll be pleased with what's coming up.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What can you tell us about the environment right now?  We've  been hearing a lot of optimistic talk about four percent economic growth,  about this tax plan, from your standpoint, what do bookings look like?   What can you tell us?</p><p>SORENSON:  Well, so let me -- let me step back to the Davos stage for just  a second, and the data is still coming in.  The company's doing great,  where organic growth is good.  Red part numbers will report for fourth  quarter in a couple of weeks.  But you look at global travel trends.  We  think about $1.3 billion international trips last year, around the world.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>SORENSON:  Up about seven percent from the year before.  The U.S. share was  down four percent.  Why?  Well, the U.S. is a less friendly destination  today.  And so, one of the things we're doing here -- why are we less  friendly because we are probably talking about security more than we have  in the past.  Security is a real issue.  </p><p>And until people are comfortable that security is being addressed.  We  would expect there would be some hesitation.  But still, we're here,  basically saying, let's work on security and the international travel.   Let's make sure people understand the power of this industry to create jobs  in the United States and around the world.  And let's compete for it  because business could be even better.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you -- and you opened dozens more locations in China, in a  joint venture with Alibaba.  They are not traveling as much to the U.S.   Where are they going?</p><p>SORENSON:  They're going everywhere else.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Everywhere else?</p><p>SORENSON:  Everywhere else.  So visitation to the airport was up seven  percent, we think, in 2017.  Now, this is a status a little harder to get  reliably because it's not just our data, its government data and Global  Travel Trends.  But we are seeing growth all around the world.  We're  seeing -- Americans come to Europe too.  </p><p>The dollar is strong, U.K. for example, the pound is quite weak.  It's a  great place to take a vacation these days.  But again, the U.S. is losing  some share and we want to see the U.S. address security and come back to  take that share because I think it'll perform even better.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we will leave it there.  When you come back, we got  to talk about the room of the future because I know you've made a lot of  changes there.  Arne Sorenson, Marriott, we'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  LeBron James joined an elite list of basketball  legends last night.  Jared Max with the story now.  Good morning, Jared.  </p><p>JARED MAX, FBN SPORTS REPORTER:  Hey, good morning, Maria.  LeBron James  has earned himself a seat at the 30,000-point table.  Now in company with  Kareem Abdul Jabbar, Karl Malone, Kobe Bryant, Michael Jordan, Wilt  Chamberlain, and Dirt Novitsky.  The Cavaliers, and the Spurs, and San  Antonio, LeBron needed seven points to get to 30,000.  Bang, he gets it  right here.  The final shot of the first quarter.  Spurs fans congratulated  with the standing ovation.  LeBron, the youngest to score 30,000, almost 15  months younger than Kobe Bryant was.  LeBron turned 33 at the end of the  December.  By the way, the Cavaliers lost the game.  </p><p>Check this out, earlier yesterday, LeBron James posted on Instagram a  congratulatory letter to his younger self.  In it, LeBron wrote: \"I want to  be one of the first to congratulate you on this accomplishment achievement  tonight that you'll reach.  I know it's never been a goal of yours from the  beginning.  Look up to the higher skies and say thank you.  Congrats again,  young king.\"  LeBron got roasted on social media fans who used LeBron's  opening line similar, satirical self-congratulatory notes.  Like this one:  \"Want to be the first to congratulate you on the accomplishment achievement  when you binged 10 episodes of fifth place, have sent you 30,000 on  (INAUDIBLE)\"  </p><p>There's something that Kobe Bryant has, LeBron James is not -- an Oscar  nomination.  Yes, Kobe nominated for \"Best Animated Short Film\" for the  five-minute \"Dear Basketball\" poem -- he wrote when he retired in 2015.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>KOBE BRYANT, BASKETBALL PLAYER, NBA:  You gave a six-year-old boy his Laker  dream.  And we both know, no matter what I do next, I'll always be that  kid, with the rolled-up socks, garbage can in the corner, 00:00:05 seconds  on the clock, ball in my hands.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MAX:  Kobe Bryant said, the short film is about a dream and trying to keep  that dream as an adult. </p><p>Tomorrow, Tiger Woods will play his first PGA tour event this year.  Tiger  took in a practice round yesterday at Torrey Pines.  He's won the Farmers'  Insurance Open seven times.  This is now his latest effort to return from  multiple surgeries on his back.  </p><p>It's a bird, it's a plane, it's Tom Brady -- no, actually, that won't be  part of the Super Bowl pre-game show.  But get this, on Super Bowl Sunday,  masses says an asteroid that they've been following for 14 years will pass  by the Earth at a speed of about 76,000 miles per hour.  But it won't come  closer than 2.6 million miles from Earth.  The last one that came by was at  26,000 miles from Earth.  That was in the fall.  So, Maria, this is 2.6  million miles.  I think we'll be safe from the asteroid on Super Bowl  Sunday.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  What a story.  Thank you, Jared.  Coming up, we have been  watching this roller coaster run of Bitcoin.  Some say that the smart money  is on the potential of the blockchain, not actually Bitcoin.  The  underlying technology for Bitcoin is what we're talking about right here  next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ADENA FRIEDMAN, PRESIDENT AND CEO, NASDAQ:  We want to make sure that if we  choose to enter into the market in terms of (INAUDIBLE) a future in the  market that we: number one, have client demands; and number two, that we  put the right risk management protocols in place to make it so that people  feel confident in what we're providing and how that becomes an investable  product. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That was NASDAQ President and CEO, Adena Friedman, with me  yesterday right here.  We were talking Bitcoin.  The cryptocurrency craze  has taken over in the last few months.  But some see far more potential  from the blockchain.  The underlying technology for Bitcoin that really  works as the digital ledger, if you will.  Joining me right now is Jamie  Smith, a Member of the Global Blockchain Business Council here at Davos.   Jamie, good to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us.  </p><p>JAMIE SMITH, MEMBER OF THE GLOBAL BLOCKCHAIN BUSINESS COUNCIL:  Thanks for  having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Glenn Hutchins also explained blockchain and why this ledger  and the trust that is required in terms of, you know, lending money --  taking money back and forth to (INAUDIBLE) is so important?  Give us your  sense of blockchain versus Bitcoin.</p><p>SMITH:  Yes.  So, the way that I understand it for myself and explain it to  other people is I think of it like a train track between you and me.  If I  want to send you an asset, I have to send in on some rails, but there has  to be a car on top of that rail we'd like to attach it to.  The rail is the  blockchain; the car is the digital token; and that token, the most famous  one, is a Bitcoin.  And so, what's fooling everyone's mind is that this  Bitcoin has an actual value.  But what is capturing a lot of the  imagination here in at west is that, while everybody really cares about  moving money, because 99 percent of people are using it for that purpose.   It's just an asset; you could use it for anything.  So, land title,  identity, medical health records, all of these things that we're having  some date integrity issues around the world.  And this technology is much  more secure, so it's fascinating. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  If I wanted to be on those rails, the blockchain, I can use  dollars.  </p><p>SMITH:  Sure.  Of course, you could.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do we need Bitcoin for?</p><p>SMITH:  Well, I think you have to look at it from a developed world  perspective, and a developing world perspective.  When you look at the  whole -- the world as a whole, you're talking about billions of people are  unbanked.  You're talking about 1.5 billion people who don't even have an  identity.  There are a lot of people who just are left out of the system.   And somewhere in the range of 60 to 70 percent of the world's population is  just living under systems that are really hard to navigate.  They're just  kind of broken, or there's so much friction.  We take for granted -- I can  go get a bank account; it's fine, right?  But most of the people in the  world, if you want to start a business and provide for yourself?  You just  don't have those opportunities and now you do.  And not only that, it's  pretty cheap.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You make a really good point.  Let me ask you, how are you  going to identify which cryptocurrency is actually going to be the winner  here?  Is it Bitcoin?  Is it (INAUDIBLE)?  I mean, there is a bit cash.   So, how do we know?  What metrics are you looking at to identify which is  actually the most effective?  </p><p>SMITH:  Yes.  So, at the moment what's happening is that companies are  actually deciding.  So, there's a company in San Francisco coin base, so  they only allow you to buy four different kinds of cryptocurrencies.  There  are hundreds on the market.  I would like to see a world where governments  get more involved in really betting these things.  The problem we have  right is that regulators literally don't know what this is.  And so, it's  really hard to do smart regulation if you're not smart about what's  happening.  And so, our job is we're going in and we're just teaching them  what they need to know, and then we can get to decisions later.  But at  least, we're trying to educate them on what it actually is.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's what we all need.  Jamie, great to see you.  Thanks so  much for weighing in today.</p><p>SMITH:  Thank you.  It's such an honor to be on.  Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good to see you.  We'll be right back.  Jamie Smith.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Thanks so  much for joining us.  Welcome back.</p><p>I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Wednesday January 24th.</p><p>Your top stories right now 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Bringing America First to the world stage -- President Trump and his  administration headed to Davos to tout the U.S. economy and lure big name  investors to the U.S.</p><p>Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin already making waves here in Davos -- the  dollar is sliding this morning after he said a weaker dollar is good for  the U.S. economy.  He is moving markets with that comment.</p><p>He's not the only cabinet member making headlines.  I spoke with Homeland  Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen earlier about her fiery exchange with  Democratic Senator Cory Booker last week.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KIRSTJEN NIELSON, U.S. HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY:  It was a distraction  and it was very frustrating to me on behalf of the men and women of the  Department of Homeland Security because I was there to talk about real  threats and their needs to do their job that the American people has asked  them to do.  And it became 11 minutes of a lecture about a meeting he was  not in, about one word and whether or not I heard it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  She's part of the delegation here from the U.S. to highlight  the booming American economy with President Trump.  </p><p>The President just tweeted this.  Quote, \"Tremendous investment by  companies from all over the world being made in America.  There has never  been anything like it now.  Disney, JPMorgan Chase and many others.   Massive regulation reduction and tax cuts making U.S. a powerhouse again.   Long way to go -- jobs, jobs, jobs.\"</p><p>The President just tweeting out that this morning.</p><p>The wins are rolling in for American workers, that's for sure.  Starbucks  the latest company to pass on the savings from the new tax law on to its  employees.  Its announcement coming on the hills of similar news from  Disney, JPMorgan Chase and Verizon just yesterday alone.  What the coffee  giant is brewing up for its staff, coming up this morning.</p><p>Meanwhile, more records for stock prices.  The Nasdaq yesterday surging 52  points after Netflix shares jumped 10 percent.  It is now once again in  record a territory.  The S&amp;P 500 also at an all-time high this morning  going into today's open.</p><p>Futures indicating another rally at the start of trading this morning.  The  Dow Jones Industrial Average up better than 60 points right now.  The  Nasdaq and the S&amp;P 500 also higher.</p><p>In Europe this morning, different story -- the major indices are pulling  back today.  If you look at all of the majors, the FT 100 down almost a  half a percent.  The CAC 40 and the DAX index, also weaker.</p><p>Comcast just reporting earnings, beating expectations of 49 cents a share  versus an estimate of 47 cents a share.</p><p>And there is a look at the Asian markets and how that closed.  Shanghai  composite was the best performer, up one third of 1 percent.</p><p>Earnings the story on Wall Street -- we're just looking at Comcast revenue  beating expectations at $21.9 billion versus an estimate of $21.8 billion.   Also reporting today, General Electric missed expectations with its numbers  earlier.  Ford and as you see Comcast the very latest to report earnings  which were better than expected.</p><p>By the way, General Electric missed expectations on both earnings and  revenue and the stock however is trading up, One-and-two-thirds percent.   There is clearly investors seeing value in GE this morning despite the  worse than expected numbers after a year that saw that stock fall 40  percent.</p><p>More trouble for Toys R Us to report.  The retailer planning to shutter a  fifth of its stores as it grapples with bankruptcy.  A look at the  company's turnaround plan.  </p><p>Plus why the makers of Huggies planning to slash thousands of jobs, coming  up this morning.</p><p>And the award goes to Wal-Mart.  How the retail giant is celebrating their  fifth-ever female director nominated for an Oscar.  We will tell you about  that coming up on Wal-Mart.</p><p>Also coming up this morning, Energy Secretary Rick Perry will join me here  in Davos.  The chairman of the board of UBS Axel Weber is with me this  morning along with the CEO of Dow Andrew Liveris and EY Mark Weinberger.   Plus the U.S chairman and CEO of KPMG Lynne Doughtie is with us.</p><p>Big couple of hours coming up so don't miss a moment of it.  We have  breaking news right now as I was just reporting.  Comcast reporting its  fourth-quarter earnings better than expected, 49 cents a share on revenue  of $21.9 billion.</p><p>Dagen McDowell in New York -- and Dagen, overall the numbers have been  pretty good in terms of earnings.  What's your sense?</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  Certainly good in terms of Comcast as well, as  you pointed out -- a double beat.  The share is up more than 1 percent  right here.  And we already know how good business is for Comcast and other  companies like it based on the announcement that it's given thousand-dollar  bonuses to thousands of its employees because of the tax reform law that  was passed by the Trump administration and the Republican Congress.</p><p>So you don't step up and give those kinds of bonuses unless you see very,  very good days ahead.  And certainly the last quarter was quite good for  Comcast.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean you're seeing all these companies pass on the tax  savings, right, to employees -- Dagen.  And it's like 200 companies.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's literally millions of individuals in this country will get  bonuses because -- immediate bonuses because of the tax reform law.  People  are seeing wage increases, $15 minimum wage at say Wells Fargo for example.</p><p>So people are feeling it even before next month.  The tax cuts show up in  their pay checks.  And again, that's more than 90 percent of workers are  going to get a tax cut in their pay checks come next month.</p><p>In terms of Comcast also, I wonder on the conference call if they're going  to be saying anything about the AT&amp;T battle with the Justice Department to  purchase Time Warner.  Because again that -- them just getting in the way  of that acquisition actually would help Comcast which was allowed to buy  NBC Universal.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Absolutely.  Yes, we will be listening for that -- a lot of  consolidation going on.</p><p>Dagen -- thank you.</p><p>We want to talk now about bringing America First to Davos.  President Trump  headed to the World Economy Forum tonight.  He is expected to land tomorrow  here in Davos.</p><p>Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is already on the ground here in  Switzerland.  His comments this morning where he welcomed the weakening  dollar because it's good for trade are sending the dollar this morning to  fresh lows.  Mnuchin also emphasized that America is open for business.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY:  We have a great story to tell,  lots of important meetings.  It's really all about economic growth  opportunities to invest, free and fair trade, so we are looking forward to  it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now to weigh in Hermitage Capital Management  CEO Bill Browder.  Bill -- good to see you, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>BILL BROWDER, CEO, HERMITAGE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT:  Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Were you surprised to see the Treasury Secretary say that a  weaker dollar is good for the U.S. economy?  </p><p>BROWDER:  No.  And anybody who's in the investment business knows that  that's -- if there is -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're not supposed to say it if you're treasury secretary.</p><p>BROWDER:  No.  You can absolutely say it.  And in fact, there's no -- I  mean if you want to sell more goods, make them cheaper for people outside  the country to buy them, and that's what a weaker dollar is all about.   It's sort of a no-brainer.</p><p>In fact, when a country is in real deep trouble they do a major  devaluation.  And that's what gets them out of the trouble.  And so it's a  good thing for the U.S.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Bill -- I want to turn to the Russia probe.  We've got new  developments this morning that I want to talk to you about.</p><p>There are new text messages and allegedly they reveal controversial FBI  agent Peter Strzok was hesitant about joining special counsel Robert  Mueller's investigation.  Because of his quote, \"gut sense\" that there  would be no big there, there; in other words, no collusion between Donald  Trump and the Russians.</p><p>We're also learning in text messages between Strzok and FBI lawyer Lisa  Page, they are a couple.  The two talk about a quote, \"secret society\" that  would be working against the President after he got elected.  That is  according to two Republican lawmakers.</p><p>Here's what one of them, Senator Ron Johnson, had to say about this  developments.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SENATOR RON JOHNSON (R), WISCONSIN:  What this is all about is further  evidence of corruption, more than bias, but corruption at the highest  levels of the FBI.  And that secret society, we have an informant who's  talking about a group that were holding secret meetings offsite.</p><p>There is so much smoke here, there's so much suspicion.</p><p>BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS CHIEF POLITICAL ANCHOR:  Let's stop there.  A secret  society -- secret meetings off site of the Justice Department -- </p><p>JOHNSON:  Correct.  </p><p>BAIER:  And you have an informant saying that.</p><p>JOHNSON:  Yes.</p><p>BAIER:  Is there anything more about that?</p><p>JOHNSON:  No, we have to dig into it.  That's -- this is not a distraction  -- again this is biased, potentially corruption at the highest levels of  the FBI.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So basically when they were talking, Bill Browder, about the  election, Peter Strzok and his girlfriend Lisa Page, they said look if he  wins we have to have an insurance policy.</p><p>And now this latest text reveals that when he did win they said oh, let's  get the secret society in place.  So basically, I guess, to create  investigation after investigation between Trump and the Russians which so  far no evidence exist whatsoever.  Your take?</p><p>I know that -- I asked you about this because you've got an indirect sort  of relation to this Russia probe because of the Magnitsky Law.</p><p>BROWDER:  Well, I don't know who is saying what to whom from the FBI and it  would be dumb for my place to comment on it.  But what I can say is that  the Russians absolutely had an agenda.  The agenda was to get rid of the  Magnitsky Act which was a piece of legislation that I helped put in place  which put sanctions on Putin and his regime.</p><p>And they went to Donald Trump, Jr. and Jared Kushner and others to try to  make that happen.  Now, whether anything happened in that meeting in  response, we don't know.  And eventually the truth will come out about that  one way or another. </p><p>And I'm not going to pre-judge a Justice Department investigation.  I  believe Robert Mueller is an honest investigator and he's got a lot of good  people, patriots, working for him.  And either we'll prove there was no  collusion or they'll prove there's collusion.  </p><p>We can all be armchair investigators making -- trying to make sense of one  or two sound bites.  But, you know, these people have -- there's 20 people,  20 U.S. attorneys on the staff, 200 FBI agents and a bunch of other people.   Eventually the truth will come out one way or the other.  And then we can  put it either to rest or we can put it to a problem.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tell me about Mr. Magnitsky and why you helped create that law.   I'm not sure that the public understands what you've been through.</p><p>BROWDER:  Yes.  So I worked with Sergei Magnitsky who's my lawyer in  Russia.  He uncovered a massive Putin government corruption scheme that  were Putin and his cronies stole $230 million of taxes that my firm had  paid to the Russian government -- from the Russian government.</p><p>Sergei exposed that in retaliation.  He was arrested, put in pre-trial  detention, tortured for 358 days and killed at the age of 37, eight years  ago, November 16, 2009.  I made it my mission since then to get justice for  Sergei Magnitsky which has resulted in the Magnitsky Act which imposes  sanctions on the Putin regime and there are now four other countries above  and beyond America -- Canada, the U.K., Lithuania and Estonia that have  Magnitsky Acts.</p><p>I'm working all over the world to get a similar legislation.  And Putin is  absolutely apoplectic because Putin is one of the richest men in the world.   He's got money everywhere.  He is afraid that his money will be frozen. </p><p>He's personally angry at me for this.  I've been threatened with death,  kidnapping, arrests, extradition.  It's a major, major problem for Vladimir  Putin.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You walk around with security?  </p><p>BROWDER:  I don't go around announcing on Fox News what I do to secure  myself but -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok.  Got you, got you.  </p><p>Let me ask you this in terms of what you went through.  This is not a new  story that Russia tries to undermine the U.S. and the rest of the world.   They try to do it in the European elections, by the way, as well.</p><p>BROWDER:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I remember years ago when I traveled to Moscow and I also  traveled to St. Petersburg to the St. Petersburg International Conference,  I was told don't bring your Blackberry.  As soon as you enter -- and this  was 10 years ago -- </p><p>BROWDER:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  As soon as you enter Russian airspace, the Russians will hack  you and they will have access to your rolodex and your calendar and et  cetera.</p><p>So the Russians have been undermining the world for how long?  </p><p>BROWDER:  They've been doing it for 50 years.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There is nothing new about Donald Trump.</p><p>BROWDER:  There's nothing new about this.  When they did it France, they do  it everywhere.  I mean so -- and it's not partisan.  I think America needs  to put aside all this partisan discussion about Russia.  It's not -- if you  support Trump then you can't believe in Russian interference.  </p><p>Russia was interfering everywhere.  And it's a nonpartisan thing.  If they  could've interfered with -- if they could have talked to the Clinton  campaign, they would have talked to the Clinton campaign. </p><p>It's about Putin trying to create chaos.  So he can't bring Russia up to  the level of the United States and Western Europe and so he wants to bring  us down to his level by creating chaos, by creating dissent, by having us  all fight with each other over this stuff.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Somebody tried to run against him.  And the election was what - - what happened.  He said no, you can't run.</p><p>BROWDER:  Well, so Boris Nemtsov -- Boris Nemtsov, a Russian opposition  person was killed right in front of the Kremlin.  And it turned out that  all 60 security cameras were turned off at the moment he was killed.  What  does that tell you?</p><p>Alexei Navalny, one of the most popular opposition politicians in Russia  has been charged criminally.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what is the world to do?  I mean what do you want to tell  these world leaders here in Davos about Russia and partnering with Russia.</p><p>BROWDER:  What I tell them is that Putin is out to create chaos and destroy  democracy and freedoms in the world.  And we have to contain him and  surround him.  He is a man who wishes us nothing but ill.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.  Bill -- great to see you.   Thanks so much for weighing in.</p><p>BROWDER:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Very important story.  Bill Browder, joining us there.</p><p>Coming up -- trouble for Toys R Us, how the retailer is trying to reinvent  itself this morning amid more store closings.</p><p>Then Wal-Mart goes to tinseltown again.  Details on the company's new ads  set to debut at the Oscars and the famous female director is in charge of  them.</p><p>Back in a moment, right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Another major company passing on some of the savings from the tax law to  its workers.  </p><p>Cheryl Casone is in New York with the details -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  Here we go.</p><p>Starbucks, Maria, boosting pay and expanding benefits for its 150,000  employees here in the United States.  They also announced a stock grant  along with the new policies for expanded parental leave and sick time.   Shares of Starbucks up 5 percent from just a year ago.</p><p>Well, a different story over at Toys R Us.  They are still trying to emerge  from bankruptcy but they are planning to close 182 stores in the United  States.  The company says most of those have failed to meet performance  goals.</p><p>Toys R Us filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in September.  They  had been hurt by competitors including Wal-Mart and obviously Amazon.  The  company also had to contend with heavy debt stemming from a leveraged  buyout that happened back in 2005.</p><p>Well, Kimberly-Clark is slashing at least 5,000 jobs, that's 12 percent of  their workforce.  The maker of Huggies and Kleenex says it plans to close  or sell about 10 manufacturing plants.  Declining birth rates have been  affecting diaper sales and a retail price war is also weighing in on the  company's profits, again the online component.  Shares of Kimberly-Clark go  down more than 5 percent from just six months ago.  There's a lot of  pressure on the stock.</p><p>And then finally, Maria, you're going to love the irony of this story.   Amazon Go -- I showed this to you a couple of days ago.  Amazon's brand new  first ever cashier-less grocery story.  You walk in, you got your phone.   You pick up your stuff, you walk out.</p><p>Hopefully it was to reduce wait times.  Get this, customers had to wait a  long time for their first Amazon grocery shopping experience.  Despite  being able to walk in, grab groceries, walk out -- that is the whole plan.   But traffic was too much and they were overrun.  There's huge lines at the  Amazon Go store.</p><p>People on Twitter, you know, making fun of Amazon for this.  Amazon shares  are up in premarket trading.  It's not affecting the stocks, Maria, and  it's certainly probably not going to affect Amazon but, you know, kind of  missed the point on this one -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It's just not what they do, right.  I mean that's -- I  can understand. </p><p>CASONE:  It's a great concept.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dagen -- what's your take.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm waiting for, in terms of the real world shopping experience  of Amazon to clean up the rotten, wilting lettuce at the Whole Foods down  on 7th Avenue.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, my goodness.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Again -- and I can't wait for the people who get mischarged or  over charged when they to and shop in these Amazon Go stores.  Talk about  spending time, cleaning up your credit card receipts.  You know that's  going to happen.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we'll see.  I mean, you know, I am interested in seeing  how this whole consolidation and integration goes with Whole Foods.  You've  been making a lot of good points about what you are seeing at that specific  Whole Foods.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The stores -- they've become cafeterias for people who eat  copious amounts of edamame.  So I don't really know how they are going to  really -- it will be interesting to see how that combination progresses.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll take a short break.</p><p>When we come back, cyber security concerns to artificial technology.   Microsoft president Brad Smith will weigh in on the top technology issues  of 2018, coming up next.</p><p>Then a magical trip for Muggles -- details on the new Harry Potter cruise  that will cost you $36,000.</p><p>Right here, live from Davos.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>We are coming to you live this week from Davos, Switzerland where leaders  from across the globe are gathering for the World Economic Forum.</p><p>Today, Microsoft is highlighting their top technology issues of 2018, a  list dominated by many of the same problems plaguing government and  businesses alike.</p><p>Joining me right now this morning in a First on Fox interview is Microsoft  president and CLO, chief legal officer, Brad Smith.  Brad -- great to see  you.</p><p>BRAD SMITH, PRESIDENT AND CLO, MICROSOFT:  Nice to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>So you point to cyber security as the top issue facing technology this  year.</p><p>SMITH:  I think every time we talk to customers especially in the world of  business, it is so often the number one concern.  I think it's a huge  imperative for our entire industry.  But it's a shared responsibility with  customers and we also need governments to do more.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do we need to do?  I mean we are looking at hacking across  the board in companies; not to mention efforts in government as well.  How  could we protect ourselves?</p><p>SMITH:  So I think the first imperative whether you are a consumer or  you're a business is, you know, keep your machines up-to-date.  Apply  patches.  Make sure you are applying common sense.  If you see an e-mail  that comes in from somebody you don't know that asked you to click a link  and provide your password, don't do that.</p><p>It then gets a lot more sophisticated from there.  We're seeing governments  pour more money into nation state attacks.  This is where I think we need  governments themselves to engage in addressing this at a new level.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What should governments do?</p><p>SMITH:  Well, specifically we think that we need rules of the road.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's a good point.</p><p>SMITH:  We need governments to come together and, you know, it needs to be  off limits, especially to be attacking civilians, to be attacking  hospitals, to be attacking the electrical grid.  If we can't get  governments to do that, it's a very difficult task for the tech sector to  make up for the difference.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Let me move on to your second issue in terms of top  issues and that is immigration specifically the travel ban and the fight  over DACA, the dreamers.</p><p>I spoke with Princeton president Christopher Eisgruber about a letter that  he wrote to President Trump with you in defense of the Dreamers.  Here's  what he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRISTOPHER EISGRUBER, PRESIDENT, PRINCETON UNIVERSITY:  Well, what Brad  Smith, the president of Microsoft and I said was that we know from our  personal experience with these students on the Princeton campus and as  employees of Microsoft, these are people who have had spent all of their  lives in America, who are law-abiding, talented and hardworking.  It makes  a difference to our future as a country and at Princeton and Microsoft that  we'd be bale to keep these people at Princeton as they had been promised.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think most people would agree with that.  They've only lived  here.</p><p>SMITH:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right -- for the most part.</p><p>Tell us how it affects technology?</p><p>SMITH:  Well, the life blood of technology is people.  It's our employees.   And it really required that we have the best and most talented people in  the world.  In the United States that means a great mix of people born in  the United States and people who have come from elsewhere.</p><p>We had 45 employees at Microsoft who are dreamers.  We have many more  employees who've come here lawfully from other countries, many of them are  waiting for green cards.  They're worried about whether they're going to be  able to continue to work under their visa.</p><p>It is a cloud that is hanging over the future of the tech sector and the  competitiveness of the U.S. tech sector.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the other side, you know, pushing for what they want is to  say look, yes, we want the dreamers to stay here and have a path to  citizenship.  But at the same time we don't want it to happen at the  expense of American citizens.  What do you say to that?</p><p>SMITH:  I agree.  We want a world where we create better opportunities for  people in the United States, in every corner of the United States.  That's  why we're working to bring broadband to rural counties, for example. </p><p>But we need the kind of very talented people who help create jobs here.   They start companies here.  It is not a zero sum game it if it is done well  and it is doing it well that we have to come together as a country to do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's interesting because when you look at where  unemployment is right now, you're talking about almost full employment,  right.  Four percent unemployment is extraordinary, very strong.</p><p>But from a technology standpoint and corporate America standpoint, people  feel like we can't find workers to take the jobs that are actually  available.</p><p>SMITH:  It is a huge challenge.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So we need immigration.  </p><p>SMITH:  We need to do better for our own people and we need immigration.   That is the only way we're going to fill the jobs in the United States.   Otherwise, the jobs will get filled somewhere else.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>No, I understand what you're saying.  So what are you doing about that?</p><p>SMITH:  Well, what we're doing is investing every day in better digital  skills for American students.  We have a program that is in 349 high  schools in 29 states across the country.  At the same time we are engaged  every day with the administration hoping to find the key that unlocks this  immigration stalemate.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You're doing a great job.</p><p>The other issues on the list of the need for technology in rural  communities, certainly university in the technology industry -- the battle  over privacy, and surveillance.  Tell me about privacy and surveillance  because this is an issue that corporate America is spending hundreds of  millions of dollars on in terms of privacy and surveillance. </p><p>How do you see it?</p><p>SMITH:  Well, two things need to come together -- our customers need to  have confidence that their records will be protected -- individuals,  consumers need that confidence.  And at the same time, we do have real  surveillance questions we've continued to work through -- really still in  the wake of Edward Snowden.</p><p>We have a case that will be argued before the Supreme Court on February  27th.  The Department of Justice is asserting that it can use its  subpoenas, it's warrants, to go get e-mails in any data center anywhere in  the world.</p><p>Other countries are saying no.  We need international processes.  We don't  want a world where every government seeks to reach in to every day, the  center -- everywhere else.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It's a good point -- Brad.  All right.  I want to ask you  about artificial intelligence.  But first let me ask you about Microsoft.   Congratulations, fantastic performance.  The stop once again hitting  another all-time high just the other day.  What is behind this growth?</p><p>I know you're putting earnings in the next week so you're not going to talk  specifics here.  But what's driving this growth.  How did you and Satya  Nadella manage to turn this ship around in terms of growth?</p><p>SMITH:  Well, I think first of all we are living at a time when software is  changing every part of the economy.  Every business in every sector is  realizing that its own path to growth probably involves what we call  digital transformation.</p><p>We've made it our mission to help them use technology to unlock that  growth.  Part of it is the cloud.  Part of it is artificial intelligence.   If they succeed we succeed.  It's actually a pretty simple formula.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Is the growth at Microsoft in the next five years also come from  the Cloud.</p><p>SMITH:  I think it comes from the Cloud, it comes from artificial  intelligence.  It comes from what's called augmented reality, mixed reality  so to speak.  And at the end of the day it comes from our employees.  And  the cultural change that Satya I think has really led for all of us.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tell me about artificial intelligence and its role in this  growth story and in society?</p><p>SMITH:  Well fundamentally Artificial Intelligence is about making machines  more powerful, the ability to see, to recognize what they see, the ability  to understand speech, the ability to learn and what it really means is when  you combine Artificial Intelligence with you know, sort of growing human  capacity, you start to find new ways to get more done, to find break- through solutions to some important problems, tool drive efficiencies and  productivity in business.</p><p>I think we are entering and AI era around the world.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No doubt about it but I mean robotics and machines, are they  taking over jobs?</p><p>How work (ph) - here we are having a discussion about Immigration we need  more jobs and yet some of these jobs are going away because of Machine  Learning.</p><p>SMITH:  I think we can say that three things will be true.</p><p>AI will eliminate some jobs.  AI will create lots of new jobs.  And AI will  change probably all of our jobs.</p><p>What it really means is it doesn't matter whether you work at a big company  or in a one-person business, we are all going to keep learning, we need to  learn new skills, we need to focus our educational institutions and our  whole economy and sort of the reskilling that is going to be required --  happily not in the next month, we have time but in the coming decade and  decades.</p><p>This is going to be part of our lives.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Really amazing stuff here, Brad.</p><p>Great to talk with you.</p><p>SMITH:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.</p><p>Brad Smith, Microsoft.</p><p>We'll be right back, stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Here again is Maria Bartiromo with a Special Edition of  MORNINGS WITH MARIA live from Davos, Switzerland at the World Economic  Forum.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Good Wednesday morning everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm  Maria Bartiromo and it is Wednesday, January 24th; your top stories right  now, 7:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>The White House descending on Davos, President Trump set to leave (ph) D.C.  for (ph) the World Economic Forum, tonight.  The trip comes as the White  House makes good on the commander-in-chief's promise to put \"America  First.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GARY COHN, PRESIDENT, GOLDMAN SACHS &amp; DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC  COUNCIL AND CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISOR TO PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP:  - President  Trump's tax reform and tax cuts.

There has never been anything like it.  Now Disney,  JPMorgan Chase and many others.  Massive Regulation Reduction and Tax Cuts  are making us a powerhouse again.  Long way to go.  Jobs.  Jobs. Jobs. (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>Meanwhile markets this morning are looking higher.  Take a look, we've got  another rally underway for stock prices, the Dow Industrials set to open up  about 100 points today, a third of a percent higher; the S&amp;P 500 also  higher adding on to yesterday's record-setting performance; and the NASDAQ  also add another all-time high, up now another 12 points this morning.</p><p>Investors are watching earnings from the likes of General Electric and  Comcast, hitting the tape earlier this morning.</p><p>Now GE missed expectations on both earnings and revenue but look at the  stock, up two percent this morning; investors are clearly seeing value  after this 40 percent selloff in GE over the last year.</p><p>Comcast was better than expected, that stock is lower.</p><p>In Europe this morning the major indices are lower across-the-board.  Take  a look at Europe and stock prices today where the FT 100 is down one half  of a percent; the CAC krone is down a fraction; and the DAX Index is lower  as well, really break-even on the DAX.</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets closed mostly higher with the exception of Japan  which was down three-quarters of one percent.</p><p>A big shape - shakeup at UBS' $2.3 trillion Wealth Management Division.   Earlier I sat down with UBS Chairman, Axel Weber, here's what he had to say  about the Wealth Management business which is driving the business at UBS.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>AXEL WEBER, CHAIRMAN, UBS &amp; CHAIR OF THE GOVERNANCE AND NOMINATING  COMMITTEE:  The quarter has been good for us and of course you know, in  addition to the frontloaded (ph) impact of the US tax reforms which  produced a write-down of our DTAs the business has been growing steadily.</p><p>We've had record values of net new money in the Bank, our Wealth Management  business is doing fine.  We've gone through the transformation of the  Wealth Management business over a number of years now and we're very strong  in Americas, in the business, we are very strong globally and that's why  (ph) we decided we would start integrating back offices for example and we  will move to a co-head structure of our Global Wealth Management business.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's talk about tax reform, you mentioned it a moment ago, the  law taking place now, this year, what kind of an impact have you seen?</p><p>WEBER:  Well so we're expecting a good half percent impact on US growth  this year and next year and beyond that I think we are waiting for what the  US will announce on Infrastructure investments and that's going to be a key  driver I guess of this year potentially.</p><p>But in general; what you're seeing is the mood in the market is very, very,  good; you're seeing the global income improve, output gaps closing.  </p><p>The big thing that people don't really have on their radar screen is  inflation is starting to tick up.  </p><p>I mean oil has normalized so what used to be a tail-wind for inflation  figures that produced lower inflation was the downturn in the oil price but  now with oil above 70, inflation data are going to come in stronger, wage  growth is going to be stronger in Europe, and wage price dynamics are going  to start impacting on inflation.</p><p>So, I think central banks might be - not because they are behind of the  curve but simply by better data coming in and if that data depending (ph)  might be driven to speeding up somewhat the degree to which they retreat  from market.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But that's the point, I mean we're talking now about inflation.   We probably will be talking about inflation, wage gains, in the coming  year, is that going to be the trigger that actually surprises investors,  there's a lot of optimism out there, are people too optimistic?</p><p>WEBER:  Yes.  If you look at for example, volatility is at an all-time low,  complacency and risk-taking is very high in the market and we've been  advising our clients to actually 'cover their bets' because I think with  volatility so low and risk insurance being available relatively  inexpensive, doesn't mean that you don't need insurance, it means you  should buy insurance at a reasonable price.</p><p>And we've been doing that ourselves.  We've been recommending it to  clients.</p><p>And I think there are some headwinds that we're going to see this year,  despite all the tailwinds, the economy, the global economy still has,  geopolitical risks clearly still out there.</p><p>The whole discussion here started by Canada and Mexico and now the  president will come here, about NAFTA and what the international trade  agreements are.</p><p>In a world where global exchange of goods and services has been a key  driver of growth, undoing some of that or scaling it back will mean that we  - it will impact negatively on growth.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you seeing people want to shift their money toward the US  because of the tax package -</p><p>WEBER:  Well we're for example -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  - international (ph)?</p><p>WEBER:  - Yes.  So, we're long US Equity and we're long Global Equity  still.</p><p>We think this is not the time to disengage in equity markets.</p><p>And since the US profitability and corporating to have a long position on  US Equity and I think that's the right place to be.</p><p>So yes, globally, there is a strong perception that the US will benefit  over the next two years, over proportionately from this reorientation of  policy, away from Monetary Policy only, to a more balanced mix between  Fiscal, Monetary, and some Structural policies down the road.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about regulation because the roll-back in  regulation has been much talked about in the United States and now we have  new people who are running these agencies but actually the roll-back has  not hit the banks yet.</p><p>What kind of a runway are you expecting for the entire industry given this  roll back in regulations which is quite significant?</p><p>WEBER:  It's significant and it will not just be limited to the United  States.</p><p>There is a long debate now on whether some of the Dodd-Frank rules, some of  the Volcker Rule implementation, some of the Net Stable Funding Ratio  arrangements that banks will have to cater for, a fundamental review of the  trading book, whether all of that will get embedded into national  legislation.</p><p>Now the focus is, will that global regulatory framework get implemented in  national legislation and that's no longer the Bar Committee, that's - in  the US, that's politics, that's where basically Capitol Hill will have a  big role to play and the president will have a role.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And so that will take a longer time than people expect then, is  what you're saying?</p><p>WEBER:  It should take a - take a longer time -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>WEBER:  - and therefore the need for additional capital raising for  maintaining large capital buffers to you know, to digest some of these  developments, is clearly not going to be at much of the forefront of what  the guidance for financial institutions will be.</p><p>We've already seen US banks give guidance that their capital ratios, medium  to long-term are not their current ratios because some of that had been  trying to raise capital for potential developments.</p><p>And we've just recently did that on Monday as well, we said, 'look, our  capital ratio medium to long-term will be around 13 percent,' and because  we have more clarity now, we can't really take it too far because national  implementation of these Basel rules is going to be a key factor on what  actual capital requirements will be like but we expect clarity over the  next year on that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Interesting that the IMF recently raised forecast for growth  for this year and next year across the globe, except for the UK.</p><p>Interesting that the UK has now become the underperformer of Europe?</p><p>WEBER:  And you know, with Brexit looming it's pretty clear, it's a  countdown happening and we know it will be an event; Brexit will not be a  non-event.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There are actually some surprises on the upside in Europe as  well, for example France?</p><p>WEBER:  Yes.  Absolutely and I think the two things that surprised me most  this year is, how long it actually takes the former government in Germany  and how that has been inhabitating and you know, has really not made it  possible for Merkel to give strong commitment on the road ahead, whereby  Macron, a newly elected president is now giving long-term visions to  Europe.</p><p>And if you look a year ago, the balance of power between Germany and  France, in the perception of who drives the European agenda, has been the  other way around.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about UBS, what do you want to see in terms of  changes, where does the growth come from at UBS in the coming three years?</p><p>WEBER:  So, we've been very clear that given our business model and focus  on wealth management and the regions in which we our present, our business  will grow twice global GDP.</p><p>So other than retail banks who basically move along with the economy, we  have a chance of growing much more than the global economy and that would  mean if you have the global economy priced currently at about four percent,  3.9 percent growth, that could mean our business growth - out grows that by  a wide margin.</p><p>And that means that our business in particular in Asia-Pacific will  continue to be the driver of profitability, and our US business given the  much better performance of the US economy will be a driver of  profitability.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Does it surprise you though that we're talking of four percent  growth, we're talking about all of this optimism and yet capital markets  business continue to be just OK.  I mean when you look at you know, Fixed  Income Trading, I mean trading really under pressure?</p><p>WEBER:  It's point that I'd said before about -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Low volatility (ph).</p><p>WEBER:  - volatility -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>WEBER:  - if the market really doesn't see any great risk and isn't pricing  risks, that complacency leads to many not buying insurance about risk.</p><p>There are people that are selling volatility, long and I think that's a  very dangerous strategy because volatility usually whilst it is low at this  point in time, any repricing of the current expected consensus will lead to  massive changes in market prices because everyone's pretty much focused on  the same strategy.</p><p>And as soon as that consensus gets disturbed people will trade out of the  events and market prices will move massively.</p><p>And so, volatility when it comes back, it will come back with a vengeance.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  My thanks to Axel Weber.</p><p>We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>A very frightening bus ride, to school for dozens of students in  Massachusetts.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the story now in New York, Cheryl?</p><p>CASONE:  It's a crazy video Maria, we're going to show it to you.</p><p>Twenty-nine students were on board this school bus.  The bus was trying to  drive up and icy hill, lost traction.</p><p>Look at it sliding backwards?</p><p>And it's about to knock out - Yes, there goes the mailbox and it keeps  going.  </p><p>And then, next up, hits the (ph) car.</p><p>This school bus was filled with kids, now luckily nobody was hurt and get  this, and afterwards the bus continued on its way to school.</p><p>Now we have that video to watch, and probably the kids do too.</p><p>Well ahead of Ben Shapiro's speech on the University of Connecticut's  Campus today, the College is offering counseling to students personally  offended by Shapiro's conservative views.</p><p>UConn also banned the public from attending Shapiro's speech, only  students, faculty, and special invitees, are going to be allowed to attend;  security is going to be heightened on campus, there are fears that  political disagreements could turn into violent protests.</p><p>Well Walmart is returning to the Academy Awards.  The Company plans to air  60-seconds commercials during the award show and this year these ads will  have three, all - it's all-female directors this time, it's Melissa  McCarthy, Dee Reeves (ph), and Nancy Meyers, there are the ladies on your  screen.</p><p>Walmart executives said 'the Company is not trying to cash in on the \"Me  Too\" movement but simply put on a show that will hopefully resonate with  their audience.'  They did this last year (ph).</p><p>Shares of Walmart up about 60 percent from just one year ago; there's the  chart for you.</p><p>And then finally this Maria, have you ever wanted to attend Hogwarts School  of Witchcraft and Wizardry?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Have you ever made anything happen, anything that you  couldn't explain.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You're a wizard Harry.</p><p>HARRY POTTER:  I'm -- I'm a what?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Well thanks to Barge Lady cruise company, you can spend your next  vacation on a Harry Potter-themed cruise, down London's River Thames.</p><p>The 6:00 to 8:00 (ph) cruise has key stops at filming location, Hogwarts  Great Hall which Is actually Oxford's Christ Church College, number 4  Privet Drive, and go to Warner Bros. Studios, they've got sets, costumes,  and props from all of the movies there.</p><p>All this can be yours Maria, for just $36,000, just $6,000 a day and I'll  leave you with this, 'there is an open bar,' for the entire thing.</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>That's cool, all right.</p><p>Cheryl, thank you.</p><p>Coming up for the first time in the World Economic Forum's history, the  seven co-chairs are all women.</p><p>The US Chairman and CEO of KPMG, Lynne Doughtie will weigh in on that,  right here, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>The World Economic Forum makes history, this year the WEF summits, chaired  entirely by women, for the first time in the Forum's 48-year history.</p><p>Among the historic board members is, IBM Chief Executive, Ginni Rometty;  Norwegian Prime Minister, Erna Solberg; and joining us from right now from  Davos, Switzerland, is KPMG, US Chairman and CEO, Lynne Doughtie.</p><p>Lynne, great to see you.</p><p>Thank so much -</p><p>LYNNE DOUGHTIE, US CHAIRMAN &amp; CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER:  It's great -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  - for joining us.</p><p>DOUGHTIE:  - to see you.  Thank -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>DOUGHTIE:  - you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you, a woman, running this major corporation,  congratulations to you.</p><p>DOUGHTIE:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you make of this all-female line up?</p><p>DOUGHTIE:  Well, I think they are the most qualified individuals to be part  of the co-chairs this year so I think it's tremendous, I think it's great  that we show that women are in the forefront kind of setting the stage for  Davos.</p><p>But as you know, we still - when we look at the delegate representation,  you know, we're still hoping at - around 20 percent so we need to improve  that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, the delegates, meaning companies, right, I mean you've got  to get kind (ph) - it's companies who decide who comes to Davos?</p><p>DOUGHTIE:  That's right and one of the things that we said at KPMG this  year, now leading into Davos was to do a social media campaign around women  voices knowing that you know, the representation is probably not where we  want it to be, let's get women from across the globe to add their voice to  Davos.</p><p>And so far, we've had about a half a million voices in this social media  campaign so it raises attention and I think you know, companies need to  really focus on how we're getting more women into the C-Suite.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  For sure.  And how do you do it?  </p><p>I mean the World Economic Forum published a report in November, exploring  the gender parity.</p><p>In 144 countries, this is what they found, the overall global gender gap  can be close in exactly 100 years; the most prominent gender gaps are  economic- and health-based.</p><p>So, what do you think it's going to take, why is it so hard for women to  get to the CEO suite, for example?</p><p>DOUGHTIE:  Well I think the one great thing about this is, this is a  conversation that's happening everywhere -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>DOUGHTIE:  - so there is massive attention to it and you know, I'll brag  about my own profession where you know, of the Big Four, we now, with the  change at EY in the US, we have three women of the Big Four, leading those  firms so I think that's tremendous progress.</p><p>But to your point you know, how do you make a difference?</p><p>I mean it requires you to be surgical within your company to ensure that  you are looking at, do you have the most diverse perspectives at the table.</p><p>You know, the conversation in here in Davos is all about you know,  disruption and how things are changing so fast you have to be agile.  Well  if you don't have Diversity and Inclusion in your organization, you won't  be the most successful so it's a business imperative.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, absolutely.</p><p>Let me ask you about your own business and -</p><p>DOUGHTIE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  - what you are doing, you recently announced the acquisition of  Cyber Inc. -</p><p>DOUGHTIE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  - which provides Cyber-security globally, where are your  priorities right now at the firm?</p><p>DOUGHTIE:  Well, I think that acquisition points to the importance of Cyber  as a top risk on CEOs agenda all over the place and it's - and it's - it's  no surprise because with Artificial Intelligence as technology is being  embedded in basically everything that organizations do, the threat of Cyber  is more important than ever.</p><p>And I think you are talking about it with Microsoft earlier today -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Absolutely.</p><p>DOUGHTIE:  - how that is something that every organization is focused on.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think - I think J.P.

Welcome back,  everybody.  Thank you so much for joining us this morning.  It is  Wednesday, January 24th.  The top stories right now 8:00 A.M. on the East  Coast.  America First on the world stage.  President Trump and his  administration heads to Davos to tout the U.S. economy and lure big-name  investors to America.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin making headline  down the ground in Davos already.  The dollar is down this morning after  Secretary Mnuchin said a weaker dollar is good for the U.S. economy.  He's  not the only cabinet member making headlines.  Earlier this morning, I  spoke with Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen about the  delegation to the World Economic Forum.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>KIRSTJEN NIELSEN, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY:  I think  what this message is going to be is America First is not America alone.  We  need to partner, you know, as I said earlier, not one of us has the ability  to do this alone.  So we need to partner with the private secretary.  We  need to partner with our allies.  We've seen those discussions with North  Korea.  We've seen that in Syria.  We've seen that in Iran.  We have to  build coalitions to be able to attack these threats together and I think --  I think that's what you'll hear a lot about.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The president's trip to Davos comes amid another case of  trickle-down tax reform.  Starbucks, the latest company passing on savings  from the new tax law to its employees.  The announcement coming on the  heels of similar news from Disney, J.P. Morgan Chase, and Verizon and that  was just yesterday.  What the coffee giant is brewing up for its records  coming up.  New and more records from markets, the NASDAQ yesterday surged  52 points after Netflix stock jumped 10 percent.  The S&amp;P 500 also added  all-time high this morning after another gain yesterday of 6 points quarter  of a percent higher.  The Dow pulled back yesterday but this morning we  look at momentum on the upside we're expecting a pretty strong opening for  the broader averages.  Take a look at Futures with the Dow Industrials now  at the highs of the morning.  We're expecting a gain of 80 points right out  of the gate a third of a percent higher, S&amp;P 500 also higher by a quarter  of a percent, and the NASDAQ adding on to yesterday's record performance.  </p><p>In Europe, this morning different story.  Take a look at the European  indices lower across the board worst performer in the U.K. FT-100 down one  half of one percent.  In Asia overnight, markets closed mostly higher with  the exception of Japan as you see the Nikkei averaging Japan down three- quarters of a percent overnight.  Earnings, the story on Wall Street once  again General Electric, Ford Motor, Comcast, all among the big names  reporting their fourth quarter numbers.  Comcast delivered a double beat  earnings and revenue above estimates.  General Electric missed estimates  but look at the stock, it's up one and one and a half percent.  Clearly,  investors are seeing some value in G.E. shares after a 40 percent sell-off  despite that miss on earnings.</p><p>Trouble patching the patch, well, Intel is still struggling to repair the  glaring flaw in its chips sparking new concerns this morning for  cybersecurity.  Plus, hackers cash in on the cryptocurrency craze.  The  stunning amount stolen from the billions raised in initial coin offerings  amid the Bitcoin boom.  We will tell you about that.  Also coming up this  morning, joining the conversation Energy Secretary Rick Perry is with us  this morning along with Dow CEO Andrew Liveris, the CEO of Cisco Chuck  Robbins is here, and the CEO of Campbell Soup Denise Morrison.  </p><p>Plus, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney weighs in.  You don't  want to miss the moments with them.  We got a big hour coming up.  First,  this top story this hour, America First on the world stage.  President  Trump headed to the World Economic Forum in Davos.  Tonight, he's expected  to arrive tomorrow.  Treasure Secretary Steven Mnuchin already on the  ground here in Switzerland and he's making news.  He had comments this  morning saying that he welcomes a weakening dollar because it is good for  trade.  That sent the dollar to fresh new lows this morning.  Though  Mnuchin also emphasized America is open for business.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY:  We have a great  story to tell, lots of important meetings.  It's truly all about economic  growth opportunities to invest free and fair trade, and kind of -- so we're  looking forward to it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You can do that.  If you don't want to, you don't have  to.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's fine.  This is coming as companies here in U.S. are  giving back to their employees in the wake of the tax reform overhaul.   President Trump just tweeted this, this morning.  He says, tremendous  investment by companies from all over the world being made in America.   There has never been anything like it.  The president writes now, Disney,  JPMorgan Chase, and many others, massive regulation reduction tax cuts  making the U.S. a powerhouse once again.  He says, long way to go, jobs,  jobs, jobs.  Joining me now to weigh in is the Chairman and CEO of E.Y.,  Global Chairman and CEO Mark Weinberger.  Mark, it's great to see you.  </p><p>MARK WEINBERGER, GLOBAL CHAIRMAN AND CEO OF E.Y.:  Always a pleasure,  Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So I know that you have been  on panels this morning.  You're talking to a lot of your customers and  clients about what's taking place in the U.S. and the tax reform bill that  is having a really big impact.</p><p>WEINBERGER:  It is, Maria.  We're seeing, you know, obviously, it doesn't  make the U.S. a tax heaven but what it does do is give us a competitor rate  and it allows companies to move their capital around without having to pay  that extra level of tax.  We are seeing supply changed being reevaluated,  operations and investment being expanded and as you said, we're seeing a  whole bunch of things like increasing wages, bonuses, pension payments,  healthcare payments.  The real question is you know it has been are the  businesses going to give back to shareholders and stock buybacks and  dividends or investing in capital and labor?  I think you're going to see  all of that but it's a positive -- definitely a positive momentum here in  Davos.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And all of the above is positive?  </p><p>WEINBERGER:  All of the above are positive, gives back in the economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But let me ask you this because we see this tax plan having an  immediate effect with the companies announcing these things, but this is  really going to have a longer-term effect, isn't it?</p><p>WEINBERGER:  That is a great point because everyone is saying, what's this  going to do next quarter?  This is a landmark tax reform bill that  structurally changes business taxes like we haven't even done since 1960s.   We talk about the 1986 Act.  That was a lot of individual changes.   International rules are written in the 60s.  This completely changes how a  company thinks about where to put his capital.  It's not just U.S.  businesses.  We're talking to many Asian companies, European companies, who  are looking to invest in the U.S. to get advantage of the full expensing,  the lower corporate rate, and a number of other benefits of just being a  great market.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.  I was speaking to a European player recently and  he said, we had a whole plan to invest in Europe.  We've shifted that plan  and now we'll be investing in America which is -- </p><p>WEINBERGER:  We'll see more of that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which is very positive.  All right.  There's that.  The  president and his administration getting high marks on the tax reform  package.  No doubt about it.  But then there's trade where there are some  questions.  The president yesterday announced steep tariffs on solar  panels, on washing machines while 11 Pacific Rim countries agreed to forge  a new commercial block that excludes the U.S., obviously, the U.S. pulling  out of the TPP, what's your take on what's happening with regards to trade?  </p><p>WEINBERGER:  So I think the speech is you and your league, you talked about  it's going to be really important because the president has to balance and  enforcing the laws.  I mean this, you know, putting tariffs on solar isn't,  you know, changing the whole landscape of trade, in fact, from 2012 and  2015, we had tariffs on solar.  So there are really uncertainty now is  where is he go next?  And we need to be involved in trade deals around the  world.  We can't be left out.  Ninety-five percent of the world's  consumers, 80 percent of GDP growth is outside the United States.  So  businesses want to be able to go there.  The U.S. is and open market.  We  let everybody in.  Trade deals are good for businesses.  In the U.S., they  create jobs.  So the question is going to be, does this lead to more and  more retaliation and trade wars?  Or is this enforcement of existing deals  and renegotiations of NAFTA or renegotiations of course, and discussions  with China to get to a positive trade deal?  That's what everyone is going  to be watching.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So one of the issues with NAFTA is it basically sets the  companies, look, you can have a factory overseas in Mexico and you can  produce cheap stuff and then you can send them back to the U.S. and sell  them in U.S., so of course, companies are going to do just that in higher  workers at a much lower wage in Mexico.  And then once NAFTA was completed  and then everybody started doing that, that became the template for all  trade deals?</p><p>WEINBERGER:  Well, it's true.  But if you think -- but there are so many  examples where you know, well, I mean how do you even implement as you  don't know what the cargo -- component parts going over and back across the  border in Canada six times.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.  </p><p>WEINBERGER:  And iPhone is 800 different companies worked on an iPhone in  31 different countries and the component parts all come together into the  United States, so --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what are they going to do, pay a tariff every time they  cross --</p><p>WEINBERGER:  They couldn't do it.  You couldn't afford an iPhone if you had  a tariff every level of the company in the United States.  You couldn't get  the labor done if you try to bring it all back to the United States.  So we  need to understand that this helps the United States too to have these  trade deals in place.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So there's got to a balance between fair trade but also not  hurting the customer because ultimately that's going to fall on the  consumer who's going to pay more for a product because the company that  makes it is paying a tariff?  </p><p>WEINBERGER:  Absolutely.  It's like a tax here that we just reduced.  So  but you're in the nail in the head, Maria, as always.  The pivot we got to  watch and see right now from feeding up on our trading partners.  First, a  lot of bad deals and upgrading necessarily trade deals to starting to  negotiating positively the new deals.  Seeing if NAFTA will get done this  year.  We have a lot of negotiations coming up this month, of course, the  Mexican elections coming up on midterms and coming up makes it hard.   Mercosur is positively moving forward, so we're going to try and negotiate  that.  We got to make progress in those deals and that will set a good  signal. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Let me ask you, Mark.  And turn to -- turn to Bitcoin  because according to new research, you and Ernst &amp; Young did recently more  than 10 percent of funds raised through initial coin offerings are lost or  stolen in hacker attacks?  </p><p>WEINBERGER:  Yes.  Well, this is -- as we know, it's a really complicated  area and, you know, these coin offerings are plenty.  There's over a  hundred different indexes out there where they're coming in there's  offerings.  They are obviously susceptible to fraud and theft.  They become  more of an investment than a currency and so I think appropriately you have  the government to look at it where we point it out there is that investors  -- it's not an investor.  It's really a tool to be a currency.  You have to  be cautious how you're investing in it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  One more risk to watch around Bitcoin?  </p><p>WEINBERGER:  Always, a lot more.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mark, great to see you.</p><p>WEINBERGER:  Always, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us this morning, Mark Weinberger  or EY.  Coming up, General Electric releases its 4th quarter results  missing earnings and revenue expectations.  We'll break those numbers.   Nonetheless, the stock is up 1-1/2 percent.  And then more concerns over  cybersecurity, Intel is telling customers to stop installing a software  patch release to address a security flaw in their computer chips.  We've  got the details next.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are live this week at the World Economic  Forum here in Davos, Switzerland.  President Trump will be here tomorrow.   Joining me right now and a first time Fox Business interview DowDuPont  Executive Chairman, CEO Andrew Liveris who is also the head of the now  disbanded president -- Americans Manufacturing Council.  Good to see you,  sir.  Thank you so much for joining us.  </p><p>LIVERIS:  Nice to be with you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  No.  We're coming into this meeting there was a lot of  optimism.  But would you say that this is one of the most optimistic Davos  meetings you've ever seen? </p><p>LIVERIS:  Definitely one of the most optimistic and also one full of  expectation for the president visit here on Friday.  So really the topic is  the president's visit.  So most of us are getting all of that meetings done  before tomorrow because I think it's going to tilt very quickly to what the  president is going to say and kind of his team is kind of coming in already  with meeting some of them.  I had a couple of meetings today with U.S.  officials.  I've never seen such a strong U.S. delegation.  So this is kind  of opposite to America First thing.  I mean this is America engaged and as  a global company, this is a positive thing.  And I think my European  colleagues and the rest of the world colleagues Asian, Middle East, Africa,  they're all kind of waiting to see how the U.S. will posture itself.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is a really good way to put it American engaged, I like  that.  How is the president doing in your view?  I know that, you know, you  were on that council.  You were the chairman.  It was disbanded.  There was  upset at that time, but how would you grade President Trump's by now?  </p><p>LIVERIS:  Well, from a year ago to present day even through the year with  the disbanding of the council, I've been very consistent on that answer.   This is a very business-friendly president, very business friendly  administration, so I give him a strong A.  I mean, you know, the tax reform  you just talked about I mean but not just tax reform, the regulatory work  is being done.  It's astonishing.  I've never imagined that much progress  in 12 months or so and of course other work that I'm involved in which I'm  on secretary of (INAUDIBLE) workforce reinvention counsel.  This is the  apprenticeship task force which is to redefine what the American system is  producing in terms of skilled workers with digitalization approaching us.   I'm very encouraged by that work and that early stuff that we're doing to  change the way America supplies workers we need and so I'm very -- I give - - I give it a strong A.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's very important because we're seeing machine learning take  over jobs and we're seeing new skillsets really required.  OK.  So positive  marks on the tax reform package.  We know that.  We know what's going on  but all of these companies coming out and saying how positive it is, but  we're also seeing a debate around the trade story and that's I want to get  your take on because the president issued new tariffs on imports of solar  panels and washing machines from Asia, what do you make of this?  </p><p>LIVERIS:  Well, so, you know, now that -- you just said tax reform  happening and let's skip the details of that finalized.  But trade is of  course on his agenda and the business agenda are topic he ran for office on  and there's a lot of work to be done whether it be the redoing of NAFTA and  whatever form it takes, the China discussion, and of course, all the things  that the president worries about which is giving Americans jobs that they  can count on for the future.  You just mentioned machine learning and  digitalization.  We all know that's as big a potential job killer as  anything in the trade agenda.  So we've got all to engage our workers.   We've got to engage the American public to actually put the facts in front  of the table of what is the trade topic.  And it isn't -- look at Dow, I  mean I export from the United States to all countries of the world.  </p><p>One in five of my jobs is based on America being a trader, so we got to  keep trade.  But what the president is doing is he wants to change the  rules of engagement.  And I think we all have to engage in that topic, so  what are these rules?  OK.  It isn't just about putting tariffs on and on  that tariff question, I mean we Dow make a polysilicon.  That's a -- the  raw material for solar panels.  We've been excluded from the China market  for the last five years, so that's not far.  So these tariffs on solar  panels is a way of sending a signal that it can't be one way.  It can't be  one-way trade and I support the president on that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is really important because you've actually seen firsthand  the impact of much cheaper products coming from China.  </p><p>LIVERIS:  Absolutely.  And then, so American workers, we can't -- we are  now having plants at risks, factories at risks because I can't access the  China market and they favor their own producers, yet the solar panels are  being -- coming over here and killing our solar panel industry in the  United States.  So there needs to be a recalibration with lots of  conversation with Secretary Ross in the USTR on this topic.  So that's an  example of recalibrating the rules of trade and I'm all for that, but I  think we need to get the facts on the table, get the rhetoric out of room,  and, you know, what are these rules of engagement in terms of fair trade.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is the first explanation that really I've heard that make  so much sense because you're right there and you're feeling it firsthand.   The worry is of course, are we going to see retaliation?  I mean are you  going to China even get more secluded and even more protectionist in terms  of their solar panels?</p><p>LIVERIS:  Well, since antiquity and city-states, and bartering view, of  course, get tit-for-tat.  You, of course, get retaliation.  This is what  negotiation is.  This president is a negotiator.  We have a team of  negotiations in the U.S. side.  I'm a businessperson.  I'm going  negotiator.  As long as we end up at the right spot, I think the rhetoric  and the retaliation may will be part of the process.  I'm convinced based  on speed of tax reform and the speed of regulatory reform, this will not be  one of these things that takes a lot of time.  So I would encourage all my  colleagues certainly our company to be engaged, to be at the table on what  these tit-for-tats will be.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think we're going to see more of this like for example  as it relates to aluminum and steel because the president did say -- he  mentioned aluminum and steel and I think that is getting some people  nervous that we're going to see more and more of this kind of tariff  behavior and it's --</p><p>LIVERIS:  Well, I'm not in -- I'm not in the room that decides which ones  but I am telling you, if I look at chemicals, for example, we have a  surplus.  We're the second largest exporter from the United States.  So we  would hate to see if steel and aluminum thing happen and then chemicals,  you know, give restrictions in terms of exporting from the United States  into China or any other country, so I would be counter doing too much tit- for-tat.  But I think this recent one is a strong enough message that the  United States is serious.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, for sure.  And you've given us phenomenal insight into  this.  Andrew, thank you for that.  </p><p>LIVERIS:  Not at all.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You are such a retire as Chairman of DowDuPont later this year  after overseeing its historic deal the merger late last year.  Now, I know  you are reporting earnings.  You're going to be giving us guidelines on all  of this in the coming week.  But what can you tell us in terms of the  timing of integration?  What do you want to say to shareholders in terms of  where you are today?  </p><p>LIVERIS:  Well, I think our shareholders from our last report to present  day what I'll say and then what I'll say next week with specificity.  This  is on track.  As you said, it's historic, 300 years of corporate history  and to reconfigure these assets in a tax-free way pushing in a hold value  for growth, for three companies, the new Dow which will be the materials  company, the new agricultural company, the new specialty company.  We're on  track.  And look, I can't be happier about the way the cultures of being  assimilating, the integration work.  We've got thousands of people working  on this, not to mention all the help in the consultants' world that you can  find.  It's working and I would tell you that you right now and you'll hear  more next week that it's basically on track.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And then in terms of growth look at five years, where does the  growth come from at this company?</p><p>LIVERIS:  Well, I got to tell you that the humanity and sustainability  which gets talked about here a lot.  We need products that have full  circulation capability.  So all that work on light-weighting on batteries  and cars, on the next car what that looks like.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That's a good point.  </p><p>LIVERIS:  Good packaging, what we do with food packaging, what we do with  plastics in the ocean, what we do with carbon emissions, these are all  opportunities for these companies would it be the agricultural one or the  materials one, or the specialty ones, water, and water reuse, waste  management, waste reuse, these are the opportunities that we're addressing  through using out 7500 scientists.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So this is where the growth comes from?  </p><p>LIVERIS:  That's where it comes from.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about regulation.  Obviously, this president has  been rolling back regulations, have you felt it in your sector because I  know other sectors they're not there yet and it sort of the smaller runway,  what have you seen?  </p><p>LIVERIS:  Look, I can't speak strongly enough about how much we've felt it.   It's not just -- it's not just the attitude.  It's being specific and we've  been asked, and it's kind of nice to be consulted to be at the front end of  this, to use science, to say this regulation makes sense.  This one  doesn't.  This administration has been unafraid to roll back regulations  that make no sense.  We felt it.  We're feeling it on our bottom line.  But  more importantly, we're seeing it in a change in attitude on what's the  smarter regulation.  We are for regulation.  We just want the right type of  regulation to actually manage the behaviors of everyone in the value chain.   We're a big player.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the pendulum just swung way too far.  Andrew, it's great to  see you.  </p><p>LIVERIS:  Always going to be with you, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Andrew Liveris there.  We'll be right back.   Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are coming to you live this week from the  World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.  Speaking with the biggest  names in business and innovation, cybersecurity, of course, one of the  agenda topics here as companies like Intel are asking their companies and  their customers to stop installing a software patch that it released to fix  security flaws on computer chips.  The company says that the patch is can  cause, \"Unpredictable system behavior.\"  Joining me right now to weigh in  on that is the CEO of Cisco Chuck Robbins.  Chuck, it's great to see you.  </p><p>CHUCK ROBBINS, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF CISCO SYSTEMS:  Great to see you,  Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I want to talk broadly about what's happening in your  business right now.  But how are you combating the cybersecurity  vulnerability like this one?  </p><p>ROBBINS:  Well, first of all, I think Intel is doing a reasonable job.   It's obviously a significant issue.  In the industry, we all try to come  together when we have these kinds of issues occur and there's a great  cooperative spirit between the major tech companies when we find these  types of issues and we're working through it within just like everybody is,  and I think they're doing the right things.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What can you tell us about I.T. budgets today, Chuck?  I mean  here we are looking at an environment where people are talking about four  percent economic growth.  Your business is the gut to any other business in  a whole host of sectors.  So I want to ask you what you're seeing in terms  of I.T. budgets.  Are managers spending more on your products?</p><p>ROBBINS:  Well, it's early in the year and every year when we start the new  calendar year budgets begin to become more visible as we get into it.  And  we're in the latter part of our quarter now and so we'll be reporting  earnings in a couple weeks and we'll give some insights into that.  But I  think that when you look at what happened here in the country and you look  at tax reform, and you look at the positive feeling here in Davos that you  have at least from an economic perspective, I think that there's a great  deal of optimism around the world right now.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  There really is.  What do you think is powering it?   Because I think from your standpoint it's more than just tax reform, isn't  it?</p><p>ROBBINS:  Well, it is.  And if you look at the economic situation around  the world, it's -- I mean the central banks have done a great job.  You've  got stimulus has been put into the system.  You have had a great, you know,  since the 2008 crisis, we've had a -- we've finally got into a sustained  recovery and now what you see happening that with our business is that as  we've seen here in Davos if you go back three or four years, we were  talking about the internet of things and now the fourth industrial  revolution, and there's no doubt that that's occurring, and no one is  talking about it.  So here we're having conversations about how do we  redefine the architecture inside a vehicle.  Those are the conversations  we're having now.  So technology is permeating every aspect of life and  industry, and as that happens as billions of things become connected.   Obviously, that's good for us.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Let's talk about that because we were talking with Carlo  Stone yesterday and he was saying, everything in a car today is technology  related.  So what areas of business are the most important in terms of  powering your business?  What sectors?</p><p>ROBBINS:  Well, if you look at -- it's happening across every industry  today.  Primarily, we have seen early adoption in manufacturing of this  industrial internet.  We've seen retail move.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Sorry about that.  </p><p>ROBBINS:  That's great.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  This must mean someone important is arriving.  </p><p>ROBBINS:  I know.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because a helicopter is here making lots of noise but hopefully  they just passed.  So you said manufacturing -- </p><p>ROBBINS:  Well, I just want you to know when I arrived in Davos, I wouldn't  interrupt you like that visitor, you know, we've seen manufacturing.  We've  seen healthcare.  We see connected cars.  We made announcements of CES with  Hyundai.  I meet with a couple of car manufacturers here this week about  what we can do together and then across our broader business just the  connectivity of all these devices, the management of the data, the  cybersecurity issues that are associated with it.  They all provide great  opportunities for us in the future.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Because everything is connected today, so tell us how the  Cisco products connect?  </p><p>ROBBINS:  Well, so I think they're circling to come back to see if they --  make sure you heard them the first time.  So when you -- when you look at  the connectivity of all of the platforms, the -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Stop.  Just give it a minute first.  It's going back at out,  yes.  </p><p>ROBBINS:  It's (INAUDIBLE) they're going to land right here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  They're right above us.  </p><p>ROBBINS:  They're going to land.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  This helicopter.  </p><p>ROBBINS:  The matter of the issue is as we connect vehicles, as we connect  vending machines, manufacturing facilities whatever they are, Cisco is the  largest machine, the machine connectivity platform.  Then after that, you  have to actually take the data that's created and help our customers move  that data to the place that they need it and whether it's in a public  crowd, whether it's in a private cloud, or whether they want to assess and  manage that data at the edge of the network, the network is going to play a  great role, and then we fundamentally have to drive security in the network  because there is no perimeter to defend it anymore.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wonderful.  Chuck, I'm so sorry.</p><p>ROBBINS:  What did you say?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is -- this is incredible.  We're having a conversation --</p><p>ROBBINS:  We had a funny experienced last year too, you know.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But with the helicopters? </p><p>ROBBINS:  No.  We had one with a camera last year, so --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, that's right.  Let me ask you real quick in terms of  geography and where you see the best growth right now.  Europe is growing.   The U.S. is obviously a chunk of a four percent growth, is there a corner  of the world that is doing better than others with regard to this kind of  activity?</p><p>ROBBINS:  Well, what I would say is that we see probably more consistent  growth around the world than we've seen in a very long time as evidence by  the discussions going on here.  When we look at the adoption of the  technology, we see emerging countries adopting the technology to try to  solve problems in a massive scale whether it's in India, whether it's in  China.  And then we see obviously developed countries leveraging these  technologies to look at how we make cities smarter that had optimized  traffic and optimized citizen services, so it's really happening  everywhere, it's amazing.  So -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Incredible performance.  So how do you keep this going?</p><p>ROBBINS:  Well, I think that as long as this industrial revolution  continues then we should be at the heart of all of that because as our  customers connect more and more devices, the network is absolutely the  foundation, so --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Chuck, it's good to have you on the show.  Thank you so much.   This is great, this is incredible.  This is actually funny.</p><p>ROBBINS:  They're circling.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They're circling.  Chuck Robbins, Cisco CEO, we will be right  back.  Thank you so much.</p><p>LEIF SHIRAS, TENNIS CHANNEL COMMENTATOR: Welcome back to another Tennis  Channel Court Report, a special presentation For Business.  I'm Leif  Shairs.  Well, the 2018 Austrian Open completed quarterfinal action on day  10 in Melbourne and there was American interest in both the man and woman  draws.  Kyung Chang ended the dream run of Tennessee native Tenny Sandgren  to reach the final four and become the first South Korean to reach the  semifinals at a major.</p><p>Elsewhere, Angelique Kerber made short work of Maidson Keys in their  quarterfinal.  The American never found her game as the German powered away  to an impressive one and two victory.  Don't forget, Tennis Channel's live  coverage of the Australian Open continues Wednesday at 6:00 p.m. Eastern.   I'm Leif Sharis.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Here again Maria Bartiromo with the special edition of  MORNINGS WITH MARIA live from Davos, Switzerland at the World Economic  Forum.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Wednesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so  much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Wednesday, January  24th.  Your top stories right now 8:34 on the East Coast.  The White House  descends on Davos.  President Trump set to leave Washington for the World  Economic Forum tonight.  The trip comes as the White House makes good on  the Commander-in-Chief's promise to put America first, this follows the  overwhelming success of the President's tax plan. </p><p>Treasury Secretary Stephen Mnuchin already on the ground and he is making  news, the dollar is sliding this morning after Secretary Mnuchin said a  weaker dollar is good for the U.S. economy and trade during a press  conference in Davos.  Markets this morning are rallying, take a look at the  futures indicating that we will see a higher opening for the broader  averages.  This right here is the high of the morning.  Up better than 100  points in unchartered territory once again. S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ also in  unchartered territory.  The NASDAQ and the S&amp;P hit new record-highs  yesterday.  </p><p>Ahead of the President's trip, investors are watching earning this morning  from the likes of General Electric and Comcast among others.  G.E. reported  earnings and revenue which were below expectation and yet the stock is  trading higher.  The stock up 2-1/2 percent as investors look for value  after a huge selloff.  Comcast also topped expectations although that stock  is lower.  European indices this morning are lower.  The stocks in Europe,  take a look, are weaker across the board pretty much.  FT-100 down one-half  of a half percent, the CAC quarante and DAX are also lower.  In Asia  overnight, markets close mostly higher, take a look.  And as you see, the  markets were higher with the exception of Japan which was down three- quarters of one percent.</p><p>Topping our news this half an hour, President Trump and America First at  Davos.  More than a dozen high-level members of the administration are  arriving here to discuss economics, trade, cybersecurity and a lot more  with the political and corporate leaders gathers here.  Joining me right  now is the United States Secretary of Energy, Secretary Rick Perry.   Secretary, it's great to see you.</p><p>RICK PERRY, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF ENERGY:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  The President's America  First message, how do you think it will be received?</p><p>PERRY:  Well, I think he have to understand what America First means to the  President and the administration.  It's really pretty simple from my  perspective.  This is about America being competitive around the globe.   When folks were thinking about where you want to buy your energy from,  where do you want that next load of LNG to come from?  We want you to think  about America first.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's a good way to put it.  Well, the President has  stressed really tapping into our oil reserves in America.  Let's talk about  that and where the opportunities are from your standpoint.  </p><p>PERRY:  Yes.  Well, you think about 10 plus years ago and then 2005 we were  -- besides ourselves, if you will and behind, other places where the oil  and gas was coming from, you know, we had founded all, Peak oil.  We heard  all of those stories and then, you know, by the grace of God and some  technology and a god by named George Mitchell from Texas, hydraulic  fracturing came into play in a really big way and we were able to go into  those tight shell formations and develop that which is now creating an  absolute revolution in the oil and gas industry and completely changing the  geopolitical dynamics in the world with America being at the forefront.  We  are now the number one oil and gas producing nation on the face of the  earth.  I mean, who would have thought that a decade ago that that would  have been true.  But it puts us in a very unique place.  And here is what I  try to share with all of our allies and for all the audience here at Davos  is that the United States is not just exporting energy, we're exporting  freedom.  We're exporting to our allies in Europe.  The opportunity to  truly have a choice of where do you buy your energy from.  That's freedom,  and that kind of freedom is priceless.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is a really important point that you're making because for  a long time America was reliant on places like Saudi Arabia and Russia to  get energy but today it's a completely different situation in America.  How  significant is it?  I mean, how would you characterize the supply that will  be coming from the U.S. or to the global markets.</p><p>PERRY:  You know, I'm not sure anything since World War II has been anymore  dynamic from my perspective than they shift in the energy supply, energy  control if you will.  And again, the United States in the back controlling  a country with this industry.  It's about literally freeing up our allies  around the world.  Letting them know that we're going to be there for them,  there's no strings attached when you buy American LNG.  So, that is --  that's world-changing.  And truly, this president, that's his message here.   Is that the United States is -- it's a new day.  The fossil fuels that  we're going to be relying them on for decades to come are going to be  available.  Now, is our technology going to be able to allow us to use it  wiser?  With better results for the environment?  Absolutely.  The CCCU,  the carbon capture utilization, we're doing projects with Saudi Arabia.  </p><p>I'll see my counterpart (INAUDIBLE) today on a panel, we'll talk about the  projects that we're working on together.  The UAE, Qatar, all of those  countries as we come together to develop and supply the rest of the world  with the power so that they can have manufacturing (INAUDIBLE) in Africa.   Being able to, you know, literally turn the lights on when the sun goes  down so that their children can read, the people are safer.  I mean, all of  that is partly because of American ingenuity and our abilities to not  believe the naysayers that people is here and you're not going to find any  more of this</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, is there -- is there a way to characterize the amount of  supply that will be coming from the U.S.?</p><p>PERRY:  Well, you know, I hesitate to be a forecaster of what the home  markets are going to be.  I'll leave that up to people that are  substantially more into that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, come on.  You're the Energy Secretary.  Let me ask --</p><p>PERRY:  My job is to make sure that it's -- the abundant supply and I want  to get people together so that they know that America is going to be a  reliant supplier of that energy.  The price will work itself though.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you surprised where prices are by the way because it feels  like the markets are focused more on the potential for terrorism or  disruption.  Where oil is right now.  </p><p>PERRY:  Well, those are realities of the world.  But the fact is that we  have an amazing I mean, you think about Anwar that the Congress just opened  up again.  You know, the previous administration closed it down, Congress  working with the administration said, you know what, those nine million  barrels are really important to the United States and to the world.  So  opening up markets that the previous administration have closed.  I think  it's in a very powerful message around the world that we're going to be a  reliant supplier of energy into the foreseeable future.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Absolutely.  And I think that's why there's change happening in  Saudi Arabia.</p><p>PERRY:  Indeed.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There is incredible change happening in other countries because  they see what to expect from the U.S.  By the way, what was behind the  decision not to drill off of the coast of Florida?  </p><p>PERRY:  You know, I think that the administration through the Department of  Interior sensitive to the issues there.  There is plenty of space out there  whether it's in the gulf, whether it's in Anwar, whether it's other areas  that we can develop the energy resource we have.  You know, the people of  Florida said, hey listen, we don't want to add any new drilling platforms,  the administration respected that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that was OK with the (INAUDIBLE) let me ask you about the  President's news this week and that is these tariffs on solar panels and on  washing machines, there is some conversation happening and as you know  about worries about potential trade wars, about what China will do in  response.  Should we worry about a different trade stance from this  administration?  </p><p>PERRY:  They shouldn't be worrying about this administration from the  standpoint of transparency and fairness.  That's what Donald Trump is all  about.  You want to compete against the United States, bring it but don't  subsidize in a way that it's unfair, don't get into the market and try to  gobble up all the market and then all of a sudden after you choked  everybody else out of market, guess what, prices go up.  This is a  president that says, look, I get it about competition.  But you're going to  compete fairly, and you're going to compete on a level-playing field.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the President said that as it relates to jobs as well and  when you look at the energy story, that's a real job creator.  Can you  characterize what we might see from all of the drilling and the fracturing  that will happen in terms of job creation?  </p><p>PERRY:  Well, it's going to continue on.  I mean, that's obviously for the  states that --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And consistent.  </p><p>PERRY:  And it's not just the jobs right in those states where it's  happening, it's upstream or excuse me, it's downstream from that.  It's the  manufacturing.  We think there is an incredible potential in the  Appalachian region to turn that area into an absolute job-creating giant  with the development of the Marcell or Shell with the other fossil fuels  that are available there.  You can duplicate the footprint of what you see  along in Texas Gulf Coast in that Appalachian region and the jobs that get  created.  I'm promising you the governor of West Virginia and Ohio and  Kentucky and Pennsylvania, they're going to be staying and they're saluting  and saying, Mr. President, let's go, let's go make this happen, let's go  make America great again.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And they're -- and these are high-paying jobs.  </p><p>PERRY:  Indeed.  They are.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How do you like the job?  How do you like the role of energy  secretary?  What's new that you can tell us with this?</p><p>PERRY:  Most interesting job I've ever had.  Best job ever had was governor  of Texas but this one is the most interesting and the coolest job mostly  because of the 17 national labs that are out there involved in everything  from cybersecurity to the next wave of small-moderate reactors to, you  know, just the most fascinating new things that are going to be on the  horizon for America.  Our national labs are involved in. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Secretary, thank you for your leadership.  </p><p>PERRY:  You're welcome.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good to see you.  Secretary Rick Perry.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  General Electric reported earnings that were  below expectations, this morning.  Nicole Petallides on the floor of the  New York Stock Exchange watching the stock trade up -- Nicole.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN HOST:  Hey, good morning, Maria.  We know that  General Electric has been in a turnaround phase.  In the last August,  Flannery came on as the new CEO to turn this thing around.  Today, look at  that, just in the last half hour, you -- a short time ago, we're saying it  was up 2-1/2 percent.  And look now, it's up 5.2 percent.  So, what  happened here?  We did see ultimately, that the company in the latest  quarter, they're really focusing on the overall -- the restructuring plan.   The weakness that they've seen in operating profit and the revenue but  ultimately that they're focusing on the aviation and health care divisions  where they are seeing some strength.  </p><p>There has been talk about this company being beaten down, and don't forget,  it's down about 45 percent in the last 12 months.  Is now the time to  finally get into General Electric?  I know you've had this conversation  with many of your guests, but there's been talk of dividing up the company  in some way.  But that the turnaround and restructuring is underway, but  you are seeing the stock now getting a big jump, Maria.  Now, it's up 5-1/2  percent at 17.78.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Thank you, Nicole.  From Disney to Verizon and  Starbucks, more U.S. companies handing out bonus checks, hiking wages for  their workers after the tax reform overhaul.  Joining me right now, the  host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney to weigh in on that.  Stu, it's  just incredible the number of companies.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Oh, it's a flood.  Look, I  would call it a flood.  Look, in the last 24 hours, we've got Disney, a  thousand bucks to 125,000 employees, Verizon, I think is 2,500 bucks worth  of stock to the employees; J.P. Morgan 10 percent wage increases for a big  swath of their people.  I mean, it's a long list, just in last 24 hours.   It's clear, I think American business was on trial, they got everything  they wanted from the tax cut deal, and now, they are indeed passing it  along to the -- to the customers and also to their employees.  But, you  know, the big pass-through, I think, is still to come.  I think that will  come from the big tech companies of this world, when they repatriate all of  that money.  I think a lot of it goes to shareholders.  And looking for  stock buybacks like Comcast, for example, and I'm looking also for a  dividend increases.  That's the next round in this flood of pass-throughs  and givebacks.  Here it comes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's a great point.  I would also add on to financial  services, Stu, because, you know, the banks really haven't even had the  actual impact of regulation rollback.  You know,  that's to come, so  there's this enormous runway there as well.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, look, it's a flood, that's what I'm saying.  By the way, how  is Davos treating you?  Are being nice to you?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's good.  I mean, you know, everyone's talking about  President Trump.</p><p>VARNEY:  Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming tomorrow, and wondering what he's going to say, so he's  definitely making a splash even before he arrives, Stu.</p><p>VARNEY:  Stick it to them, Mr. President</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see you in 10 min, Stu.</p><p>VARNEY:  You will.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins top of the hour,  right after \"MORNINGS WITH MARIA\".  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Tax reform trickle down, Verizon, Disney,  Starbucks have all announced perks for their employees as a result of the  new tax cuts.  Joining me right now live from the World Economic Forum is  the CEO of Campbell Soup, Denise Morrison.  Denise, great to see you,  thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>DENISE MORRISON, CEO, CAMPBELL SOUP:  Hi, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's your take on the tax package?</p><p>MORRISON:  Well, I think the tax reform will be beneficial for business.   We at Campbell's are going to realize a benefit from the reduced rate being  largely United States company, we bear a rate over 30 percent and we  expected that will come down pretty significantly.  And what we're going to  do with that is invest in our brands and pay down debt because we just made  a very large acquisition.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Let's talk about that acquisition.  How does this  acquisition fill in the whole that you were looking to do?  What -- how  does it give you a scale and tell us about the growth that you're expecting  as a result?</p><p>MORRISON.  Yes.  Well, we've been on a journey to transform Campbell's and  to transition our portfolio.  Soup is a very important category but we now  recognize that in order to deliver on the needs and wants of the next  generation of consumers, we wanted to diversify our portfolio in the  faster-growing spaces, and those spaces are health and well-being and  snacking.  And so, acquisitions were the key accelerator for that strategy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Lance, $50 a share in cash.  A lot of people talked about  this as really helping Snyder's-Lance -- helping the company fill in areas  because people are looking for healthier options, wellness.  Tell us about  it.</p><p>MORRISON:  We believe that this provides a snacking platform, a diversified  snacking platform because we already have Pepperidge Farm, Arnott's, and  Kelsen, so this adds more to the savory snacks in addition to the sweet  snacks.  And then if you start to think about our simple meals as  convenient mini meals, it's right on trend with what the consumer is doing  because, Maria, only 34 percent of consumers eat three square meals a day.   Over 90 percent are snacking five times a day, so this is right on trend. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Interesting.  So, the soup category, is that slowing down?  I  know the last quarter, a lot of people were worried that it showed that  we're seeing a bit of a slowdown.</p><p>MORRISON:  Yes, there are pockets of growth in the soup category, for  example, we introduced a new Well Yes! Product that we co-created with  consumers, and that's targeted for the younger generation, all clean label  soups, so you can read every ingredient on the label, ingredients like  quinoa and kale, right on trend.  We also just closed on the acquisition of  Pacific Foods, which is a soup and broth and plant-based beverage company.   We're very excited about that company, and the growth rate of that brand is  really exciting.  So, we are starting to move into new spaces even within  the soup category.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You've got to change as consumer tastes change and people are  looking for healthier options like the kale and quinoa.</p><p>MORRISON:  It always starts with the consumer.  And if you keep your eye on  the consumer, they will take you where you need to go.  And we spend lots  of times with the consumers, we shop with them, we cook with them, we eat  with them.  Our team is having so much fun, sometimes it's hard to get them  to come back to work.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, growth comes from acquisitions or organic?</p><p>MORRISON:  Growth comes from both.  You need to be innovation -- you have  to have organic innovation and really push the thinking, you have to do  some acquisitions but you also have to --</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks for joining us, everybody, we'l1 see you tomorrow.   Here's Stuart and \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY.\"  Stu?</p><p>VARNEY:  Thanks very much, Maria.  All right.  </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Your top stories right now, 6:00 a.m.  on the east coast, bringing America  First to the world stage, President Trump and his administration in Davos,  the administration cabinet landing here, the president arriving on  Thursday.  To tout the United States economy and lure new big-name  investors.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin already on the ground at the  World Economic Forum.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY:  We couldn't be happier to be here.   It's all about economic growth, opportunities to invest, free and fair  trade and we are looking forward to it.  I think is going to have lots of  good interaction.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Secretary Mnuchin later said that a weaker dollar is good for  the US economy and trade, what sent to dollars sliding this morning.  Plus,  trickle-down tax reform, Disney detailing plans to pass on the savings from  the new law by giving a $1000 cash bonus to 125,000 employees.  Big news  coming after similar announcements from JPMorgan Chase yesterday in Verizon  as well.</p><p> The very latest wins for American workers coming up this morning.  Earnings  the story in business again this morning.  General Electric, Ford, Comcast  all of the names set to report their fourth-quarter numbers today.  GE  expecting earnings of $0.29 a share, we will bring you those numbers as  soon as they hit the tape throughout the morning.</p><p> Markets this morning look like this.  The Nasdaq surged 52 points yesterday  after Netflix shares jumped 10 percent.  S&amp;P 500 closing at an all-time  high.  These markets continue to be on fire.  Dow industrials down just a  fraction yesterday.  But the Nasdaq with a three-quarter of a percent move  in unchartered territory yet again.  </p><p> This morning here is the story.  Futures indicating the markets will open  like this and we are looking at gains once again.  The momentum continues.   Dow industrials up another 55 points right now.  Nasdaq up 10 points this  morning.  </p><p> In Europe the major indices look like this.  Take a look at the trading  this morning with the major indices lower.  FTSE 100 down 1/4 of a percent.   The other managers flat on the session.</p><p> In Asia overnight, markets close mostly higher.  The best performer there  as you can see in China.  Shanghai composite up a third of a percent.   Japan, Nikkei average down three-quarter of 1 percent.</p><p> King James ground early, Lebron celebrating his new spot in the 30,000 club  before actually making history.  The hilarious reaction to the premature  celebration coming up this morning.  Also coming up this morning joining  us, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen is with us.  Energy  Secretary Rick Perry is with us.  The chairman of UBS, largest wealth  manager in the world, Axel Weber will join me.  The CEO of Bank of America,  Brian Moynihan is here.</p><p> Plus, Dow DuPont chairman and CEO, Andrew Liverus will be with us.  We will  get a sense of business today coming up in a jampacked program.  And we  kick it off right now with this top story bringing America First to Davos.  </p><p> Trump headed here to the World Economic Forum tonight.  The president  firing back at  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer last night for offering and then  rescinding a deal to support border wall funding in exchange for legal  protections for illegal immigrants brought to the United States as  children.  </p><p> The president tweeted this last night, crying Chuck Schumer fully  understands especially after is his humiliating defeat that if there is no  wall there is no DACA.  We must have safety and security together with a  strong military for our great people.</p><p> Joining me now in Davos is the Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen  NielSEN. Great to see you.  Thank you for joining us.  Let's talk about  immigration.  Explain the wall.  Tell us why the wall is important for  security, not just a talking point, but actually security.  </p><p> KIRSTJEN NIELSEN, HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY:  I appreciate that.  The  wall itself is a system.  So, when we talk about the world I really mean a  system.  So, it is infrastructure, which is some sort of physical  structure, but also the personnel and technology that go with it.  So, we  have to need all three together to get the security.</p><p> And I think what we see in the United States with examples in Yuma, Arizona  and San Diego in California, when we put up a wall system, we have actually  decreased illegal border crossings by 95 percent.  So, we have evidence it  works.  There are certain places on the border will be need this.  We work  very closely with state and local when we can, we try to find a dual use,  so we are looking at levees for example, so we have the dual use of  security and helping the community not flood.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What is your response to what Senator Schumer said?  Now he is  withdrawing the immigration offer.  I know that I've heard Schumer and  others talk about the need for security, border security in the past and  last night he changed his tune.  </p><p> NIELSEN:  I can't see what he changed his tune, it's a bit confusing to me  as well.  He's voted for the security fence act in the past as have many  Democrats.  It's a bipartisan issue.  It is a clear need in our country, we  have agreed it is one of the four pillars for discussion.  So hopefully we  come back around and move forward in our discussions.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What is a state of security today?  You've got a lot on your  plate from actual border situations to cyber, so can you give us a status  check in terms of American homeland security?</p><p> NIELSEN:  Absolutely.  So, I think what we are seeing is terrorists, nation  states whether across the board are changing their tune.  So, what we need  to do is we need to continue to evolve and make sure that we can meet the  incoming changing threats.</p><p> And that is why I'm here today.  So, we need to do that in partnership,  there is not one entity that has all the resources and capabilities to  address any of these threats alone.  So, we have to look at it from an  international domestic, from a public-private and certainly within the  United States government, a whole of government approach to address these  threats.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What are the threats?  Is it transnational gangs, is it drug  lords, who is coming across the border?  </p><p> NIELSEN:  we do have a large TCO problem, yes.  So transnational criminal  organizations smuggle all things, the smuggle people, drugs, they can  smuggle weapons.  We work very closely with our partners to the south and  within the international community to try to combat that, but we need to do  more within the United States, not only stopping them at the border but  frankly I need the ability to be able to remove them once I do stop them at  the border, and that is part of our discussions right now with Congress.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  How much an issue is homegrown terrorism at this point?  We  have seen that obviously people getting inspired by ISIS.  Where we are  not?  </p><p> NIELSEN:  Terrorist used of the Internet is the first thing that comes to  mind when we talk about that, we do see them inspiring, we do see them  recruiting, we see them financing over the Internet, that is something that  we are working with companies here today in Davos to further that  discussion.  It is a problem, so we need to understand what causes one to  become radicalized.  But if there is a way to take them off that path and  give them perhaps a more constructive way forward.  Sort of different parts  of the process that we are working on.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I thought it was really fascinating that even with the  government shutdown, the US was able to kill 150 ISIS fighters in Syria due  to the airstrikes there.  Extraordinary.</p><p> NIELSEN:  Yes, and we must continue to remove their safe haven.  That is a  very important step.  Secretary Mattis if he were here he would tell you  and thank the troops for what they have done and all of our military, but  what we as homeland security no need to do is make sure that they don't,  they fall apart if you will, if they don't have a safe haven to not come to  the United States.  So, we are working with international partners to  increase that screening Internet sure the terrorists not coming to the  United States.</p><p> We released a report last week, we meet seven terrorists a day trying to  come to our country legally, they are on the terrorist watch list.  It is  an ongoing problem.  Need to make sure we have the tools to defend our  country.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What do you need to do that effectively?  We are having this  debate over funding for the border wall, but also funding in general for  the for the military as the Democrats want what they want in terms of DACA.   Tell us the needs in terms of homeland security.</p><p> NIELSEN:  Some of this as you say is funding.  I think we have been very  clear.  We have a very clear proposal with respect to the wall system, were  that would go and how that would work.  But also need the ability to  promptly remove those that I stop at the border.  This is where I am  confused because this is border security.  If I stop 20 people at the  border but I have to let them into the country, that is not border  security.  So, we need to work with Congress to close the loopholes that  have evolved over time through the courts, so that if someone comes and  they don't have any legal right, they don't have any other claim, for  example such as asylum, I need the ability to be all the remove them at  that point at the border.  Then we don't have an interior problem.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  In other words, you can just send them right back.  </p><p> NIELSEN:  No, ma'am.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Why?</p><p> NIELSEN:  A lot of court cases to be honest, it is just the way that the  courts have evolved you find a very sympathetic case, and unfortunately the  law is made around that case, the exception becomes the rule.  And suddenly  the rule is the exception meaning I can't stop anyone.  So, we've given  these proposals to Congress and I'm very hopeful that we can make the case  that is border security, it is not interior security, it is not integration  enforcement, it is border security right there at the border.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What you want to see from corporate America?  I mean companies  in terms of verifying who was working for that company, are there a lot of  stories of companies that hiding illegals?</p><p> NIELSEN:  I don't know about a lot of stories, but we do unfortunately see  bad actors.  We do seek companies who consistently and persistently violate  our laws.  We will have to work on that.  As you have seen with 7 Eleven  recently, that has been a problem in the past, we noticed them.  And so,  then we had to take enforcement action against the company at the company  level.</p><p> E-verify as you know right now is a voluntary program, it enables you to  assure that who you are hiring has the legal right to work in the United  States.  We encourage all employers to use it.  But if you are purposely  evading our laws we will prosecute.  We do need to enforce our laws.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Even sanctuary cities?  I find it extraordinary that California  can just get away with being a sanctuary city.  In just blowing off the  federal law.</p><p> NIELSEN:  Yes, you know what I find really disturbing about that is I can't  find anyone who would tell me they don't want the criminals out.  So, this  is where I get very confused, what at the heart of this discussion of  sanctuary cities is, I can get a criminal, my folks can go get a criminal  in jail which is a safe area, it is a controlled area.  They can pick that  person up.  They can detain them for federal purposes on the way out to be  deported.  </p><p> If a so-called sanctuary city left that person out into the community, my  officials are then forced to go into the community which puts everyone at  risk, not just my officers but frankly the immigrant community as well.   So, I get very confusing people talk about sanctuary city.  It is a  sanctuary for criminals.  It is not a sanctuary for immigrants.  So really  need to work with cities to make sure that we can understand the safest way  to do this is to remove the criminals in a controlled environment.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Is there accountability?  Should a city not remove those  criminals?</p><p> NIELSEN:  In my opinion, they should work with ICE and let ICE come pick  them out.  By the way we are not asking them to do anything special, just  before you are going to release someone, 48 hours before you do let us  know.  We will come get them.  If we can't get something we can't get them.   But we would like to try, we would like the ability to be able to take them  in a controlled way so that we can then put them into proceeding.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you that your testimony last week before the senate  judiciary committee when New Jersey Democrat Booker really exploded on you  over language that the president may or may not have used in the oval  office on immigration.  Here's the exchange.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN. CORY BOOKER, (D) NEW JERSEY:  The commander-in-chief in an oval office  meeting referring to people from African countries and Haitians with the  most wild and vulgar language.  I had tears of rage when I heard about this  experience in that meeting, you don't remember.  You can't remember the  words of your commander-in-chief.  I find that unacceptable.  Your silence  and amnesia are complicity.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What did you make of Senator Booker's behavior toward you?</p><p> NIELSEN:  To be honest it was a distraction, and it was very frustrating to  me on behalf of the men and women of the Department of Homeland Security,  because I was there to talk about real threats and their needs to do their  job.  That the American people has asked him to do.</p><p> It became 11 minutes of a lecture about a meeting he was not in about one  word and whether or not I heard it.  I said under testimony was that  possible?  Sure.  I just did not hear the word.  There is no story there.   He didn't ask me what I think, he didn't ask me what I think about the  countries, he didn't ask me what I think about immigration policy.  He had  no interest about what the Secretary of Homeland security thinks.  He just  wants to lecture me for 11 minutes.  So, it was unfortunate, it was an  unfortunate waste of all of our time, one recruiter been focused on the  needs and threats.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It felt to me like harassment.  Did you feel harassed?</p><p> NIELSEN:  I felt it was just inappropriate.  That is a workplace  environment, he didn't seem constructive to me, it didn't seem productive.   It wasn't a conversation.  There wasn't any opportunity for me to explain  how I feel which I would think is what he would be interested as the  Secretary of Homeland Security.  And again, he wasn't even in the meeting,  so it was a bit confusing as to why he felt that it was appropriate to tell  me what I heard and didn't hear, when he wasn't even there.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It seems obviously like he wanted a platform, so that he could  do a show, maybe he was to run for president.  How is the new job going?   You handled that very well.  Tell us your observations from this that you  have.</p><p> NIELSEN:  I'm so proud of the men and women of DHS.  They put their lives  on the line everyday.  We have a huge portfolio, we have many threats.  But  it is a great job.  It is the order of a lifetime to be able to support  them and protect the American people.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What should we expect from the president tomorrow?</p><p> NIELSEN:  I think what his message is going to be is America First is not  America alone.  We need a partner.  Not one of us has the ability to do  this alone.  We need to partner with the private sector, we need to partner  with our allies.  We see that in discussions about North Korea, Syria,  Iran.  We have to build coalitions to attack these threats together.  That  is what you will hear a lot about.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Is there is threat from North Korea currently on the ground,  Homeland Security that we should be aware of?</p><p> NIELSEN:  What we worry about of course is with the missile testing and  ongoing nuke program, with that means for us.  Should they be able to  develop the capability to reach the United States?  I want to make sure we  are prepared.  What does that mean for the homeland?  So that is every  thing from alert and warning systems.  We see lately that we need some work  there to connect, but it also means being prepared for the consequences if  any should occur.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Secretary Nielsen, it's good to have you on the program.</p><p> NIELSEN:  My pleasure.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p> We will take a break.  When we come back the weak dollar is good  apparently.  That is the word from Treasury Secretary Mnuchin.  We break  down more of his comments and the impact on markets this morning.  Dollar  is lower.</p><p> And all eyes on General Electric after a huge fall, the company reports  quarterly earnings within the hour after a dismal year.  We will bring you  the numbers as soon as they hit the tape.  Stay with us right here live  from Davos.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Gunfire causing panic at another school to  report.  Cheryl Casone with the details.  </p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FBN HOST:  Good morning to you.  Maria.  A 15-year-old  student opened fire at Marshall County High School killing two fellow  students and injuring 18 others.  Police say the suspect is in custody and  will be charged with two counts of murder, and several counts of attempted  murder.  Officials haven't decided if he'll be tried as an adult.   According to \"The New York Times,\" and this is the 11th school shooting  since January 1st and roughly the 50th of the academic year.  </p><p> The dollar hitting fresh lows this morning after Treasury Secretary Mnuchin  said that he welcomes a weakening dollar because it is good for trade.  The  euro is now hitting a three year high on those comments.  While attending  the World Economic Forum in Davos where you are, Maria, Secretary Mnuchin  also said that America is open for business.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MNUCHIN:  We have a great story to tell, lots of important meetings, all  about economic growth, opportunities to invest in a free and fair trade.   We are looking forward to it.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE:  This is coming after fair protectionism already push the dollar  lower.  Trump is set to leave the United States for Davos tonight.  The  United States Senate voting Tuesday on President Trump's pick for the  federal reserve.  Jerome Powell was confirmed as the next fed chair in a  landslide vote.  Powell signaled during confirmation hearings that he  agrees with the central bank's current policies, including gradual  increases in interest rates.  He will replace Janet Yellen who was the  first woman to leave the fed, Yellen's for your turn parents officially on  February 3.</p><p> And we are going to get earnings from two Dow components this morning.   Investors in General Electric get ready.  They are bracing for possibly  more bad news after the company recently announced a surprise charge from  its insurance business.  Earnings-per-share expect to fall nearly 38  percent from a year ago.  Those are the estimates.  We should say the stock  was a little bit higher a few moments ago.  It has actually scaled-back it  is up .12 percent.</p><p> And then let's look at United Technologies, they reported actually just a  few minutes ago, posted better than expected results.  Sales rising in all  four of the business units there.  United Technologies stock is up 22  percent from just a year ago.  But obviously all eyes this morning, Maria,  on General Electric.  Back to you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Already, it also obviously, Steven Mnuchin's comments, we will  talk more about that coming up in the program, thank you.</p><p> The tax plan giveback continues, Verizon, Disney, JPMorgan and Starbucks  all plan financial perks for employees because of the new tax cuts.  I will  speak with Bank of America chairman and CEO, Brian Moynihan, coming up  about the impact.</p><p> Plus, crypto currency is a big topic of discussion here in Davos, but is  the technology behind it, block chain, the much bigger economic game  changer?  We are getting some answers this morning, back in a moment, right  here live.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SARAH SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Verizon announced today that  all of their employees other than a top management will receive 50 shares  of restricted stock.  This amounts to about $2500 per employee.  Employees  will further share in the company's success, Verizon said in a release.  We  are only one year in and the president is just getting started.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders detailing Verizon's  plan to reward employees as a result of President Trump's tax plan.  Not  the only company with a big announcement yesterday.  Disney announced  employee bonuses and JPMorgan Chase raised wages.  My next guest was among  the first to announce plans to give money back to employees.  Bank of  America, chairman and CEO, Brian Moynihan is with us now.  Brian, great to  see you.</p><p> BRIAN MOYNIHAN, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, BANK OF AMERICA:  Good morning.   Wonderful day.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Really is.  You announced employees getting their $1000 bonus  citing the tax bill.</p><p> MOYNIHAN:  It was a broader package.  When the tax bill came out, we  believed we had to share success with our teammates.  It is one of our core  principles.  So, if you earned under $150,000, we gave them a $1000 bonus  that they got in their paychecks by year end.</p><p> But it was on the backs, we moved to $15 an hour last year at this time as  a starting wage.  It employees will work for a company from 2010 to now, it  is in the bracket that we are talking about, has had an average wage  increase of 5 percent per year.  It is a constant war for talent out there  at all levels of our company.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So how long does this go on?  One of your colleagues in the  business said to me, people are looking at this as if it is an overnight  success.  The truth is going to be a lot longer and sustainable than people  think.  How do you see it?</p><p> MOYNIHAN:  We were on a panel yesterday together.  If you think about it,  the tax reform is a month old.  We all had a one-time adjustments we had to  make in our year end financial statements, so we had some programs.  The  question is what we do.  We are increasing our investment and we told our  investors on our earnings call we consider increasing investments, speeding  up the pace stuff that we are doing, more branches in new cities which have  about 10 employees.</p><p> All of those things.  Like companies around the world, it will take a  little while for people to catch up to because it is brand-new.  And so,  they are adjusting business plans and their spending plans, but your  hearing across the board, incremental aggressiveness, incremental focus on  investing on stuff that has a little longer payback.  With an equal balance  if are going to give investments extra earnings, stock buybacks, dividends,  which is it bad either.</p><p> Because that is going to go back in the economy and the investor gets that  is going to have to put it to work with some company that needs more  capital will take it and put it to work.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, let's talk about more capital.  Generally, the regulations  that you have been faced with for the last 10 years, which are beginning to  get brought back.  The Trump administration has announced a pretty good  rollback in regulations but hasn't even impacted the banks yet.  Isn't that  right?</p><p> MOYNIHAN:  Well, if you think about the regulations for banking, we needed  to get the situation right, we had a ton of regulations.  And the  expectation would be they would swing past the point of the middle.  And if  you think about what we need to do going forward, the people running the  agencies and the regulatory process, those people are now in place,  Chairman Powell was approved yesterday.</p><p> That was important.  The second was to new regulations that were  inconsistent, adding on, piling on, whatever the right word you might use.   Because we had fixed everything frankly.  We are kind of done.  And even  Tarullo we did a good job of bringing the regulation forward, declares it  was kind of over.  But we had to stop the momentum.</p><p> And then the third thing is Mnuchin with Craig Phillips and the team in  treasury, working with the industry, people who like the industry and  people who don't like the industry, came up with a roadmap to appropriately  rebalance the regulation.  As one of the largest underwriters of the FDIC  fund with my other banks, putting in money, we have the highest interest in  the safest and soundest banking industry.  Because anytime a bank fails the  industry puts up the money ultimately, and we put up about a 14 or 15  percent share of that.  So, I have a higher interest than a lot of people  to make sure this is safe and sound industry.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What I was getting out it seems like there is a long runway.   You haven't even felt the impact yet.  A big deal for Bank of America and  the entire industry.  </p><p> MOYNIHAN:  I think it will take time.  And you have to do it right, and has  got to be it has got to be carefully done with the right cost benefit  analysis.  We can't keep changing back and forth.  As we fix Volcker, it's  got to have stick to the ribs to it.  It has to have integrity to it that  does the purpose which was intended to stop proprietary trading.  Remove  some of the difficulty in compliance, the sticks to it, so somebody doesn't  have a better idea in two years, because the system requirements and the  fixes for this.  We spent over $1 billion on a resolution plan.  I don't  want that to have to be redone.  That is really money that just goes to  consultants and teammates and other people and systems, but it really  doesn't do anything for our customers.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You need certainly, I get that, to plan.  Characterize the  consumer, your business has been going very well.  Growth obviously at Bank  of America.  Can you tell us how the consumer looks in terms of lending,  spending right now?</p><p> MOYNIHAN:  Sure.  If you start the broad thing of what happened last year,  from 2015 to 2016, all the spending in the consumers which is about two and  one quarter trillion dollars, Bank of America grew about three percent.   2016 to 2017 that same spending whether it is checks or debit credit cards,  money out of the ATM, groom at six percent.</p><p> So twice the rate across 2.6 trillion last year.  In January off to start  again.  Consumers  have been spending, it is a little more driven at the implement by  experiences as opposed to things.  Doing stuff as opposed to buying stuff.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Going out to dinner, there spending money there.</p><p> MOYNIHAN:  A vacation.  And as wages continue to rise, as wealth continues  to build a market, you going to see that is one of the attributes of that.   That's very constructive.  On a lending side, we are a prime lender, the  credit statistics are very strong.  The availability of credit is very  strong.  </p><p> Small business we've had record success, meaning new loans so that business  has done well, and the next level up we call business banking.  Also doing  well.  So, the activity is high, can I think is you get the regulatory  certainty for those companies, our clients, in the tax benefits that they  will get.  You will see them be more aggressive, so you will see those  people will grow also.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Do you believe that this market the end is trading  appropriately?  It sounds really good the 4 percent growth expectations,  the business of course at your bank the people are worried about  complacency in terms of these markets.  You are a markets guy, what do you  think about this incredible performance?</p><p> MOYNIHAN:  Well, I have this -- I have a lot of experts and we have  (INAUDIBLE) in the research team, one of the best in the business and they  have the S&amp;P, you know, growing for the year.  But to say, the target they  put out because of all the enthusiasm, maybe 3,000 or something, and then  so it's all constructive.  </p><p> But the reality is the best (INAUDIBLE) of Bank of America and that's where  my money is.  But if you really think about it, the mark is reflecting  (INAUDIBLE) earnings for the company and there are some excesses, there  always will be.  But broadly across the board that's what's driving  evaluations and our companies are earning well.  Economies are growing and  the world's economy is growing faster.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, OK.  We will leave it there.  Brian, it's great to see you  this morning.</p><p> MOYNIHAN:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  Brian Moynihan is the  Chairman and CEO of Bank of America.  I want to get this breaking news at  right now, General Electric is missing the expectations this morning on its  earnings, $0.27 cents a share, is what the company's reporting right now  versus an estimate of $0.29 cents a share.  Revenue is expected at $34.06  billion for the quarter for General Electric.  </p><p> We're going to put those numbers on right now on the screen, in terms of  revenue for the fourth quarter.  G.E. shares, as you can see this morning,  are up two-thirds of a percent, the stock is down about 40 percent in the  last year.  </p><p> We'll take a quick break here.  King James, king size ego, that's what some  are saying about NBA LeBron James after he congratulated himself on social  media on joining the 30,000 point club.  Back in a minute, right here, live  from Davos.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> ANNOUNCER:  Here again is Maria Bartiromo with a special edition of  Mornings with Maria, live, from Davos, Switzerland at the World Economic  Forum.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, happy Wednesday, everybody.  Thanks so much for  joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Wednesday, January 24th, your  top stories right now 6:34 on the East Coast, this morning.  Breaking news  right now, General Electric just reported earnings, the earning came in  below expectations at $0.27 a share versus an estimate of $0.29 cents a  share, revenue at $31.04 billion versus an estimate $34.06 billion.  </p><p> Shares of General Electric are trading higher in the pre-market.  Of  course, the stock is down about 40 percent in the last year, the numbers  hitting the tape, not having a big impact.  </p><p> Putting America first, President Trump will leave for Davos, Switzerland  tonight, as he meets with top names in business here in Davos, at the World  Economic Forum.  I spoke with Homeland Security Secretary Christian  Nielsen, earlier this hour about the President's trip.  </p><p> Meanwhile, the dollar is sliding this morning after Treasury Secretary  Steven Mnuchin said a weaker dollar is good for the U.S. economy and for  trade, during a press conference in Davos.  We will have more on his  comments ahead of the President's visit, as it has, moved markets.</p><p> Stocks, meanwhile, check it out, NASDAQ surged yesterday, again, in  uncharted territory at the close, up 52 points yesterday as Netflix shares  were up 10 percent, towering the NASDAQ.  NASDAQ now at 74.60, S&amp;P 500  also, at an all-time high yesterday, at 28.39, the Dow industrials pulled  back just a fraction yesterday.  </p><p> And this morning, we see momentum continuing, Dow industrials expected to  be up better than 60 points this morning, quarter of a percent higher, S&amp;P  500 up four points, and the NASDAQ also higher this morning, up 10 points.</p><p> In Europe, the major indices are also showing gains.  Take a look at the  European indices, oh, we're seeing reversal here, FT 100 down a third of a  percent, 30 points lower, the CAC Quarante in Paris is lower and the DAX  Index is also fractionally weaker on the session.</p><p> In Asia overnight, markets closed mostly higher, fractional moves across  the board.  Breaking news this morning, General Electric releasing its  fourth-quarter results, earnings of $0.27 cents a share, on revenue of  $31.4 billion, joining me right now on telephone, is Former G.E.  Transportation and Power System CEO and the Former CEO of Home Depot and  Chrysler, Bob Nardelli, Bob, good to talk with you, thanks so much for  weighing in this morning.  You work at G.E. for 30 years, and really was  there in the glory days, your reaction to these numbers this morning.</p><p> BOB NARDELLI, FORMER CEO OF G.E. TRANSPORTATION AND POWER SYSTEM (via  telephone):  Well, good morning, Maria.  I think if you think about this  announcement, gone (INAUDIBLE) you know, obviously, we are able to make  some adjustments (INAUDIBLE) $0.27 cents.  The overall consensus was 28,  the estimate was 29.  I think one of the big concerns was the drop in  earnings from the previous estimate.  I think one of the other big concerns  was in November.  </p><p> They talked about a 3 million -- $3 billion-dollar charge.  It ended up  about being about 6.2 for insurance.  So I think the big underlying word  here with G.E. right now is uncertainty.  As John and his team, you know,  try to navigate through some of the issues that they faced.  </p><p> The power system, unfortunately, was down more than they had anticipated  which is the, you know, the largest segment of the (INAUDIBLE) that they've  talked about with aviation, healthcare and then power system.  </p><p> So I think they have got a lot of work to do, to bring back investment  confidence, cash looks like it was a little bit stronger than they  anticipated, that is good news considering they still, you know, they still  have a dividend, half of what it was.  They've got a pension obligation to  take care of, and they're trying to reinvest in the businesses.  </p><p> You know, the tax -- the new tax policy really doesn't help G.E. a lot.   They've done a fabulous job and fact planning over the years, so well have  to see.  I think -- you know, the big wait and watch will be how John and  them team does in the first quarter of this year.  Down significantly from  last year, right, 17 versus --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> NARDELLI:  16 down significantly.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, let me bring in Dagen McDowell in New York.  Dagen,  we've missed you, great to see you this morning.  And of course, you know  there has been an expectation out there that given the weakness and the  fall at G.E. that we could actually be talking about a potential split up  of this company at this point.</p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  Right.  And we will listening for more comments  from the CEO John Flannery on that note because there's been talk, G.E.,  looking at they are looking at exiting that major stake in the oil services  business, Baker Hughes rearranging its board of directors which, I think,  is probably a long time coming at this point, but if you look at the stock  up two percent in pre-market.  </p><p> This has been really the discussion among investors.  At what point is this  a buying opportunity?  This quarter that it reported this morning is a real  morass.  It's a complete mess, maybe even a throwaway, if you will.  The  stock last year lost about half of its value down so far this year.  </p><p> So, again, some investors are willing to step up a little bit and put some  money on G.E. but it remains to be seen what the road ahead looks like for  this company and how much of -- how much of it would really be left quite  frankly?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Bob, what about that, really quick, I know you sold your  position here but the high was, what, 59 and three quarters.  Is 17 and  change a buy here, you think?</p><p> NARDELLI:  Well, you know, we saw the other day fell below 16 which was a  52 (INAUDIBLE) a fifth year low.  I think, you know, it's a wait-and-see  attitude right now, Maria.  I probably would wait and see before I jump in.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, we will leave it there, Bob Nardelli, Dagen  McDowell, thank you so much, with the analysis on General Electric.  We've  got lofty ambitions.  Meanwhile, for a hotel empire, just over two years  ago, Marriott International announced plans to take over Starwood, a deal  worth an estimated $14 billion.  </p><p> The merger created what now is the world's largest hotel company, 6400  properties across the world.  Spread out across its 20 brands, Marriott now  has locations in 126 countries and the deal has paid off.  Marriott shares  are up 70 percent plus, in the past year alone.  Look at that chart.   Joining me right now to talk about those successes is Marriott's President  and CEO, Arne Sorenson, Arne, great to see you.</p><p> ARNE SORENSON, CEO OF MARRIOTT INTERNATIONAL:  Nice to see you, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  Congratulations on that  success.  Wow.  </p><p> SORENSON:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> SORENSON:  We're off to a good start.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What's behind it?</p><p> SORENSON:  Well, the deal is a good deal.  And of course, the market always  worries with big deals that there will be a stumble in the immigration.   And I think there was great relief that we haven't stumbled at least, not  visible yet, and we're off to a good start.  </p><p> But it's a good start, in the sense that it is a multiyear process to take  Starwood and its SPG platform, pull it into Marriott and the Marriott  rewards platform.  Really combine it into one loyalty program.  That will  happen later this year.  But so far, it's gone really well.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  How tough is it to combine two very different cultures, right?   I mean, Starwood and Marriott, I guess, have similarities in some culture  but overall, people look at these two brands as very different.  So have  you had issues in terms of melding these two cultures?</p><p> SORENSON:  Well, of course, there are always issues that you go through but  the culture is actually are more similar than different.  Both very proud  companies that want to perform really well for the long-term and they want  to win in their space.  </p><p> And you bring those two things together and, sort of, feed them.  And we  get a lot of momentum.  Obviously, the stock price performed well last  year.  That's also a great motivating tool for a team of thousands of  people around the world who are invested in the company.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  When do you expect the integration to be complete (INAUDIBLE).</p><p> SORENSON:  I don't think we will be able to say for another couple of  years, how well it's truly gone.  I thought when we did this deal, it'll be  three to five years, sort of, minimum.  I think we will start to see good  performance from our customers' share of wallet, as the year goes along.   So far, it's been great.  There've been no stumble so, you know, we're  really off to a good start.  But it's a -- it's a big job.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I guess you had a lot of questions from, you know, guests and  investors about the rewards program.  They want to know what happens with  their rewards with the merger.</p><p> SORENSON:  Absolutely.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> SORENSON:  If I'm a -- if I'm a long-time SPG member has been, you know, a  hundred nights a year with Starwood and now, suddenly Marriott's involved.   I had deliberately made a choice and have it, loyalty, all of those things,  maybe drove that choice.  </p><p> Now, suddenly, I've got the earth shifting under me.  What's going to  happen?  And so far, that's been good because we've been reassuring.  But  until we get that completed, you won't able to be as definitive.  I think  they'll be pleased with what's coming up.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What can you tell us about the environment right now?  We've  been hearing a lot of optimistic talk about four percent economic growth,  about this tax plan, from your standpoint, what do bookings look like?   What can you tell us?</p><p> SORENSON:  Well, so let me -- let me step back to the Davos stage for just  a second, and the data is still coming in.  The company's doing great,  where organic growth is good.  Red part numbers will report for fourth  quarter in a couple of weeks.  But you look at global travel trends.  We  think about $1.3 billion international trips last year, around the world.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p> SORENSON:  Up about seven percent from the year before.  The U.S. share was  down four percent.  Why?  Well, the U.S. is a less friendly destination  today.  And so, one of the things we're doing here -- why are we less  friendly because we are probably talking about security more than we have  in the past.  Security is a real issue.  </p><p> And until people are comfortable that security is being addressed.  We  would expect there would be some hesitation.  But still, we're here,  basically saying, let's work on security and the international travel.   Let's make sure people understand the power of this industry to create jobs  in the United States and around the world.  And let's compete for it  because business could be even better.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And you -- and you opened dozens more locations in China, in a  joint venture with Alibaba.  They are not traveling as much to the U.S.   Where are they going?</p><p> SORENSON:  They're going everywhere else.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Everywhere else?</p><p> SORENSON:  Everywhere else.  So visitation to the airport was up seven  percent, we think, in 2017.  Now, this is a status a little harder to get  reliably because it's not just our data, its government data and Global  Travel Trends.  But we are seeing growth all around the world.  We're  seeing -- Americans come to Europe too.  </p><p> The dollar is strong, U.K. for example, the pound is quite weak.  It's a  great place to take a vacation these days.  But again, the U.S. is losing  some share and we want to see the U.S. address security and come back to  take that share because I think it'll perform even better.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, we will leave it there.  When you come back, we got  to talk about the room of the future because I know you've made a lot of  changes there.  Arne Sorenson, Marriott, we'll be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  LeBron James joined an elite list of basketball  legends last night.  Jared Max with the story now.  Good morning, Jared.  </p><p> JARED MAX, FBN SPORTS REPORTER:  Hey, good morning, Maria.  LeBron James  has earned himself a seat at the 30,000-point table.  Now in company with  Kareem Abdul Jabbar, Karl Malone, Kobe Bryant, Michael Jordan, Wilt  Chamberlain, and Dirt Novitsky.  The Cavaliers, and the Spurs, and San  Antonio, LeBron needed seven points to get to 30,000.  Bang, he gets it  right here.  The final shot of the first quarter.  Spurs fans congratulated  with the standing ovation.  LeBron, the youngest to score 30,000, almost 15  months younger than Kobe Bryant was.  LeBron turned 33 at the end of the  December.  By the way, the Cavaliers lost the game.  </p><p> Check this out, earlier yesterday, LeBron James posted on Instagram a  congratulatory letter to his younger self.  In it, LeBron wrote: \"I want to  be one of the first to congratulate you on this accomplishment achievement  tonight that you'll reach.  I know it's never been a goal of yours from the  beginning.  Look up to the higher skies and say thank you.  Congrats again,  young king.\"  LeBron got roasted on social media fans who used LeBron's  opening line similar, satirical self-congratulatory notes.  Like this one:  \"Want to be the first to congratulate you on the accomplishment achievement  when you binged 10 episodes of fifth place, have sent you 30,000 on  (INAUDIBLE)\"  </p><p> There's something that Kobe Bryant has, LeBron James is not -- an Oscar  nomination.  Yes, Kobe nominated for \"Best Animated Short Film\" for the  five-minute \"Dear Basketball\" poem -- he wrote when he retired in 2015.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> KOBE BRYANT, BASKETBALL PLAYER, NBA:  You gave a six-year-old boy his Laker  dream.  And we both know, no matter what I do next, I'll always be that  kid, with the rolled-up socks, garbage can in the corner, 00:00:05 seconds  on the clock, ball in my hands.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MAX:  Kobe Bryant said, the short film is about a dream and trying to keep  that dream as an adult. </p><p> Tomorrow, Tiger Woods will play his first PGA tour event this year.  Tiger  took in a practice round yesterday at Torrey Pines.  He's won the Farmers'  Insurance Open seven times.  This is now his latest effort to return from  multiple surgeries on his back.  </p><p> It's a bird, it's a plane, it's Tom Brady -- no, actually, that won't be  part of the Super Bowl pre-game show.  But get this, on Super Bowl Sunday,  masses says an asteroid that they've been following for 14 years will pass  by the Earth at a speed of about 76,000 miles per hour.  But it won't come  closer than 2.6 million miles from Earth.  The last one that came by was at  26,000 miles from Earth.  That was in the fall.  So, Maria, this is 2.6  million miles.  I think we'll be safe from the asteroid on Super Bowl  Sunday.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  What a story.  Thank you, Jared.  Coming up, we have been  watching this roller coaster run of Bitcoin.  Some say that the smart money  is on the potential of the blockchain, not actually Bitcoin.  The  underlying technology for Bitcoin is what we're talking about right here  next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ADENA FRIEDMAN, PRESIDENT AND CEO, NASDAQ:  We want to make sure that if we  choose to enter into the market in terms of (INAUDIBLE) a future in the  market that we: number one, have client demands; and number two, that we  put the right risk management protocols in place to make it so that people  feel confident in what we're providing and how that becomes an investable  product. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That was NASDAQ President and CEO, Adena Friedman, with me  yesterday right here.  We were talking Bitcoin.  The cryptocurrency craze  has taken over in the last few months.  But some see far more potential  from the blockchain.  The underlying technology for Bitcoin that really  works as the digital ledger, if you will.  Joining me right now is Jamie  Smith, a Member of the Global Blockchain Business Council here at Davos.   Jamie, good to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us.  </p><p> JAMIE SMITH, MEMBER OF THE GLOBAL BLOCKCHAIN BUSINESS COUNCIL:  Thanks for  having me.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Glenn Hutchins also explained blockchain and why this ledger  and the trust that is required in terms of, you know, lending money --  taking money back and forth to (INAUDIBLE) is so important?  Give us your  sense of blockchain versus Bitcoin.</p><p> SMITH:  Yes.  So, the way that I understand it for myself and explain it to  other people is I think of it like a train track between you and me.  If I  want to send you an asset, I have to send in on some rails, but there has  to be a car on top of that rail we'd like to attach it to.  The rail is the  blockchain; the car is the digital token; and that token, the most famous  one, is a Bitcoin.  And so, what's fooling everyone's mind is that this  Bitcoin has an actual value.  But what is capturing a lot of the  imagination here in at west is that, while everybody really cares about  moving money, because 99 percent of people are using it for that purpose.   It's just an asset; you could use it for anything.  So, land title,  identity, medical health records, all of these things that we're having  some date integrity issues around the world.  And this technology is much  more secure, so it's fascinating. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  If I wanted to be on those rails, the blockchain, I can use  dollars.  </p><p> SMITH:  Sure.  Of course, you could.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What do we need Bitcoin for?</p><p> SMITH:  Well, I think you have to look at it from a developed world  perspective, and a developing world perspective.  When you look at the  whole -- the world as a whole, you're talking about billions of people are  unbanked.  You're talking about 1.5 billion people who don't even have an  identity.  There are a lot of people who just are left out of the system.   And somewhere in the range of 60 to 70 percent of the world's population is  just living under systems that are really hard to navigate.  They're just  kind of broken, or there's so much friction.  We take for granted -- I can  go get a bank account; it's fine, right?  But most of the people in the  world, if you want to start a business and provide for yourself?  You just  don't have those opportunities and now you do.  And not only that, it's  pretty cheap.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You make a really good point.  Let me ask you, how are you  going to identify which cryptocurrency is actually going to be the winner  here?  Is it Bitcoin?  Is it (INAUDIBLE)?  I mean, there is a bit cash.   So, how do we know?  What metrics are you looking at to identify which is  actually the most effective?  </p><p> SMITH:  Yes.  So, at the moment what's happening is that companies are  actually deciding.  So, there's a company in San Francisco coin base, so  they only allow you to buy four different kinds of cryptocurrencies.  There  are hundreds on the market.  I would like to see a world where governments  get more involved in really betting these things.  The problem we have  right is that regulators literally don't know what this is.  And so, it's  really hard to do smart regulation if you're not smart about what's  happening.  And so, our job is we're going in and we're just teaching them  what they need to know, and then we can get to decisions later.  But at  least, we're trying to educate them on what it actually is.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's what we all need.  Jamie, great to see you.  Thanks so  much for weighing in today.</p><p> SMITH:  Thank you.  It's such an honor to be on.  Thanks.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good to see you.  We'll be right back.  Jamie Smith.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Thanks so  much for joining us.  Welcome back.</p><p> I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Wednesday January 24th.</p><p> Your top stories right now 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p> Bringing America First to the world stage -- President Trump and his  administration headed to Davos to tout the U.S. economy and lure big name  investors to the U.S.</p><p> Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin already making waves here in Davos -- the  dollar is sliding this morning after he said a weaker dollar is good for  the U.S. economy.  He is moving markets with that comment.</p><p> He's not the only cabinet member making headlines.  I spoke with Homeland  Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen earlier about her fiery exchange with  Democratic Senator Cory Booker last week.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> KIRSTJEN NIELSON, U.S. HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY:  It was a distraction  and it was very frustrating to me on behalf of the men and women of the  Department of Homeland Security because I was there to talk about real  threats and their needs to do their job that the American people has asked  them to do.  And it became 11 minutes of a lecture about a meeting he was  not in, about one word and whether or not I heard it.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  She's part of the delegation here from the U.S. to highlight  the booming American economy with President Trump.  </p><p> The President just tweeted this.  Quote, \"Tremendous investment by  companies from all over the world being made in America.  There has never  been anything like it now.  Disney, JPMorgan Chase and many others.   Massive regulation reduction and tax cuts making U.S. a powerhouse again.   Long way to go -- jobs, jobs, jobs.\"</p><p> The President just tweeting out that this morning.</p><p> The wins are rolling in for American workers, that's for sure.  Starbucks  the latest company to pass on the savings from the new tax law on to its  employees.  Its announcement coming on the hills of similar news from  Disney, JPMorgan Chase and Verizon just yesterday alone.  What the coffee  giant is brewing up for its staff, coming up this morning.</p><p> Meanwhile, more records for stock prices.  The Nasdaq yesterday surging 52  points after Netflix shares jumped 10 percent.  It is now once again in  record a territory.  The S&amp;P 500 also at an all-time high this morning  going into today's open.</p><p> Futures indicating another rally at the start of trading this morning.  The  Dow Jones Industrial Average up better than 60 points right now.  The  Nasdaq and the S&amp;P 500 also higher.</p><p> In Europe this morning, different story -- the major indices are pulling  back today.  If you look at all of the majors, the FT 100 down almost a  half a percent.  The CAC 40 and the DAX index, also weaker.</p><p> Comcast just reporting earnings, beating expectations of 49 cents a share  versus an estimate of 47 cents a share.</p><p> And there is a look at the Asian markets and how that closed.  Shanghai  composite was the best performer, up one third of 1 percent.</p><p> Earnings the story on Wall Street -- we're just looking at Comcast revenue  beating expectations at $21.9 billion versus an estimate of $21.8 billion.   Also reporting today, General Electric missed expectations with its numbers  earlier.  Ford and as you see Comcast the very latest to report earnings  which were better than expected.</p><p> By the way, General Electric missed expectations on both earnings and  revenue and the stock however is trading up, One-and-two-thirds percent.   There is clearly investors seeing value in GE this morning despite the  worse than expected numbers after a year that saw that stock fall 40  percent.</p><p> More trouble for Toys R Us to report.  The retailer planning to shutter a  fifth of its stores as it grapples with bankruptcy.  A look at the  company's turnaround plan.  </p><p> Plus why the makers of Huggies planning to slash thousands of jobs, coming  up this morning.</p><p> And the award goes to Wal-Mart.  How the retail giant is celebrating their  fifth-ever female director nominated for an Oscar.  We will tell you about  that coming up on Wal-Mart.</p><p> Also coming up this morning, Energy Secretary Rick Perry will join me here  in Davos.  The chairman of the board of UBS Axel Weber is with me this  morning along with the CEO of Dow Andrew Liveris and EY Mark Weinberger.   Plus the U.S chairman and CEO of KPMG Lynne Doughtie is with us.</p><p> Big couple of hours coming up so don't miss a moment of it.  We have  breaking news right now as I was just reporting.  Comcast reporting its  fourth-quarter earnings better than expected, 49 cents a share on revenue  of $21.9 billion.</p><p> Dagen McDowell in New York -- and Dagen, overall the numbers have been  pretty good in terms of earnings.  What's your sense?</p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  Certainly good in terms of Comcast as well, as  you pointed out -- a double beat.  The share is up more than 1 percent  right here.  And we already know how good business is for Comcast and other  companies like it based on the announcement that it's given thousand-dollar  bonuses to thousands of its employees because of the tax reform law that  was passed by the Trump administration and the Republican Congress.</p><p> So you don't step up and give those kinds of bonuses unless you see very,  very good days ahead.  And certainly the last quarter was quite good for  Comcast.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean you're seeing all these companies pass on the tax  savings, right, to employees -- Dagen.  And it's like 200 companies.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's literally millions of individuals in this country will get  bonuses because -- immediate bonuses because of the tax reform law.  People  are seeing wage increases, $15 minimum wage at say Wells Fargo for example.</p><p> So people are feeling it even before next month.  The tax cuts show up in  their pay checks.  And again, that's more than 90 percent of workers are  going to get a tax cut in their pay checks come next month.</p><p> In terms of Comcast also, I wonder on the conference call if they're going  to be saying anything about the AT&amp;T battle with the Justice Department to  purchase Time Warner.  Because again that -- them just getting in the way  of that acquisition actually would help Comcast which was allowed to buy  NBC Universal.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Absolutely.  Yes, we will be listening for that -- a lot of  consolidation going on.</p><p> Dagen -- thank you.</p><p> We want to talk now about bringing America First to Davos.  President Trump  headed to the World Economy Forum tonight.  He is expected to land tomorrow  here in Davos.</p><p> Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is already on the ground here in  Switzerland.  His comments this morning where he welcomed the weakening  dollar because it's good for trade are sending the dollar this morning to  fresh lows.  Mnuchin also emphasized that America is open for business.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEVEN MNUCHIN, U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY:  We have a great story to tell,  lots of important meetings.  It's really all about economic growth  opportunities to invest, free and fair trade, so we are looking forward to  it.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now to weigh in Hermitage Capital Management  CEO Bill Browder.  Bill -- good to see you, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p> BILL BROWDER, CEO, HERMITAGE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT:  Great to be here.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Were you surprised to see the Treasury Secretary say that a  weaker dollar is good for the U.S. economy?  </p><p> BROWDER:  No.  And anybody who's in the investment business knows that  that's -- if there is -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You're not supposed to say it if you're treasury secretary.</p><p> BROWDER:  No.  You can absolutely say it.  And in fact, there's no -- I  mean if you want to sell more goods, make them cheaper for people outside  the country to buy them, and that's what a weaker dollar is all about.   It's sort of a no-brainer.</p><p> In fact, when a country is in real deep trouble they do a major  devaluation.  And that's what gets them out of the trouble.  And so it's a  good thing for the U.S.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Bill -- I want to turn to the Russia probe.  We've got new  developments this morning that I want to talk to you about.</p><p> There are new text messages and allegedly they reveal controversial FBI  agent Peter Strzok was hesitant about joining special counsel Robert  Mueller's investigation.  Because of his quote, \"gut sense\" that there  would be no big there, there; in other words, no collusion between Donald  Trump and the Russians.</p><p> We're also learning in text messages between Strzok and FBI lawyer Lisa  Page, they are a couple.  The two talk about a quote, \"secret society\" that  would be working against the President after he got elected.  That is  according to two Republican lawmakers.</p><p> Here's what one of them, Senator Ron Johnson, had to say about this  developments.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SENATOR RON JOHNSON (R), WISCONSIN:  What this is all about is further  evidence of corruption, more than bias, but corruption at the highest  levels of the FBI.  And that secret society, we have an informant who's  talking about a group that were holding secret meetings offsite.</p><p> There is so much smoke here, there's so much suspicion.</p><p> BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS CHIEF POLITICAL ANCHOR:  Let's stop there.  A secret  society -- secret meetings off site of the Justice Department -- </p><p> JOHNSON:  Correct.  </p><p> BAIER:  And you have an informant saying that.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Yes.</p><p> BAIER:  Is there anything more about that?</p><p> JOHNSON:  No, we have to dig into it.  That's -- this is not a distraction  -- again this is biased, potentially corruption at the highest levels of  the FBI.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So basically when they were talking, Bill Browder, about the  election, Peter Strzok and his girlfriend Lisa Page, they said look if he  wins we have to have an insurance policy.</p><p> And now this latest text reveals that when he did win they said oh, let's  get the secret society in place.  So basically, I guess, to create  investigation after investigation between Trump and the Russians which so  far no evidence exist whatsoever.  Your take?</p><p> I know that -- I asked you about this because you've got an indirect sort  of relation to this Russia probe because of the Magnitsky Law.</p><p> BROWDER:  Well, I don't know who is saying what to whom from the FBI and it  would be dumb for my place to comment on it.  But what I can say is that  the Russians absolutely had an agenda.  The agenda was to get rid of the  Magnitsky Act which was a piece of legislation that I helped put in place  which put sanctions on Putin and his regime.</p><p> And they went to Donald Trump, Jr. and Jared Kushner and others to try to  make that happen.  Now, whether anything happened in that meeting in  response, we don't know.  And eventually the truth will come out about that  one way or another. </p><p> And I'm not going to pre-judge a Justice Department investigation.  I  believe Robert Mueller is an honest investigator and he's got a lot of good  people, patriots, working for him.  And either we'll prove there was no  collusion or they'll prove there's collusion.  </p><p> We can all be armchair investigators making -- trying to make sense of one  or two sound bites.  But, you know, these people have -- there's 20 people,  20 U.S. attorneys on the staff, 200 FBI agents and a bunch of other people.   Eventually the truth will come out one way or the other.  And then we can  put it either to rest or we can put it to a problem.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Tell me about Mr. Magnitsky and why you helped create that law.   I'm not sure that the public understands what you've been through.</p><p> BROWDER:  Yes.  So I worked with Sergei Magnitsky who's my lawyer in  Russia.  He uncovered a massive Putin government corruption scheme that  were Putin and his cronies stole $230 million of taxes that my firm had  paid to the Russian government -- from the Russian government.</p><p> Sergei exposed that in retaliation.  He was arrested, put in pre-trial  detention, tortured for 358 days and killed at the age of 37, eight years  ago, November 16, 2009.  I made it my mission since then to get justice for  Sergei Magnitsky which has resulted in the Magnitsky Act which imposes  sanctions on the Putin regime and there are now four other countries above  and beyond America -- Canada, the U.K., Lithuania and Estonia that have  Magnitsky Acts.</p><p> I'm working all over the world to get a similar legislation.  And Putin is  absolutely apoplectic because Putin is one of the richest men in the world.   He's got money everywhere.  He is afraid that his money will be frozen. </p><p> He's personally angry at me for this.  I've been threatened with death,  kidnapping, arrests, extradition.  It's a major, major problem for Vladimir  Putin.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You walk around with security?  </p><p> BROWDER:  I don't go around announcing on Fox News what I do to secure  myself but -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Ok.  Got you, got you.  </p><p> Let me ask you this in terms of what you went through.  This is not a new  story that Russia tries to undermine the U.S. and the rest of the world.   They try to do it in the European elections, by the way, as well.</p><p> BROWDER:  Absolutely.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I remember years ago when I traveled to Moscow and I also  traveled to St. Petersburg to the St. Petersburg International Conference,  I was told don't bring your Blackberry.  As soon as you enter -- and this  was 10 years ago -- </p><p> BROWDER:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  As soon as you enter Russian airspace, the Russians will hack  you and they will have access to your rolodex and your calendar and et  cetera.</p><p> So the Russians have been undermining the world for how long?  </p><p> BROWDER:  They've been doing it for 50 years.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  There is nothing new about Donald Trump.</p><p> BROWDER:  There's nothing new about this.  When they did it France, they do  it everywhere.  I mean so -- and it's not partisan.  I think America needs  to put aside all this partisan discussion about Russia.  It's not -- if you  support Trump then you can't believe in Russian interference.  </p><p>Russia was interfering everywhere.  And it's a nonpartisan thing.  If they  could've interfered with -- if they could have talked to the Clinton  campaign, they would have talked to the Clinton campaign. </p><p> It's about Putin trying to create chaos.  So he can't bring Russia up to  the level of the United States and Western Europe and so he wants to bring  us down to his level by creating chaos, by creating dissent, by having us  all fight with each other over this stuff.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Somebody tried to run against him.  And the election was what - - what happened.  He said no, you can't run.</p><p> BROWDER:  Well, so Boris Nemtsov -- Boris Nemtsov, a Russian opposition  person was killed right in front of the Kremlin.  And it turned out that  all 60 security cameras were turned off at the moment he was killed.  What  does that tell you?</p><p> Alexei Navalny, one of the most popular opposition politicians in Russia  has been charged criminally.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So what is the world to do?  I mean what do you want to tell  these world leaders here in Davos about Russia and partnering with Russia.</p><p> BROWDER:  What I tell them is that Putin is out to create chaos and destroy  democracy and freedoms in the world.  And we have to contain him and  surround him.  He is a man who wishes us nothing but ill.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.  Bill -- great to see you.   Thanks so much for weighing in.</p><p> BROWDER:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Very important story.  Bill Browder, joining us there.</p><p> Coming up -- trouble for Toys R Us, how the retailer is trying to reinvent  itself this morning amid more store closings.</p><p> Then Wal-Mart goes to tinseltown again.  Details on the company's new ads  set to debut at the Oscars and the famous female director is in charge of  them.</p><p> Back in a moment, right here.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p> Another major company passing on some of the savings from the tax law to  its workers.  </p><p> Cheryl Casone is in New York with the details -- Cheryl.</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  Here we go.</p><p> Starbucks, Maria, boosting pay and expanding benefits for its 150,000  employees here in the United States.  They also announced a stock grant  along with the new policies for expanded parental leave and sick time.   Shares of Starbucks up 5 percent from just a year ago.</p><p> Well, a different story over at Toys R Us.  They are still trying to emerge  from bankruptcy but they are planning to close 182 stores in the United  States.  The company says most of those have failed to meet performance  goals.</p><p> Toys R Us filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in September.  They  had been hurt by competitors including Wal-Mart and obviously Amazon.  The  company also had to contend with heavy debt stemming from a leveraged  buyout that happened back in 2005.</p><p> Well, Kimberly-Clark is slashing at least 5,000 jobs, that's 12 percent of  their workforce.  The maker of Huggies and Kleenex says it plans to close  or sell about 10 manufacturing plants.  Declining birth rates have been  affecting diaper sales and a retail price war is also weighing in on the  company's profits, again the online component.  Shares of Kimberly-Clark go  down more than 5 percent from just six months ago.  There's a lot of  pressure on the stock.</p><p> And then finally, Maria, you're going to love the irony of this story.   Amazon Go -- I showed this to you a couple of days ago.  Amazon's brand new  first ever cashier-less grocery story.  You walk in, you got your phone.   You pick up your stuff, you walk out.</p><p> Hopefully it was to reduce wait times.  Get this, customers had to wait a  long time for their first Amazon grocery shopping experience.  Despite  being able to walk in, grab groceries, walk out -- that is the whole plan.   But traffic was too much and they were overrun.  There's huge lines at the  Amazon Go store.</p><p> People on Twitter, you know, making fun of Amazon for this.  Amazon shares  are up in premarket trading.  It's not affecting the stocks, Maria, and  it's certainly probably not going to affect Amazon but, you know, kind of  missed the point on this one -- Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It's just not what they do, right.  I mean that's -- I  can understand. </p><p> CASONE:  It's a great concept.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Dagen -- what's your take.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I'm waiting for, in terms of the real world shopping experience  of Amazon to clean up the rotten, wilting lettuce at the Whole Foods down  on 7th Avenue.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Oh, my goodness.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Again -- and I can't wait for the people who get mischarged or  over charged when they to and shop in these Amazon Go stores.  Talk about  spending time, cleaning up your credit card receipts.  You know that's  going to happen.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, we'll see.  I mean, you know, I am interested in seeing  how this whole consolidation and integration goes with Whole Foods.  You've  been making a lot of good points about what you are seeing at that specific  Whole Foods.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  The stores -- they've become cafeterias for people who eat  copious amounts of edamame.  So I don't really know how they are going to  really -- it will be interesting to see how that combination progresses.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll take a short break.</p><p> When we come back, cyber security concerns to artificial technology.   Microsoft president Brad Smith will weigh in on the top technology issues  of 2018, coming up next.</p><p> Then a magical trip for Muggles -- details on the new Harry Potter cruise  that will cost you $36,000.</p><p> Right here, live from Davos.  Stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p> We are coming to you live this week from Davos, Switzerland where leaders  from across the globe are gathering for the World Economic Forum.</p><p> Today, Microsoft is highlighting their top technology issues of 2018, a  list dominated by many of the same problems plaguing government and  businesses alike.</p><p> Joining me right now this morning in a First on Fox interview is Microsoft  president and CLO, chief legal officer, Brad Smith.  Brad -- great to see  you.</p><p> BRAD SMITH, PRESIDENT AND CLO, MICROSOFT:  Nice to be here.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p> So you point to cyber security as the top issue facing technology this  year.</p><p> SMITH:  I think every time we talk to customers especially in the world of  business, it is so often the number one concern.  I think it's a huge  imperative for our entire industry.  But it's a shared responsibility with  customers and we also need governments to do more.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What do we need to do?  I mean we are looking at hacking across  the board in companies; not to mention efforts in government as well.  How  could we protect ourselves?</p><p> SMITH:  So I think the first imperative whether you are a consumer or  you're a business is, you know, keep your machines up-to-date.  Apply  patches.  Make sure you are applying common sense.  If you see an e-mail  that comes in from somebody you don't know that asked you to click a link  and provide your password, don't do that.</p><p> It then gets a lot more sophisticated from there.  We're seeing governments  pour more money into nation state attacks.  This is where I think we need  governments themselves to engage in addressing this at a new level.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What should governments do?</p><p> SMITH:  Well, specifically we think that we need rules of the road.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's a good point.</p><p> SMITH:  We need governments to come together and, you know, it needs to be  off limits, especially to be attacking civilians, to be attacking  hospitals, to be attacking the electrical grid.  If we can't get  governments to do that, it's a very difficult task for the tech sector to  make up for the difference.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Let me move on to your second issue in terms of top  issues and that is immigration specifically the travel ban and the fight  over DACA, the dreamers.</p><p> I spoke with Princeton president Christopher Eisgruber about a letter that  he wrote to President Trump with you in defense of the Dreamers.  Here's  what he said.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CHRISTOPHER EISGRUBER, PRESIDENT, PRINCETON UNIVERSITY:  Well, what Brad  Smith, the president of Microsoft and I said was that we know from our  personal experience with these students on the Princeton campus and as  employees of Microsoft, these are people who have had spent all of their  lives in America, who are law-abiding, talented and hardworking.  It makes  a difference to our future as a country and at Princeton and Microsoft that  we'd be bale to keep these people at Princeton as they had been promised.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I think most people would agree with that.  They've only lived  here.</p><p> SMITH:  Right.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right -- for the most part.</p><p> Tell us how it affects technology?</p><p> SMITH:  Well, the life blood of technology is people.  It's our employees.   And it really required that we have the best and most talented people in  the world.  In the United States that means a great mix of people born in  the United States and people who have come from elsewhere.</p><p> We had 45 employees at Microsoft who are dreamers.  We have many more  employees who've come here lawfully from other countries, many of them are  waiting for green cards.  They're worried about whether they're going to be  able to continue to work under their visa.</p><p> It is a cloud that is hanging over the future of the tech sector and the  competitiveness of the U.S. tech sector.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And the other side, you know, pushing for what they want is to  say look, yes, we want the dreamers to stay here and have a path to  citizenship.  But at the same time we don't want it to happen at the  expense of American citizens.  What do you say to that?</p><p> SMITH:  I agree.  We want a world where we create better opportunities for  people in the United States, in every corner of the United States.  That's  why we're working to bring broadband to rural counties, for example. </p><p> But we need the kind of very talented people who help create jobs here.   They start companies here.  It is not a zero sum game it if it is done well  and it is doing it well that we have to come together as a country to do.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's interesting because when you look at where  unemployment is right now, you're talking about almost full employment,  right.  Four percent unemployment is extraordinary, very strong.</p><p> But from a technology standpoint and corporate America standpoint, people  feel like we can't find workers to take the jobs that are actually  available.</p><p> SMITH:  It is a huge challenge.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So we need immigration.  </p><p> SMITH:  We need to do better for our own people and we need immigration.   That is the only way we're going to fill the jobs in the United States.   Otherwise, the jobs will get filled somewhere else.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p> No, I understand what you're saying.  So what are you doing about that?</p><p> SMITH:  Well, what we're doing is investing every day in better digital  skills for American students.  We have a program that is in 349 high  schools in 29 states across the country.  At the same time we are engaged  every day with the administration hoping to find the key that unlocks this  immigration stalemate.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You're doing a great job.</p><p> The other issues on the list of the need for technology in rural  communities, certainly university in the technology industry -- the battle  over privacy, and surveillance.  Tell me about privacy and surveillance  because this is an issue that corporate America is spending hundreds of  millions of dollars on in terms of privacy and surveillance. </p><p> How do you see it?</p><p> SMITH:  Well, two things need to come together -- our customers need to  have confidence that their records will be protected -- individuals,  consumers need that confidence.  And at the same time, we do have real  surveillance questions we've continued to work through -- really still in  the wake of Edward Snowden.</p><p> We have a case that will be argued before the Supreme Court on February  27th.  The Department of Justice is asserting that it can use its  subpoenas, it's warrants, to go get e-mails in any data center anywhere in  the world.</p><p> Other countries are saying no.  We need international processes.  We don't  want a world where every government seeks to reach in to every day, the  center -- everywhere else.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It's a good point -- Brad.  All right.  I want to ask you  about artificial intelligence.  But first let me ask you about Microsoft.   Congratulations, fantastic performance.  The stop once again hitting  another all-time high just the other day.  What is behind this growth?</p><p> I know you're putting earnings in the next week so you're not going to talk  specifics here.  But what's driving this growth.  How did you and Satya  Nadella manage to turn this ship around in terms of growth?</p><p> SMITH:  Well, I think first of all we are living at a time when software is  changing every part of the economy.  Every business in every sector is  realizing that its own path to growth probably involves what we call  digital transformation.</p><p> We've made it our mission to help them use technology to unlock that  growth.  Part of it is the cloud.  Part of it is artificial intelligence.   If they succeed we succeed.  It's actually a pretty simple formula.</p><p> BARTIROMO: Is the growth at Microsoft in the next five years also come from  the Cloud.</p><p> SMITH:  I think it comes from the Cloud, it comes from artificial  intelligence.  It comes from what's called augmented reality, mixed reality  so to speak.  And at the end of the day it comes from our employees.  And  the cultural change that Satya I think has really led for all of us.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Tell me about artificial intelligence and its role in this  growth story and in society?</p><p> SMITH:  Well fundamentally Artificial Intelligence is about making machines  more powerful, the ability to see, to recognize what they see, the ability  to understand speech, the ability to learn and what it really means is when  you combine Artificial Intelligence with you know, sort of growing human  capacity, you start to find new ways to get more done, to find break- through solutions to some important problems, tool drive efficiencies and  productivity in business.</p><p> I think we are entering and AI era around the world.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  No doubt about it but I mean robotics and machines, are they  taking over jobs?</p><p> How work (ph) - here we are having a discussion about Immigration we need  more jobs and yet some of these jobs are going away because of Machine  Learning.</p><p> SMITH:  I think we can say that three things will be true.</p><p> AI will eliminate some jobs.  AI will create lots of new jobs.  And AI will  change probably all of our jobs.</p><p> What it really means is it doesn't matter whether you work at a big company  or in a one-person business, we are all going to keep learning, we need to  learn new skills, we need to focus our educational institutions and our  whole economy and sort of the reskilling that is going to be required --  happily not in the next month, we have time but in the coming decade and  decades.</p><p> This is going to be part of our lives.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Really amazing stuff here, Brad.</p><p> Great to talk with you.</p><p> SMITH:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.</p><p> Brad Smith, Microsoft.</p><p> We'll be right back, stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Here again is Maria Bartiromo with a Special Edition of  MORNINGS WITH MARIA live from Davos, Switzerland at the World Economic  Forum.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p> Good Wednesday morning everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm  Maria Bartiromo and it is Wednesday, January 24th; your top stories right  now, 7:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p> The White House descending on Davos, President Trump set to leave (ph) D.C.  for (ph) the World Economic Forum, tonight.  The trip comes as the White  House makes good on the commander-in-chief's promise to put \"America  First.\"</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GARY COHN, PRESIDENT, GOLDMAN SACHS &amp; DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC  COUNCIL AND CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISOR TO PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP:  - President  Trump's tax reform and tax cuts.  Over 100 companies have announced  policies that will create jobs, benefit our workers, and grow our economy.</p><p> At the World Economic Forum, we will reiterate America's commitment to  domestic and global economic growth and prosperity; strengthen close ties  with other world leaders; and catalyze international business support.</p><p> President Trump will reiterate that a prosperous America benefits the  world.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin is already on the ground and  boy is he making news.  The dollar is sliding this morning after he called  a weaker dollar, 'good for the US economy and trade,' during a press  conference here in Davos.</p><p> The comments come as America keeps winning.</p><p> Starbucks the latest company to pass on the savings from the new tax law to  its employees, the announcement coming on the heels of similar news from  Disney, JPMorgan Chase, and Verizon, all happening yesterday.</p><p> The President just tweeted this, on the moves, \"Tremendous investment by  companies from all over the world being made in America.  There has never  been anything like it.  Now Disney, JPMorgan Chase and many others.   Massive regulation reduction and tax cuts are making us a powerhouse once  again.

There has never been anything like it.  Now Disney,  JPMorgan Chase and many others.  Massive Regulation Reduction and Tax Cuts  are making us a powerhouse again.  Long way to go.  Jobs.  Jobs. Jobs. (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> Meanwhile markets this morning are looking higher.  Take a look, we've got  another rally underway for stock prices, the Dow Industrials set to open up  about 100 points today, a third of a percent higher; the S&amp;P 500 also  higher adding on to yesterday's record-setting performance; and the NASDAQ  also add another all-time high, up now another 12 points this morning.</p><p> Investors are watching earnings from the likes of General Electric and  Comcast, hitting the tape earlier this morning.</p><p> Now GE missed expectations on both earnings and revenue but look at the  stock, up two percent this morning; investors are clearly seeing value  after this 40 percent selloff in GE over the last year.</p><p> Comcast was better than expected, that stock is lower.</p><p> In Europe this morning the major indices are lower across-the-board.  Take  a look at Europe and stock prices today where the FT 100 is down one half  of a percent; the CAC krone is down a fraction; and the DAX Index is lower  as well, really break-even on the DAX.</p><p> In Asia overnight, markets closed mostly higher with the exception of Japan  which was down three-quarters of one percent.</p><p> A big shape - shakeup at UBS' $2.3 trillion Wealth Management Division.   Earlier I sat down with UBS Chairman, Axel Weber, here's what he had to say  about the Wealth Management business which is driving the business at UBS.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> AXEL WEBER, CHAIRMAN, UBS &amp; CHAIR OF THE GOVERNANCE AND NOMINATING  COMMITTEE:  The quarter has been good for us and of course you know, in  addition to the frontloaded (ph) impact of the US tax reforms which  produced a write-down of our DTAs the business has been growing steadily.</p><p> We've had record values of net new money in the Bank, our Wealth Management  business is doing fine.  We've gone through the transformation of the  Wealth Management business over a number of years now and we're very strong  in Americas, in the business, we are very strong globally and that's why  (ph) we decided we would start integrating back offices for example and we  will move to a co-head structure of our Global Wealth Management business.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let's talk about tax reform, you mentioned it a moment ago, the  law taking place now, this year, what kind of an impact have you seen?</p><p> WEBER:  Well so we're expecting a good half percent impact on US growth  this year and next year and beyond that I think we are waiting for what the  US will announce on Infrastructure investments and that's going to be a key  driver I guess of this year potentially.</p><p> But in general; what you're seeing is the mood in the market is very, very,  good; you're seeing the global income improve, output gaps closing.  </p><p> The big thing that people don't really have on their radar screen is  inflation is starting to tick up.  </p><p> I mean oil has normalized so what used to be a tail-wind for inflation  figures that produced lower inflation was the downturn in the oil price but  now with oil above 70, inflation data are going to come in stronger, wage  growth is going to be stronger in Europe, and wage price dynamics are going  to start impacting on inflation.</p><p> So, I think central banks might be - not because they are behind of the  curve but simply by better data coming in and if that data depending (ph)  might be driven to speeding up somewhat the degree to which they retreat  from market.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But that's the point, I mean we're talking now about inflation.   We probably will be talking about inflation, wage gains, in the coming  year, is that going to be the trigger that actually surprises investors,  there's a lot of optimism out there, are people too optimistic?</p><p> WEBER:  Yes.  If you look at for example, volatility is at an all-time low,  complacency and risk-taking is very high in the market and we've been  advising our clients to actually 'cover their bets' because I think with  volatility so low and risk insurance being available relatively  inexpensive, doesn't mean that you don't need insurance, it means you  should buy insurance at a reasonable price.</p><p> And we've been doing that ourselves.  We've been recommending it to  clients.</p><p> And I think there are some headwinds that we're going to see this year,  despite all the tailwinds, the economy, the global economy still has,  geopolitical risks clearly still out there.</p><p> The whole discussion here started by Canada and Mexico and now the  president will come here, about NAFTA and what the international trade  agreements are.</p><p> In a world where global exchange of goods and services has been a key  driver of growth, undoing some of that or scaling it back will mean that we  - it will impact negatively on growth.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Are you seeing people want to shift their money toward the US  because of the tax package -</p><p> WEBER:  Well we're for example -</p><p> BARTIROMO:  - international (ph)?</p><p> WEBER:  - Yes.  So, we're long US Equity and we're long Global Equity  still.</p><p> We think this is not the time to disengage in equity markets.</p><p> And since the US profitability and corporating to have a long position on  US Equity and I think that's the right place to be.</p><p> So yes, globally, there is a strong perception that the US will benefit  over the next two years, over proportionately from this reorientation of  policy, away from Monetary Policy only, to a more balanced mix between  Fiscal, Monetary, and some Structural policies down the road.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about regulation because the roll-back in  regulation has been much talked about in the United States and now we have  new people who are running these agencies but actually the roll-back has  not hit the banks yet.</p><p> What kind of a runway are you expecting for the entire industry given this  roll back in regulations which is quite significant?</p><p> WEBER:  It's significant and it will not just be limited to the United  States.</p><p> There is a long debate now on whether some of the Dodd-Frank rules, some of  the Volcker Rule implementation, some of the Net Stable Funding Ratio  arrangements that banks will have to cater for, a fundamental review of the  trading book, whether all of that will get embedded into national  legislation.</p><p> Now the focus is, will that global regulatory framework get implemented in  national legislation and that's no longer the Bar Committee, that's - in  the US, that's politics, that's where basically Capitol Hill will have a  big role to play and the president will have a role.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And so that will take a longer time than people expect then, is  what you're saying?</p><p> WEBER:  It should take a - take a longer time -</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> WEBER:  - and therefore the need for additional capital raising for  maintaining large capital buffers to you know, to digest some of these  developments, is clearly not going to be at much of the forefront of what  the guidance for financial institutions will be.</p><p> We've already seen US banks give guidance that their capital ratios, medium  to long-term are not their current ratios because some of that had been  trying to raise capital for potential developments.</p><p> And we've just recently did that on Monday as well, we said, 'look, our  capital ratio medium to long-term will be around 13 percent,' and because  we have more clarity now, we can't really take it too far because national  implementation of these Basel rules is going to be a key factor on what  actual capital requirements will be like but we expect clarity over the  next year on that.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Interesting that the IMF recently raised forecast for growth  for this year and next year across the globe, except for the UK.</p><p> Interesting that the UK has now become the underperformer of Europe?</p><p> WEBER:  And you know, with Brexit looming it's pretty clear, it's a  countdown happening and we know it will be an event; Brexit will not be a  non-event.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  There are actually some surprises on the upside in Europe as  well, for example France?</p><p> WEBER:  Yes.  Absolutely and I think the two things that surprised me most  this year is, how long it actually takes the former government in Germany  and how that has been inhabitating and you know, has really not made it  possible for Merkel to give strong commitment on the road ahead, whereby  Macron, a newly elected president is now giving long-term visions to  Europe.</p><p> And if you look a year ago, the balance of power between Germany and  France, in the perception of who drives the European agenda, has been the  other way around.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about UBS, what do you want to see in terms of  changes, where does the growth come from at UBS in the coming three years?</p><p> WEBER:  So, we've been very clear that given our business model and focus  on wealth management and the regions in which we our present, our business  will grow twice global GDP.</p><p> So other than retail banks who basically move along with the economy, we  have a chance of growing much more than the global economy and that would  mean if you have the global economy priced currently at about four percent,  3.9 percent growth, that could mean our business growth - out grows that by  a wide margin.</p><p> And that means that our business in particular in Asia-Pacific will  continue to be the driver of profitability, and our US business given the  much better performance of the US economy will be a driver of  profitability.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Does it surprise you though that we're talking of four percent  growth, we're talking about all of this optimism and yet capital markets  business continue to be just OK.  I mean when you look at you know, Fixed  Income Trading, I mean trading really under pressure?</p><p> WEBER:  It's point that I'd said before about -</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Low volatility (ph).</p><p> WEBER:  - volatility -</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> WEBER:  - if the market really doesn't see any great risk and isn't pricing  risks, that complacency leads to many not buying insurance about risk.</p><p> There are people that are selling volatility, long and I think that's a  very dangerous strategy because volatility usually whilst it is low at this  point in time, any repricing of the current expected consensus will lead to  massive changes in market prices because everyone's pretty much focused on  the same strategy.</p><p> And as soon as that consensus gets disturbed people will trade out of the  events and market prices will move massively.</p><p> And so, volatility when it comes back, it will come back with a vengeance.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  My thanks to Axel Weber.</p><p> We'll be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p> A very frightening bus ride, to school for dozens of students in  Massachusetts.</p><p> Cheryl Casone with the story now in New York, Cheryl?</p><p> CASONE:  It's a crazy video Maria, we're going to show it to you.</p><p> Twenty-nine students were on board this school bus.  The bus was trying to  drive up and icy hill, lost traction.</p><p> Look at it sliding backwards?</p><p> And it's about to knock out - Yes, there goes the mailbox and it keeps  going.  </p><p> And then, next up, hits the (ph) car.</p><p> This school bus was filled with kids, now luckily nobody was hurt and get  this, and afterwards the bus continued on its way to school.</p><p> Now we have that video to watch, and probably the kids do too.</p><p> Well ahead of Ben Shapiro's speech on the University of Connecticut's  Campus today, the College is offering counseling to students personally  offended by Shapiro's conservative views.</p><p> UConn also banned the public from attending Shapiro's speech, only  students, faculty, and special invitees, are going to be allowed to attend;  security is going to be heightened on campus, there are fears that  political disagreements could turn into violent protests.</p><p> Well Walmart is returning to the Academy Awards.

Thank -</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> DOUGHTIE:  - you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And you, a woman, running this major corporation,  congratulations to you.</p><p> DOUGHTIE:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What do you make of this all-female line up?</p><p> DOUGHTIE:  Well, I think they are the most qualified individuals to be part  of the co-chairs this year so I think it's tremendous, I think it's great  that we show that women are in the forefront kind of setting the stage for  Davos.</p><p> But as you know, we still - when we look at the delegate representation,  you know, we're still hoping at - around 20 percent so we need to improve  that.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, the delegates, meaning companies, right, I mean you've got  to get kind (ph) - it's companies who decide who comes to Davos?</p><p> DOUGHTIE:  That's right and one of the things that we said at KPMG this  year, now leading into Davos was to do a social media campaign around women  voices knowing that you know, the representation is probably not where we  want it to be, let's get women from across the globe to add their voice to  Davos.</p><p> And so far, we've had about a half a million voices in this social media  campaign so it raises attention and I think you know, companies need to  really focus on how we're getting more women into the C-Suite.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  For sure.  And how do you do it?  </p><p> I mean the World Economic Forum published a report in November, exploring  the gender parity.</p><p> In 144 countries, this is what they found, the overall global gender gap  can be close in exactly 100 years; the most prominent gender gaps are  economic- and health-based.</p><p> So, what do you think it's going to take, why is it so hard for women to  get to the CEO suite, for example?</p><p> DOUGHTIE:  Well I think the one great thing about this is, this is a  conversation that's happening everywhere -</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> DOUGHTIE:  - so there is massive attention to it and you know, I'll brag  about my own profession where you know, of the Big Four, we now, with the  change at EY in the US, we have three women of the Big Four, leading those  firms so I think that's tremendous progress.</p><p> But to your point you know, how do you make a difference?</p><p> I mean it requires you to be surgical within your company to ensure that  you are looking at, do you have the most diverse perspectives at the table.</p><p> You know, the conversation in here in Davos is all about you know,  disruption and how things are changing so fast you have to be agile.  Well  if you don't have Diversity and Inclusion in your organization, you won't  be the most successful so it's a business imperative.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, absolutely.</p><p> Let me ask you about your own business and -</p><p> DOUGHTIE:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  - what you are doing, you recently announced the acquisition of  Cyber Inc. -</p><p> DOUGHTIE:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  - which provides Cyber-security globally, where are your  priorities right now at the firm?</p><p> DOUGHTIE:  Well, I think that acquisition points to the importance of Cyber  as a top risk on CEOs agenda all over the place and it's - and it's - it's  no surprise because with Artificial Intelligence as technology is being  embedded in basically everything that organizations do, the threat of Cyber  is more important than ever.</p><p> And I think you are talking about it with Microsoft earlier today -</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Absolutely.</p><p> DOUGHTIE:  - how that is something that every organization is focused on.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I think - I think J.P. Morgan said that 'they'll get you $1  billion in terms of spending on Cyber, at some point, there at 700 million  right now.</p><p> Lynne, it's good to see you.</p><p> Thank you so much.</p><p> DOUGHTIE:  Great, great to be here.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Lynne Doughtie, joining us.</p><p> We'll be right back.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Welcome back,  everybody.  Thank you so much for joining us this morning.  It is  Wednesday, January 24th.  The top stories right now 8:00 A.M. on the East  Coast.  America First on the world stage.  President Trump and his  administration heads to Davos to tout the U.S. economy and lure big-name  investors to America.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin making headline  down the ground in Davos already.  The dollar is down this morning after  Secretary Mnuchin said a weaker dollar is good for the U.S. economy.  He's  not the only cabinet member making headlines.  Earlier this morning, I  spoke with Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen about the  delegation to the World Economic Forum.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> KIRSTJEN NIELSEN, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY:  I think  what this message is going to be is America First is not America alone.  We  need to partner, you know, as I said earlier, not one of us has the ability  to do this alone.  So we need to partner with the private secretary.  We  need to partner with our allies.  We've seen those discussions with North  Korea.  We've seen that in Syria.  We've seen that in Iran.  We have to  build coalitions to be able to attack these threats together and I think --  I think that's what you'll hear a lot about.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The president's trip to Davos comes amid another case of  trickle-down tax reform.  Starbucks, the latest company passing on savings  from the new tax law to its employees.  The announcement coming on the  heels of similar news from Disney, J.P. Morgan Chase, and Verizon and that  was just yesterday.  What the coffee giant is brewing up for its records  coming up.  New and more records from markets, the NASDAQ yesterday surged  52 points after Netflix stock jumped 10 percent.  The S&amp;P 500 also added  all-time high this morning after another gain yesterday of 6 points quarter  of a percent higher.  The Dow pulled back yesterday but this morning we  look at momentum on the upside we're expecting a pretty strong opening for  the broader averages.  Take a look at Futures with the Dow Industrials now  at the highs of the morning.  We're expecting a gain of 80 points right out  of the gate a third of a percent higher, S&amp;P 500 also higher by a quarter  of a percent, and the NASDAQ adding on to yesterday's record performance.  </p><p> In Europe, this morning different story.  Take a look at the European  indices lower across the board worst performer in the U.K. FT-100 down one  half of one percent.  In Asia overnight, markets closed mostly higher with  the exception of Japan as you see the Nikkei averaging Japan down three- quarters of a percent overnight.  Earnings, the story on Wall Street once  again General Electric, Ford Motor, Comcast, all among the big names  reporting their fourth quarter numbers.  Comcast delivered a double beat  earnings and revenue above estimates.  General Electric missed estimates  but look at the stock, it's up one and one and a half percent.  Clearly,  investors are seeing some value in G.E. shares after a 40 percent sell-off  despite that miss on earnings.</p><p> Trouble patching the patch, well, Intel is still struggling to repair the  glaring flaw in its chips sparking new concerns this morning for  cybersecurity.  Plus, hackers cash in on the cryptocurrency craze.  The  stunning amount stolen from the billions raised in initial coin offerings  amid the Bitcoin boom.  We will tell you about that.  Also coming up this  morning, joining the conversation Energy Secretary Rick Perry is with us  this morning along with Dow CEO Andrew Liveris, the CEO of Cisco Chuck  Robbins is here, and the CEO of Campbell Soup Denise Morrison.  </p><p> Plus, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney weighs in.  You don't  want to miss the moments with them.  We got a big hour coming up.  First,  this top story this hour, America First on the world stage.  President  Trump headed to the World Economic Forum in Davos.  Tonight, he's expected  to arrive tomorrow.  Treasure Secretary Steven Mnuchin already on the  ground here in Switzerland and he's making news.  He had comments this  morning saying that he welcomes a weakening dollar because it is good for  trade.  That sent the dollar to fresh new lows this morning.  Though  Mnuchin also emphasized America is open for business.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEVEN MNUCHIN, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY:  We have a great  story to tell, lots of important meetings.  It's truly all about economic  growth opportunities to invest free and fair trade, and kind of -- so we're  looking forward to it.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You can do that.  If you don't want to, you don't have  to.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's fine.  This is coming as companies here in U.S. are  giving back to their employees in the wake of the tax reform overhaul.   President Trump just tweeted this, this morning.  He says, tremendous  investment by companies from all over the world being made in America.   There has never been anything like it.  The president writes now, Disney,  JPMorgan Chase, and many others, massive regulation reduction tax cuts  making the U.S. a powerhouse once again.  He says, long way to go, jobs,  jobs, jobs.  Joining me now to weigh in is the Chairman and CEO of E.Y.,  Global Chairman and CEO Mark Weinberger.  Mark, it's great to see you.  </p><p> MARK WEINBERGER, GLOBAL CHAIRMAN AND CEO OF E.Y.:  Always a pleasure,  Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So I know that you have been  on panels this morning.  You're talking to a lot of your customers and  clients about what's taking place in the U.S. and the tax reform bill that  is having a really big impact.</p><p> WEINBERGER:  It is, Maria.  We're seeing, you know, obviously, it doesn't  make the U.S. a tax heaven but what it does do is give us a competitor rate  and it allows companies to move their capital around without having to pay  that extra level of tax.  We are seeing supply changed being reevaluated,  operations and investment being expanded and as you said, we're seeing a  whole bunch of things like increasing wages, bonuses, pension payments,  healthcare payments.  The real question is you know it has been are the  businesses going to give back to shareholders and stock buybacks and  dividends or investing in capital and labor?  I think you're going to see  all of that but it's a positive -- definitely a positive momentum here in  Davos.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And all of the above is positive?  </p><p> WEINBERGER:  All of the above are positive, gives back in the economy.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But let me ask you this because we see this tax plan having an  immediate effect with the companies announcing these things, but this is  really going to have a longer-term effect, isn't it?</p><p> WEINBERGER:  That is a great point because everyone is saying, what's this  going to do next quarter?  This is a landmark tax reform bill that  structurally changes business taxes like we haven't even done since 1960s.   We talk about the 1986 Act.  That was a lot of individual changes.   International rules are written in the 60s.  This completely changes how a  company thinks about where to put his capital.  It's not just U.S.  businesses.  We're talking to many Asian companies, European companies, who  are looking to invest in the U.S. to get advantage of the full expensing,  the lower corporate rate, and a number of other benefits of just being a  great market.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's right.  I was speaking to a European player recently and  he said, we had a whole plan to invest in Europe.  We've shifted that plan  and now we'll be investing in America which is -- </p><p> WEINBERGER:  We'll see more of that.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Which is very positive.  All right.  There's that.  The  president and his administration getting high marks on the tax reform  package.  No doubt about it.  But then there's trade where there are some  questions.  The president yesterday announced steep tariffs on solar  panels, on washing machines while 11 Pacific Rim countries agreed to forge  a new commercial block that excludes the U.S., obviously, the U.S. pulling  out of the TPP, what's your take on what's happening with regards to trade?  </p><p> WEINBERGER:  So I think the speech is you and your league, you talked about  it's going to be really important because the president has to balance and  enforcing the laws.  I mean this, you know, putting tariffs on solar isn't,  you know, changing the whole landscape of trade, in fact, from 2012 and  2015, we had tariffs on solar.  So there are really uncertainty now is  where is he go next?  And we need to be involved in trade deals around the  world.  We can't be left out.  Ninety-five percent of the world's  consumers, 80 percent of GDP growth is outside the United States.  So  businesses want to be able to go there.  The U.S. is and open market.  We  let everybody in.  Trade deals are good for businesses.  In the U.S., they  create jobs.  So the question is going to be, does this lead to more and  more retaliation and trade wars?  Or is this enforcement of existing deals  and renegotiations of NAFTA or renegotiations of course, and discussions  with China to get to a positive trade deal?  That's what everyone is going  to be watching.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So one of the issues with NAFTA is it basically sets the  companies, look, you can have a factory overseas in Mexico and you can  produce cheap stuff and then you can send them back to the U.S. and sell  them in U.S., so of course, companies are going to do just that in higher  workers at a much lower wage in Mexico.  And then once NAFTA was completed  and then everybody started doing that, that became the template for all  trade deals?</p><p> WEINBERGER:  Well, it's true.  But if you think -- but there are so many  examples where you know, well, I mean how do you even implement as you  don't know what the cargo -- component parts going over and back across the  border in Canada six times.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.  </p><p> WEINBERGER:  And iPhone is 800 different companies worked on an iPhone in  31 different countries and the component parts all come together into the  United States, so --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So what are they going to do, pay a tariff every time they  cross --</p><p> WEINBERGER:  They couldn't do it.  You couldn't afford an iPhone if you had  a tariff every level of the company in the United States.  You couldn't get  the labor done if you try to bring it all back to the United States.  So we  need to understand that this helps the United States too to have these  trade deals in place.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So there's got to a balance between fair trade but also not  hurting the customer because ultimately that's going to fall on the  consumer who's going to pay more for a product because the company that  makes it is paying a tariff?  </p><p> WEINBERGER:  Absolutely.  It's like a tax here that we just reduced.  So  but you're in the nail in the head, Maria, as always.  The pivot we got to  watch and see right now from feeding up on our trading partners.  First, a  lot of bad deals and upgrading necessarily trade deals to starting to  negotiating positively the new deals.  Seeing if NAFTA will get done this  year.  We have a lot of negotiations coming up this month, of course, the  Mexican elections coming up on midterms and coming up makes it hard.   Mercosur is positively moving forward, so we're going to try and negotiate  that.  We got to make progress in those deals and that will set a good  signal. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Let me ask you, Mark.  And turn to -- turn to Bitcoin  because according to new research, you and Ernst &amp; Young did recently more  than 10 percent of funds raised through initial coin offerings are lost or  stolen in hacker attacks?  </p><p> WEINBERGER:  Yes.  Well, this is -- as we know, it's a really complicated  area and, you know, these coin offerings are plenty.  There's over a  hundred different indexes out there where they're coming in there's  offerings.  They are obviously susceptible to fraud and theft.  They become  more of an investment than a currency and so I think appropriately you have  the government to look at it where we point it out there is that investors  -- it's not an investor.  It's really a tool to be a currency.  You have to  be cautious how you're investing in it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  One more risk to watch around Bitcoin?  </p><p> WEINBERGER:  Always, a lot more.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Mark, great to see you.</p><p> WEINBERGER:  Always, Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us this morning, Mark Weinberger  or EY.  Coming up, General Electric releases its 4th quarter results  missing earnings and revenue expectations.  We'll break those numbers.   Nonetheless, the stock is up 1-1/2 percent.  And then more concerns over  cybersecurity, Intel is telling customers to stop installing a software  patch release to address a security flaw in their computer chips.  We've  got the details next.  Back in a moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are live this week at the World Economic  Forum here in Davos, Switzerland.  President Trump will be here tomorrow.   Joining me right now and a first time Fox Business interview DowDuPont  Executive Chairman, CEO Andrew Liveris who is also the head of the now  disbanded president -- Americans Manufacturing Council.  Good to see you,  sir.  Thank you so much for joining us.  </p><p> LIVERIS:  Nice to be with you, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  No.  We're coming into this meeting there was a lot of  optimism.  But would you say that this is one of the most optimistic Davos  meetings you've ever seen? </p><p> LIVERIS:  Definitely one of the most optimistic and also one full of  expectation for the president visit here on Friday.  So really the topic is  the president's visit.  So most of us are getting all of that meetings done  before tomorrow because I think it's going to tilt very quickly to what the  president is going to say and kind of his team is kind of coming in already  with meeting some of them.  I had a couple of meetings today with U.S.  officials.  I've never seen such a strong U.S. delegation.  So this is kind  of opposite to America First thing.  I mean this is America engaged and as  a global company, this is a positive thing.  And I think my European  colleagues and the rest of the world colleagues Asian, Middle East, Africa,  they're all kind of waiting to see how the U.S. will posture itself.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  This is a really good way to put it American engaged, I like  that.  How is the president doing in your view?  I know that, you know, you  were on that council.  You were the chairman.  It was disbanded.  There was  upset at that time, but how would you grade President Trump's by now?  </p><p> LIVERIS:  Well, from a year ago to present day even through the year with  the disbanding of the council, I've been very consistent on that answer.   This is a very business-friendly president, very business friendly  administration, so I give him a strong A.  I mean, you know, the tax reform  you just talked about I mean but not just tax reform, the regulatory work  is being done.  It's astonishing.  I've never imagined that much progress  in 12 months or so and of course other work that I'm involved in which I'm  on secretary of (INAUDIBLE) workforce reinvention counsel.  This is the  apprenticeship task force which is to redefine what the American system is  producing in terms of skilled workers with digitalization approaching us.   I'm very encouraged by that work and that early stuff that we're doing to  change the way America supplies workers we need and so I'm very -- I give - - I give it a strong A.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's very important because we're seeing machine learning take  over jobs and we're seeing new skillsets really required.  OK.  So positive  marks on the tax reform package.  We know that.  We know what's going on  but all of these companies coming out and saying how positive it is, but  we're also seeing a debate around the trade story and that's I want to get  your take on because the president issued new tariffs on imports of solar  panels and washing machines from Asia, what do you make of this?  </p><p> LIVERIS:  Well, so, you know, now that -- you just said tax reform  happening and let's skip the details of that finalized.  But trade is of  course on his agenda and the business agenda are topic he ran for office on  and there's a lot of work to be done whether it be the redoing of NAFTA and  whatever form it takes, the China discussion, and of course, all the things  that the president worries about which is giving Americans jobs that they  can count on for the future.  You just mentioned machine learning and  digitalization.  We all know that's as big a potential job killer as  anything in the trade agenda.  So we've got all to engage our workers.   We've got to engage the American public to actually put the facts in front  of the table of what is the trade topic.  And it isn't -- look at Dow, I  mean I export from the United States to all countries of the world.  </p><p> One in five of my jobs is based on America being a trader, so we got to  keep trade.  But what the president is doing is he wants to change the  rules of engagement.  And I think we all have to engage in that topic, so  what are these rules?  OK.  It isn't just about putting tariffs on and on  that tariff question, I mean we Dow make a polysilicon.  That's a -- the  raw material for solar panels.  We've been excluded from the China market  for the last five years, so that's not far.  So these tariffs on solar  panels is a way of sending a signal that it can't be one way.  It can't be  one-way trade and I support the president on that.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  This is really important because you've actually seen firsthand  the impact of much cheaper products coming from China.  </p><p> LIVERIS:  Absolutely.  And then, so American workers, we can't -- we are  now having plants at risks, factories at risks because I can't access the  China market and they favor their own producers, yet the solar panels are  being -- coming over here and killing our solar panel industry in the  United States.  So there needs to be a recalibration with lots of  conversation with Secretary Ross in the USTR on this topic.  So that's an  example of recalibrating the rules of trade and I'm all for that, but I  think we need to get the facts on the table, get the rhetoric out of room,  and, you know, what are these rules of engagement in terms of fair trade.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  This is the first explanation that really I've heard that make  so much sense because you're right there and you're feeling it firsthand.   The worry is of course, are we going to see retaliation?  I mean are you  going to China even get more secluded and even more protectionist in terms  of their solar panels?</p><p> LIVERIS:  Well, since antiquity and city-states, and bartering view, of  course, get tit-for-tat.  You, of course, get retaliation.  This is what  negotiation is.  This president is a negotiator.  We have a team of  negotiations in the U.S. side.  I'm a businessperson.  I'm going  negotiator.  As long as we end up at the right spot, I think the rhetoric  and the retaliation may will be part of the process.  I'm convinced based  on speed of tax reform and the speed of regulatory reform, this will not be  one of these things that takes a lot of time.  So I would encourage all my  colleagues certainly our company to be engaged, to be at the table on what  these tit-for-tats will be.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Do you think we're going to see more of this like for example  as it relates to aluminum and steel because the president did say -- he  mentioned aluminum and steel and I think that is getting some people  nervous that we're going to see more and more of this kind of tariff  behavior and it's --</p><p> LIVERIS:  Well, I'm not in -- I'm not in the room that decides which ones  but I am telling you, if I look at chemicals, for example, we have a  surplus.  We're the second largest exporter from the United States.  So we  would hate to see if steel and aluminum thing happen and then chemicals,  you know, give restrictions in terms of exporting from the United States  into China or any other country, so I would be counter doing too much tit- for-tat.  But I think this recent one is a strong enough message that the  United States is serious.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, for sure.  And you've given us phenomenal insight into  this.  Andrew, thank you for that.  </p><p> LIVERIS:  Not at all.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You are such a retire as Chairman of DowDuPont later this year  after overseeing its historic deal the merger late last year.  Now, I know  you are reporting earnings.  You're going to be giving us guidelines on all  of this in the coming week.  But what can you tell us in terms of the  timing of integration?  What do you want to say to shareholders in terms of  where you are today?  </p><p> LIVERIS:  Well, I think our shareholders from our last report to present  day what I'll say and then what I'll say next week with specificity.  This  is on track.  As you said, it's historic, 300 years of corporate history  and to reconfigure these assets in a tax-free way pushing in a hold value  for growth, for three companies, the new Dow which will be the materials  company, the new agricultural company, the new specialty company.  We're on  track.  And look, I can't be happier about the way the cultures of being  assimilating, the integration work.  We've got thousands of people working  on this, not to mention all the help in the consultants' world that you can  find.  It's working and I would tell you that you right now and you'll hear  more next week that it's basically on track.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And then in terms of growth look at five years, where does the  growth come from at this company?</p><p> LIVERIS:  Well, I got to tell you that the humanity and sustainability  which gets talked about here a lot.  We need products that have full  circulation capability.  So all that work on light-weighting on batteries  and cars, on the next car what that looks like.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That's a good point.  </p><p> LIVERIS:  Good packaging, what we do with food packaging, what we do with  plastics in the ocean, what we do with carbon emissions, these are all  opportunities for these companies would it be the agricultural one or the  materials one, or the specialty ones, water, and water reuse, waste  management, waste reuse, these are the opportunities that we're addressing  through using out 7500 scientists.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So this is where the growth comes from?  </p><p> LIVERIS:  That's where it comes from.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about regulation.  Obviously, this president has  been rolling back regulations, have you felt it in your sector because I  know other sectors they're not there yet and it sort of the smaller runway,  what have you seen?  </p><p> LIVERIS:  Look, I can't speak strongly enough about how much we've felt it.   It's not just -- it's not just the attitude.  It's being specific and we've  been asked, and it's kind of nice to be consulted to be at the front end of  this, to use science, to say this regulation makes sense.  This one  doesn't.  This administration has been unafraid to roll back regulations  that make no sense.  We felt it.  We're feeling it on our bottom line.  But  more importantly, we're seeing it in a change in attitude on what's the  smarter regulation.  We are for regulation.  We just want the right type of  regulation to actually manage the behaviors of everyone in the value chain.   We're a big player.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And the pendulum just swung way too far.  Andrew, it's great to  see you.  </p><p> LIVERIS:  Always going to be with you, Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Andrew Liveris there.  We'll be right back.   Stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are coming to you live this week from the  World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.  Speaking with the biggest  names in business and innovation, cybersecurity, of course, one of the  agenda topics here as companies like Intel are asking their companies and  their customers to stop installing a software patch that it released to fix  security flaws on computer chips.  The company says that the patch is can  cause, \"Unpredictable system behavior.\"  Joining me right now to weigh in  on that is the CEO of Cisco Chuck Robbins.  Chuck, it's great to see you.  </p><p> CHUCK ROBBINS, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF CISCO SYSTEMS:  Great to see you,  Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I want to talk broadly about what's happening in your  business right now.  But how are you combating the cybersecurity  vulnerability like this one?  </p><p> ROBBINS:  Well, first of all, I think Intel is doing a reasonable job.   It's obviously a significant issue.  In the industry, we all try to come  together when we have these kinds of issues occur and there's a great  cooperative spirit between the major tech companies when we find these  types of issues and we're working through it within just like everybody is,  and I think they're doing the right things.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What can you tell us about I.T. budgets today, Chuck?  I mean  here we are looking at an environment where people are talking about four  percent economic growth.  Your business is the gut to any other business in  a whole host of sectors.  So I want to ask you what you're seeing in terms  of I.T. budgets.  Are managers spending more on your products?</p><p> ROBBINS:  Well, it's early in the year and every year when we start the new  calendar year budgets begin to become more visible as we get into it.  And  we're in the latter part of our quarter now and so we'll be reporting  earnings in a couple weeks and we'll give some insights into that.  But I  think that when you look at what happened here in the country and you look  at tax reform, and you look at the positive feeling here in Davos that you  have at least from an economic perspective, I think that there's a great  deal of optimism around the world right now.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  There really is.  What do you think is powering it?   Because I think from your standpoint it's more than just tax reform, isn't  it?</p><p> ROBBINS:  Well, it is.  And if you look at the economic situation around  the world, it's -- I mean the central banks have done a great job.  You've  got stimulus has been put into the system.  You have had a great, you know,  since the 2008 crisis, we've had a -- we've finally got into a sustained  recovery and now what you see happening that with our business is that as  we've seen here in Davos if you go back three or four years, we were  talking about the internet of things and now the fourth industrial  revolution, and there's no doubt that that's occurring, and no one is  talking about it.  So here we're having conversations about how do we  redefine the architecture inside a vehicle.  Those are the conversations  we're having now.  So technology is permeating every aspect of life and  industry, and as that happens as billions of things become connected.   Obviously, that's good for us.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Let's talk about that because we were talking with Carlo  Stone yesterday and he was saying, everything in a car today is technology  related.  So what areas of business are the most important in terms of  powering your business?  What sectors?</p><p> ROBBINS:  Well, if you look at -- it's happening across every industry  today.  Primarily, we have seen early adoption in manufacturing of this  industrial internet.  We've seen retail move.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Sorry about that.  </p><p> ROBBINS:  That's great.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  This must mean someone important is arriving.  </p><p> ROBBINS:  I know.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Because a helicopter is here making lots of noise but hopefully  they just passed.  So you said manufacturing -- </p><p> ROBBINS:  Well, I just want you to know when I arrived in Davos, I wouldn't  interrupt you like that visitor, you know, we've seen manufacturing.  We've  seen healthcare.  We see connected cars.  We made announcements of CES with  Hyundai.  I meet with a couple of car manufacturers here this week about  what we can do together and then across our broader business just the  connectivity of all these devices, the management of the data, the  cybersecurity issues that are associated with it.  They all provide great  opportunities for us in the future.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Because everything is connected today, so tell us how the  Cisco products connect?  </p><p> ROBBINS:  Well, so I think they're circling to come back to see if they --  make sure you heard them the first time.  So when you -- when you look at  the connectivity of all of the platforms, the -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Stop.  Just give it a minute first.  It's going back at out,  yes.  </p><p> ROBBINS:  It's (INAUDIBLE) they're going to land right here.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  They're right above us.  </p><p> ROBBINS:  They're going to land.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  This helicopter.  </p><p> ROBBINS:  The matter of the issue is as we connect vehicles, as we connect  vending machines, manufacturing facilities whatever they are, Cisco is the  largest machine, the machine connectivity platform.  Then after that, you  have to actually take the data that's created and help our customers move  that data to the place that they need it and whether it's in a public  crowd, whether it's in a private cloud, or whether they want to assess and  manage that data at the edge of the network, the network is going to play a  great role, and then we fundamentally have to drive security in the network  because there is no perimeter to defend it anymore.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wonderful.  Chuck, I'm so sorry.</p><p> ROBBINS:  What did you say?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  This is -- this is incredible.  We're having a conversation --</p><p> ROBBINS:  We had a funny experienced last year too, you know.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But with the helicopters? </p><p> ROBBINS:  No.  We had one with a camera last year, so --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Oh, that's right.  Let me ask you real quick in terms of  geography and where you see the best growth right now.  Europe is growing.   The U.S. is obviously a chunk of a four percent growth, is there a corner  of the world that is doing better than others with regard to this kind of  activity?</p><p> ROBBINS:  Well, what I would say is that we see probably more consistent  growth around the world than we've seen in a very long time as evidence by  the discussions going on here.  When we look at the adoption of the  technology, we see emerging countries adopting the technology to try to  solve problems in a massive scale whether it's in India, whether it's in  China.  And then we see obviously developed countries leveraging these  technologies to look at how we make cities smarter that had optimized  traffic and optimized citizen services, so it's really happening  everywhere, it's amazing.  So -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Incredible performance.  So how do you keep this going?</p><p> ROBBINS:  Well, I think that as long as this industrial revolution  continues then we should be at the heart of all of that because as our  customers connect more and more devices, the network is absolutely the  foundation, so --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Chuck, it's good to have you on the show.  Thank you so much.   This is great, this is incredible.  This is actually funny.</p><p> ROBBINS:  They're circling.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  They're circling.  Chuck Robbins, Cisco CEO, we will be right  back.  Thank you so much.</p><p> LEIF SHIRAS, TENNIS CHANNEL COMMENTATOR: Welcome back to another Tennis  Channel Court Report, a special presentation For Business.  I'm Leif  Shairs.  Well, the 2018 Austrian Open completed quarterfinal action on day  10 in Melbourne and there was American interest in both the man and woman  draws.  Kyung Chang ended the dream run of Tennessee native Tenny Sandgren  to reach the final four and become the first South Korean to reach the  semifinals at a major.</p><p> Elsewhere, Angelique Kerber made short work of Maidson Keys in their  quarterfinal.  The American never found her game as the German powered away  to an impressive one and two victory.  Don't forget, Tennis Channel's live  coverage of the Australian Open continues Wednesday at 6:00 p.m. Eastern.   I'm Leif Sharis.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Here again Maria Bartiromo with the special edition of  MORNINGS WITH MARIA live from Davos, Switzerland at the World Economic  Forum.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Wednesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so  much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Wednesday, January  24th.  Your top stories right now 8:34 on the East Coast.  The White House  descends on Davos.  President Trump set to leave Washington for the World  Economic Forum tonight.  The trip comes as the White House makes good on  the Commander-in-Chief's promise to put America first, this follows the  overwhelming success of the President's tax plan. </p><p> Treasury Secretary Stephen Mnuchin already on the ground and he is making  news, the dollar is sliding this morning after Secretary Mnuchin said a  weaker dollar is good for the U.S. economy and trade during a press  conference in Davos.  Markets this morning are rallying, take a look at the  futures indicating that we will see a higher opening for the broader  averages.  This right here is the high of the morning.  Up better than 100  points in unchartered territory once again. S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ also in  unchartered territory.  The NASDAQ and the S&amp;P hit new record-highs  yesterday.  </p><p> Ahead of the President's trip, investors are watching earning this morning  from the likes of General Electric and Comcast among others.  G.E. reported  earnings and revenue which were below expectation and yet the stock is  trading higher.  The stock up 2-1/2 percent as investors look for value  after a huge selloff.  Comcast also topped expectations although that stock  is lower.  European indices this morning are lower.  The stocks in Europe,  take a look, are weaker across the board pretty much.  FT-100 down one-half  of a half percent, the CAC quarante and DAX are also lower.  In Asia  overnight, markets close mostly higher, take a look.  And as you see, the  markets were higher with the exception of Japan which was down three- quarters of one percent.</p><p> Topping our news this half an hour, President Trump and America First at  Davos.  More than a dozen high-level members of the administration are  arriving here to discuss economics, trade, cybersecurity and a lot more  with the political and corporate leaders gathers here.  Joining me right  now is the United States Secretary of Energy, Secretary Rick Perry.   Secretary, it's great to see you.</p><p> RICK PERRY, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF ENERGY:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  The President's America  First message, how do you think it will be received?</p><p> PERRY:  Well, I think he have to understand what America First means to the  President and the administration.  It's really pretty simple from my  perspective.  This is about America being competitive around the globe.   When folks were thinking about where you want to buy your energy from,  where do you want that next load of LNG to come from?  We want you to think  about America first.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, that's a good way to put it.  Well, the President has  stressed really tapping into our oil reserves in America.  Let's talk about  that and where the opportunities are from your standpoint.  </p><p> PERRY:  Yes.  Well, you think about 10 plus years ago and then 2005 we were  -- besides ourselves, if you will and behind, other places where the oil  and gas was coming from, you know, we had founded all, Peak oil.  We heard  all of those stories and then, you know, by the grace of God and some  technology and a god by named George Mitchell from Texas, hydraulic  fracturing came into play in a really big way and we were able to go into  those tight shell formations and develop that which is now creating an  absolute revolution in the oil and gas industry and completely changing the  geopolitical dynamics in the world with America being at the forefront.  We  are now the number one oil and gas producing nation on the face of the  earth.  I mean, who would have thought that a decade ago that that would  have been true.  But it puts us in a very unique place.  And here is what I  try to share with all of our allies and for all the audience here at Davos  is that the United States is not just exporting energy, we're exporting  freedom.  We're exporting to our allies in Europe.  The opportunity to  truly have a choice of where do you buy your energy from.  That's freedom,  and that kind of freedom is priceless.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  This is a really important point that you're making because for  a long time America was reliant on places like Saudi Arabia and Russia to  get energy but today it's a completely different situation in America.  How  significant is it?  I mean, how would you characterize the supply that will  be coming from the U.S. or to the global markets.</p><p> PERRY:  You know, I'm not sure anything since World War II has been anymore  dynamic from my perspective than they shift in the energy supply, energy  control if you will.  And again, the United States in the back controlling  a country with this industry.  It's about literally freeing up our allies  around the world.  Letting them know that we're going to be there for them,  there's no strings attached when you buy American LNG.  So, that is --  that's world-changing.  And truly, this president, that's his message here.   Is that the United States is -- it's a new day.  The fossil fuels that  we're going to be relying them on for decades to come are going to be  available.  Now, is our technology going to be able to allow us to use it  wiser?  With better results for the environment?  Absolutely.  The CCCU,  the carbon capture utilization, we're doing projects with Saudi Arabia.  </p><p> I'll see my counterpart (INAUDIBLE) today on a panel, we'll talk about the  projects that we're working on together.  The UAE, Qatar, all of those  countries as we come together to develop and supply the rest of the world  with the power so that they can have manufacturing (INAUDIBLE) in Africa.   Being able to, you know, literally turn the lights on when the sun goes  down so that their children can read, the people are safer.  I mean, all of  that is partly because of American ingenuity and our abilities to not  believe the naysayers that people is here and you're not going to find any  more of this</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, is there -- is there a way to characterize the amount of  supply that will be coming from the U.S.?</p><p> PERRY:  Well, you know, I hesitate to be a forecaster of what the home  markets are going to be.  I'll leave that up to people that are  substantially more into that.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Oh, come on.  You're the Energy Secretary.  Let me ask --</p><p> PERRY:  My job is to make sure that it's -- the abundant supply and I want  to get people together so that they know that America is going to be a  reliant supplier of that energy.  The price will work itself though.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Are you surprised where prices are by the way because it feels  like the markets are focused more on the potential for terrorism or  disruption.  Where oil is right now.  </p><p> PERRY:  Well, those are realities of the world.  But the fact is that we  have an amazing I mean, you think about Anwar that the Congress just opened  up again.  You know, the previous administration closed it down, Congress  working with the administration said, you know what, those nine million  barrels are really important to the United States and to the world.  So  opening up markets that the previous administration have closed.  I think  it's in a very powerful message around the world that we're going to be a  reliant supplier of energy into the foreseeable future.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Absolutely.  And I think that's why there's change happening in  Saudi Arabia.</p><p> PERRY:  Indeed.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  There is incredible change happening in other countries because  they see what to expect from the U.S.  By the way, what was behind the  decision not to drill off of the coast of Florida?  </p><p> PERRY:  You know, I think that the administration through the Department of  Interior sensitive to the issues there.  There is plenty of space out there  whether it's in the gulf, whether it's in Anwar, whether it's other areas  that we can develop the energy resource we have.  You know, the people of  Florida said, hey listen, we don't want to add any new drilling platforms,  the administration respected that.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And that was OK with the (INAUDIBLE) let me ask you about the  President's news this week and that is these tariffs on solar panels and on  washing machines, there is some conversation happening and as you know  about worries about potential trade wars, about what China will do in  response.  Should we worry about a different trade stance from this  administration?  </p><p> PERRY:  They shouldn't be worrying about this administration from the  standpoint of transparency and fairness.  That's what Donald Trump is all  about.  You want to compete against the United States, bring it but don't  subsidize in a way that it's unfair, don't get into the market and try to  gobble up all the market and then all of a sudden after you choked  everybody else out of market, guess what, prices go up.  This is a  president that says, look, I get it about competition.  But you're going to  compete fairly, and you're going to compete on a level-playing field.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And the President said that as it relates to jobs as well and  when you look at the energy story, that's a real job creator.  Can you  characterize what we might see from all of the drilling and the fracturing  that will happen in terms of job creation?  </p><p> PERRY:  Well, it's going to continue on.  I mean, that's obviously for the  states that --  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And consistent.  </p><p> PERRY:  And it's not just the jobs right in those states where it's  happening, it's upstream or excuse me, it's downstream from that.  It's the  manufacturing.  We think there is an incredible potential in the  Appalachian region to turn that area into an absolute job-creating giant  with the development of the Marcell or Shell with the other fossil fuels  that are available there.  You can duplicate the footprint of what you see  along in Texas Gulf Coast in that Appalachian region and the jobs that get  created.  I'm promising you the governor of West Virginia and Ohio and  Kentucky and Pennsylvania, they're going to be staying and they're saluting  and saying, Mr. President, let's go, let's go make this happen, let's go  make America great again.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And they're -- and these are high-paying jobs.  </p><p> PERRY:  Indeed.  They are.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  How do you like the job?  How do you like the role of energy  secretary?  What's new that you can tell us with this?</p><p> PERRY:  Most interesting job I've ever had.  Best job ever had was governor  of Texas but this one is the most interesting and the coolest job mostly  because of the 17 national labs that are out there involved in everything  from cybersecurity to the next wave of small-moderate reactors to, you  know, just the most fascinating new things that are going to be on the  horizon for America.  Our national labs are involved in. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Secretary, thank you for your leadership.  </p><p> PERRY:  You're welcome.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good to see you.  Secretary Rick Perry.  We'll be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  General Electric reported earnings that were  below expectations, this morning.  Nicole Petallides on the floor of the  New York Stock Exchange watching the stock trade up -- Nicole.</p><p> NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN HOST:  Hey, good morning, Maria.  We know that  General Electric has been in a turnaround phase.  In the last August,  Flannery came on as the new CEO to turn this thing around.  Today, look at  that, just in the last half hour, you -- a short time ago, we're saying it  was up 2-1/2 percent.  And look now, it's up 5.2 percent.  So, what  happened here?  We did see ultimately, that the company in the latest  quarter, they're really focusing on the overall -- the restructuring plan.   The weakness that they've seen in operating profit and the revenue but  ultimately that they're focusing on the aviation and health care divisions  where they are seeing some strength.  </p><p> There has been talk about this company being beaten down, and don't forget,  it's down about 45 percent in the last 12 months.  Is now the time to  finally get into General Electric?  I know you've had this conversation  with many of your guests, but there's been talk of dividing up the company  in some way.  But that the turnaround and restructuring is underway, but  you are seeing the stock now getting a big jump, Maria.  Now, it's up 5-1/2  percent at 17.78.  Back to you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Thank you, Nicole.  From Disney to Verizon and  Starbucks, more U.S. companies handing out bonus checks, hiking wages for  their workers after the tax reform overhaul.  Joining me right now, the  host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney to weigh in on that.  Stu, it's  just incredible the number of companies.</p><p> STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Oh, it's a flood.  Look, I  would call it a flood.  Look, in the last 24 hours, we've got Disney, a  thousand bucks to 125,000 employees, Verizon, I think is 2,500 bucks worth  of stock to the employees; J.P. Morgan 10 percent wage increases for a big  swath of their people.  I mean, it's a long list, just in last 24 hours.   It's clear, I think American business was on trial, they got everything  they wanted from the tax cut deal, and now, they are indeed passing it  along to the -- to the customers and also to their employees.  But, you  know, the big pass-through, I think, is still to come.  I think that will  come from the big tech companies of this world, when they repatriate all of  that money.  I think a lot of it goes to shareholders.  And looking for  stock buybacks like Comcast, for example, and I'm looking also for a  dividend increases.  That's the next round in this flood of pass-throughs  and givebacks.  Here it comes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's a great point.  I would also add on to financial  services, Stu, because, you know, the banks really haven't even had the  actual impact of regulation rollback.  You know,  that's to come, so  there's this enormous runway there as well.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, look, it's a flood, that's what I'm saying.  By the way, how  is Davos treating you?  Are being nice to you?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's good.  I mean, you know, everyone's talking about  President Trump.</p><p>VARNEY:  Exactly.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Coming tomorrow, and wondering what he's going to say, so he's  definitely making a splash even before he arrives, Stu.</p><p>VARNEY:  Stick it to them, Mr. President</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We'll see you in 10 min, Stu.</p><p>VARNEY:  You will.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins top of the hour,  right after \"MORNINGS WITH MARIA\".  We'll be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Tax reform trickle down, Verizon, Disney,  Starbucks have all announced perks for their employees as a result of the  new tax cuts.  Joining me right now live from the World Economic Forum is  the CEO of Campbell Soup, Denise Morrison.  Denise, great to see you,  thanks so much for joining us.</p><p> DENISE MORRISON, CEO, CAMPBELL SOUP:  Hi, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What's your take on the tax package?</p><p> MORRISON:  Well, I think the tax reform will be beneficial for business.   We at Campbell's are going to realize a benefit from the reduced rate being  largely United States company, we bear a rate over 30 percent and we  expected that will come down pretty significantly.  And what we're going to  do with that is invest in our brands and pay down debt because we just made  a very large acquisition.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Let's talk about that acquisition.  How does this  acquisition fill in the whole that you were looking to do?  What -- how  does it give you a scale and tell us about the growth that you're expecting  as a result?</p><p> MORRISON.  Yes.  Well, we've been on a journey to transform Campbell's and  to transition our portfolio.  Soup is a very important category but we now  recognize that in order to deliver on the needs and wants of the next  generation of consumers, we wanted to diversify our portfolio in the  faster-growing spaces, and those spaces are health and well-being and  snacking.  And so, acquisitions were the key accelerator for that strategy.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And Lance, $50 a share in cash.  A lot of people talked about  this as really helping Snyder's-Lance -- helping the company fill in areas  because people are looking for healthier options, wellness.  Tell us about  it.</p><p> MORRISON:  We believe that this provides a snacking platform, a diversified  snacking platform because we already have Pepperidge Farm, Arnott's, and  Kelsen, so this adds more to the savory snacks in addition to the sweet  snacks.  And then if you start to think about our simple meals as  convenient mini meals, it's right on trend with what the consumer is doing  because, Maria, only 34 percent of consumers eat three square meals a day.   Over 90 percent are snacking five times a day, so this is right on trend. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Interesting.  So, the soup category, is that slowing down?  I  know the last quarter, a lot of people were worried that it showed that  we're seeing a bit of a slowdown.</p><p> MORRISON:  Yes, there are pockets of growth in the soup category, for  example, we introduced a new Well Yes! Product that we co-created with  consumers, and that's targeted for the younger generation, all clean label  soups, so you can read every ingredient on the label, ingredients like  quinoa and kale, right on trend.  We also just closed on the acquisition of  Pacific Foods, which is a soup and broth and plant-based beverage company.   We're very excited about that company, and the growth rate of that brand is  really exciting.  So, we are starting to move into new spaces even within  the soup category.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You've got to change as consumer tastes change and people are  looking for healthier options like the kale and quinoa.</p><p> MORRISON:  It always starts with the consumer.  And if you keep your eye on  the consumer, they will take you where you need to go.  And we spend lots  of times with the consumers, we shop with them, we cook with them, we eat  with them.

Asked if he wanted to impose new regulations on technology companies, he responded: \"We're just going to see. You know what we want? Not regulation; we want fairness.\"</p><p>He also tweeted a video, with the hashtag #StopTheBias, which purported to show that Google promoted President Barack Obama's annual State of the Union address on its homepage but did not give a boost to Trump's. Google said in a statement that it promoted Trump's 2018 address but did not post a tout to either his or Obama's speeches to Congress after they were first elected, which are not technically State of the Union addresses.</p><p>Experts say it's unclear what he or Congress could do to influence how internet companies distribute online news. The industry has an exemption from liability for the content users write. Some top members of Congress have suggested limiting that protection as a response to allegations of bias and other misdeeds, although there have been few moves to do so since Congress curbed the shield for some cases of sex trafficking earlier in the year.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Pressure on big tech</emphasis></p><p>Trump has talked about expanding libel laws and mused about reinstating long-ended rules requiring broadcasters to offer equal time for opposing views, which didn't apply to the internet. Neither has resulted in a serious policy push.</p><p>Downes said it's possible the Federal Trade Commission could use its authority over deceptive practices to examine the company's statements that it doesn't skew its results based on politics. Such an inquiry, though, would require a \"charitable\" evaluation of the government's powers, he said, noting Trump is not supposed to interfere in the independent agency.</p><p>Google may hear more about the issue alongside executives from Facebook and Twitter at a hearing on Russian election meddling on Wednesday. The company intended to send Senior Vice President for Global Affairs Kent Walker to testify, but the panel's chairman, Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina, who wanted Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai, has rejected Walker.</p><p>The accusation of bias, dismissed by online search experts, follows the president's Aug. 24 statement that social media \"giants\" are \"silencing millions of people.\" Such allegations - along with assertions that the news media and special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation are arrayed against him - have been a chief Trump talking point meant to appeal to his base.</p><p>Trump's re-election campaign texted the president's tweets to supporters, writing as part of an end-of-month fundraising push that \"The FAKE NEWS machine is completely out of control.\"</p><p>Google issued a statement saying its searches are designed to give users relevant answers. \"Search is not used to set a political agenda and we don't bias our results toward any political ideology,\" the statement said. Twitter has said that any allegations of anti-conservative bias are unfounded.</p><p>Facebook declined to comment on Trump's statements but pointed to actions it has taken in recent years to guard against bias in its feeds, including hiring a retired Republican senator to perform an internal review.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Business impact</emphasis></p><p>Tech companies' reaction to claims of political bias shows that the accusations like Trump's \"have a significant impact on their business,\" said Chris Calabrese, vice president for policy at Washington-based think tank Center for Democracy &amp; Technology.</p><p>There's little evidence, however, backing up the president's complaint, Calabrese said, meaning it would be difficult to tackle through legal or regulatory changes.</p><p>\"It would be really hard to see how that happens without some kind of evidence-based understanding of what's actually happening,\" he said. \"It's just hard to know what's really being contemplated here.\"</p><p>Trump's threats drew a strong rebuke from free-speech advocates.</p><p>\"There are lots of things that get published that political candidates, businessmen and people on the street don't like,\" said Lucy Dalglish, dean of the journalism school at the University of Maryland. \"But you don't get to ban speech because you don't like what was said or published.\"</p><p>Freedom Partners, a conservative group affiliated with billionaire Charles Koch that has taken issue with some of Trump's policies, called any attempt to regulate search engines \"a dangerous precedent.\"</p><p>\"Regulating the results of Google or other tech companies is a reckless idea that would undermine essential elements of free speech,\" Jim Fellinger, a spokesman, said in a statement.</p><p>Google's rankings have long angered media companies, not for political bias but for the revenue that the search company gets from news publishers' work and concerns about the promotion of controversial outlets at the expense of those doing careful reporting and breaking original stories. Rupert Murdoch, who controls, among other news organizations, The Wall Street Journal, has called on Facebook to pay publishers fees to carry the news that its users post and share online.</p><p>Google News rankings have sometimes highlighted unconfirmed and erroneous reports in the early minutes of tragedies when there's little information to fill its search results. After the Oct. 1, 2017, Las Vegas shooting, for instance, several accounts seemed to coordinate an effort to smear a man misidentified as the killer, with false claims about his political ties.</p><p>Google since has tightened requirements for inclusion in news rankings, blocking outlets that \"conceal their country of origin\" and relying more on authoritative sources, although the moves have led to charges of censorship from less established outlets. Google currently says it ranks news based on \"freshness\" and \"diversity\" of the stories. Trump-favored outlets such as Fox News routinely appear in results.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">'Shadow banning'</emphasis></p><p>Twitter has addressed concerns over \"shadow banning,\" or deliberately making someone's content undiscovered to everyone except the person who posted it, writing in a blog post last month that Twitter does not use those tactics.</p><p>\"Our purpose is to serve the conversation, not to make value judgment on personal beliefs,\" Nick Pickles, Twitter's global lead for public policy strategy, said in last month's congressional hearing.</p><p>Last month, Twitter limited the functionality of a far-right commentator Alex Jones after he tweeted a link to a video that violated company policies against abusive behavior.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHICO-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHICO2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T5W-5JF1-JCK9-70GF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">279923</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-09-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1274\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 MediaNews Group, Inc. and ANG Newspapers All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Chico Enterprise-Record (California)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 2, 2018 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>TWTR (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D0UY</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2012</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DF5U</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001669</classCode><className>TALKS &amp;

Asked if he wanted to impose new regulations on technology companies, he responded: \u201cWe\u2019re just going to see. You know what we want? Not regulation; we want fairness.\u201d</p><p>He also tweeted a video, with the hashtag #StopTheBias, which purported to show that Google promoted President Barack Obama\u2019s annual State of the Union address on its homepage but did not give a boost to Trump\u2019s. Google said in a statement that it promoted Trump\u2019s 2018 address but did not post a tout to either his or Obama\u2019s speeches to Congress after they were first elected, which are not technically State of the Union addresses.</p><p>Experts say it\u2019s unclear what he or Congress could do to influence how internet companies distribute online news. The industry has an exemption from liability for the content users write. Some top members of Congress have suggested limiting that protection as a response to allegations of bias and other misdeeds, although there have been few moves to do so since Congress curbed the shield for some cases of sex trafficking earlier in the year.</p><p>Pressure on big tech</p><p>Trump has talked about expanding libel laws and mused about reinstating long-ended rules requiring broadcasters to offer equal time for opposing views, which didn\u2019t apply to the internet. Neither has resulted in a serious policy push.</p><p>Downes said it\u2019s possible the Federal Trade Commission could use its authority over deceptive practices to examine the company\u2019s statements that it doesn\u2019t skew its results based on politics. Such an inquiry, though, would require a \u201ccharitable\u201d evaluation of the government\u2019s powers, he said, noting Trump is not supposed to interfere in the independent agency.</p><p>Google may hear more about the issue alongside executives from Facebook and Twitter at a hearing on Russian election meddling on Wednesday. The company intended to send Senior Vice President for Global Affairs Kent Walker to testify, but the panel\u2019s chairman, Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina, who wanted Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai, has rejected Walker.</p><p>The accusation of bias, dismissed by online search experts, follows the president\u2019s Aug. 24 statement that social media \u201cgiants\u201d are \u201csilencing millions of people.\u201d Such allegations \u2014 along with assertions that the news media and special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation are arrayed against him \u2014 have been a chief Trump talking point meant to appeal to his base.</p><p>Trump\u2019s re-election campaign texted the president\u2019s tweets to supporters, writing as part of an end-of-month fundraising push that \u201cThe FAKE NEWS machine is completely out of control.\u201d</p><p>Google issued a statement saying its searches are designed to give users relevant answers. \u201cSearch is not used to set a political agenda and we don\u2019t bias our results toward any political ideology,\u201d the statement said. Twitter has said that any allegations of anti-conservative bias are unfounded.</p><p>Facebook declined to comment on Trump\u2019s statements but pointed to actions it has taken in recent years to guard against bias in its feeds, including hiring a retired Republican senator to perform an internal review.</p><p>Business impact</p><p>Tech companies\u2019 reaction to claims of political bias shows that the accusations like Trump\u2019s \u201chave a significant impact on their business,\u201d said Chris Calabrese, vice president for policy at Washington-based think tank Center for Democracy &amp; Technology.</p><p>There\u2019s little evidence, however, backing up the president\u2019s complaint, Calabrese said, meaning it would be difficult to tackle through legal or regulatory changes.</p><p>\u201cIt would be really hard to see how that happens without some kind of evidence-based understanding of what\u2019s actually happening,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just hard to know what\u2019s really being contemplated here.\u201d</p><p>Trump\u2019s threats drew a strong rebuke from free-speech advocates.</p><p>\u201cThere are lots of things that get published that political candidates, businessmen and people on the street don\u2019t like,\u201d said Lucy Dalglish, dean of the journalism school at the University of Maryland. \u201cBut you don\u2019t get to ban speech because you don\u2019t like what was said or published.\u201d</p><p>Freedom Partners, a conservative group affiliated with billionaire Charles Koch that has taken issue with some of Trump\u2019s policies, called any attempt to regulate search engines \u201ca dangerous precedent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegulating the results of Google or other tech companies is a reckless idea that would undermine essential elements of free speech,\u201d Jim Fellinger, a spokesman, said in a statement.</p><p>Google\u2019s rankings have long angered media companies, not for political bias but for the revenue that the search company gets from news publishers\u2019 work and concerns about the promotion of controversial outlets at the expense of those doing careful reporting and breaking original stories. Rupert Murdoch, who controls, among other news organizations, The Wall Street Journal, has called on Facebook to pay publishers fees to carry the news that its users post and share online.</p><p>Google News rankings have sometimes highlighted unconfirmed and erroneous reports in the early minutes of tragedies when there\u2019s little information to fill its search results. After the Oct. 1, 2017, Las Vegas shooting, for instance, several accounts seemed to coordinate an effort to smear a man misidentified as the killer, with false claims about his political ties.</p><p>Google since has tightened requirements for inclusion in news rankings, blocking outlets that \u201cconceal their country of origin\u201d and relying more on authoritative sources, although the moves have led to charges of censorship from less established outlets. Google currently says it ranks news based on \u201cfreshness\u201d and \u201cdiversity\u201d of the stories. Trump-favored outlets such as Fox News routinely appear in results.</p><p>\u2018Shadow banning\u2019</p><p>Twitter has addressed concerns over \u201cshadow banning,\u201d or deliberately making someone\u2019s content undiscovered to everyone except the person who posted it, writing in a blog post last month that Twitter does not use those tactics.</p><p>\u201cOur purpose is to serve the conversation, not to make value judgment on personal beliefs,\u201d Nick Pickles, Twitter\u2019s global lead for public policy strategy, said in last month\u2019s congressional hearing.</p><p>Lastmonth, Twitter limited the functionality of a far-right commentator Alex Jones after he tweeted a link to a video that violated company policies against abusive behavior.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">OCREG-74AD3E3C79A5114FE0530100007FC1FE</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">OCREG2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T5N-7D21-JBK9-9156-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">152786</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1270\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Orange County Register All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Orange County Register (California)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 2, 2018 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>CC0002JIM</classCode><className>ALPHABET INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

A party that once stood for free trade has a president who loves tariffs. A party that championed free enterprise has a president out to punish companies he doesn't like. A party that stood for the rule of law has a president who attacks his own Justice Department.</p><p>And now this. A party that has long preached limited government, free expression and deregulation now has an administration pondering an  investigation of social media intended to justify a new wave of regulations.</p><p>Without question, social media companies such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube as well as Google, the web's dominant search engine, have had an almost unimaginable impact on politics and culture.</p><p>Facebook is being used as a propaganda vehicle for both sides in a Libyan civil war and has been accused of aiding the cause of ethnic cleansing in Myanmar, formerly Burma. Closer to home, it was used by the Russian government to spread misinformation leading up to the 2016 presidential election.</p><p>Twitter has long been the social media weapon of choice for conspiracy theorists such as Alex Jones. Jones is a peddler of lies, most notably that the school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012 was a hoax. He also likes to wrap himself in constitutionalism, arguing  his First Amendment right to peddle sickening fantasies requires tech companies to provide an audience.</p><p>One by one, social media companies have come to the conclusion that they have no obligation to amplify his voice and that, as a matter of pure self-interest, they should not. On Thursday, Twitter became the last major company to ban or greatly limit him from its platform.</p><p>Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced last week that he would convene a meeting with states to discuss ways that social media companies stifle free expression. This comes after some Republican members of Congress and the president complained that tech companies were stifling conservative voices.</p><p>We can think of nothing more repulsive to the values of the Constitution, or antithetical to Republican beliefs, than a government inquiry into the role of media in disseminating speech.</p><p>Do social media companies stifle some legitimate speech? Almost certainly. But if people have a beef with that, they should take it up with the various companies.</p><p>What they will find is that such tech companies restrict speech in a limited number of instances to protect the quality of their product, and thus to make more money.

Great to have you with us. I'm John Vause.</p><p>The first hour of NEWSROOM L.A. starts right now.</p><p>We begin with disturbing new details about the police response to the massacre at a Florida high school last week. The Broward County sheriff says an armed deputy never went inside the building, but waited outside. The deputy has since resigned.</p><p>Sheriff Scott Israel described his reaction to seeing the incident on security video.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCOTT ISRAEL, BROWARD COUNTY SHERIFF: Devastated, sick to my stomach -- there are no words. I mean these families lost their children. We lost coaches. I've been to the funerals. I've been to the homes where they sit and shiver. I've been to the vigils. It's just -- there are no words.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: That news comes as <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>doubles down on arming teachers as one way to prevent school shootings. He also supports tougher background checks and raising the legal age for buying a semiautomatic rifle from 18 to 21. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP, </nameText></person>PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think a concealed permit for having teachers, and letting people know that there are people in the building with a gun.</p><p>You won't have, in my opinion you won't have these shootings because these people are cowards. They're not going to walk into a school if 20 percent of the teachers have guns. It may be 10 percent or maybe 40 percent.</p><p>And what I'd recommend doing is the people that do carry, we give them a bonus. We give them a little bit of a bonus. So practically for free you have now made the school into a hardened target.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: Well, joining me here now in Los Angeles, CNN political commentator Joe Trippi and KABC talk radio host John Phillips. Good to have you both here. Welcome.</p><p>JOE TRIPPI, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Good to be with you.</p><p>VAUSE: You're welcome.</p><p>Ok. So reading and writing and rifles, I guess is where it's going. But John -- seriously, in a public school system where teachers don't have enough textbooks, they don't have enough pens or pencils or basic supplies. The federal government will suddenly find what -- close to a billion dollars I think they want to spend to arm a million or so teachers and they don't even want it for the most part?</p><p>JOHN PHILLIPS, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well the fact of the matter is it's unfortunate, but the reality of the situation is that a lot of soft targets in today's day and age are going to have to become hard targets. We saw this happen at airports where you have pilots who can now go through very extensive training and carry a gun on planes. They can also carry it with them through the airplane terminal. I think that's something that we certainly should look at for schools and other soft targets.</p><p>We had a situation here, I think it was yesterday or two days ago at a high school in Whittier, where there was a threat made against a school and you had the guard there who was unarmed who leapt into duty and did everything that he was supposed to do. And fortunately that was thwarted.</p><p>As we saw in Florida, sometimes things don't work like a Swiss clock. You had the FBI missed the obvious signs. You had local police missing obvious signs. You had the school security guard who was there who didn't do what he was supposed to do. Sometimes it can be your last line of defense in an unfortunate situation such as this.</p><p>VAUSE: Joe -- before you respond, the President obviously likes this idea. The NRA really loves this idea. But that seems that's it. Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SAMUEL ZEIF, STUDENT, STONEMAN DOUGLAS HIGH SCHOOL: To arm -- to arm any teacher. They're there to teach.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We don't need to put guns in the hands of teachers.</p><p>ISRAEL: I don't believe teachers should be armed. I believe teachers should teach.</p><p>SENATOR MARCO RUBIO (R), FLORIDA: The notion that my kids are going to school with teachers that are armed with a weapon is not something that, quite frankly, I'm comfortable with.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: And Joe -- there could be evidence that some teachers want it, but for the most part --</p><p>TRIPPI: Yes. No, no. Teachers don't want it. Senator Rubio, the senator of Florida, you know, \"Little Rubio\", I guess --</p><p>VAUSE: Little Marco.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TRIPPI: -- apparently the President, yes Little Marco. Excuse me -- you know, doesn't want them. I mean it just doesn't make a whole lot of sense, the billion dollars that it would take.</p><p>And, again the teachers don't want them. And they are there to teach. So I think this is just a non-starter. I don't think this is going to go anywhere.</p><p>[00:04:58] VAUSE: And John -- you know, at the same time, the President wants to arm the teachers or some of the teachers, and he's opposed to active shooter drills because he doesn't want to give, you know, the children the negative news that there could be shooters that, you know, one day will be in the school.</p><p>PHILLIPS: Well, we're going to have to rethink the way we handle security not just at schools, but at shopping malls, at we certainly have at baseball stadiums, sporting stadiums. I mean you can't go to a baseball game now -- major league baseball without going through a metal detector.</p><p>It's a sad reality but in a free society where you have people who are able to do these sorts of things you have to take every precaution you can to make sure the tragedy that we saw doesn't happen again.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TRIPPI: I actually think the most significant thing was the President's willingness to move the age to 21. I mean that is some movement, at least, in the right direction, I think, from him. VAUSE: And with that -- that move is not supported by the NRA.</p><p>TRIPPI: Right.</p><p>VAUSE: But, you know, you said this is progress, and <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>believes that he could probably win over the NRA on this measure. This is what he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I don't think I'll be going up against them. I really think the NRA wants to do what's right. I mean they're very close to me. I'm very close to them. They're very, very great people. They love this country. They're patriots. The NRA wants to do the right thing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: Joe -- in recent memory, can you recall the NRA ever supporting a measure which would restrict the access to guns in this country as opposed to making it easier?</p><p>TRIPPI: No, they never have. But I do think this is something the President -- I agree with him. I think he can do this.</p><p>He has a real ability now to lead, I mean to actually take some of the people that have supported him, that will do -- you know, follow him even sort of against ideas that they didn't like before. He can move. He's moved the party. He's moved them in the wrong direction.</p><p>VAUSE: He can have a Nixon to China moment.</p><p>TRIPPI: Yes. And I think this is when he could actually make significant progress on just moving that age would be, you know, look, I don't think it's enough, but for the President to move that way is something --</p><p>VAUSE: It would break the deadlock that we've seen for the last 20 years.</p><p>TRIPPI: Yes.</p><p>VAUSE: Ok. The NRA came out, all guns blazing -- forgive the, you know, me for saying that. This is on Thursday, the first public response to the school shooting in Florida.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WAYNE LAPIERRE, CEO, NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION: As we've learned in recent months even the FBI is not free of its own corruption and its own unethical agents. Look, and I know you probably all share this sentiment, and I get people telling me from coast-to-coast, and they kind of shake their heads when they say it to me.</p><p>I can understand a few bad apples in their organization as large as the FBI. But what's hard to understand is why no one at the FBI stood up and called BS on its rogue leadership. (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: John, this is an organization which the FBI is reportedly investigating for receiving millions of dollars of money from Russia which was then funneled to the Trump campaign you know. And what Wayne LaPierre was saying there, it sounded like it was out of the first chapter of <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>play book.</p><p>PHILLIPS: Well, I mean in this particular case, in the Florida shooting the FBI certainly dropped the ball. I mean we've heard that admitted by the FBI itself and by a lot of people who used to work in that organization who consider themselves to be big supporters of them.</p><p>But to go back to what the President's suggestion in gun control, I think that the NRA is going to have to get on board with that because the President will be able to cobble together the votes.</p><p>Not only is that good for a lot of Republicans who are running in purple states or blue states, it's good for a lot of Democrats who are representing red states who are up for election this time, including ten of them in states that Trump won.</p><p>If the Democrats take a strident position on gun control, and force people like Heidi Heitkamp and Joe Manchin to sign on to that, it's political suicide for them. What the president could do (AUDIO GAP) olive branch to them and get some sort of consensus to put a majority together.</p><p>VAUSE: Joe -- I just want to ask you what Wayne LaPierre was saying. I mean, this attack on the FBI -- I mean, it sounded dangerous in a way.</p><p>TRIPPI: Yes. No, this is something that I think is dangerous. Again, it's out of the Trump playbook. It's trying to distract from others to answer the push off the FBI. And destroy the credibility of the FBI and of the Mueller investigation.</p><p>And this is a group that may very well be under investigation, like many people around Trump. So, again, is out of that playbook. It's not a big surprise that he would say this. But in the end I think it's very, very dangerous to where the country's headed right now.</p><p>VAUSE: I was surprised that he actually took it that far.</p><p>Ok, we're almost out of time. So do you remember when Paul Manafort actually, you know, proudly told everyone that he wasn't getting paid to be <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>campaign manager -- or chairman, rather? Not so because there's this new indictment from Robert Mueller the special counsel in the Russia investigation. And it shows that along with his business partner Rick Gates, Manafort was being paid before, during and after the election.</p><p>[00:10:06] But here's the real substance of the new indictment. Prosecutors described a scheme in which the two long-time business partners allegedly laundered $30 million failed to pay taxes for almost ten years, and used real estate they own to fraudulently secure more than $20 million in loans.</p><p>John -- Paul Manafort's lawyer says he's innocent, but this is now all being seen as Mueller upping the pressure on Gates (INAUDIBLE) to then turn on Manafort and then ultimately Manafort to turn on Trump.</p><p>PHILLIPS: Yes. Still nothing to do with Russian collusion, more of the same -- similar charges to what they charged Manafort with the first time. I don't think a lot of people are surprised that Manafort didn't fill out the right forms or pay his taxes and has vulnerabilities there. But it doesn't go to the heart of what he's supposed to be investigating.</p><p>VAUSE: But Joe -- if you look at this -- so many charges -- I mean Manafort is what -- 70 years old.</p><p>TRIPPI: Yes. He's going to spend the rest of his life in prison if he's --</p><p>VAUSE: If he's guilty of those.</p><p>TRIPPI: Yes. There's a guilty verdict there.</p><p>Look, I think this is like -- it is a bunch of stuff about Russia right now. And Manafort and Gates may have deep insights into that that may implicate the President or people around him -- certainly his relatives.</p><p>And so I don't think -- I think to, again, I think this sort of repetition that there's no collusion, there's no evidence of collusion, you know, I'm prepared to sit back with what's coming out.</p><p>VAUSE: See what happens.</p><p>TRIPPI: And still wait and see what happens there before I want to proclaim that.</p><p>VAUSE: And obviously, if nothing else, Mueller is playing hardball.</p><p>Joe and John -- good to see you both. Thank you.</p><p>TRIPPI: Good to be with you.</p><p>VAUSE: Well, now for the segment that we call \"Where in the world are the President's children?\" <person><nameText>Donald Trump Jr. </nameText></person>will be speaking in just a few hours from now at a business summit in India. Organizers are calling this speech a fireside chat, very FDR. He's also dining with prospective business partners who reportedly shelled out nearly $40,000 in a booking fee that would secured them dinner and a conversation, and maybe a $1.6 million luxury Trump-branded apartment. All of this raising ethical concerns.</p><p>Meantime, first daughter, Ivanka will soon touch down in South Korea where she will represent the U.S. at the closing ceremony of the Olympic Games. And she will meet with the South Korean preside Moon Jae-In. CNN's Paula Hancocks is following Ivanka's trip. She is live at this hour in Pyeongchang. So Paula, cast your mind back to U.S. Vice President Mike Pence. He gave the North Koreans the cold shoulder at the opening ceremony.</p><p>Are there any plans maybe for these two delegations to meet this time around at the closing ceremony?</p><p>PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well John -- what we're hearing at this point from the South Korean side is that they're not going to try and facilitate a meeting between <person><nameText>Ivanka Trump </nameText></person>and the North Korean delegation.</p><p>Now, one man I should mention in that North Korean delegation was the former head of the reconnaissance bureau. He is widely believed to be behind a couple of attacks that North Korea has been blamed for against the South Koreans, the Yeonpyeong Island shelling which killed four people, the sinking of the Cheonan warship which killed 46 sailors.</p><p>So what we are expecting is that when Kim Yong-chol arrives here we are expecting some protests potentially as early as Saturday outside the Blue House. Not everybody is going to be welcoming him.</p><p>And certainly it's not necessarily the charm offensive that was touted just a couple of weeks ago at the opening ceremony with Kim Jong-un's sister when you bring a man that is heavily-sanctioned by the United States and South Korea, and many South Koreans blame for attacks on their country -- John.</p><p>VAUSE: Yes, it does seem to be a very different vibe in many ways. But there will be comparisons made though, between <person><nameText>Ivanka Trump's </nameText></person>visit to South Korea and also the visit by Kim Jong-un's sister, which, you know, she got that rock star welcome and, you know headlines all around the world.</p><p>HANCOCKS: Well, absolutely. They're both women who are related to the man in power in their respective countries. And certainly there's going to be some similarities that South Korean media, for one, is going to be focusing on.</p><p>But the thing is it's very unlikely according to some experts that there would be any kind of similarities beyond that. Whether or not there's going to be a similarity between <person><nameText>Ivanka Trump </nameText></person>and the U.S. Vice President Mike Pence is something they'll be looking out for. Will <person><nameText>Ivanka Trump </nameText></person>stand for the joint North/South Korean team as they walk in to the closing ceremony? Mr. Pence did not at the opening ceremony and did draw some criticism here in South Korea.</p><p>But he has defended that in the past day or so, also saying that the U.S.A. doesn't stand with murderous dictatorships, we stand up to murderous dictatorships suggesting Ivanka will stay seated as well -- John.</p><p>[00:15:00] VAUSE: Well, the intrigue continues; a lot to look for. Paula -- thank you. We appreciate it. Still to come here -- he is a survivor of the Florida high school shooting. He is not a paid actor, but yet that conspiracy theory went viral in a video which managed to slip through the net of the social networks. How did it happen? And what are the implications?</p><p>VAUSE: Australia's deputy prime minister is stepping down from his job after acknowledging an affair with a former staffer. Barnaby Joyce also announced he will resign as leader of the national party.</p><p>Earlier this month Joyce admitted he had an affair with a former staffer. They'd been living together, expecting a child. The resignation comes as the Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is in the United States. Joyce says he will continue to serve as a member of parliament.</p><p>YouTube has apologized after it was used as a platform to spread conspiracy theories about the Florida school shooting. But there's one video in particular which seems to have taken the tech giant by surprise. It claims David Hogg, an outspoken student leader of the Never Again Movement, was in fact, a paid actor. This is just simply not true.</p><p>Even so, it quickly rose tot he top trending spot before being removed for violating YouTube's policy on harassment and bullying. This effort to smear the students and survivors of the Stoneman Douglas School shooting began on Monday with far right Web sites posting a vile mix of rumor, innuendo and outright lies.</p><p>But the YouTube video about Hogg raises new concerns about social networks and their ability to stop the spread of fake news.</p><p>For more, CNN's Hadas Gold is with us from Washington. Hadas -- good to see you.</p><p>HADAS GOLD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hi -- John. Great to be with you.</p><p>VAUSE: Ok. Let's start with the statement to CNN from YouTube. \"This video should never have appeared in trending because the video contained footage from an authoritative new source, our system misclassified it.\" That new source it's talking about, it came from the CBS station here in Los Angeles. It was an older interview with David. And in some ways this seems to highlight the need to humanize the human judgment as opposed to, you know, a computer's algorithms to sort out what is fake is what is not.</p><p>GOLD: That is the exact issue that we have here in that they're using computerized algorithms to do the work that maybe humans should be doing. YouTube doesn't have a group of people who are sitting around and checking the trending bars and checking the search results for any sort of possible conspiracy theories that are arising.</p><p>They are more reactive if things give flak to them, if it starts become part of the news. Then they take it down. But this incident is raising a lot of questions now for how they should react to this in the future and maybe there should be a sort of SWAT team of humans who, when there's a big news event, such as this horrific shooting, they're just keeping an eye on it because for a while, and I was testing this out, if you typed in David Hogg's name into YouTube's search bar, let's say you were looking for an interview he did, the first few results were these conspiracy videos.</p><p>[00:20:12] And that's something that these social media and Internet platforms are coming ahead to right now because they're starting to also get the eyes of government regulators looking at them and saying, maybe we should start getting more involved in this process.</p><p>VAUSE: Yes. That's sort of been the constant sort of threat I guess hanging over all of these big tech companies.</p><p>The \"New York Times\" actually looked closely at how all of this happened. Here's part of their reporting. \"Unlike the other unhinged clips that have garnered significant attention on YouTube in the recent past, the video of the Parkland survivor originated with neither a conspiracy, orientated media organization like Info Wars, nor one of the popular YouTubers that catered to far right subcultures and fringe political factions. Instead it was posted to the infrequently updated account run by Mike M.\"</p><p>I guess which meant it did no raise any red flags and was, I guess, almost like a back door into the YouTube system.</p><p>GOLD: Exactly. I mean people are so used to hearing that these sites like an Info Wars or Gateway Pundits are the source of some of these videos and these conspiracy theories. But as we've known now for years, anybody's video -- anybody can sort of become famous or trending on any of these platforms.</p><p>And that's clearly what happened here. And so it might not have raised some red flags in the traditional sense but, you know, if one person makes a video after a big news event and kind of captures really quickly what's going on, as this person clearly did with a student who became very well-known, then you reach this sort of interesting balance that these platforms need to strike between people who are expressing themselves on these platforms, which is obviously a big part of these platform's successes, how it's open to everybody.</p><p>But then also making sure that the truth is still going out there and maybe as people are discussing this, people are discussing there should be these human teams that maybe don't have to delete the entire video, but just make sure that it's not the top of trending, that it's not the top result in a search result so that people, when they're searching just for legitimate information, they're actually finding it.</p><p>VAUSE: And the thing about this video, it wasn't designed to game the system, and have worked those algorithms on YouTube because that has often been the case in the past. This one video it has this meteoric rise because it was being driven by outside influence. They really had no control over this. This was a real viral video. GOLD: It was a real viral video and this is the problem, there's just so many videos on these sites. And it is understandable that for these platforms, you know, how to really control this. And this is what they say, that they're working on it, that they know that there's more work to do and that they simply can't -- they don't have the manpower right now to control or to keep an eye on any sort of news event that happens all over the world.</p><p>But this continues to be a PR problem because this isn't the first time we've seen this happen on these platforms.</p><p>VAUSE: Yes. We saw this back in Sandy Hook. There is this great big conspiracy theory put out that, you know, it was basically -- it was all staged so the government could crack down on, you know, people who owned guns and that kind of stuff.</p><p>And the big social networks, they have promised to try and stop, you know, the spread of these conspiracy theories. But at the end of the day there remains a tension between cracking down on fake news content and it's also a business at the same time which has a business model of making money from getting people to watch. And people watch this kind of stuff.</p><p>GOLD: That's exactly right. And I mean, if you look at the viewership numbers on some of these videos, there are hundreds of thousands of viewers. And if you put an ad onto that, that's how these platforms make their money.</p><p>But this is something that people are clearly asking for. And at some point I think tech platforms have said themselves that their whole business model is really based off of the trust of the users, that users trust them to get them good information. And if they start losing that trust then they start losing their business.</p><p>VAUSE: Yes. Yes, exactly because this has been -- this has been going on, not just this, we saw it, you know, in the 2016 election, it continues to go on. And, you know, some would say we really need to get a handle on it relatively soon because the clock is ticking on all of this.</p><p>But Hadas -- good to see you. Thanks so much.</p><p>GOLD: Thanks for having me.</p><p>VAUSE: Well the U.N. Security Council is expected to vote Friday on a 30-day ceasefire for Syria's brutal civil war. It's set to meet at 11:00 a.m., New York time. Syria's main ally Russia opposes that measure, but the Swedish ambassador said a vote will happen if the language is worked out.</p><p>All this comes amid the intense bombardment of the rebel-held enclave of eastern Ghouta near Damascus. The Syrian military briefly stopped dropping bombs this week and instead dropped leaflets warning residents to leave, warning the Syrian army surrounds the area.</p><p>Images of the leaflets were posted on social media. The leaflets blame insurgents for the deaths of thousands of women and children. But activists and human rights groups say Russian and Syrian warplanes are killing civilians almost at will it seems.</p><p>[00:25:00] And in this video, one activist documents the destruction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NOUR ADAM, SYRIAN ACTIVIST: Since 24 hours until this moment there are like more than 100 people killed by the Assad government and the Russia warplanes. But they hit every building in every town and every village in eastern Ghouta.</p><p>Right now the warplanes in the sky in Ghouta, you can hear the sound of the warplanes hit the building and village in a single shot.</p><p>Today, like they are like more than 24 people here, more than 20 people killed the Russian warplanes in Duma City (ph). And worst of that, the war planes target the hospitals and make many hospitals out of service, completely out of service.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: That was Syrian activist Nour Adam and the nightmare he was describing is life in eastern Ghouta.</p><p>The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with U.S. Senators and House members that are staying in Jerusalem. He thanked them for American support. But it's what he did not talk about that's getting a lot of attention.</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu's administration is facing five graft investigations and a long-time top confidant agreed earlier this week to turn state's witness.</p><p>On Facebook, Netanyahu is trying to portray a business as usual demeanor. He posted on Thursday \"I continue and will continue to lead the state of Israel with responsibility, with judiciousness, and with dedication.</p><p>Well, up next here, Venezuelans desperate for food, standing in line for handouts and going to bed and waking up hungry, anyway. Is there a way out of this poverty crisis?</p><p>(HEADLINES)</p><p>JOHN VAUSE, CNN ANCHOR: In Venezuela, they call it the Maduro diet, eating less and skipping meals and with that Venezuelans are losing a lot of weight. On average, 11 kilos per person last year, according to a survey by three universities.</p><p>It seems most just can't afford to buy enough food. The poverty rate is now close to 90 percent. Among those living in poverty, more than 61 percent are living in extreme poverty. Almost half the country receives government assistance, mostly for food. Marianella Herrera-Cuenca is one of the authors of that study and she joins us now from Caracas.</p><p>Thank you for being with us. If you look at this study, in every category, these numbers are worse than the previous year.</p><p>Were you expecting that result from this survey, did you think it would be as bad as it is?</p><p>MARIANELLA HERRERA-CUENCA, CENTRAL UNIVERSITY OF VENEZUELA: Yes. We expected (INAUDIBLE) because there has been no intervention in the right direction. So we've known public policies that will address the situation. It is expected that this would only be worsening every day unfortunately.</p><p>VAUSE: Because the last time there are any official government data on this, it was what, back in 2015 and then the poverty rate was around 30 percent, 33 percent. Since then the government has published nothing on the poverty rate and it has actually done nothing about the situation with malnutrition in the country?</p><p>HERRERA-CUENCA: Yes, the only thing the government has provided is a program called CLAB (ph). But (INAUDIBLE) it doesn't address nutrition necessities for the population.</p><p>So what you get is a box with some goods that are insufficient for feeding a family. And they receive this like every three or four weeks, a month, every two months. So we don't know whether they will receive the box or not. So that is not a solution.</p><p>VAUSE: It seems the biggest factor driving, you know, this problem, is essentially the inflation rate, which it's hyperinflation running out of control.</p><p>HERRERA-CUENCA: Yes, absolutely. People have been losing the power for acquiring the goods. And we have seen skyrocketing levels of food insecurity; 80 percent of households in Venezuela are categorized as food insecure. That means that they cannot buy the foods they need to feed their families.</p><p>VAUSE: And it just seems that all the of the policies which have been put in place by Maduro, refusing to import goods into the country, putting price controls on goods as well, that has just exacerbated what was already a pretty bad circumstance.</p><p>HERRERA-CUENCA: Absolutely, controls have been doing worse for this situation because it doesn't allow free market to grow. And then you have to go into our very, very tedious process for acquiring the foreign money, the U.S. dollars, for buying international markets, things such as seeds for (INAUDIBLE) production.</p><p>Producers, they are not having the seeds or other things they need to increase their productions of food. So that's also a limitation at the moment.</p><p>VAUSE: You know what is remarkable and really tragic and sad, too, is that this is a country which once had the most prosperous economy in South America.</p><p>It has, you know, incredible reserves of oil as well. It should be a wealthy country. But people are being what forced to forage through garbage just to get enough to eat?</p><p>HERRERA-CUENCA: Yes, absolutely. I, myself, grew up in a very different country. My country used to be a producer of wine, a very successful wine with everything on it. And now people are very limited. You can see people looking into the garbage on the streets for food. And that's a drama.</p><p>VAUSE: OK. Marianella, we'll leave it there. But what you've done is important work. It's three universities. It's a very wide-ranging survey, it's probably the most comprehensive a survey of the actual situation inside Venezuelan when it comes to poverty and malnutrition that you have.</p><p>And it's important to continue this work. So thank you.</p><p>HERRERA-CUENCA: Thank you very much.</p><p>VAUSE: OK, short break here. When we come back, they say they're just being who they are but they're making a global impression. Up next, meet --</p><p>[00:35:00]</p><p>VAUSE: -- two Olympians pushing the culture of sport in the right direction.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>VAUSE: In Egypt, an amazing and heartwarming end to what was a terrifying ordeal at times. A police officer looked up just in time to see a little boy dangling from the third floor.</p><p>The boy was at a party, accidentally fell through a window and he was there just long enough for the officer and a colleague to grab a piece of fabric to try and catch him, to break his fall.</p><p>Instead, the 5-year-old boy landed in the officer's arms and, amazingly, he was not hurt. The little boy is now back with his mom, seems pretty happy and doing well.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>VAUSE: Two members of Team USA are making history at the PyeongChang Winter Olympics, not just for their athletic accomplishments but for opening up about their personal lives.

She says the games give athletes an unparalled platform with a rich history of cultural milestones.</p><p>CHRISTINE BRENNAN, CNN SPORTS ANALYST: In 1968 you had the Black Power salute and now we have Adam and Gus, openly gay athletes, talking about their lives; 50 years from now, people will be looking back and talking about Adam and Gus.</p><p>RIPLEY (voice-over): Brennan remembers a time not too long ago when gay Olympians had little choice but to live secret lives.</p><p>BRENNAN: Several decades ago, athletes just could never have risked coming out. They would have lost everything, sponsorship, what have you. Think of Brian Boitano and the skating shows, all that he had that came out of those Olympic Games --</p><p>[00:40:00]</p><p>BRENNAN: -- all gone if he had come out.</p><p>RIPLEY (voice-over): Brian Boitano won figure skating gold in 1988. He waited 26 years to come out in 2014. Boitano was a member of former President Obama's delegation at the Winter Games in Sochi.</p><p>BRIAN BOITANO, OLYMPIAN: I felt great about supporting the president's message, because it was -- is such a powerful statement as a powerful way to go into Sochi and it was a powerful time.</p><p>The focus on sexuality now, it's happening because it needs to happen to promote open-mindedness from, you know, the public and more people. And once that happens, then hopefully people won't have to talk about sexuality as much anymore.</p><p>RIPLEY (voice-over): Today's out and proud Olympians are amplifying their voices on social media.</p><p>KENWORTHY: Adam and I may be the first U.S. openly gay Winter Olympians but we're definitely not going to be the last.</p><p>RIPLEY (voice-over): Kenworthy says many athletes are still hiding in the closet.

Biden and his family's interactions with Ukraine.</p><p>Twitter decided to ban political ads outright.</p><p> The Trump campaign said Twitter's move is small potatoes.</p><p> \"Google, however, is a serious platform with very deep reach across the entire country,\" it said. \"In short, Google has made an extraordinarily poor decision which will lead to less-informed voters, lower voter engagement and voter suppression.\"</p><p> The campaign said the rule changes will hurt people who offer insight into issues they care about, a concept known as \"first-party data.\"</p><p> \"By doing this, voters are digitally raising their hand and saying, 'Please communicate with me,'\" the campaign said. \"This ensures they can be reached and informed as they have directly requested. Voters can also learn about ways to volunteer on campaigns, about key campaign events and fundraising efforts, and of course, about where and when to vote. Google is now arbitrarily saying this is not allowed.\"</p><p> The Trump campaign and its manager, Brad Parscale, frequently boast about their extensive digital operation and ability to ferret out voters, so their pushback is not surprising.</p><p> However, the campaign insisted the impacts will be far-reaching and hinder the 2020 Democratic primary, too.</p><p> \"Google should immediately reverse its decision in order to ensure they do not suppress voter turnout during both the Democrat primaries and the 2020 general election,\" it said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WTIMES-17778CDD5C6F6370</dc:identifier><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XKT-WG61-DXVP-V2KS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8176</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"652\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>27 November 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002LOB</classCode><className>DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Illegal?\" Trump said in his tweet, adding that \"96% of results on 'Trump News' are from National Left-Wing Media, very dangerous. Google &amp; others are suppressing voices of Conservatives and hiding information and news that is good.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That 96 percent figure probably comes from an              article I wrote at PJ Media about what happened when I plugged \"Trump\" into the search engine's \"News\" tab. Let me be clear: While suspicions about inherent biases being baked into the systems at Google and other tech platforms are certainly warranted, I do not believe that government regulations are the answer to that problem.</p><p>In my article, I reported that 96 of 100 results returned were from left-leaning news outlets. In fact, nearly one-fourth of the results (21) were from CNN. (To determine which sites were right- or left-leaning              , I used              a               chart              from former CBS               News               correspondent Sharyl                            Attkisson              .) I stressed in my report that my research was not scientific and that it included only a small sample size (100               results). I did, however,              link to a report              from a reputable online-traffic software company that studied 2,000               search results and found that left-leaning sites received far more hits on hot-button political issues than right-leaning sites.</p><p>The president, who likely saw a story on Lou Dobbs's Fox Business Network show about my piece, took that 96 percent figure and ran with it, calling for an investigation into the \"rigged\" search results and suggesting that the government might need to regulate big tech companies.</p><p>As a conservative who tends to be rather libertarian on tech issues, I beg to disagree. The government has no business regulating private companies for their political views, and it would set a dangerous precedent to do so in this case. Government regulation would only make things worse. The Internet would be less free, and fewer voices would be allowed to have a say.</p><p>That said, I'm sympathetic to fears that conservative voices will be silenced. Media reports, including one by Chris Cillizza at CNN, have been quick to lump Trump's tweets - and by association my article - into the category of an Alex Jones-style conspiracy theory, without putting it into context. Many of the media outlets chafed at being branded as a left-leaning site.</p><p>Here's a dirty little secret of the news business: No media outlet is unbiased. Even if a site isn't blatantly partisan, its biases come out in story choices and headlines that lead readers to certain positions, encouraging them to care about the things the media outlet thinks are important.</p><p>There have been plenty of credible reports over the past two years claiming anti-conservative bias at the Big Three Internet platforms, including the 2016 revelation that Facebook had routinely suppressed conservative outlets in the network's \"trending\" news section. Further, when Alphabet-owned  YouTube pulls down and demonetizes mainstream conservative content from sites such as PragerU, it certainly gives the impression that the company has its thumb on the scale.</p><p>Many, including my PJ Media colleague Roger L. Simon, have suggested that there should be an investigation into whether these behemoth tech companies are violating antitrust laws. The president seems to share that sentiment, as does his economic adviser Larry Kudlow, who said Tuesday that the White House is \"taking a look\" at regulating Google.</p><p>There is no easy answer to this problem. But perhaps a better approach would be for consumers to refuse to let big tech companies dictate what news they see. These companies - cocooned in their Silicon Valley bubble where tech leaders are, by and large, liberal - don't understand the flyover states and the people who live there. I'm not   optimistic that these companies are motivated to fix this problem on their own or change their hiring practices to include a balance of liberal and conservative voices. And they shouldn't have to.</p><p>Rather, users should be proactive in seeking sites and sources they trust. When you find a site you like, visit it regularly and turn off your ad blocker or pay for a subscription. It costs money to pay writers and run a website, and if you're not willing to subsidize organizations you like, they might not exist in the very near future, leaving all of us at the mercies of Silicon Valley algorithms.</p><p>I wrote in my article at PJ Media that these big tech companies have the power to influence elections and even the state of democracy itself. I stand by that statement. And while the president might have gone too far in calling for government intervention, I agree that Americans need to pay attention to this issue.</p><p>Paula Bolyard is supervising editorat PJ Media.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPOST-15bdaae2-abaa-11e8-8f4b-aee063e14538</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPOST2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T50-BXG1-JBFW-C1SN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8075</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"855\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Post</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12311\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Regional Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 30, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009ZGF</classCode><className>LIBERAL MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CYCH</classCode><className>LIBERALISM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000CYBP</classCode><className>CONSERVATISM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000969</classCode><className>INVESTIGATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001346</classCode><className>POLITICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000369</classCode><className>CONSPIRACY</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Q0FGMDkyQTE0NTI1NEUyNkE0NjUxM0E2OTBDQjQ0NUU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzZBMzM3QjFDOTcxNENCNzhBNTE0MzVGMzBBMzdERUY</classCode><className>Conspiracy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N813940MM</classCode><className>POLITICAL PARTIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001333</classCode><className>PLATFORMS &amp;
