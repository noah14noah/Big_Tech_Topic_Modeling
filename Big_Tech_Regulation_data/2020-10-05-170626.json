The analyst ultimately believes this is more noise versus the start of broader structural changes across the tech food chain and will likely result in business model tweaks and potential DOJ/FTC fines in a worst-case scenario rather than forced breakups of the underlying businesses. That said, Ives acknowledges that these potential DOJ probes could be an overhang on the stocks, but would encourage investors to focus on the fundamentals in the near-term as any probe would take many years to complete as witnessed first-hand with Microsoft (MSFT), which proved to be more noise than a structural jolt to its business model. Further, the analyst believes that Congress will investigate claims of anticompetitive behavior, but ultimately expects a \"no harm, no foul\" outcome on these FAANG names. |WEDB</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FLYCOM-346110974</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FLYCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WCN-CXG1-JCD8-M4VP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">295234</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"202\"/><timeReceived>7:28 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Comtex News Network, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 TheFlyOnTheWall.com</copyright><bodyText><p>This content is provided to LexisNexis by Comtex News Network, Inc.</p></bodyText><publicationName>Theflyonthewall.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33010\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 19, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The sudden economic shock resulting from the pandemic changed that quickly, with economists now expecting U.S. gross domestic product to drop by 4% to 7% this year, far worse than the 2.5% decline in 2009 and the worst falloff since 1946. That makes finding the best growth stocks to buy a vital part of portfolio construction as sustainable growth is harder than ever to find. With what looks to be a secular shift into tech stocks now underway, this list is chock-full of Silicon Valley names, which are generally better suited for survival going forward. Here are seven of the best <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/7-high-growth-stocks-that-cant-be-stopped\">growth stocks</url> to buy in 2020.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amazon.com (ticker: AMZN)</emphasis></p><p>Amazon.com has been one of the most successful growth investments in history; in the 2010s, shares gained around 1,200%. As the year began, CFRA analyst Tuna Amobi expected more of the same in 2020. Amazon investors should anticipate both e-commerce and cloud revenue growth to slow over time, but in the meantime, analysts are expecting another year of 20% revenue growth for Amazon -- outpacing many of its smaller tech peers and reiterating Amazon's undeniable staying power. CFRA had a \"buy\" rating and a $1,950 price target for <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/articles/pros-cons-to-buying-amazon-amzn-stock\">AMZN stock</url> to start the year. These are levels that the stock has easily breezed past, with shares now comfortably above the $3,000 mark. Recent reports that the company may be considering converting some Sears and J.C. Penney locations into fulfillment centers show the company is pressing its advantage in the pandemic. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook (FB)</emphasis></p><p>Despite a never-ending parade of negative headlines related to data abuse, political manipulation, content violations, regulatory crackdowns and antitrust risk, Facebook continues to deliver impressive growth numbers and outsized returns. In fact, 2019 was another huge year for Facebook, with the stock up 56%. Analysts expect earnings per share growth around 10% in 2020 even as the pandemic holds back ad revenue. Entering the year, CFRA analyst John Freeman noted that the biggest growth source for Facebook should come from better monetizing its users. CFRA began the year with a \"buy\" rating and a $233 price target for <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/articles/2017-03-24/10-reasons-facebook-inc-fb-stock-is-a-strong-buy\">FB stock</url>. Shares have not only reached that price but zoomed past it, nearing $266 per share in August. In order to combat the rise of TikTok, Facebook recently rolled out its own video app, Instagram Reels.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)</emphasis></p><p>Like \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/investing-in-faang-stocks-do-they-deserve-the-hype\">FAANG</url>\" peers Amazon and Facebook, CFRA's Freeman foresaw another big year for Alphabet in 2020. He cited the increasing profitability of Google Cloud as one of the biggest near-term growth drivers. Although the potential of Amazon Web Services rival Google Cloud may be kept in check due to the pandemic, revenue for that high-margin segment still surged in the second quarter, jumping 43% year over year to $3 billion. Although its core advertising business saw reduced demand last quarter, the rapid growth of YouTube has also been a strength as the demand for entertainment surges in quarantine times. Google's autonomous vehicle business Waymo could also be a major long-term growth driver for investors. For better or worse, the traditional Big Tech names remain some of the best growth stocks to buy in 2020. Based on analysts offering 12-month price targets for GOOGL in the last three months, the average price target is about $1,744.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fiverr International (FVRR)</emphasis></p><p>Transitioning to a bit of a riskier pick and certainly a much smaller company, the online freelance and contract working marketplace Fiverr is a natural beneficiary of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/articles/2020-05-12/3-trillion-stimulus-plan-dow-sheds-457-points\">current environment</url>. Worth more than $4 billion, FVRR is a volatile growth stock, but even after shares have more than quadrupled year to date, it still has greater potential to be a grand slam than, say, the FAANG stocks. Revenue grew by nearly 82% in the second quarter. And although it has been horrendous for millions of families and the wider economy, the nearly 17 million Americans that are now unemployed have dramatically spiked demand for Fiverr's gig platform. The online services marketplace, where gig authors, graphic designers, translators and others can hawk their skills, is not yet profitable, but Fiverr revised its 2020 revenue estimates higher on the heels of rapidly growing adoption.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Slack Technologies (WORK)</emphasis></p><p>Workplace messaging and productivity platform Slack Technologies has a <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/stocks-expanding-their-competitive-advantages\">business model</url> that Wall Street has come to love in recent years: It's a high gross margin, recurring revenue software business. It's taking losses in the short term, but as it grows its customer base, losses will shrink. Then the company will turn profitable as fixed costs more easily spread across a growing revenue base, with shareholders enjoying the margin expansion that comes with scalable software businesses. Large corporate customers, including IBM (<url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/ibm-international-business-machines-corp\">IBM</url>), are using Slack for communications across their entire workplaces. If Slack continually cements itself into workflows, the \"network effect\" will make its clients less likely to leave. Wall Street analysts expect revenue to jump by more than 36% this fiscal year.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Microsoft (MSFT)</emphasis></p><p>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is widely credited with pushing the software giant aggressively into the high-margin, high-growth cloud computing industry following more than a decade of stagnation under Steve Ballmer. \"We've seen two years' worth of digital transformation in two months,\" Nadella emphasized during MSFT's April earnings report, the first to encompass the pandemic. Although it might seem odd calling Microsoft one of the best growth stocks to buy given its status as one of the most valuable public companies in the world, even a portfolio of growth stocks needs to have its share of safer picks. The company pays a roughly 1% dividend, which isn't much to brag about but isn't bad for a $1.6 trillion company that saw top- and bottom-line growth of 13% and 7%, respectively, last quarter.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Activision Blizzard (ATVI)</emphasis></p><p>Last but not least, Activision Blizzard rounds out the list of growth stocks to buy for 2020. It's the largest publicly traded game publisher in the U.S., with a market capitalization around $63 billion, and its portfolio of titles has created an ecosystem of hooked <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/video-game-stocks-companies-thriving-despite-coronavirus-pandemic\">gamers</url> with more than 400 million players globally. Not only does the company make popular games like World of Warcraft, Overwatch, Diablo and Candy Crush, but its Call of Duty franchise has been wildly popular for years. Activision itself, the division under which Call of Duty is published, has recently seen monthly active users skyrocket from 37 million to 125 million year over year. Its most recent earnings report was far better than expected, sending ATVI shares back toward all-time highs.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The best growth stocks to buy this year:</emphasis></p><p>-- Amazon.com (<url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/amzn-amazoncom-inc\">AMZN</url>)</p><p>-- Facebook (<url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/fb-facebook-inc-ordinary-shares-class-a\">FB</url>)</p><p>-- Alphabet (<url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/goog-alphabet-inc-ordinary-shares-class-c\">GOOG</url>, <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/googl-alphabet-inc-ordinary-shares-class-a\">GOOGL</url>)</p><p>-- Fiverr International (<url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/fvrr-fiverr-international-ltd\">FVRR</url>)</p><p>-- Slack Technologies (<url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/work-slack-technologies-inc-ordinary-shares-class-a\">WORK</url>)</p><p>-- Microsoft (<url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/msft-microsoft-corp\">MSFT</url>)</p><p>-- Activision Blizzard (<url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/atvi-activision-blizzard-inc\">ATVI</url>)</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, (Getty Images)</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, (Getty Images)</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, (Getty Images)</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, (Getty Images)</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, (Igor Golovniov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, (Getty Images)</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, (Getty Images)</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, (Photo by Rich Polk/Getty Images for Activision)</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, (Getty Images)</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic><correction appended=\"true\"><correctionDescription><bodyText><p>Update 08/19/20: This story was published at an earlier date and has been updated with new information.</p></bodyText></correctionDescription><correctionStatusText>Correction Appended</correctionStatusText></correction></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USNCOM-190226investing.growthstocks</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USNCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X1M-KD51-JCKG-J4FH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">297647</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1172\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 U.S. News &amp;

Last year, he accurately predicted that Amazon would choose the Washington, DC area for one of its HQ2 locations, arguing that would clearly be the choice of CEO Jeff Bezos, who has a house nearby and owns the Washington Post.</p><p>On Monday, Galloway made roughly 19 predictions and recommendations about the tech industry in 2019, although not all of them were about tech stocks specifically. Here are his top predictions about tech stocks:</p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1. Amazon will surpass Apple as the world's most valuable public company.</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p>Galloway had previously predicted this would happen in 2018, but still thinks it will happen soon (the current standing is Apple at $838 billion and Amazon at $816 billion). Galloway argues that Amazon's Alexa has replaced the iPhone as the most transformative device in the history of modern business.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2. Amazon will spin out AWS.</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p>This is Galloway's big prediction for 2019 or 2020; he argues that Bezos will make the move pre-emptively to forestall the government from moving to break up or otherwise regulate the company itself. Making it easier, Galloway argues, is the fact that Amazon now has another cash cow business that can replace AWS as a means of subsidizing its retail platform -- the media division.</p><p>Once it happens, AWS will be one of the 10 most valuable companies in the world, according to Galloway, who predicts it could be valued anywhere from $70 billion to as much as $600 billion, depending on what comparable metrics you apply. \"Spins work; throughout the history of technology, they tend to be very positive for shareholders,\" Galloway notes.</p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3. Instagram should also be spun out of Facebook.</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p>With Facebook's stock plunge this year, Galloway notes that it's now trading at a forward multiple similar to that of Coke KO and P&amp;GPG, which are growing at just 6% a year vs. Facebook's 30% annual revenue growth. Despite Facebook being \"bad for humanity and bad for the planet,\" according to Galloway, he also calls the company \"likely the most undervalued stock in America.\" Spinning out Instagram would unlock value and create a company valued at anywhere from $110 billion to $470 billion.</p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">4. Europe will continue 'going gangster' on Big Tech.</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p>Galloway notes that Europe registers all the downside of Big Tech, including the weaponization of their elections, the anti-competitive behavior and avoidance of taxes, but only a fraction of the upside in terms of the jobs and wealth creation. As a result, we're seeing Europe levy fines against many big tech firms for anti-competitive practices and new revenue taxes being adopted.</p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">5. The Big Four will continue uncoupling from each other in terms of stock performance. </emphasis><br/><br/></p><p>While they've tended to have been grouped together by investors, the four tech giants' stock moves have now started to diverge. Significantly, Galloway notes that Apple has come out of the recent challenges to Big Tech significantly better off reputation-wise than the others as a result of its stance of not trading on customers' data, opportunistic as that stance may be.</p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">6. Amazon will soon become the fastest-growing health-care company in the world. </emphasis><br/><br/></p><p>Health care, with its high prices and customer dissatisfaction, is one of the industries most vulnerable to disruption, and tech companies are increasingly investing in both financial and human capital in the space. Galloway argues that of the Big Four, Amazon is best-positioned to profit here, particularly by selling health insurance, since it already has so much valuable data on its customers' habits.</p><p>\"They're very good at sitting on top of a large data set and deciding which businesses to be in and which to outsource,\" Galloway says. \"That's a perfect fulcrum for an entry into health care.\" In addition, Galloway notes that \"health care will demand extraordinary capital investments and losses in the short term -- Amazon has this as a core competency.\"</p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">7. Mark </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Zuckerberg can and should be fired as CEO by a resolute board, and Sheryl Sandberg should go, too. </emphasis><br/><br/></p><p>While many view Zuckerberg as un-fireable given his control over the voting shares of Facebook, Galloway argues that he can be removed by a board that's determined to hold him to account for decisions that have resulted in a significant loss in shareholder value this year. According to Galloway, board members could join together to fire Zuckerberg as CEO and kick him up to chairman. Zuckerberg could then, in turn, fire the entire board, but then think of the reaction from the public and from regulators to such a move.</p><p>\"I don't think Zuckerberg will burn his castle to save it,\" says Galloway. Likewise, Galloway says COO Sheryl Sandberg should be fired as well, noting that she \"failed to do her job and protect the commonwealth.\"</p><p>How many of Galloway's 2019 predictions will end up coming true? Time will tell, but his past record has been pretty good so far.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Alphabet are holdings in Jim Cramer's </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">. Want to be alerted before Jim Cramer buys or sells AMZN, FB, AAPL or GOOGL? </emphasis><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSC-14802917</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSC2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TX3-7R41-JCHV-V324-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">220623</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"910\"/><timeReceived>1:20 PM EDT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 TheStreet.com, Inc.

A growing number of antitrust experts say it's the sort of deal that should no longer be possible.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Google owns the world's leading search engine, it operates the largest video-hosting service in YouTube, and its popular web browser, email, map and meeting software is used by billions of people. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  But its financial heft -- the source of nearly all its enormous profits -- is advertising. And perhaps no day was more pivotal in transforming Google into a powerhouse across the entire digital advertising industry than April 13, 2007, when the company clinched a deal to buy DoubleClick for $3.1 billion.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  The deal turned out to be ''a total game changer, a crucial piece in the larger jigsaw puzzle Google put together,'' said Timothy Armstrong, a former Google executive who championed the acquisition.</p><p>  It has also turned out to be a classic example of why a growing number of antitrust experts say lawmakers need to broadly rethink how mergers are regulated when the buyer is a tech company with strong and growing market power.</p><p>Google's ad business is now a focus of wide-ranging investigations by the Justice Department and state attorneys general. The scrutiny includes whether the company choked off competitors, or shortchanged advertisers and publishers, and how it assembled its ad empire, including DoubleClick, an ad technology company and marketplace.</p><p>  The Justice Department is expected to file an antitrust suit against Google by the end of the month. The case is expected to concentrate on how Google uses its dominant search engine to harm rivals and consumers.</p><p>  An investigation by attorneys general from dozens of states, led by Texas, into Google's ad business may result in a separate suit. But the Justice Department wants to move quickly, and that meant leaving out the ad allegations. Its decision points to the challenge facing antitrust enforcement in a fast-moving, highly complex tech business: Investigations are difficult, long and backward looking.</p><p>  Instead, those experts say, the country needs a more pre-emptive approach, making it much more difficult for big tech corporations to buy other companies -- and perhaps forcing spinoffs if a past acquisition took out a nascent competitor or became a short cut to greater market power. In other words, changing the law so that Google would not have been able to buy DoubleClick.</p><p>  The Federal Trade Commission, which reviews many mergers, approved the DoubleClick deal in a 4-to-1 vote. William Kovacic cast one of the four assenting votes.</p><p>  ''If I knew in 2007 what I know now, I would have voted to challenge the DoubleClick acquisition,'' said Mr. Kovacic, now a law professor at George Washington University who is among the experts pushing for stronger merger oversight.</p><p>  In Senate testimony last week, Donald Harrison, Google's president of global partnerships and corporate development, described the DoubleClick deal and smaller ones in digital advertising as ''finding a piece of technology'' that the company then invested in and strengthened to accelerate innovation.</p><p>  Online ad prices, Mr. Harrison said, have fallen over the past decade, and it is a highly competitive marketplace.</p><p>  The Prize</p><p>DoubleClick had a valuable asset: its business relationships and ad-serving technology used by thousands of publishers online.</p><p>  In 2007, Google was a tenth of the size it is today. Still, it was a surging company and a heavyweight in search and in search advertising, with $16.6 billion in revenue. And it was headed for the business where DoubleClick made its living -- larger display ads on websites and video ads. Google, for example, was giving away software tools that DoubleClick had charged for. To diversify, DoubleClick created an ad exchange, or marketplace, as a new business and a buffering source of revenue.</p><p>  ''But we were terrified,'' recalled Michael Rubenstein, a former DoubleClick executive. The DoubleClick managers and investors decided it was a good time to sell.</p><p>  The auction for the company came down to three finalists, Yahoo, Microsoft and Google, said David Rosenblatt, a former chief executive of DoubleClick. The three bids were similar in value, he said, but Google, given its thriving search business, had access to the largest pool of advertisers, complementing DoubleClick's strength with publishers.</p><p>  ''The combination with Google made the most sense,'' Mr. Rosenblatt said.</p><p>  The Review</p><p>  The Federal Trade Commission gave Google the go-ahead to buy DoubleClick by December 2007, as did the European Commission a few months later. Looking back, Mr. Kovacic said a legal challenge to the deal would have been ''difficult but not impossible.''</p><p>  Another former commissioner said a merger review was a prediction of whether competition may or may not result. But he added that it was an educated guess, made by regulators grounded in the present. No one foresaw the power that tech platforms like Google, Facebook and Amazon would amass, said the former commissioner, who asked not to be identified because of potential conflicts with clients of his firm.</p><p>  In its 2007 statement allowing the DoubleClick deal, the commission described broad swaths of the digital ad market as ''relatively nascent, dynamic and highly fragmented,'' adding that other big companies ''appear to be well positioned to compete vigorously against Google.''</p><p>Microsoft, it seemed, could be a formidable rival. Just a month after Google announced the DoubleClick deal, Microsoft agreed to pay about twice as much -- more than $6 billion -- to acquire aQuantive, another digital ad company.</p><p>  At the time, aQuantive mainly appealed to Microsoft as a competitor to Google that could slow its expansion plans in advertising. Microsoft saw Google as its most dangerous rival because it posed a threat to Microsoft's lifeblood products, Windows and Office, former executives say. Google was offering free versions of email, document and spreadsheet programs over the internet, subsidized by advertising.</p><p>  ''With DoubleClick, Google was playing offense, but aQuantive was a defensive move for Microsoft,'' said Brian McAndrews, the former chief executive of aQuantive. (Mr. McAndrews is a member of The New York Times's board of directors.)</p><p>  For Microsoft, aQuantive was never really a priority, former executives say, and its leaders departed and it withered. In 2012, Microsoft publicly conceded that the deal had failed, taking a $6 billion write-off.</p><p>  While DoubleClick was its largest deal by far, Google built up its ad technology business with a string of acquisitions. It bought start-ups that made software for publishers, advertisers and mobile ads, including AdMob in 2009, Invite Media in 2010 and AdMeld in 2011.</p><p>  Those building blocks and its in-house innovations have given Google a strong presence in every step of buying and selling online ads.</p><p>  ''Google has put it all together,'' said Jeffrey Rayport, an online marketing expert at the Harvard Business School. ''Google is the market under one roof.''</p><p>  The Competition</p><p>Google's one-stop shop is a huge convenience for the smaller businesses that generate much of the tech giant's revenue and do not have online advertising expertise. But the Google machine can seem like a fortress to ad tech companies seeking a slice of the market.</p><p>  In 2007, with big companies scooping up digital ad properties, Brian O'Kelley saw opportunity. He left Right Media, which Yahoo had just bought and where he had been chief technology officer, and founded AppNexus.</p><p>  His ad tech start-up was meant to be an independent middleman for advertisers and publishers, an alternative to the rising powers of digital advertising, Google and later Facebook.</p><p>  By 2010, the start-up was gaining momentum and attracting attention. That October, Microsoft led a $50 million round of venture funding in AppNexus. A month later, Mr. O'Kelley said, AppNexus was cut off from DoubleClick, just as the peak holiday marketing season was getting underway.</p><p>  ''They almost killed us,'' Mr. O'Kelley recalled.</p><p>Google said it could not comment on dealings with specific customers like AppNexus. But Google said that it had policies on ''ad quality, ad content and malware'' and that violations sometimes led to suspending access to the DoubleClick ad exchange.</p><p>  The issue, Mr. O'Kelley said, was a technical one: Google's software attributed ads it said violated its rules to AppNexus rather than to the advertiser.</p><p>  When the AppNexus cutoff raised alarm in the ad industry, Google issued a statement calling AppNexus ''a great partner'' and saying the two companies were working to resolve the matter.</p><p>  The problem lasted a few weeks, a temporary blow to the start-up. The message Mr. O'Kelley and his team took from the episode was that operating a business in the Google ad ecosystem could be precarious and unpredictable.</p><p>  Over the next several years, AppNexus struggled at times, but it persevered and emerged as an alternative to the Google marketplace. In 2018, AT&amp;T bought AppNexus for $1.6 billion. AT&amp;T executives spoke of the company as a linchpin in AT&amp;T's vision of creating a television and digital video advertising exchange that would be a counterweight to Google and Facebook.</p><p>  But those ambitions were scaled back, and the focus became using AppNexus to provide the best ad tech for AT&amp;T's Time Warner television and video units, including CNN, TBS and TNT. This month, The Wall Street Journal reported that AT&amp;T was looking to sell its digital ad unit.</p><p>  Things might look different today if the Federal Trade Commission had made a different decision in 2007, said Mr. O'Kelley, who left AT&amp;T in early 2019.</p><p>  ''Had DoubleClick not gone to Google,'' he said, ''it's not clear that Google would have been the power it became -- certainly not as easily.''</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: A billboard promoting a part of Manhattan, and the ad technology company DoubleClick, during the dot-com boom.

In exchange for the efficiency and convenience provided by the \"Big 4\" firms - Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon - he argues that we are pressed into conformity. By constantly interacting with these companies' products, we have allowed them to intrude upon our inner lives, destroy contemplation and manipulate our behaviors.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Forward's Sam Bromer met with Foer and they spoke about how spirituality and Jewish concepts influenced \"World Without Mind,\" Foer's admiration for Justice Louis Brandeis, and the steps that can be taken to combat tech's intrusion on our collective psyches.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SAM BROMER: Your father, Bert Foer, worked in antitrust law for many years. How did he influence \"World Without Mind,\" if at all? Because clearly there's a huge antitrust element to what you're writing about.</p><p>FRANKLIN FOER: My dad went to law school. He trained to be an antitrust lawyer. And then my grandfather, as he was dying, asked my dad to come work in the family business, which was jewelry. So he had this kind of decade-long diversion into being a small businessman. But antitrust was kind of his burning passion, as much as antitrust can be anyone's burning passion. So, I'm sure I absolutely absorbed from him the basics of what constitutes predatory pricing and anti-competitive behavior. And like every good Jewish boy, I wanted to please my dad. So I'm sure that all that was in the back of my mind.</p><p>To what extent did your upbringing in a Jewish household affect either your views on the preciousness of literary criticism or your fear of monopolistic corporations as authoritarian?</p><p>I think that some of my skepticism and hostility to the big tech companies grows from a Jewish sense of time, and just the idea of there being a Sabbath, which is a break in the architecture of the week, where there's a moment where you're disconnected. And this idea that there were these sources that are trying to hijack our attention and overrun our lives, leaving no space for contemplation. I think that idea is in some ways at the core of my hostility to Facebook and Google and Apple and Amazon.</p><p>So spirituality and contemplation are sort of hand in hand in how you view the world?</p><p>Absolutely. To put the Jewish spin on it, I would say that a lot of my thinking about this rose out of my readings of Brandeis, who is the ultimate Jewish secular saint. Brandeis made a fetish of contemplation. He invented a concept of privacy and also was the great critic of monopoly.</p><p>But I think it's impossible to think metaphysically, impossible to think about the things that go beyond the world of appearance, if your attention is constantly being directed and if you're constantly being distracted. So I think that contemplation is the necessary ingredient that makes a spiritual life possible.</p><p>Brandeis had a theory of intellectual privacy, and spoke of the need for protection from surveillance and interference while generating ideas and private opinions. What do you think regulators or Supreme Court members or government officials can learn from his ideas?</p><p>Well, privacy is something that everybody claims to want, but nobody articulates why. Privacy is beyond just having somebody get a peek through your window. The threat isn't just that your space is being crowded and violated. What Brandeis was worried about was that idea that the fear of somebody looking over your shoulder as you think would start to affect your thought - that as soon as we know we have an audience, we start to bend our opinions to try to please our audience.</p><p>And so he was really worried most intensely about the disappearance of independence. And when you put it that way, what he's arguing is that as the creep of privacy descends upon us, we become less able to be citizens because we're less able to formulate opinions that are entirely our own.</p><p>Are you skeptical of collectivist solutions to the problems posed by these tech companies? Take, for example, unionization at media companies that are affected by technological change, like Vox or the Los Angeles Times.</p><p>I'm definitely pro-union. I think that the preservation of good journalism in some ways depends on unionization. If you look around newsrooms, it's hard to find anybody who has any gray hairs. I've always wondered what happens to all these people. And part of what happens to all people is that they get pushed out because there's not a pay structure that works for people who have families or who age in their profession.</p><p>What happens in journalism is that there is a race to the bottom, where a lot of these outlets hire young people because the product that they produce oftentimes requires less skill and less experience and less expertise. Aggregation is the simplest and cheapest type of journalism. And so I think as unions fight to exist and then as they fight to make it more possible to have an extended career in journalism, what they're actually fighting for, at the end of the day, is a certain idea of quality.</p><p>Do you think that no matter what these companies like Facebook do, as gatekeepers they are going to have an effect on our political system? And what are the consequences of that?</p><p>Facebook is in the process right now of reckoning with its size and power. And we would have never had an internal reckoning over that had they not been accused of messing with the results of the 2016 election or if there hadn't been this scandal about Russian interference.</p><p>I think that Facebook is just really uncomfortable \"owning\" its power. To be the most powerful media outlet in the world means that what you publish has tremendous impact and therefore should be held to pretty high standards. But Facebook is not built to hold its content up to high standards.</p><p>And so to accept the power that they actually have, and the responsibility to the power that they actually have, means that they would have to become a different sort of company that is a less profitable company. So they're in a real conundrum.</p><p>You write in the book about Face-book's infamous lab rat-like experimentation on its users, and then also Google's involvement in the 2012 election. Do you think that these kinds of activities should be regulated? Should these companies be bound to a code of conduct, or require more informed consent from their users?</p><p>I think we need to find some response to the problem of addiction, and I think it should be viewed as a public health problem. I'm not exactly sure whether that means posting a Surgeon General's warning on iPhone and Facebook pages, but I do think that needs to be addressed.</p><p>Secondly, there's the problem of privacy, and we have this gobsmacking fact that there is no comprehensive legislative regime that protects people's privacy, which stands in stark contrast to the direction [in which] the Europeans are quickly moving. And so I think that's the most urgent thing. And then, you're right, they need to be held to some sort of code of conduct. And when academics conduct research on subjects, they are duty bound to a code of ethics that wires them to disclose certain manipulations or to give the subjects a sense of their involvement in experimentation, and I think it would be nice if there [could be] something akin to that for the tech companies.</p><p>Perhaps the tech companies could draw from academia, where the same sort of process requires more protections for the people involved.</p><p>At the same time, the amount of manipulation that happens at Facebook on a daily basis is endemic. Everything is being constantly tested. And that's true at most media companies as well, where headlines are constantly being tested. And I don't think we want to eliminate that; I don't think we want the government trying to eliminate that. But when it comes to experiments that are designed to deliberately manipulate emotions or electoral results. I don't want to be a prude, but manipulation of elections is a bridge too far.</p><p>'Privacy is something that everybody claims to want, but nobody articulates why.'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ENW-2024398967</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">26378ENW</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S41-XNJ1-JC85-J254-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11341</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1362\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Forward Association, Inc.

How did he influence \"World Without Mind,\" if at all? Because clearly there's a huge antitrust element to what you're writing about.</p><p>FRANKLIN FOER: My dad went to law school. He trained to be an antitrust lawyer. And then my grandfather, as he was dying, asked my dad to come work in the family business, which was jewelry. So he had this kind of decade-long diversion into being a small businessman. But antitrust was kind of his burning passion, as much as antitrust can be anyone's burning passion. So, I'm sure I absolutely absorbed from him the basics of what constitutes predatory pricing and anti-competitive behavior. And like every good Jewish boy, I wanted to please my dad. So I'm sure that all that was in the back of my mind.</p><p>To what extent did your upbringing in a Jewish household affect either your views on the preciousness of literary criticism or your fear of monopolistic corporations as authoritarian?</p><p>I think that some of my skepticism and hostility to the big tech companies grows from a Jewish sense of time, and just the idea of there being a Sabbath, which is a break in the architecture of the week, where there's a moment where you're disconnected. And this idea that there were these sources that are trying to hijack our attention and overrun our lives, leaving no space for contemplation. I think that idea is in some ways at the core of my hostility to Facebook and Google and Apple and Amazon.</p><p>So spirituality and contemplation are sort of hand in hand in how you view the world?</p><p>Absolutely. To put the Jewish spin on it, I would say that a lot of my thinking about this rose out of my readings of Brandeis, who is the ultimate Jewish secular saint. Brandeis made a fetish of contemplation. He invented a concept of privacy and also was the great critic of monopoly.</p><p>But I think it's impossible to think metaphysically, impossible to think about the things that go beyond the world of appearance, if your attention is constantly being directed and if you're constantly being distracted. So I think that contemplation is the necessary ingredient that makes a spiritual life possible.</p><p>Brandeis had a theory of intellectual privacy, and spoke of the need for protection from surveillance and interference while generating ideas and private opinions. What do you think regulators or Supreme Court members or government officials can learn from his ideas?</p><p>Well, privacy is something that everybody claims to want, but nobody articulates why. Privacy is beyond just having somebody get a peek through your window. The threat isn't just that your space is being crowded and violated. What Brandeis was worried about was that idea that the fear of somebody looking over your shoulder as you think would start to affect your thought - that as soon as we know we have an audience, we start to bend our opinions to try to please our audience.</p><p>And so he was really worried most intensely about the disappearance of independence. And when you put it that way, what he's arguing is that as the creep of privacy descends upon us, we become less able to be citizens because we're less able to formulate opinions that are entirely our own.</p><p>Are you skeptical of collectivist solutions to the problems posed by these tech companies? Take, for example, unionization at media companies that are affected by technological change, like Vox or the Los Angeles Times.</p><p>I'm definitely pro-union. I think that the preservation of good journalism in some ways depends on unionization. If you look around newsrooms, it's hard to find anybody who has any gray hairs. I've always wondered what happens to all these people. And part of what happens to all people is that they get pushed out because there's not a pay structure that works for people who have families or who age in their profession.</p><p>What happens in journalism is that there is a race to the bottom, where a lot of these outlets hire young people because the product that they produce oftentimes requires less skill and less experience and less expertise. Aggregation is the simplest and cheapest type of journalism. And so I think as unions fight to exist and then as they fight to make it more possible to have an extended career in journalism, what they're actually fighting for, at the end of the day, is a certain idea of quality.</p><p>Do you think that no matter what these companies like Facebook do, as gatekeepers they are going to have an effect on our political system? And what are the consequences of that?</p><p>Facebook is in the process right now of reckoning with its size and power. And we would have never had an internal reckoning over that had they not been accused of messing with the results of the 2016 election or if there hadn't been this scandal about Russian interference.</p><p>I think that Facebook is just really uncomfortable \"owning\" its power. To be the most powerful media outlet in the world means that what you publish has tremendous impact and therefore should be held to pretty high standards. But Facebook is not built to hold its content up to high standards.</p><p>And so to accept the power that they actually have, and the responsibility to the power that they actually have, means that they would have to become a different sort of company that is a less profitable company. So they're in a real conundrum.</p><p>You write in the book about Face-book's infamous lab rat-like experimentation on its users, and then also Google's involvement in the 2012 election. Do you think that these kinds of activities should be regulated? Should these companies be bound to a code of conduct, or require more informed consent from their users?</p><p>I think we need to find some response to the problem of addiction, and I think it should be viewed as a public health problem. I'm not exactly sure whether that means posting a Surgeon General's warning on iPhone and Facebook pages, but I do think that needs to be addressed.</p><p>Secondly, there's the problem of privacy, and we have this gobsmacking fact that there is no comprehensive legislative regime that protects people's privacy, which stands in stark contrast to the direction [in which] the Europeans are quickly moving. And so I think that's the most urgent thing. And then, you're right, they need to be held to some sort of code of conduct. And when academics conduct research on subjects, they are duty bound to a code of ethics that wires them to disclose certain manipulations or to give the subjects a sense of their involvement in experimentation, and I think it would be nice if there [could be] something akin to that for the tech companies.</p><p>Perhaps the tech companies could draw from academia, where the same sort of process requires more protections for the people involved.</p><p>At the same time, the amount of manipulation that happens at Facebook on a daily basis is endemic. Everything is being constantly tested. And that's true at most media companies as well, where headlines are constantly being tested. And I don't think we want to eliminate that; I don't think we want the government trying to eliminate that. But when it comes to experiments that are designed to deliberately manipulate emotions or electoral results. I don't want to be a prude, but manipulation of elections is a bridge too far.</p><p>'Privacy is something that everybody claims to want, but nobody articulates why.'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ENW-2024398967</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">26378ENW</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y7J-HR31-DYR7-818P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11341</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1362\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Forward Association, Inc.

And when academics conduct research on subjects, they are duty bound to a code of ethics that wires them to disclose certain manipulations or to give the subjects a sense of their involvement in experimentation, and I think it would be nice if there [could be] something akin to that for the tech companies.</p><p>Perhaps the tech companies could draw from academia, where the same sort of process requires more protections for the people involved.</p><p>At the same time, the amount of manipulation that happens at Facebook on a daily basis is endemic. Everything is being constantly tested. And that's true at most media companies as well, where headlines are constantly being tested. And I don't think we want to eliminate that; I don't think we want the government trying to eliminate that. But when it comes to experiments that are designed to deliberately manipulate emotions or electoral results. I don't want to be a prude, but manipulation of elections is a bridge too far.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FORWRD-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FORWRD2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S8X-7F51-DYRW-V0J0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">300814</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1348\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Forward Association, Incorporated All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>The Forward</publicationName><publicationDate month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>AAPL (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp; Internet Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Qzk0QUJBRENDQzhBNDc2MDk5OTAyQzI3QkRFMkU0OUU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>Social Networking Sites</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkJEOEE3NERCMEE5NDAyRTgzQ0QzNTc3MkM3NzI0MUY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6N0U2OEYyMDlBMThBNDQxRjg4NkFGM0I4REVDODE1QTE</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001485</classCode><className>RESTRAINT OF TRADE</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Nzc5QTM2RDA2QTExNDg4Njk3MzJEQzkzODM4REJENEE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDA2NTZCMDc0RDA0NDBCOEFFMjA0NTg1QTBGMjM3NTQ</classCode><className>Price Fixing &amp; Restraints of Trade</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000100</classCode><className>ANTITRUST &amp; TRADE LAW</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6REEyRTNDM0JGQzYyNEMyOEFGNTAwNUJEOUU1MDg4NjU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><className>Antitrust &amp; Trade Law</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009VG6</classCode><className>LITERARY CRITICISM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009UI0</classCode><className>LITERATURE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>N541110GM</classCode><className>LAWYERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0009SR8</classCode><className>FAMILY COMPANIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>N611310QM</classCode><className>LAW SCHOOLS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009VG6</classCode><className>LITERARY CRITICISM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>N541110GM</classCode><className>LAWYERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>N611310QM</classCode><className>LAW SCHOOLS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

Newsom clearly wins the prize for having to cope with the most crises at the same time,\" says former California Gov. Gray Davis.    SACRAMENTO \u2014 Ronald Reagan used the California governor's office as a springboard to the White House. Jerry Brown and Pete Wilson tried to.    But now, the governor of the nation\u2019s most populous state has to contend with massive wildfires, unhealthy air, rolling blackouts, unchecked homelessness, social unrest and the constant threat of earthquakes \u2014 not to mention ideological attacks by the president. New headaches arise every week, sometimes every day, all during a pandemic that has led to soaring unemployment.      State executive jobs anywhere come with their challenges to accompany ribbon cuttings and a chance to feed national political ambition. But the pitfalls in California seem enormous, and no more so than under the Gavin Newsom \u2014 the suave and stylish Democrat who manages one moment to be a leading liberal figure and at another an unwitting star in Donald Trump campaign ads.     \u201cMost governors will experience some form of crisis,\u201d former Gov. Gray Davis, who was recalled in 2003 following an energy market crisis, said in an interview. \u201cEither a substantial recession, wildfires, earthquakes \u2014 that comes with the territory. But I think Gov. Newsom clearly wins the prize for having to cope with the most crises at the same time.\u201d    Pundits have questioned for decades whether the state is governable at all. Here are seven reasons why Newsom finds himself with the worst job in state politics.   1. California is too big for its own good   California is a \"nation-state,\" as Newsom and previous governors like to boast. But that vastness makes it hard to govern. Its sheer size, along with nearly 40 million residents, makes it perennially open to suggestions that it should be split into three or more states.    San Francisco is as culturally and economically different from agricultural towns as it is from anywhere in the Midwest. That's one reason rural residents still proudly wave \"State of Jefferson\" signs in honor of a 1941 idea to carve out a separate state covering vast swaths of southern Oregon and Northern California \u2014 a state that would have far greater allegiance to Republicans.    Southern California could be a nation \u2014 perhaps multiple nations \u2014 in and of itself. The rugged North Coast bears no resemblance to the Mojave Desert.    \"When the lines of latitude cover ten degrees and the topographical regions number eleven, what are a people to do?\" asks Mark Arax, a Central Valley native and longtime California chronicler, in his latest book \"The Dreamt Land.\"    As home to the largest number of immigrants \u2014 more than 2.3 million of them undocumented \u2014 California confronts yawning economic divides and language barriers that can be difficult to transcend. A prime example: Latinos, often on the front lines of essential workers like home health care, agriculture and retail, are suffering the most from Covid.    And despite its homegrown, world-leading tech industry, California has fumbled the distribution of unemployment benefits for hundreds of thousands and left thousands of rural students stranded during the pandemic without broadband internet access.    Within California's solid-blue facade lies a diverse political constituency, as well. Newsom's challenge during the pandemic has been to communicate the importance of mask-wearing to libertarian resisters in Orange County and more rural areas \u2014 and to tailor reopening rules so as not to trigger a revolt.   2. Climate change hits the state hardest   The dystopian future that climate scientists have predicted is fully coming to pass in California. Each new crisis subsumes the last; planned power shutoffs to prevent wildfires gave way to last month's rolling blackouts to prevent grid overload during a historic heat wave.    The blackouts were then quickly forgotten amid massive wildfires from dry lightning strikes. More than 3.5 million acres have been consumed so far this year \u2014 weeks before the typical peak of fire season.    In recent years, climate change exposed problems that forced its largest utility, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, to declare bankruptcy. The company's power lines stood for decades in the Sierra Nevada and hillsides across Northern California. But they sparked deadly fires in California's Wine Country in 2017 and then the state's deadliest conflagration \u2014 the Camp Fire, with 85 fatalities \u2014 in late 2018.    Newsom now faces hard decisions about land use, forest management and electricity supply, with no cheap or easy fixes in sight. And that's before facing the other threats posed by climate change: sea-level rise that threatens waterfront development and the potential for superstorms to cause disastrous floods.    \"I do sympathize with the folks in the 'Horseshoe,'\" said Michael Wara, director of Stanford University's climate and energy program, using the nickname for the governor's Capitol office. \"They did not take the job thinking that this was the future they were inheriting.\"   3. Coronavirus has exposed fault lines   As the nation\u2019s most populous and geographically diverse state by a wide margin, California has posed a number of unique challenges to Newsom and health officials attempting to combat the spread of the coronavirus. The state\u2019s sheer size has made managing medical resources and coordinating testing and contact tracing logistically fraught endeavors, contributing to more than 770,000 coronavirus infections \u2014 the most in the nation \u2014 and nearly 15,000 deaths to date.    This geographic diversity has also brought political challenges as Newsom attempts to govern how 58 counties will balance demands to reopen a range of economic sectors while containing the spread of the virus. After winning early praise for their quick decisions to issue stay-at-home orders in March, Newsom and California health officials have spent much of the last few months recovering from a series of self-inflicted political wounds, most notably a botched June reopening that led to a surge of cases and deaths.    \u201cTo come up with a single, statewide strategy on top of all that diversity was just extremely challenging,\u201d said Matt Willis, Marin County\u2019s public health officer. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to have a California- wide approach to any one issue no matter what it is.\u201d    Efforts to slow the pace of reopening and more strictly monitor the progress of individual counties have proven successful in recent weeks, with new cases dropping and the statewide positive test rate falling to 3.5 percent. But they\u2019ve also sparked anger in conservative regions such as Orange County and the Central Valley where lawmakers argue an economic jumpstart is desperately needed.    Newsom faces his toughest challenge heading into the fall as pressure to reopen increases, along with the potential risks of the coronavirus pandemic overlapping with flu season.   4. The California Dream is out of reach   Despite all the wealth generated by Silicon Valley, Hollywood and massive agriculture and energy industries, California fares terribly on some basic measures of prosperity.    Soaring poverty and homelessness, exacerbated by rocketing rents and a dearth of affordable homes, offer grim counterpoints to the California portrayed by Newsom and other Democrats as America\u2019s shining star. Images of desperate Californians living in the streets, at times under conditions reminiscent of refugee camps, underscore the complex and intractable crisis.    Newsom's campaign pledge to create millions of new housing units has run into the hard realities of regulations, local opposition and environmental restrictions. High-profile housing bills have faltered during the first two legislative years of Newsom's governorship.    \u201cThis is a difficult, complex challenge that takes political will to prioritize these things,\u201d said Carol Galante, faculty director of the Terner Center for Housing Innovation at UC Berkeley. \u201cAt its core, it really is the underbuilding in my view, and that\u2019s a huge political problem to fix.\u201d    The state has attempted to offset income inequality \u2014 California has the most billionaires of any U.S. state by far \u2014 with a progressive tax structure that relies heavily on the highest earners.    But the pandemic recession has still cut into state resources while threatening to push huge numbers of financially ailing Californians out of their homes \u2014 an eviction and foreclosure catastrophe that could deepen California\u2019s existing housing crisis. Newsom signed a stopgap eviction halt, but no one sees it as a long-term solution.    His administration has used federal dollars to house more homeless people; advocates are closely watching to see if that progress is sustainable. Looking ahead, Galante warned that policymakers cannot \u201ctake our foot off the gas\u201d on housing production, noting that after the Great Recession, rents spiked even as the economy recovered.   5. California hasn't solved racial inequality   California leaders are quick to highlight the state\u2019s unique diversity as a driving force behind its status as an economic and cultural powerhouse. But state lawmakers and public officials have also struggled to reverse persistent racial inequalities in health, education and public safety.    Decades after historic protests in Los Angeles sparked conversations about racial injustice in policing \u2014 and in society as a whole \u2014 toward Black Californians, the law enforcement killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis and the disproportionate impact of the coronavirus pandemic on people of color has again pushed inequality to the forefront of conversations here. Major cities have seen demonstrations throughout the summer, and a handful of bills that would shift the dynamic passed the Legislature, including a November ballot measure that would reinstate affirmative action.    While African Americans comprise just 6 percent of California\u2019s population, they represent nearly 16 percent of all arrests and constitute at least 25 percent of both the jail and prison populations. Blacks and Latinos in California also disproportionally suffer from chronic illnesses related to the quality of life, like asthma and diabetes, and are more likely to work in low wage jobs that are classified as essential, contributing factors to high coronavirus infection and death rates among these groups.    California leaders are still struggling to communicate with millions of residents, and more than 44 percent of Californians speak a language other than English at home. Such diversity is celebrated in the state, but language barriers also make it challenging to communicate public warnings during coronavirus and wildfires. They also hurt access to public and health services.    Nowhere is racial inequality more present than in homelessness. Nearly 40 percent of California\u2019s more than 150,000 homeless are Black, a number expected to grow in the wake of an economic downturn.    Mark Ridley-Thomas, a Los Angeles County supervisor and former state legislator who has been a leading voice for the Black community, praised Newsom for making homelessness a top priority of his administration. But he warned that addressing systemic inequality will be no easy task.    \u201cIt is not for the faint of heart,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you lack resolve, don't show up because these issues will test everything you have.\u201d   6. Like it or not, California needs Trump   Shepherding California through a pandemic and catastrophic wildfires has forced Newsom to constantly walk a political tightrope. Newsom\u2019s Democratic base despises Trump and recoils from any positive words for the president. But California needs federal assistance to endure repeated catastrophes, and Newsom has clearly calculated that getting that help is worth strategically setting the enmity aside.    Particularly as California grapples with the coronavirus, Newsom has diligently avoided publicly criticizing Trump and has regularly offered up praise. That has led to the astonishing sight of resistance hero Newsom in Trump campaign spots, praising the president for delivering aid to California.    Even as he has tried to avoid antagonizing Trump, Newsom has tried to tend to those political imperatives. In the space of a few weeks, he used a Democratic National Convention speech to assail Trump\u2019s threats over wildfires and then gave the president the benefit of the doubt in remarks to reporters; he respectfully urged Trump to think about climate change during a wildlfire tour this week and then fundraised off of having \u201cconfronted him.\u201d    Meanwhile, Newsom's ex-wife, Kimberly Guilfoyle, made headlines at the Republican National Convention with a booming speech blasting California as \"a land of discarded heroin needles in parks, riots in streets and blackouts in homes.\" Since her split with Newsom, Guilfoyle became a conservative television personality and began dating Trump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr.   7. Governors walk a narrow tightrope in a big tent   In liberal California, Democrats are the only game in town. They control every statewide office and wield Republican-proof supermajorities in the Legislature \u2014 and that adds up to big ambitions for progressive Democrats and their allies in organized labor.    Despite the national caricature of Newsom as a starry-eyed San Francisco liberal, in California he\u2019s always been seen as more of a business-friendly centrist. He also has deep ties to a technology industry that has increasingly clashed with unions. That means Newsom is constantly trying to balance those constituencies as he faces decisions that will inevitably frustrate someone.    \"I think it\u2019s fair to say that organized labor has done a very good job of becoming influential in California and that business has done a good job of becoming un-influential over time and you have to appreciate the position the governor is in,\" said Jim Wunderman, CEO of a business coalition called the Bay Area Council. \u201cThis is a really important point we\u2019re at now because the business position is not good,\" he added.    The shifting fortunes of Big Tech offer a prime example. Gig economy firms like Uber and Doordash are under intense pressure from organized labor, which championed a law that could upend their business models by forcing them to treat drivers as employees rather than independent contractors. Newsom has consistently advocated for a deal that could placate both sides by bridging the contractor-employee dichotomy, and he has stayed neutral on a tech-funded ballot initiative to get out from under the sweeping labor law.    A pandemic-induced recession has intensified those tensions. Democratic mayors, unions and liberal activists have pushed Newsom to raise taxes; business groups have warned that could derail a stuttering economy recovery. Newsom charted a middle course last week when he backed a labor-backed initiative to raise commercial property taxes, but Newsom also flatly rejected a union campaign to raise taxes on the most affluent Californians.    \u201cThere\u2019s this tremendous chasm and there\u2019s really no way to fit in between it without falling into it,\u201d Wunderman said. \u201cThe tech industry has the benefit of knowing him and he understand the future is going to be different,\u201d but \u201cat the same time I do think he has a very focused concern on the plight of people and wants to be the governor who ensure the little guy isn\u2019t getting screwed over.\u201d    Carla Marinucci and Victoria Colliver contributed to this report.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-43142793616</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60X5-BY81-F07F-80G4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2637\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Politico</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 23, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>Pacific Gas &amp;

The market is massive and massively diverse. There are viable opportunities to create niche interest solutions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Development takes time, of course: and one thing that sucks so much time and resources from small development teams is the need to test software against multiple hardware and software configurations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When building apps developers must think about how many old OS versions they will support. If they choose to support a five-year old OS, will they then define their application's feature set by what that OS supports, or build completely different apps for each OS? Each one of these decisions has a real impact on the cost and time it takes to build the solution.</p><p>That's not the case on iOS because developers can create apps accessible to 93 percent of around a billion users simply by supporting iOS 11 and iOS 12. (They can even focus on iOS 12, and still have a huge market). This cuts development time for them and means the latest apps tend to be released on Apple's platforms first.</p><p>Enterprises can be more agile</p><p>That's a huge benefit to enterprise developers. Not only can those internal B2B apps be tweaked and improved for iOS 12 more rapidly than their equivalents on other platforms, but it's possible to swiftly introduce new apps and services in the B2C markets.</p><p>Combined with Apple's other platform advantages and its rich mix of supporting technology integration firms (from Accenture to Jamf and beyond), enterprise CIOs can be pretty confident in iOS.</p><p>Not only that, but those regular security updates make it much easier to bring devices into compliance with enterprise security policy, particularly in tightly regulated industries in which data security lapses are a criminal offence.</p><p>You don't want the company you do business with leaking your credit card details because some dodgy consumer electronics company that makes hardware some of their sales teams use failed to publish a timely security update, do you?</p><p>It makes you more secure</p><p>We've all heard the arguments that the big tech firms spend billions on security, but still get hacked. Google Plus, Facebook, and everyone else gets hit. \"Perfect security is impossible,\" they mutter, while ignoring that Apple (which is also targeted) seldom suffers from anything like as egregious a data breach - and usually goes public when it does.</p><p>This is not just because Apple's approach to security isn't compromised by commercial demands to take people's data and sell it for advertising, nor is it because the company is deeply committed to protecting customer privacy, so there's little data to be stolen.</p><p>It is also because Apple publishes regular, easy-to-install security software updates for all its platforms, tends to address any security flaws quickly, and because most of its users are running the latest versions of its operating systems.</p><p>On devices of the same age on other platforms, millions may remain exposed to security vulnerabilities Apple patched in iOS 10 or earlier. 'Perfect security' may be impossible, but the least any firm that takes your money should do is try to deliver it.</p><p>The whole widget</p><p>Apple designs the hardware, engineers many of the critical components and develops the operating system.</p><p>This means the company can tweak hardware and software for best results. In the past, we've learned Apple's OS updates have performed less well on older devices, but the company tried harder this year with iOS 12, which will make even the oldest (iPhone 5S) devices it supports perform more efficiently. You'll experience less lag when using your device, from dialling a call to summoning the Camera app.</p><p>This makes for happier customers, increased app engagement - and a chance for developers to extend their dialog with their users.</p><p>You join a conversation</p><p>Customers on iOS tend to have satisfaction levels in excess of 90 percent. They also tend to use their devices frequently and to make regular use of the apps they install on those devices.</p><p>Apple's focus on upgrading the operating system annually means that even older hardware benefits, and user engagement is maintained on a platform basis. This translates into user engagement in the apps installed on those devices.</p><p>What difference does that make? If a customer likes an app they will make frequent use of it. This means enterprises offering iOS apps to customers can easily justify continued investment in those apps.</p><p>That's good for customers, good for the enterprise servicing those customers, and good for the platform as it translates into regular app updates, which themselves translate into the steady introduction of new iOS-supported features within existing apps. New technologies from ARKit to Siri Shortcuts benefit from this.</p><p>The effect is that when you use iOS you are engaged in a constant dialogue with your device, with Apple and with your apps. It's called platform engagement.</p><p>Services are the future</p><p>Apple knows this. Why else do you think it is developing its own set of services for iOS users?</p><p>It's well aware that this industry-leading platform engagement can be turned into highly profitable service delivery.</p><p>Of course, as it introduces new services it also provides its customers with new reasons to use their devices and further motivation to upgrade them.</p><p>That's good for Apple users, sure, but it's also a big benefit to iOS developers, as Apple's addictive services boost platform engagement still further, driving interest and dialogue between end users and the entire app ecosystem. In future, services will become more important than hardware sales, but that's another story. It's a lot easier to deliver and receive innovative digital services on a unified platform.</p><p>It's not just about you</p><p>Apples VP Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives, Lisa Jackson, recently pointed to Apple's decision to make iOS 12 available to the five-year-old iPhone 5S and said: \"Because they last longer, you can keep using them. And keeping using them is the best thing for the planet.\"</p><p>She's right - not only is ewaste a huge problem, but getting hold of some of the components used inside these devices imposes an egregious and unacceptably huge cost in human misery. The longer you can use a device, the better, so it makes sense for Apple to support devices it was selling some years back. It's also better for the planet.</p><p>Here's what you need to know to upgrade to iOS 12.</p><p>Got a story? Please\u00a0drop me a line via Twitter\u00a0and let me know. I'd like you to follow me there so I can tell you about new articles I publish and reports I find.</p><p>Google+?\u00a0Hopefully you are already part of\u00a0AppleHolic's Kool Aid Corner community, but as Google is closing its social network soon, please also follow me on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0and join me in testing the all-new MeWe group,\u00a0AppleHolic's bar &amp; grill.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CMPWLD-3313556</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CMPWLD2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TGB-1JH1-DY58-D0M0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6943</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1162\"/><timeReceived>04:51 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 IDG Communications, Inc.

While Wall Street is chiefly concerned with profits, many executives understand climate change comes with real financial risks. Furthermore, the recent global protests against racism show that discriminating against certain customers is unacceptable. Many public corporations are now focused on ESG issues -- that is, environmental, social and governance characteristics. Meanwhile, some index providers have begun to rank companies based on how ethically they operate, and there are accessible and affordable <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/funds/articles/what-is-an-etf-the-ultimate-guide\">exchange-traded funds</url> for people who want to invest without sacrificing their principles. Here are seven socially responsible ETFs that allow you to invest with ESG principles in mind.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">iShares MSCI KLD 400 Social ETF (ticker: DSI)</emphasis></p><p>At nearly $2 billion in assets, this iShares fund is not just one of the most popular socially responsible investment plays, but it's also a substantial fund across all categories with serious size and volume. Benchmarked to an index of about 400 large U.S. companies that includes Microsoft Corp. (<url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/msft-microsoft-corp\">MSFT</url>) and Facebook (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/fb-facebook-inc\">FB</url>), this fund is designed to feature companies that post above-average ratings on ESG characteristics. Investors should be aware that this       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/slideshows/7-of-the-best-socially-responsible-funds\">socially responsible ETF</url> is pretty biased toward technology stocks; roughly 45% of holdings are either in information tech or communications. That may be good or bad, depending on your personal goals, but is worth noting.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Vanguard ESG U.S. Stock ETF (ESGV)</emphasis></p><p>Though smaller in size than DSI with about $1.3 billion in total assets under management, this socially responsible ETF from Vanguard is tied to a much larger group of holdings with nearly 1,500 total components. It has a similar focus to the prior fund, as it includes U.S. companies with above-average ESG ratings; however, it includes a bunch of <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/best-small-cap-tech-stocks-to-buy\">smaller names</url> given the depth of the lineup of stocks. That may appeal to some investors, since top holdings remain old favorites such as Apple (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/aapl-apple-inc\">AAPL</url>). But further down the list are a host of relatively unknown stocks across all sectors of the U.S. economy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">iShares ESG MSCI EAFE ETF (ESGD)</emphasis></p><p>This is another solid option as socially responsible ETFs go, but it excludes companies in the U.S. and Canada to take a more global approach to the ESG investing strategy. The result is a <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/international-dividend-stocks-for-diversification\">diverse</url> group of almost 500 companies across geographies and sectors, including Swiss consumer giant Nestle (SWX: NESN) and Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corp. (TYO: 7203). Investors should know that some companies in regions like Europe are even more progressive in their environmental, social and corporate governance efforts given greater regulation. For instance, in 2017, the U.K. enacted legislation that requires any business with 250 or more employees to publicly report its gender pay gap.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SPDR SSGA Gender Diversity Index ETF (SHE)</emphasis></p><p>Perhaps best known for its 2016 debut that featured the \"Fearless Girl\" statue of a ponytailed tyke staring down Wall Street's famous bronze bull, this socially responsible ETF focuses on companies that feature better-than-average <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/investing-101/slideshows/all-star-women-investors\">female representation</url> on their executive committees compared with others in their industry. This doesn't mean a perfect balance of men and women, however. Top position PayPal Holdings (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/pypl-paypal-holdings-inc\">PYPL</url>) has only four women on its leadership team of 11 people, for instance. That said, this ratio is better than its peers. And as representation of women in leadership continues to improve, so will the gender diversity of constituent stocks in this ETF.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Invesco Solar ETF (TAN)</emphasis></p><p>With more than a decade of trading history, this solar energy ETF is among the oldest options for individual investors looking to invest in a more socially responsible way. With top stocks in this narrow subsector such as First Solar (<url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/fslr-first-solar-inc\">FSLR</url>) and SolarEdge Technologies (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/sedg-solaredge-technologies-inc\">SEDG</url>), TAN is a great way to gain exposure to the solar energy trend without going all-in on a single company. Of course, a laser focus on a group of 28 specialized holdings with basically the same business model is not without its risks. Solar sales are prone to volatility from year to year, and so is this ETF.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SPDR S&amp;P 500 Fossil Fuel Reserves Free ETF (SPYX)</emphasis></p><p>If you care about going green but also want a broader range in your portfolio beyond <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/articles/2019-03-15/4-tips-to-invest-in-renewable-energy-now\">renewable energy</url> stocks, the SPDR S&amp;P 500 Fossil Fuel Reserves Free ETF is a good option. SPYX simply takes all the oil, gas and fossil fuel companies from the list of stocks out of the popular S&amp;P 500. That leaves the ESG investor with about 460 stocks that make up a typical index fund, save for the exclusion of energy giants such as Exxon Mobil Corp. (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/xom-exxon-mobil-corp\">XOM</url>). It's an interesting approach that incorporates a more diverse group of companies.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">iShares MSCI USA ESG Select ETF (SUSA)</emphasis></p><p>This socially responsible ETF is growing fast in popularity because of its \"select\" strategy, through which it places stricter requirements on components. With only 145 holdings in its portfolio, investors are not simply getting an S&amp;P 500 fund that excludes Big Oil and Big Tobacco -- you'll instead find a top cut of the biggest companies that truly take ESG issues seriously. Big tech names such as Apple are well-represented, with about 29% of assets in that sector, but there are also some names that may surprise you. For example, take home-improvement company Home Depot (<url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/hd-home-depot-inc\">HD</url>) or consulting firm Accenture (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/acn-accenture-plc-ordinary-shares-class-a\">ACN</url>). This gives you a shorter list, but it's a decently diversified one to avoid relying on just the top few holdings alone.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Socially responsible ETFs to buy:</emphasis></p><p>-- iShares MSCI KLD 400 Social ETF (<url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/funds/etfs/large-blend/ishares-msci-kld-400-social-etf/dsi\">DSI</url>)</p><p>-- Vanguard ESG U.S. Stock ETF (<url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/funds/etfs/large-blend/vanguard-esg-us-stock-etf/esgv\">ESGV</url>)</p><p>-- iShares ESG MSCI EAFE ETF (<url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/funds/etfs/foreign-large-blend/ishares-msci-eafe-esg-optimized-etf/esgd\">ESGD</url>)</p><p>-- SPDR SSGA Gender Diversity Index ETF (<url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/funds/etfs/large-blend/spdr-ssga-gender-diversity-etf/she\">SHE</url>)</p><p>-- Invesco Solar ETF (<url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/funds/etfs/miscellaneous-sector/invesco-solar-etf/tan\">TAN</url>)</p><p>-- SPDR S&amp;P 500 Fossil Fuel Reserves Free ETF (<url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/funds/etfs/large-blend/spdr-s-p-500-fossil-fuel-rsrv-free-etf/spyx\">SPYX</url>)</p><p>-- iShares MSCI USA ESG Select ETF (<url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/funds/etfs/large-blend/ishares-msci-usa-esg-select-etf/susa\">SUSA</url>)</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, (Getty Images)</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, (David Ramos/Getty Images)</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, (BRITTANY HOSEA-SMALL/AFP/Getty Images)</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, (JOHANNES EISELE/AFP/Getty Images)</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, (Getty Images)</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, (iStockphoto)</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, (Getty Images)</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, (Getty Images)</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic><correction appended=\"true\"><correctionDescription><bodyText><p>Update 06/17/20: This story was published previously and has been updated with new information.</p></bodyText></correctionDescription><correctionStatusText>Correction Appended</correctionStatusText></correction></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USNCOM-190626investing.social</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USNCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WF7-2CS1-F02J-853M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">297647</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1006\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 U.S. News &amp;

But if you recall, January was a nasty month ... one of those months that makes you wonder why you bother investing in the stock market at all. Virtually everything - even the highest quality retirement stocks - took a thorough pounding. </p><p>The best time to make portfolio changes is when the market is high and you're not blinded by fear. It's easier to objectively choose retirement stocks to sell when your portfolio is sitting near highs. You're able to look at your retirement portfolio a lot more objectively, and you're a lot less likely to impulsively sell stocks out of fear. 7 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy as Brexit Fears Recede[5] So today, we're going to do a little portfolio house cleaning. I'm going to recommend seven stocks you should dump from your retirement portfolio. Not all of these stocks are \"bad,\" per se. But none are a good fit for your retirement portfolio and should be dumped at your earliest convenience. Tesla Motors Inc(TSLA) I really like <person><nameText>Elon Musk. </nameText></person>I think he's one of the most interesting people alive today, and it's entirely possible that, 100 years from now, kids in school will be reading about him the same way you and I read about the Morgans, Vanderbilts and Rockefellers of the industrial age. But while I have all the respect in the word for Musk's vision, his stock, Tesla Motors(TSLA[6]) has no business in a portfolio of retirement stocks. It's too risky, too volatile and doesn't have the basic characteristics I like to see in a retirement stock: long history of surviving and adapting through economic cycles, good history of paying a dividend, limited need for outside capital, etc. Tesla has none of these. It's also wildly expensive, trading at 85 times earnings and nearly seven times sales, and will face tough competition from existing automakers in the years ahead, as well as potential upstarts like Alphabet Inc (GOOG[7], GOOGL[8]) or Apple Inc. (AAPL[9]). If you want to own a piece of Tesla, go for it. Just don't do it with your retirement money. Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Amazon (AMZN[10]) may be the single greatest growth story of our generation. Founder Jeff Bezos essentially invented internet commerce as we know it today, and he's disrupted the brick-and-mortar retail sector in a way that few could have imagined 20 years ago. And Amazon turned the world upside down a second time with its cloud service, Amazon Web Services. But Amazon at current prices is a trade, it's not a retirement stock. Amazon has been growing its sales at a 28% clip ... but it's also priced like a company that is growing at a 28% clip ... and one that will continue doing so forever. At current prices, AMZN is trading for 300 times earnings and three times sales. Again, I have the utmost respect for Amazon. But its cloud services will only face increased competition from Alphabet and Microsoft Corporation (MSFT[11]), among others. And while Amazon might maintain its place as the leader here, its growth should slow in the years ahead. 10 \"Growth\" Stocks That Just Don't Have It Anymore[12] So, while Amazon might be a great trade, I'd be very careful with it as a retirement stock. You'd be better off dumping it. Twitter Inc (TWTR) Hope springs eternal. When Microsoft agreed to purchase LinkedIn Corp (LKND[13]), it set off a flurry of speculation that Twitter Inc (TWTR[14]) might be the next social media company to get bought out. Well ... maybe. There might be a Big Tech company out there with more money than sense that would want to buy Twitter. But why would they? Twitter is having a hard time growing its user base, even while rival Facebook Inc (FB[15]) continues to expand from a much higher base. It's not even certain that Twitter has its business model down. Rumors still circulate that Twitter is considering dropping the 140-character maximum for its messages. It's a little late in the game to be reworking the product. On a side note, I estimate a quarter of my Twitter followers are bots. That's a real problem for Twitter's profit model, which assumes real human eyeballs looking at real advertising content. We'll see what happens with Twitter. Who know, they might pull a rabbit out of their hat and turn it around. But I wouldn't want to bet my retirement on it. Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc (VRX) Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX[16]) went from being the darling of the hedge fund masters of the universe to being an absolute whipping boy. The stock is down more than 90% from its 52-week highs. I actually think Valeant is worth a stab at current prices ... but as a trade, not as a retirement stock. I'm extremely wary of pharma and biotech stocks as long-term holdings because they operate in an industry that is one of the most prone to disruption from up-and-coming competitors or changing government regulations. You can definitely do well investing in this sector. But you don't want to risk your retirement on it. At current prices, Valeant trades for 0.76 times sales and three times expected forward earnings. Now, to be fair, the company has also in technical default on its bonds for failing to report its financial statements in a timely fashion. Biotech Bloodbath: Ditch XBI, IBB for Now[17] So while Valeant is dirt cheap, it's also fairly risky. So if you buy Valeant, do it with your speculative capital, not the funds you need to live on in retirement. iShares Core US Aggregate Bond ETF (AGG) I've beat up on stocks for a while. Now it's time to beat up on bonds too. Bonds have been a staple in virtually every retirement portfolio since the dawn of retirement as we know it today. But at today's yields, it simply doesn't make sense to own bonds. Take the iShares Barclays Aggregate Bond Fund (AGG[18]) as an example: This is a standard bond exchange-traded fund that tracks the same bond index that most fixed-income mutual funds track. Well, at today's prices, it yields an almost embarrassing 2.3%. If you hold a quality bond to maturity, you really have no \"risk\" to speak of. You're going to get back the par value of the bond at maturity. (We'll discount reinvestment risk and default risk for now to keep it simple.) But with a standard bond mutual fund or ETF, there is no maturity. The fund is presumed to be perpetual. So should bond yields start to rise again - and they will, at some point - you'll looking at significant losses. When bond yields rise, bond prices fall. If you're going to own bonds, own them outright as individual holdings. But you should dump bond ETFs like AGG from your retirement portfolio. JCPenney Company Inc (JCP) You probably don't own battered retailer JCPenney(JCP[19]). And you probably don't shop there either. And that's really the point I'm making here. JCPenney is a retailer from another era trying to survive and turn the ship around at a time when much better-run retailers are getting killed by the likes of Amazon and other internet retailers. JCP is definitely a cheap stock. At current prices, it trades at just 0.21 times sales. But how well will JCP hold up next time we have a recession? My guess is \"not well.\" It's debt load is enormous; JCP's debt-to-equity ratio is a staggering 381%. That would be high even for a stable company with non-cyclical cash flows, let alone a struggling retailer in a cutthroat business. 10 Stocks You Should Buy at a Moment's Notice[20] If you want to go value hunting in JCP, go for it. The company might end up surprising a lot of people. But it most certainly does not belong in a portfolio you need to fund your retirement. Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (EPD) I have to be careful here because I'm long Enterprise Products Partners (EPD[21]) and consider it a great stock to own for the long haul. EPD throws off cash like no one's business and has raised its distribution every year since 1998. At current prices, it yields almost 6%. So, what's not to like here? As much as I like Enterprise Products, it is a terrible stock to hold in a retirement account like an IRA. As an MLP, Enterprise Products is not subject to taxes at the entity level ... which would normally be fantastic. But it can wreak havoc on non-taxable investors because MLPs can throw off what is called unrelated business taxable income (\"UBTI\"). In a nutshell, if your IRA has too much UBTI, you could be required to file a tax return for your IRA ... in addition to the tax return you file for yourself. Is that a crisis? No. But why mess with it if you don't have to? If you own EPD in a retirement account, dump it. You can always rebuy it in a regular taxable brokerage account.

Thanks to the upcoming launch of some critical new technologies, including 5G and foldable displays, as well as critical enhancements in on-device AI, personal robotics, and other exciting areas, there's a palpable sense of expectation for the new year that we haven't felt for a while. Plus, 2018 ended up being a pretty tough year for several big tech companies, so there are also a lot of folks who want to shake the old year off and dive headfirst into an exciting future. With that spirit in mind, here's my take on some of what I expect to be the biggest trends and most important developments in 2019.Prediction 1: Foldable Phones Will Outsell 5G Phones At this point, everyone knows that 2019 will see the 'official' debut of two very exciting technological developments in the mobile world: foldable displays and smartphones equipped with 5G modems. </p><p>Several vendors and carriers have already announced these devices, so now it's just a question of when and how many. Not everyone realizes, however, that the two technologies won't necessarily come hand-in-hand this year: we will see 5G-enabled phones and we will see smartphones with foldable displays. As of yet, it's not clear that we'll see devices that incorporate both capabilities in calendar year 2019. Eventually, of course, we will, but the challenges in bringing each of these cutting-edge technologies to the mass market suggest that some devices will include one or the other. (To be clear, however, the vast majority of smartphones sold in 2019 will have neither an integrated 5G modem nor a foldable display\u2014high prices for both technologies will limit their impact this year.) In the near-term, I'm predicting that foldable display-based phones will be the winner over 5G-equipped phones, because the impact that these bendable screens will have on device usability and form factor are so compelling that I believe consumers will be willing to forgo the potential 5G speed boost. Plus, given concerns about pricing for 5G data plans, limited initial 5G coverage, and the confusing (and, frankly, misleading) claims being made by some US carriers about their 'versions' of 5G, I believe consumers will limit their adoption of 5G until more of these issues become clear. Foldable phones on the other hand\u2014while likely to be expensive\u2014will offer a very clear value benefit that I believe consumers will find even more compelling.Prediction 2: Game Streaming Services Go Mainstream In a year when there's going to be a great deal of attention placed on new entrants to the video streaming market (Apple, Disney, Time Warner, etc.), the surprise breakout winner in cloud-based entertainment in 2019 could actually be game streaming services, such as Microsoft's Project xCloud (based on its Xbox gaming platform) and other possible entrants. The idea with game streaming is to enable people to play top-tier games across a wide range of both older and newer PCs, smartphones, and other devices. Given the tremendous growth in PC and mobile gaming, along with the rise in popularity of eSports, the consumer market is primed for a service (or two) that would allow gamers to play popular high-quality gaming titles across a wide range of different device types and platforms. Of course, game streaming isn't a new concept, and there have been several failed attempts in the past. The challenge is delivering a timely, engaging experience in the often-unpredictable world of cloud-driven connectivity. It's an extraordinarily difficult technical task that requires lag-free responsiveness and high-quality visuals packaged together in an easy-to-use service that consumers would be willing to pay for. Thankfully, a number of important technological advancements are coming together to make this now possible, including improvements in overall connectivity via WiFi (such as with WiFi6) and wide area cellular networks (and 5G should improve things even more). In addition, there's been widespread adoption and optimization of GPUs in cloud-based servers. Most importantly, however, are software advancements that can enable technologies like split or collaborative rendering (where some work is done on the cloud and some on the local device), as well as AI-based predictions of actions that need to be taken or content that needs to be preloaded. Collectively, these and other related technologies seem poised to enable a compelling set of gaming services that could drive impressive levels of revenue for the companies that can successfully deploy them. It's also important to add that although strong growth in game streaming services that are less hardware dependent may imply a negative impact on gaming-specific PCs, GPUs and other game-focused hardware (because people would be able to use older, less powerful devices to run modern games); in fact, the opposite is likely to be true. Game streaming services will likely expose an even wider audience to the most compelling games and that, in turn, will likely inspire more people to purchase gaming-optimized PCs, smartphones, and other devices. The gaming service will give them the opportunity to play (or continue playing) those games in situations or locations where they don't have access to their primary gaming devices.Prediction 3: Multi-Cloud Becomes the Standard in Enterprise Computing The early days of cloud computing in the enterprise featured prediction after prediction of a winner between public cloud vs. private cloud and even of specific cloud platforms within those environments. As we enter 2019, it's becoming abundantly clear that all those arguments were wrong headed and that, in fact, everyone won and everyone lost at the same time. After all, which of those early prognosticators would have ever guessed that in 2018, Amazon would offer a version of Amazon Web Services (called AWS Outpost) that a company could run on Amazon-branded hardware in the company's own data center/private cloud? It turns out that, as with many modern technology developments, there's no single cloud computing solution that works for everybody. Public, private, and hybrid combinations all have their place, and within each of those groups, different platform options all have a role. Yes, Amazon currently leads overall cloud computing, but depending on the type of workload or other requirements, Microsoft's Azure, Google's GCP (Google Cloud Platform), or IBM, Oracle, or SAP cloud offerings might all make sense. The real winner is the cloud computing model, regardless of where or by whom it's being hosted. Not only has cloud computing changed expectations about performance, reliability, and security, the DevOps software development environment it inspired and the container-focused application architecture it enabled have radically reshaped how software is written, updated, and deployed. That's why you see companies shifting their focus away from the public infrastructure-based aspects of cloud computing and towards the flexible software environments it enables. This, in turn, is why companies have recognized that leveraging multiple cloud types and cloud vendors isn't a weakness or disjointed strategy, but actually a strength that can be leveraged for future endeavors. With cloud platform vendors expected to work towards more interoperability (and transportability) of workloads across different platforms in 2019, it's very clear that the multi-cloud world is here to stay.Prediction 4: On-Device AI Will Start to Shift the Conversation About Data Privacy One of the least understood aspects of using tech-based devices, mobile applications, and other cloud-based services is how much of our private, personal data is being shared in the process\u2014often without our even knowing it. Over the past year, however, we've all started to become painfully aware of how big (and far-reaching) the problem of data privacy is. As a result, there's been an enormous spotlight placed on data handling practices employed by tech companies. At the same time, expectations about technology's ability to personalize these apps and services to meet our specific interests, location, and context have also continued to grow. People want and expect technology to be 'smarter' about them, because it makes the process of using these devices and services faster, more efficient, and more compelling. The dilemma, of course, is that to enable this customization requires the use of and access to some level of personal data, usage patterns, etc. Up until now, that has typically meant that most any action you take or information you share has been uploaded to some type of cloud-based service, compiled and compared to data from other people, and then used to generate some kind of response that's sent back down to you. In theory, this gives you the kind of customized and personalized experience you want, but at the cost of your data being shared with a whole host of different companies. Starting in 2019, more of the data analysis work could start being done directly on devices, without the need to share all of it externally, thanks to the AI-based software and hardware capabilities becoming available on our personal devices. Specifically, the idea of doing on-device AI inferencing (and even some basic on-device training) is now becoming a practical reality thanks to work by semiconductor-related companies like Qualcomm, Arm, Intel, Apple, and many others. What this means is that\u2014if app and cloud service providers enable it (and that's a big if)\u2014you could start getting the same level of customization and personalization you've become accustomed to, but without having to share your data with the cloud. Of course, it isn't likely that everyone on the web is going to start doing this all at once (if they do it at all), so inevitably some of your data will still be shared. However, if some of the biggest software and cloud service providers (think Facebook, Google, Twitter, Yelp, etc.) started to enable this, it could start to meaningfully address the legitimate data privacy concerns that have been raised over the last year or so. Apple, to its credit, started talking about this concept several years back (remember differential privacy?) and already stores things like facial recognition scans and other personally identifiable information only on individuals' devices. Over the next year, I expect to see many more hardware and component makers take this to the next level by talking not just about their on-device data security features, but also about how onboard AI can enhance privacy. Let's hope that more software and cloud-service providers enable it as well.Prediction 5: Tech Industry Regulation in the US Becomes Real Regardless of whether major social media firms and tech companies enable these onboard AI capabilities or not, it's clear to me that we've reached a point in the US social consciousness that tech companies managing all this personal data need to be regulated. While I'll be the first to admit that the slow-moving government regulatory process is ill-matched to the rapidly evolving tech industry, that's still not an excuse for not doing anything. As a result, in 2019, I believe the first government regulations of the tech industry will be put into place, specifically around data privacy and disclosure rules. It's clear from the backlash that companies like Facebook have been receiving that many consumers are very concerned with how much data has been collected not only about their online activities, but their location, and many other very specific (and very private) aspects of their lives. Despite the companies' claims that we gave over most all of this information willingly (thanks to the confusingly worded and never read license agreements), common sense tells us that the vast majority of us did not understand or know how the data was being analyzed and used. Legislators from both parties recognize these concerns, and despite the highly polarized political climate, are likely going to easily agree to some kind of limitations on the type of data that's collected, how it's analyzed, and how it's ultimately used. Whether the US builds on Europe's GDPR regulations, the privacy laws instated in California last year, or something entirely different remains to be seen, but now that the value and potential impact of personal data has been made clear, there's no doubt we will see laws that control the valued commodity that it is. Prediction 6: Personal Robotics Will Become an Important New Category The idea of a 'sociable' robot\u2014one that people can have relatively natural interactions with\u2014has been the lore of science fiction for decades. From Lost in Space to Star Wars to WallE and beyond, interactive robotic machines have been the stuff of our creative imagination for some time. In 2019, however, I believe we will start to see more practical implementations of personal robotics devices from a number of major tech vendors. Amazon, for example, is widely rumored to be working on some type of personal assistant-based robot leveraging their Alexa voice-based digital assistant technology. Exactly what form and what sort of capabilities the device might take are unclear, but some type of mobile (as in, able to move, not small and lightweight!) visual smart display that also offers mechanical capabilities (lifting, carrying, sweeping, etc.) might make sense. While a number of companies have tried and failed to bring personal robotics to the mainstream in the recent past, I believe a number of technologies and concepts are coming together to make the potential more viable this year. First, from a purely mechanical perspective, the scarily realistic capabilities now exhibited by companies like Boston Dynamics show how far the movement, motion, and environmental awareness capabilities have advanced in the robotics world. In addition, the increasingly conversational and empathetic AI capabilities now being brought to voice-based digital assistants, such as Alexa and Google Assistant, demonstrate how our exchanges with machines are becoming more natural. Finally, the appeal of products like Sony's updated Aibo robotic dog also highlight the willingness that people are starting to show towards interacting with machines in new ways. In addition, robotics-focused hardware and software development platforms, like Nvidia's latest Jetson AGX Xavier board and Isaac software development kit, key advances in computer vision, as well as the growing ecosystem around the open source ROS (Robot Operating System) all underscore the growing body of work being done to enable both commercial and consumer applications of robots in 2019.Prediction 7: Cloud-Based Services Will Make Operating Systems Irrelevant People have been incorrectly predicting the death of operating systems and unique platforms for years (including me back in December of 2015), but this time it's really (probably!) going to happen. All kidding aside, it's becoming increasingly clear as we enter 2019 that cloud-based services are rendering the value of proprietary platforms much less relevant for our day-to-day use. Sure, the initial interface of a device and the means for getting access to applications and data are dependent on the unique vagaries of each tech vendor's platform, but the real work (or real play) of what we do on our devices is becoming increasingly separated from the artificial world of operating system user interfaces. In both the commercial and consumer realms, it's now much easier to get access to what it is we want to do, regardless of the underlying platform. On the commercial side, the increasing power of desktop and application virtualization tools from the likes of Citrix and VMWare, as well as moves like Microsoft's delivering Windows desktops from the cloud all demonstrate how much simpler it is to run critical business applications on virtually any device. Plus, the growth of private (on-premise), hybrid, and public cloud environments is driving the creation of platform-independent applications that rely on nothing more than a browser to function. Toss in Microsoft's decision to leverage the open-source Chromium browser rendering engine for its next version of its Edge browser, and it's clear we're rapidly moving to a world in which the cloud finally and truly is the platform. On the consumer side, the rapid growth of platform-independent streaming services is also promoting the disappearance (or at least sublimation) of proprietary operating systems. From Netflix to Spotify to even the game streaming services mentioned in Prediction 2, successful cloud-based services are building most all of their capabilities and intelligence into the cloud and relying less and less on OS-specific apps. In fact, it will be very interesting to see how open and platform agnostic Apple makes its new video streaming service. If they make it too focused on Apple OS-based device users only, they risk having a very small impact (even with their large and well-heeled installed base), particularly given the strength of the competition. Crossover work and consumer products like Office 365 are also shedding any meaningful ties to specific operating systems and instead are focused on delivering a consistent experience across different operating systems, screen sizes, and device types. The concept of abstraction goes well beyond the OS level. New software being developed to leverage the wide range of different AI-specific accelerators from vendors like Qualcomm, Intel, and Arm (AI cores in their case) is being written at a high-enough level to allow them to work across a very heterogeneous computing environment. While this might have a modest impact on full performance potential, the flexibility and broad support that this approach enables is well worth it. In fact, it's generally true that the more heterogeneous the computing environment grows, the less important operating systems and proprietary platforms become. In 2019, it's going to be a very heterogenous computing world, hence my belief that the time for this prediction has finally come.

We talk openly and candidly about the violence women of color and transgender women of color experience. Men not only tweet their support of abortion rights, they also declare their commitment to gender equality through initiatives like the U.N.'s HeforShe.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> See also: 13 sentimental gifts that celebrate sisterhood</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  These are just a few examples of the groundswell of support for gender equality. There are no signs of the momentum slowing, but it can be difficult to know which efforts to prioritize.To help focus your attention, we've chosen seven ways to support women in 2016:</p><p> 1. Include all women. Feminism lives up to its promise of equality when those who practice it understand how race, class, religion, education, sexuality and other factors affect a woman's experience in the world. On too many occasions, well-meaning activists have fought for equality without considering how their efforts might not help or even further marginalize certain women. A white, straight woman working a corporate job, for example, can fight for equality in the workplace, but that's likely to mean something entirely different to a low-income, queer woman of color making an hourly wage. If you need a reminder of how these blind spots can instantly reveal the painful conflicts within feminism, just revisit Patricia Arquette's controversial Oscar remarks, which neglected the essential role people of color have played in the movement. Focusing on disparities and listening to different voices shouldn't divide people, but instead unify diverse groups in the name of achieving parity.</p><p> 2. Hear all women. Republican presidential candidate <person><nameText>Carly Fiorina </nameText></person>raised a complicated question this year: Can you champion women but not the policies that arguably lead to greater equality and autonomy? Fiorina, for example, has said she wants women to live they life they choose, yet she also opposes abortion and federal paid leave.</p><p><person><nameText>Carly Fiorina </nameText></person>gives a surprising answer when asked about which woman should appear on the $10 bill. While one might disagree with Fiorina's solutions to many of the problems women face, it's important to take her views seriously \u2014 and, in general, those of women whose politics don't align with traditional feminism. Like Fiorina, they may think deeply about what it means to empower women, and that is worth discussing. Achieving gender equality will be impossible if we can't listen to all women who care about these issues.</p><p> 3. Fight for reproductive rights. Next spring the Supreme Court will hear its first abortion case in a decade. Abortion rights advocates argue that Texas' restrictive abortion access legislation, passed in 2013, creates an \"undue burden\" for women seeking to end a pregnancy. If the justices agree, the decision may well affirm the constitutional right to an abortion. If they don't, the justices could effectively dismantle Roe v. Wade and allow states to keep newly passed laws strictly regulating abortion as well as permit them to pass new ones.</p><p>   Check out our billboards in Times Square today!

Use #BirthControlHelpedMe.</p><p> A photo posted by Planned Parenthood (@plannedparenthood) on Jun 22, 2015 at 9:10am PDT</p><p>  At the same time, congressional Republicans have moved to defund both Planned Parenthood and federal legislation that provides reproductive health care, including birth control, to low-income women. Research shows, however, that women 's lives are greatly improved, particularly in terms of education and income, when they can control their reproductive health.</p><p> 4. Press for paid family leave. While many nations are proud to give new mothers get paid leave, the United States is the only industrialized country in the world without a law guaranteeing that benefit. Only 12% of workers have access to paid leave through their employer. Federal law providing 12-weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave covers just 59% of workers.But research shows that when women have access to paid leave, they remain in the workforce and may even earn more. While paid leave is important for new mothers and fathers alike, it has the potential to transform women's careers and lives. In the last year, paid leave has actually become a recruiting and retention tool among big tech companies; Amazon, Adobe, Intel and Netflix all expanded their leave programs in 2015. That sends a clear message to corporate America, but one that doesn't benefit low- and middle-income women much. There is Congressional legislation, however, that would guarantee up to 12 weeks of paid leave for most Americans by creating a federal insurance program. It has no chance of passing Congress at the moment, but that will change the more voters pressure their elected representatives on the issue.</p><p> 5. Insist on equal pay. You've probably heard the stat before: On average, American women make $0.79 for every dollar a white man earns. Most women of color make even less. In the UK, the mean average pay gap is 14%. The numbers are striking, but the pay gap isn't as simple as it seems. Women typically make less than men for a number of reasons. They face pressure to reduce their hours or quit the workforce once they become parents. They are concentrated in traditionally feminine jobs like nursing, teaching and childcare, which often pay substantially less than fields dominated by men.</p><p>  Hispanic women are paid 54% of what white men are paid: <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/BqNwQquQhi\">https://t.co/BqNwQquQhi</url> #TheReal10 via @adrimartinez04 pic.twitter.com/uE2ZbXI0IG \u2014 AAUW (@AAUW) November 2, 2015</p><p>  And yet, those factors can 't fully explain the gap. As we've learned from Hollywood this year, not even an A-list, Oscar-winning actress like Jennifer Lawrence is compensated at the same rate as her less accomplished male co-stars. But this isn't about multimillionaires. Tackling the complexity of the pay gap \u2014 and demanding equal pay \u2014 means putting more money into the hands of women so they can support themselves and their families. You can start making a difference by raising awareness of the issue, asking for greater workplace transparency on pay and, if you're a manager, ensuring that male and female employees with the same qualifications and experience are compensated equally.</p><p> 6. Champion LGBT equality. Discrimination and bias has far-reaching consequences even if you don't identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. A workplace, for example, that's hostile to people of different sexual and gender identities isn't a fair or equal one. Even though gay and lesbian couples won the right to same-sex marriage this summer, they still don't have legal protection from discrimination in many states across the country. Similarly, despite growing acceptance of transgender people, they routinely endure violence and harassment as well as discrimination when it comes to employment, housing and healthcare. Transgender women also aren't welcomed into the movement by all feminists, and that has created divisions where unity could instead prevail. Fighting for LGBT equality, in the U.S. and abroad, makes it possible for the movement to help all women.</p><p> 7. Embrace the words \"feminist\" and \"feminism.\" Feminism remains a dirty word in many quarters. But simply put, the movement is about equality of opportunity. Each time you embrace the label and demonstrate its meaning and potential, you make it easier for others to do so as well. If you need inspiration, just watch this video of Malala, a Pakistani activist for girl's rights, explaining how she came to embrace the word feminist.</p><p>   Into Film Festival opening Q&amp;A Today I met Malala. She was giving, utterly graceful, compelling and intelligent. That might sound obvious but I was struck by this even more in person. There are lots of NGOs out there in the world doing great things... But if there were one I would put my money on to succeed and make change on this planet, it would be hers. (The Malala Fund). Malala isn't messing around or mincing her words (one of the many reasons I love her). She has the strength of her convictions coupled with the kind of determination I rarely encounter... And it doesn't seem to have been diminished by the success she has already had. And lastly\u2026She has a sense of peace around her. I leave this for last because it is perhaps the most important. Maybe as a result of what she has been through? I personally think it is just who she is\u2026Perhaps the most moving moment of today for me was when Malala addressed the issue of feminism. To give you some background, I had initially planned to ask Malala whether or not she was a feminist but then researched to see whether she had used this word to describe herself. Having seen that she hadn't, I decided to take the question out before the day of our interview. To my utter shock Malala put the question back into one of her own answers and identified herself. Maybe feminist isn't the easiest word to use... But she did it ANYWAY. You can probably see in the interview how I felt about this. She also gave me time at the end of the Q&amp;A to speak about some of my own work, which she most certainly didn't need to do, I was there to interview her. I think this gesture is so emblematic of what Malala and I went on to discuss. I've spoken before on what a controversial word feminism is currently. More recently, I am learning what a factionalized movement it is too. We are all moving towards the same goal. Let's not make it scary to say you're a feminist. I want to make it a welcoming and inclusive movement. Let's join our hands and move together so we can make real change. Malala and I are pretty serious about it but we need you.

'Digital health' will be redefined as these disruptive technologies push the boundaries of what's possible in healthcare. Asia will be a major player, and nations all across the globe will prioritize access to affordable, quality care.Remote Self-Care Is Set for Rapid GrowthDigital healthcare technology such as telehealth platforms and mHealth applications will help patients treat and care for themselves, lowering strain on emergency departments and urgent care providers. This industry is expected to grow 30% and surpass $25 billion in 2019[1]. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://cdn.dribbble.com/users/1276368/screenshots/3782467/isometric-dribbbxxx.jpg\">https://cdn.dribbble.com/users/1276368/screenshots/3782467/isometric-dribbbxxx.jpg</url> Chronic sufferers and older patients will get the most benefit out of remote self-care. To keep track of health records, insurance reimbursement will start recognizing this preliminary method of healthcare alongside behavioral health solutions, dental benefits, prescription management, and nutrition.Leveraging a Data-Rich LandscapeBig data is a trend that can't be ignored in healthcare.By this time next year, 50% of all healthcare providers and hospitals will have some sort of data analytics workflow in place. Smaller multivariate data can be more meaningful throughout each specialty, according to experts. Overall, however, the specialties' data analytics will still take inputs from the other specialties to refine their insights. Data being captured and analyzed will include drug efficacy and utilization, billing discrepancies, eligibility for clinical trials, treatment efficacy and variability, and remote self-care success rates.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://blog.patientping.com/hubfs/AdobeStock_71229456%20%5BConverted%5D.png?t=1534950247203\">https://blog.patientping.com/hubfs/AdobeStock_71229456%20%5BConverted%5D.png?t=1534950247203</url> Predictive analytics can be implemented soon after data collection begins. Predictive analytics applications include population care management, operational automation for everyone involved in the healthcare chain, and improved treatment recommendations. AI will push data analytics further with constant, automatic refinement of algorithms.Augmenting Every Aspect of Healthcare With AIIn 2019, AI will surpass $1.7 billion in value just in thehealth tech application[2] industry alone. The technology will eventually get implemented in almost every aspect of healthcare, and the great thing about AI is that its impact can be seen quickly if the algorithms are set up correctly. AI will also augment data platforms, improving productivity by 10-15% over the next two to three years. We also expect AI application development costs to drastically decrease over time. Right now, it may not be cost-effective for many hospitals to budget AI into their operations. But once the benefits of implementing AI become clearer to these organizations, it won't be long before they're making room for it as well.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://cdn.dogtownmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/26133351/2636_VitalSigns_Blog_post.jpg?t=1542646312756\">https://cdn.dogtownmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/26133351/2636_VitalSigns_Blog_post.jpg?t=1542646312756</url> AI will impact every specialty by bringing better image diagnostics, risk analytics, and drug discovery methods. The technology, combined with machine learning, will forever change how patients interact with their providers and the healthcare setting.Voicing Your Needs Will Become EasierOur world evolved from voice calls to text messages to voice messages. It's often easier and faster to quickly record an explanation and send it to another person than it is to text back and forth or have a conversation. Specialized startups like Boston[3]-based Nuance and Orbita will play alongside the big tech companies like Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Apple. These companies will bring targeted voice capabilities to healthcare while regulators will work on HIPAA-compliant chatbot and voice applications.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.news-medical.net/image.axd?picture=2017%2F8%2FSpeech_Recognition_in_Healthcare_--_a_Significant_Improvement_or_Severe_Headache.jpg\">https://www.news-medical.net/image.axd?picture=2017%2F8%2FSpeech_Recognition_in_Healthcare_--_a_Significant_Improvement_or_Severe_Headache.jpg</url> Right now, voice transcription technology isn't perfect, and it works the best with bite-sized chunks of audio. But with the budgets and funding that the aforementioned companies collectively have, we have no doubt voice technology will experience a dramatic improvement by this time next year. It will unlock major benefits for patients with chronic illnesses, older patients, as well as medical scribes and physician's assistants.Asia Will Emerge as a Major Health Tech InnovatorExpect to see Asia take on a much more active role in the future of health tech. The continent, home to almost 3 billion people, will become a major innovator for global drug and device original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Emerging markets will add 20-30% more value to the pharmaceutical industry, which will grow 10-15% in 2019. Drug and device OEMs will market their products to Asian consumers, their lifestyles, and their buying power.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://evaluationmatters.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/drowningindata.png\">http://evaluationmatters.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/drowningindata.png</url> 10% of healthcare research and development will be reinvested into local innovation in Asia in 2019. The Asia-Pacific region is growing the fastest (at a rate of over 30%) for cell therapy late-stage clinical trials. This is a great indicator of the growing genomics interest in Asia; China is expected to invest more in genomics over the next five years.Tapping Into the Benefits of BlockchainBlockchain will no longer be a foreign technology for healthcare; it'll be implemented commercially to help track supplies, patient care, and revenues. By this time next year, 5-10% of enterprise healthcare blockchain applications will be sold commercially. Startups like Guardtime, Change Healthcare, and Hashed Health will lead this charge, while healthcare ICOs and new startup proofs-of-concept will race to make their own mark on commercial healthcare.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*_V3Fvgk8TNPEOnHByQ-vQg.png\">https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*_V3Fvgk8TNPEOnHByQ-vQg.png</url> While blockchain applications will only begin to blossom in 2019, it leaves a lot of room for innovation on where blockchain can be applied in the healthcare industry.An Improved Insurance ExperiencePrivate insurance companies will constantly be refining payment and billing regulations from 2019 onwards. Right now, insurance is outdated and failing to help patients receive affordable care. In fact, in 2018, insurance companies saw 1.5% less growth.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://patientengagementhit.com/images/site/features/_large/post-discharge-follow-up-care-use.jpg\">https://patientengagementhit.com/images/site/features/_large/post-discharge-follow-up-care-use.jpg</url> To circumvent their demise, insurance providers are letting patients see their data and adding more self-care treatments into their coverage. By the end of 2019, insurance companies will have added 5-10% more lifestyle and data-driven policies and services to their plans. Premiums will eventually be personalized based on a patient's data, health statistics, and self-care needs.Healthcare's FutureBy 2025, healthcare will have evolved dramatically. And 2019 will be the year we start to see and feel the benefits that technologies like AI, blockchain, and data science can bring to the industry. We can't wait to see how health tech fosters better, more affordable patient outcomes while enabling providers to have more work-life balance.

Meanwhile, Facebook (FB) is starting to feel the effects of restrictions on both ad targeting and measurement, as the company says that \"the majority of that impact lies in front of us.\" [Reference Link]:[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/facebook-google-and-apple-face-real-regulatory-risk-from-the-ftc-and-themselves-51581717358?mod=past_editions\">https://www.barrons.com/articles/facebook-google-and-apple-face-real-regulatory-risk-from-the-ftc-and-themselves-51581717358?mod=past_editions</url>]|</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FLYCOM-362030597</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FLYCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y6W-YWH1-DYWB-B0K3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">295234</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"162\"/><timeReceived>8:17 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Comtex News Network, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 TheFlyOnTheWall.com</copyright><bodyText><p>This content is provided to LexisNexis by Comtex News Network, Inc.</p></bodyText><publicationName>Theflyonthewall.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33010\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 15, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Now, Silicon Valley is doing its best to ensure that President Donald Trump is defeated in November.Several Big Tech companies have made calculated policy reforms, bowing to leftist demands and bending under the weight of a growing advertising boycott. The result is an effort to rig the outcome of the presidential election under the pretext of fighting so-called hate. It's what President of the Media Research Center Brent Bozell declared two weeks ago[1]that 'Big Tech has already made its choice for president in November.'In the past month, Trump and his followers have been increasingly censored by major Big Tech platforms. </p><p>Twitch[2], Twitter[3], and Snapchat[4] have censored Trump himself. Meanwhile, his followers on Reddit[5] and other platforms have been purged. If that weren't bad enough, platforms have been used to derail his campaign's efforts. YouTube[6] restricted no less than 300 pro-Trump ads in the Summer of 2019 alone; Chinese government overseen platform TikTok[7] was reportedly used to sabotage a Trump campaign rally; and prominent liberal Google critic Dr. Robert Epstein[8] wrote that Google gave at least 2.6 million votes to Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016 and that it could sway 'upward of 15 million votes' in the Democrats' favor in 2020.Based on the record of recent events, it's easy to see that Big Tech's meddling into politics would put conspiracies about Russian interference to shame.RedditJust yesterday, Reddit purged politically incorrect forums[9], including: r/The_Donald, r/ChapoTrap and about 2,000 other communities. The platform reportedly issued a policy update after 'Black Lives Matter protests led several popular Reddit forums to go dark temporarily in protest of what they called the company's lax policies around hosting and promoting racist content.'Reddit also updated its terms of service with a blog 'Promoting Hate Based on Identity or Vulnerability,'[10] which unabashedly proclaimed it will enforce a double standard on who is allowed to be criticized. In short, a person who is in the 'racial minority' may call somebody in the racial majority 'sub-human and inferior' with impunity.TwitchThat same day, video game broadcasting platform Twitch, owned by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, 'temporarily banned President Trump's account for 'hateful conduct' stemming from footage of the president's speeches,' Fox News reported[11].TwitterTrump speculated in a late June interview[12] with The Federalist publisher Ben Domenech[13] that his Twitter account's days are numbered[14]. The president and 'others in the White House' reportedly believe Twitter will ban him this Fall, shortly before the 2020 election itself. But if the platform does ban Trump, as the president suggested, doing so may 'hurt them more than they realize.'Twitter has only grown bolder about its censorship as the election approaches. In late March, Twitter fact-checked Trump[15] for suggesting that mail-in ballots could lead to voter fraud, a concern even The New York Times has acknowledged to be valid[16].Twitter followed up[17] by placing an interstitial, or filter, over Trump's tweet condemning violent riots over the death of Minneapolis resident George Floyd in police custody. It acted similarly in June[18] when Trump vowed to meet rioters who would destroy Washington, D.C. 'with serious force.'Even before these most recent acts of censorship, Twitter had racked up an impressive record of liberal bias[19], including allowing blatant Chinese propaganda to be spread among Americans. Two examples of this would be when Twitter allowed a Chinese official to scapegoat the U.S. military for spreading the virus and when the platform allowed a lego-based propaganda video published by a Chinese embassy erroneously blasting the American government for not handling the virus properly[20].GoogleDonald Trump, Jr. [21]recently accused Google of 'election interference' after the search engine giant had reportedly demonetized skeptic news website ZeroHedge and sent a warning that it would take similar action against The Federalist. NBC News alleged that[22] 'A Google spokesperson said in an email on Monday that it demonetized the websites after determining they violated its policies on content related to race.'Google also flip-flopped on its ad policies[23] after massive pushback by liberals who complained that they could specifically benefit the Trump campaign. Guerilla journalism group Project Veritas published a video showing Google Responsible Innovation Head Jen Gennai suggesting that 'breaking up Google' would not 'prevent the next Trump situation.'[24] She also mused how changes in Google's secret algorithms could have prevented his election from happening in the first place.YouTubeYouTube, a sister company to Google, has also been infamous for its liberal bias. YouTube has removed hundreds of ads from Trump's reelection campaign[25] over the Summer of 2019 alone.If Big Tech censorship wasn't cartoonishly evil enough, YouTube, which is blocked in China by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has allegedly censored comments on China's behalf.[26] Oculus and Anduril founder Palmer Luckey[27] claimed that YouTube deleted his comments on its platform. He tweeted, 'YouTube has deleted every comment I ever made about the Wumao ((\u4e94\u6bdb), an internet propaganda division of the Chinese Communist Party.'According to a 950-page leak from Google whistleblower Zachary Vorhies, YouTube has a 'Twiddler' system for ranking search results in order to bury content[28] the platform's consider controversial.FacebookFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, having previously given lip service to the notion of free speech[29] on his platform, has recently been bullied through internal and external pressure to alter Facebook's policies[30]. He declared in a livestream that his platform would adopt ' some new policies to prohibit a wider category of hateful content in ads.' He further stated, 'we want to do more here to prohibit the kind of divisive and inflammatory rhetoric that is being used to sow discord.' [Emphasis added.]Zuckerberg also outlined new policies aimed at comments from politicians \u2014 in other words, Trump. 'Even if a politician or government official says it, if we determine that content may lead to violence or deprive people of their right to vote, we will take that content down,' he said.TikTokA newcomer to Big Tech, Chinese government overseen app TikTok's users took credit for sabotaging a Trump rally[31] in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Multiple outlets revealed that internet users gleefully trolled the Trump campaign. '[T]he idea to troll President Donald Trump with false ticket reservations to Saturday's rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma came from TikTok,' NBC News reported[32].SnapchatSnapchat recently decided to stop Trump from being able to promote himself[33] on the platform in the same way other public figures and politicians do to reach young voters. Snap CEO Evan Spiegel cited that the First Amendment is written to 'protect individuals and private businesses from the government.' What he failed to mention was that Section 230 protections are themselves a form of government regulation that can be changed.Conservatives are under attack. Demand that Big Tech be held to account to mirror the First Amendment while providing transparency, clarity on 'hate speech' and equal footing for conservatives.

Now, Silicon Valley is doing its best to ensure that President Donald Trump is defeated in November.Several Big Tech companies have made calculated policy reforms, bowing to leftist demands and bending under the weight of a growing advertising boycott. The result is an effort to rig the outcome of the presidential election under the pretext of fighting so-called hate. It's what President of the Media Research Center Brent Bozell declared two weeks ago[1]that 'Big Tech has already made its choice for president in November.'In the past month, Trump and his followers have been increasingly censored by major Big Tech platforms. </p><p>Twitch[2], Twitter[3], and Snapchat[4] have censored Trump himself. Meanwhile, his followers on Reddit[5] and other platforms have been purged. If that weren't bad enough, platforms have been used to derail his campaign's efforts. YouTube[6] restricted no less than 300 pro-Trump ads in the Summer of 2019 alone; Chinese government overseen platform TikTok[7] was reportedly used to sabotage a Trump campaign rally; and prominent liberal Google critic Dr. Robert Epstein[8] wrote that Google gave at least 2.6 million votes to Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016 and that it could sway 'upward of 15 million votes' in the Democrats' favor in 2020.Based on the record of recent events, it's easy to see that Big Tech's meddling into politics would put conspiracies about Russian interference to shame.RedditJust yesterday, Reddit purged politically incorrect forums[9], including: r/The_Donald, r/ChapoTrap and about 2,000 other communities. The platform reportedly issued a policy update after 'Black Lives Matter protests led several popular Reddit forums to go dark temporarily in protest of what they called the company's lax policies around hosting and promoting racist content.'Reddit also updated its terms of service with a blog 'Promoting Hate Based on Identity or Vulnerability,'[10] which unabashedly proclaimed it will enforce a double standard on who is allowed to be criticized. In short, a person who is in the 'racial minority' may call somebody in the racial majority 'sub-human and inferior' with impunity.TwitchThat same day, video game broadcasting platform Twitch, owned by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, 'temporarily banned President Trump's account for 'hateful conduct' stemming from footage of the president's speeches,' Fox News reported[11].TwitterTrump speculated in a late June interview[12] with The Federalist publisher Ben Domenech[13] that his Twitter account's days are numbered[14]. The president and 'others in the White House' reportedly believe Twitter will ban him this Fall, shortly before the 2020 election itself. But if the platform does ban Trump, as the president suggested, doing so may 'hurt them more than they realize.'Twitter has only grown bolder about its censorship as the election approaches. In late March, Twitter fact-checked Trump[15] for suggesting that mail-in ballots could lead to voter fraud, a concern even The New York Times has acknowledged to be valid[16].Twitter followed up[17] by placing an interstitial, or filter, over Trump's tweet condemning violent riots over the death of Minneapolis resident George Floyd in police custody. It acted similarly in June[18] when Trump vowed to meet rioters who would destroy Washington, D.C. 'with serious force.'Even before these most recent acts of censorship, Twitter had racked up an impressive record of liberal bias[19], including allowing blatant Chinese propaganda to be spread among Americans. Two examples of this would be when Twitter allowed a Chinese official to scapegoat the U.S. military for spreading the virus and when the platform allowed a lego-based propaganda video published by a Chinese embassy erroneously blasting the American government for not handling the virus properly[20].GoogleDonald Trump, Jr. [21]recently accused Google of 'election interference' after the search engine giant had reportedly demonetized skeptic news website ZeroHedge and sent a warning that it would take similar action against The Federalist. NBC News alleged that[22] 'A Google spokesperson said in an email on Monday that it demonetized the websites after determining they violated its policies on content related to race.'Google also flip-flopped on its ad policies[23] after massive pushback by liberals who complained that they could specifically benefit the Trump campaign. Guerilla journalism group Project Veritas published a video showing Google Responsible Innovation Head Jen Gennai suggesting that 'breaking up Google' would not 'prevent the next Trump situation.'[24] She also mused how changes in Google's secret algorithms could have prevented his election from happening in the first place.YouTubeYouTube, a sister company to Google, has also been infamous for its liberal bias. YouTube has removed hundreds of ads from Trump's reelection campaign[25] over the Summer of 2019 alone.If Big Tech censorship wasn't cartoonishly evil enough, YouTube, which is blocked in China by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has allegedly censored comments on China's behalf.[26] Oculus and Anduril founder Palmer Luckey[27] claimed that YouTube deleted his comments on its platform. He tweeted, 'YouTube has deleted every comment I ever made about the Wumao ((  ), an internet propaganda division of the Chinese Communist Party.'According to a 950-page leak from Google whistleblower Zachary Vorhies, YouTube has a 'Twiddler' system for ranking search results in order to bury content[28] the platform's consider controversial.FacebookFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, having previously given lip service to the notion of free speech[29] on his platform, has recently been bullied through internal and external pressure to alter Facebook's policies[30]. He declared in a livestream that his platform would adopt ' some new policies to prohibit a wider category of hateful content in ads.' He further stated, 'we want to do more here to prohibit the kind of divisive and inflammatory rhetoric that is being used to sow discord.' [Emphasis added.]Zuckerberg also outlined new policies aimed at comments from politicians   in other words, Trump. 'Even if a politician or government official says it, if we determine that content may lead to violence or deprive people of their right to vote, we will take that content down,' he said.TikTokA newcomer to Big Tech, Chinese government overseen app TikTok's users took credit for sabotaging a Trump rally[31] in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Multiple outlets revealed that internet users gleefully trolled the Trump campaign. '[T]he idea to troll President Donald Trump with false ticket reservations to Saturday's rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma came from TikTok,' NBC News reported[32].SnapchatSnapchat recently decided to stop Trump from being able to promote himself[33] on the platform in the same way other public figures and politicians do to reach young voters. Snap CEO Evan Spiegel cited that the First Amendment is written to 'protect individuals and private businesses from the government.' What he failed to mention was that Section 230 protections are themselves a form of government regulation that can be changed.Conservatives are under attack. Demand that Big Tech be held to account to mirror the First Amendment while providing transparency, clarity on 'hate speech' and equal footing for conservatives.

Now, Silicon Valley is doing its best to ensure that President Donald Trump is defeated in November.   Several Big Tech companies have made calculated policy reforms, bowing to leftist demands and bending under the weight of a growing advertising boycott. The result is an effort to rig the outcome of the presidential election under the pretext of fighting so-called hate. It\u2019s what President of the Media Research Center Brent Bozell declared two weeks ago   that \u201cBig Tech has already made its choice for president in November.\u201d       In the past month, Trump and his followers have been increasingly censored by major Big Tech platforms. Twitch , Twitter , and Snapchat have censored Trump himself. Meanwhile, his followers on Reddit and other platforms have been purged. If that weren\u2019t bad enough, platforms have been used to derail his campaign\u2019s efforts. YouTube restricted no less than 300 pro-Trump ads in the Summer of 2019 alone; Chinese government overseen platform TikTok was reportedly used to sabotage a Trump campaign rally; and prominent liberal Google critic Dr. Robert Epstein wrote that Google gave at least 2.6 million votes to Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016 and that it could sway \u201cupward of 15 million votes\u201d in the Democrats\u2019 favor in 2020.    Based on the record of recent events, it\u2019s easy to see that Big Tech\u2019s meddling into politics would put conspiracies about Russian interference to shame.     Reddit    Just yesterday, Reddit purged politically incorrect forums , including: r/The_Donald, r/ChapoTrap and about 2,000 other communities. The platform reportedly issued a policy update after \u201cBlack Lives Matter protests led several popular Reddit forums to go dark temporarily in protest of what they called the company\u2019s lax policies around hosting and promoting racist content.\u201d    Reddit also updated its terms of service with a blog \u201cPromoting Hate Based on Identity or Vulnerability,\u201d which unabashedly proclaimed it will enforce a double standard on who is allowed to be criticized. In short, a person who is in the \u201cracial minority\u201d may call somebody in the racial majority \u201csub-human and inferior\u201d with impunity.    Twitch    That same day, video game broadcasting platform Twitch, owned by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, \u201ctemporarily banned President Trump\u2019s account for 'hateful conduct' stemming from footage of the president\u2019s speeches,\u201d Fox News reported .     Twitter    Trump speculated in a late June interview with The Federalist publisher Ben Domenech that his Twitter account\u2019s days are numbered . The president and \u201cothers in the White House\u201d reportedly believe Twitter will ban him this Fall, shortly before the 2020 election itself. But if the platform does ban Trump, as the president suggested, doing so may \u201churt them more than they realize.\u201d    Twitter has only grown bolder about its censorship as the election approaches. In late March, Twitter fact-checked Trump for suggesting that mail-in ballots could lead to voter fraud, a concern even The New York Times has acknowledged to be valid .    Twitter followed up by placing an interstitial, or filter, over Trump\u2019s tweet condemning violent riots over the death of Minneapolis resident George Floyd in police custody. It acted similarly in June when Trump vowed to meet rioters who would destroy Washington, D.C. \u201cwith serious force.\u201d     Even before these most recent acts of censorship, Twitter had racked up an impressive record of liberal bias , including allowing blatant Chinese propaganda to be spread among Americans. Two examples of this would be when Twitter allowed a Chinese official to scapegoat the U.S. military for spreading the virus and when the platform allowed a lego-based propaganda video published by a Chinese embassy erroneously blasting the American government for not handling the virus properly .    Google    Donald Trump, Jr.  recently accused Google of \u201celection interference\u201d after the search engine giant had reportedly demonetized skeptic news website ZeroHedge and sent a warning that it would take similar action against The Federalist. NBC News alleged that \u201cA Google spokesperson said in an email on Monday that it demonetized the websites after determining they violated its policies on content related to race.\u201d     Google also flip-flopped on its ad policies after massive pushback by liberals who complained that they could specifically benefit the Trump campaign. Guerilla journalism group Project Veritas published a video showing Google Responsible Innovation Head Jen Gennai suggesting that \u201cbreaking up Google\u201d would not \u201cprevent the next Trump situation.\u201d She also mused how changes in Google\u2019s secret algorithms could have prevented his election from happening in the first place.    YouTubeYouTube, a sister company to Google, has also  been infamous for its liberal bias. YouTube has removed hundreds of ads from Trump\u2019s reelection campaign over the Summer of 2019 alone.    If Big Tech censorship wasn\u2019t cartoonishly evil enough, YouTube, which is blocked in China by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has allegedly censored comments on China\u2019s behalf. Oculus and Anduril founder Palmer Luckey claimed that YouTube deleted his comments on its platform. He tweeted, \u201cYouTube has deleted every comment I ever made about the Wumao ((\u4e94\u6bdb), an internet propaganda division of the Chinese Communist Party.\u201d    According to a 950-page leak from Google whistleblower Zachary Vorhies, YouTube has a \u201cTwiddler\u201d system for ranking search results in order to bury content the platform\u2019s consider controversial.     FacebookFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, having previously given lip service to the notion of free speech on his platform, has recently been bullied through internal and external pressure to alter Facebook\u2019s policies . He declared in a livestream that his platform would adopt \u201c some new policies to prohibit a wider category of hateful content in ads.\u201d He further stated, \u201cwe want to do more here to prohibit the kind of divisive and inflammatory rhetoric that is being used to sow discord.\u201d [Emphasis added.]    Zuckerberg also outlined new policies aimed at comments from politicians \u2014 in other words, Trump. \u201cEven if a politician or government official says it, if we determine that content may lead to violence or deprive people of their right to vote, we will take that content down,\u201d he said.    TikTok    A newcomer to Big Tech, Chinese government overseen app TikTok\u2019s users took credit for sabotaging a Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Multiple outlets revealed that internet users gleefully trolled the Trump campaign. \u201c[T]he idea to troll President Donald Trump with false ticket reservations to Saturday's rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma came from TikTok,\u201d NBC News reported .    Snapchat    Snapchat recently decided to stop Trump from being able to promote himself on the platform in the same way other public figures and politicians do to reach young voters. Snap CEO Evan Spiegel cited that the First Amendment is written to \u201cprotect individuals and private businesses from the government.\u201d What he failed to mention was that Section 230 protections are themselves a form of government regulation that can be changed.    Conservatives are under attack. Demand that Big Tech be held to account to mirror the First Amendment while providing transparency, clarity on \u201chate speech\u201d and equal footing for conservatives.

Multiplied by social unrest, riots, lawlessness in our cities and the upcoming election, we have yet to see the end of how high sales will go (that's if the supply chain can keep up).  It's been an interesting experience because while the economy around us has spiraled out of control, our industry has not only survived the past 6 months\u2014but has thrived. The only way I can describe it is like being in economic vertigo. Big pieces of the global economy are going one way, but our industry is going another (up).  In this article, I wanted to point out a few brands that I've found worth mentioning (that you might not know about) in the times we find ourselves in. </p><p>If you're a business leader, director, or marketing/sales professional\u2014the below examples will help you think through your offerings, marketing programs, and perhaps spot future trends. Photo Credit: Brenton USA 1. Brenton USA - Finding the WhitespaceBartt Brenton, founder of Brenton USA hunts with ARs. After several years of not finding an AR suitable for hunting, he decided to design his own. Bartt, a former engineer at the world's largest cyclotron at Michigan State University, brings a fresh approach to hunting with his Performance-Grade AR Hunting Rifles. Brenton approaches his rifles from a hunting perspective\u2014rather than a tactical orientation. This approach means hunter specific controls, sizing, calibers (450 BM, 350 Legend, 6.5 Grendel, 6mm ARC etc.), and components designed for the hunter, not the warfighter. The AR provides the hunter with the latest in firearm design and gives hunters who have decades of experience a whole new hunting experience\u2014and for those returning from overseas, a familiar platform to hunt with.Why is this remarkable?I find Brenton USA an excellent example of finding whitespace and growing it an extremely saturated market.Photo Credit: EasyExport 2. EasyExport - International Firearm ExportsUp until now, exporting firearms, parts, optics, accessories, and suppressors has been a tedious and risky proposition. EasyExport, founded by compliance and export attorney professional Jeff Grody, makes it easier for firearm manufacturers to tap international markets without the hassle of navigating the complexity of export regulations. EasyExport enables U.S. sellers and lawful foreign purchasers of firearm products to do business easily and legally online by efficiently solving all the regulatory challenges. EasyExport's interface allows e-commerce companies to vets and qualify approves oversea purchasers that who then seamlessly connect to sellers' their websites to shop. After the purchase is complete, EasyExport clears the order for shipment after the purchaser has been approved.Why is this remarkable?EasyExport solves a complex problem that allows firearm companies to tap the expanding and lucrative international market. EasyExport is currently in BETA with four customers: ETS, Volquartson, TANDEMKROSS[2] and LaRue Tactical and is set to launch later this fall.Photo Credit: Warrior Poet Society 3. Warrior Poet Society - Building a CommunityJohn Lovell, former 2nd Battalion Army Ranger started like most YouTubers: reviewing products and providing shooting tips\u2014 but over time, John's purpose turned into a movement\u2014just as he intended. John's Warrior Poet code: 'Be a protector and lover of people' has attracted over 1 million followers across YouTube, Instagram, and Facebook. Social media giants and big tech continue to demonetize, throttle back and censor accounts that promote capitalism, the military, 2A values, and faith. Seeing the writing on the wall, John and his team launched the Warrior Poet Society Network (WPSN). The channel features content on firearm and personal defense training, leadership, family, and faith that subscribers can access through the website, app, Roku or Amazon Fire.Why is this remarkable?Eventually, YouTube, Google, Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram will pull the plug on 2A content. They are quickly moving this direction already because it's not a matter of if, but when. (Source: Bearing Arms). Several off-YouTube channels exist like Full30.com and GunStreamer.com, but none has attempted to create a branded community with such a defined purpose. I find this remarkable and refreshing.Photo Credit: TRACT Optics 4. TRACT Optics - Trailblazing E-commerceCOVID has changed consumer behavior forever, and according to new data, this means consumers are: Making fewer trips to the store Shopping more online Looking for deals more regularly Aligning with brands that share their values Source: Valassis  Founded by two former employees of Nikon, TRACT Optics, set out to create high-performance optics without the high-retail markup. TRACT launched its online company back in 2015. TRACT utilizes a direct-to-consumer model that allows them to not only manufacture higher-quality performance-grade optics without high retail markup costs but also to deliver a personalized online brand experience. E-commerce sales have jumped over 42% from last year because of COVID and continue to increase. (Source: DigitalCommerce360) What we're seeing is more brands shifting focus to online sales. To some companies surprise, COVID has changed opinions on e-commerce: 'Hey, this e-commerce stuff works.' For example, Daniel Defense launched a full e-commerce website early this year, where customers can order rifles direct. Glock announced last month that it is selling through Guns.com. When brands like DD and Glock make a move like this, you can be sure others are soon to follow. These types of tectonic shifts have the potential to change the entire dealer/distributor model forever.Why is this remarkable?There are an estimated 5 million+ new first-time gun owners as of this writing (Source: National Review). And we're still a few weeks away from the election. 2020 will be the biggest sales year the firearms industry has ever seen. If big brands have forgone e-commerce in the past, you can be sure they're talking about it now. TRACT was one of the early pioneers to step out of industry norms and trail-blaze what is now quickly becoming the new normal.Photo Credit: FalconStrike USA 5. FalconStrike - InnovationFor years, reducing recoil has been left to rubber pads and expensive contraptions built into stocks\u2014until now. Martin Gaudet, founder, and inventor of the patented FalconStrike has come up with a way to reduce recoil through hydraulics in a compact and easy-to-install pad. As Baby Boomers and GenXers get older, FalconStrike helps more aging joints and the less stout deal with the punishing effects of recoil. The pad borrows its design from the aerospace industry where Martin's systems have been used on aircraft and in the space program. This understanding has led to a drastic reduction in recoil energy, push back, muzzle rise, and felt recoil. All of these combined factors give shooters more accuracy, comfort, and more time shooting.Why is this remarkable?Recoil is a constant when it comes to shooting. Less of it is always a good thing. A softer, more comfortable shooting experience makes a better time for all when smaller calibers can't be used.True Velocity 6. True Velocity - Breaking the MoldI always thought that if the industry could figure out how to mainstream caseless or rechargeable ammo\u2014that it would set the industry on a course that resembles Star Wars. But for now, we'll have to settle for True Velocity. True Velocity's premium composite-cased ammunition made from polymer offers distinct advantages over conventional brass-cased munitions, including drastic weight reduction, heat signature elimination, and significantly improved accuracy. The casings are also 100% recyclable.Why is this remarkable?For decades ammunition has relied on brass casings, but now there seems to be an alternative. This kind of thinking will continue to push the ammo segments into new territory and give consumers a second option. The round has been reviewed and reported to be just as accurate if not better than its' brass counterpart. How will this change the future of ammo? Right now, ammo backorders have been rumored to stretch out (for some brands) 2-3 years. Finding new ways to manufacture ammo is a problem that needs to be solved.Photo Credit: Sig Sauer 7. Sig Sauer - Capitalizing on Customer JourneyOne-way to quickly become a top 5 gun manufacturer (outside of winning a lucrative military contract) (Source: Shooting Industry) is through understanding how and when to add products to the customer journey. The thinking is if a customer trusts you for one purchase like a pistol, they will trust you for more, like a rifle, optic, and ammunition. And this is what SIG has done. SIGs' loyal customer base has allowed the company to expand into electro-optics, ammunition, suppressors, and air guns that provide their customers with a 'complete system.'Why is this remarkable?Most firearm manufacturers get stuck in creating just one product\u2014however, to expand and grow, it may be necessary to expand your offering into other segments as long as you can maintain your brand focus and profitability.MantisX 8. MantisX - In-Home Shooting PracticeMantisX is a revolutionary shooting system that helps shooters improve their shooting precision. It can be used on pistols, rifles or shotguns (or bow)\u2014dry fire or live fire. While attached to a pistol or rifle, MantisX analyzes your shooting mechanics, diagnoses issues, and coaches you on how to improve. With so many new shooters coming into the industry and the scarcity of ammo and firearm instructors, MantisX is a good way to practice shooting fundamentals and stay sharp until you can get back to the range.Why is this remarkable?MantisX allows me and other experienced shooters the ability to save on ammo while keeping shooting skills sharp until ammo supplies get restocked. New shooters will also benefit. In conclusion, as the COVID era runs its course, we're seeing many brands strengthen their position, launch products in uncertainty and pivot to new online opportunities\u2014domestically and internationally. We have a few more months to go, but I concur 'What a crazy year it's been!' What about you? What brands have stood out to you during this time?About Josh Claflin Josh Claflin, President at Garrison Everest and StoryBrand Certified Guide, helps companies in the defense, outdoor, tech and shooting sports who are struggling to stand out in the crowded marketplace and attract new customers. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.garrisoneverest.com\">https://www.garrisoneverest.com</url>/[3] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ammoland.com\">https://www.ammoland.com</url>/ [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ammoland.com/tandemkross\">https://www.ammoland.com/tandemkross</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.garrisoneverest.com\">https://www.garrisoneverest.com</url>/ </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-AMMO108083160140754745175776100070</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AMMO-6755</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60YF-PVD1-F03R-N23X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1844\"/><timeReceived>7:25 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>AmmoLand.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 29, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Josh Claflin</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Shooting Industry News</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Criminal Law &amp;

The firm is projecting a $700 billion boom in technology that will help blur the lines between the digital and physical worlds, an investing theme Bank of America calls \"phygital\" tech. Phygital tech includes fields such as virtual and augmented reality, voice and speech recognition and gesture, touch and haptic technologies. Ultimately, this technology could change the way the entire business world designs, manufactures and sells its products. Here are eight phygital <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/best-tech-stocks-to-buy-this-year\">tech stocks to buy</url> from Bank of America.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Apple (ticker: AAPL)</emphasis></p><p>The Apple iPhone helped introduce touchscreen technology, tech that is now considered to be part of the standard UI for most personal devices. Apple has also helped introduce and mainstream phygital tech such as eye tracking, facial recognition technology, speech recognition and augmented reality. Despite its $1.2 trillion market cap and slowing iPhone device sales, Apple shares are up another 71.6% year-to-date. Analyst Wamsi Mohan says the stock remains inexpensive, and Apple's revenue growth is getting more consistent. Bank of America has a \"buy\" rating and $270 price target for <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/articles/pros-and-cons-to-buying-apple-aapl-stock\">AAPL stock</url>.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Microsoft Corp.

By 2025, the expensive, bulky current HoloLens models will likely look as ridiculous as 1990s cell phones. HoloLens is just one example of how Microsoft is attempting to bridge the physical and digital worlds. Analyst Kash Rangan says Microsoft landing the Department of Defense's coveted $10 billion Jedi Cloud contract is another sign that Azure is a solid long-term growth opportunity for investors. Bank of America has a \"buy\" rating and $162 price target for <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/articles/pros-and-cons-to-buying-microsoft-msft-stock\">MSFT stock</url>.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)</emphasis></p><p>In May 2019, Alphabet announced the $999 Google Glass Enterprise Edition 2. The newest Google Glass augmented reality headset is currently marketed as a professional tool for surgeons, factory workers and other professionals who may need hands-free computing or troubleshooting assistance. Google has also launched ARCore developer software for AR apps. Analyst Justin Post says regulatory scrutiny and margin compression are near-term headwinds, but Alphabet is well-positioned in high-growth fields such as digital advertising, streaming video and mobile search. Bank of America has a \"buy\" rating and $1,450 price target for <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/articles/alphabet-inc-googl-goog-stock\">GOOGL stock</url>. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">IBM Corp. (IBM)</emphasis></p><p>IBM Watson is already powering VR video games, and IBM Immersive Data enables customers to walk around and observe complex data sets from different angles. IBM has been a laggard among big tech stocks in recent years due to its legacy businesses. Mohan says IBM is a defensive play among the tech giants given its 15.4 earnings multiple, its 4.8% dividend, its strong balance sheet, its exposure to recurring revenue and its potential to gain long-term IT spending share. Bank of America has a \"buy\" rating and $170 price target for IBM stock. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Intel Corp. (INTC)</emphasis></p><p>Intel chips power connected devices, but Intel's phygital tech goes far beyond chips. Intel RealSense is the company's suite of depth-tracking technologies that allow machines to sense three dimensional objects. Earlier this year, Intel unveiled the Depth Camera SR305, which is optimized for face analytics and tracking, scene segmentation, scanning and mapping, AR and hand and finger tracking. Analyst Vivek Arya says recent chip capacity shortages are only temporary, and Intel trades at a more than 30% discount to its semiconductor peers. Bank of America has a \"buy\" rating and $70 price target for <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/articles/intel-corporation-intc-stock\">INTC stock</url>. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amazon.com (AMZN)</emphasis></p><p>Bank of America says digital assistants like Amazon Alexa will likely see increasing integration into automobiles, entertainment systems and other areas. In addition, digital assistants will likely see more business applications as well. Amazon's smart speakers are collecting troves of human voice data that can be used to improve speech recognition. Post says Amazon investors are facing potential antitrust regulation, and tax legislation may be headwinds for Amazon shares in 2020. However, the company is well-positioned in too many high-growth tech fields to ignore. Bank of America has a \"buy\" rating and $2,160 price target for <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/articles/pros-cons-to-buying-amazon-amzn-stock\">AMZN stock</url>.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NXP Semiconductors (NXPI)</emphasis></p><p>NXP is a leading global semiconductor company focusing on auto, identification, wireless and industrial markets. Arya says NXP has key products in several secular growth areas, including advanced driver-assistance systems and battery management systems for electric vehicles. In addition, he says NXP's Dutch domicile gives the company an advantage over U.S. competitors in dealing with Chinese microcontroller vendors. Arya says NXP's connectivity and processing solutions are much more complete following its recent acquisition of Marvell Technology Group (<url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/mrvl-marvell-technology-group-ltd\">MRVL</url>) WiFi assets. Bank of America has a \"buy\" rating and $140 price target for NXPI stock. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nvidia Corp. (NVDA)</emphasis></p><p>Nvidia produces high-end processors for gaming PCs, workstations, autonomous vehicles, drones, robots and other applications. Nvidia shares took a hit in the second half of 2018 after demand for cryptocurrency mining processors plummeted. However, the stock has bounced back in 2019, and Arya says Nvidia is a top sector stock pick heading into 2020. Arya says Nvidia should lead its peer group with 20% revenue growth next year thanks to demand from artificial intelligence, high-performance computing, gaming, autos and movie rendering. Bank of America has a \"buy\" rating and $275 price target for NVDA stock.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Top stocks for a 'phygital' world:</emphasis></p><p>-- Apple (<url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/aapl-apple-inc\">AAPL</url>)</p><p>-- Microsoft Corp.

But it's not such good news for Facebook, cryptocurrencies or venture capital funding, writes Tech Editor 1 IT WILL BE A BIG ENFORCEMENT YEAR FOR IRELAND'S DATA WATCHDOG In 2019, Ireland could become the world's enforcer for putting manners on big tech firms in relation to data breaches.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Irish data protection commissioner currently has 16 active investigations under way into tech multinationals, including at least two for Facebook alone.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This is largely down to the introduction of a tough new European law (the GDPR) which says that a company can now be fined up to 4pc of its annual turnover. (In Facebook's case, this could amount to around (EURO)1.5bn.) Because so many big tech companies choose Ireland as their European or global headquarters, Helen Dixon's office is responsible for investigating when there is a problem.</p><p>The DPC has gradually been increasing its headcount to meet this extra workload and now sits as the second-biggest data privacy authority in Europe (after the UK). Even still, if last year's catalogue of data scandals is anything to go by, it may yet find itself stretched.</p><p>COULD BE A BIG YEAR FOR ONLINE 2IT SUBSCRIPTIONS In 2018, online subscriptions in media, entertainment and other functions soared. Netflix continued its march in Ireland, as did Spotify, Apple Music and a range of utilities from Dropbox to iCloud.</p><p>Even small, indigenous players have gotten in on the act with online-only media companies like ex-Newstalk sports firm Second Captains amassing over 10,000 paying monthly subscribers - enough for its five founders to make a comfortable living.</p><p>One striking aspect of the transition away from 'everything is free' to 'I will pay for things I want' is the age demographic. Young people, so often assumed to eschew any paid interaction on the internet, have embraced the payment culture with gusto, especially given access to platforms such as Patreon that typically charge around (EURO)5 per month.</p><p>Next year promises to see more of the same. More Irish media companies, including Sunday Independent publisher Independent News &amp; Media, are openly touting a greater emphasis on paywalls and subscription offerings for access to content.</p><p>New media services are also rapidly coming on stream. An online news offering called Kinzen from Mark Little, Aine Kerr and Paul Watson is set to see an app launch in January, while Dublin-based News Over Audio, from entrepreneurs Gareth Hickey and Shane Ennis, is scaling a subscription service from its current 14,000 users. It's also likely that we will see new online media companies launched by journalists who recently moved on from current Irish newspapers.</p><p>3 5G WILL BE TURNED TO AS A SAFETY NET IF RURAL BROADBAND IS NOT ROLLED OUT It seems that every year is a crunch year for rural broadband. But 2019 really is shaping up to be do or die for the State's National Broadband Plan, the pledge to connect 540,000 businesses and homes in rural areas to state-subsidised fibre internet.</p><p>On balance, a contract with the current bidder, Granahan McCourt, still looks likely to be given the green light. But if this doesn't happen, the Government has a very serious infrastructural deficit to address, even if a small percentage of those without proper broadband will get it through market sources next year.</p><p>Inevitably, attention will shift to alternative options. One such option that is often mentioned is 5G, the next-generation mobile technology that is currently being trialled by Irish operators.</p><p>At peak, this can deliver speeds of 500Mbs, several times faster than the fastest Eir 'eFibre' phone broadband.</p><p>And some operators are even setting up rural trials, with broadband access specifically targeted. For example, Vodafone Ireland is dipping a toe into rural 5G mobile broadband with trials in Roscommon, Wexford, Tipperary and Waterford, with 250 homes and businesses given roof antennae and equipment that can translate that 5G signal into a speedy wifi connection.</p><p>Eir also says that it will look at 5G trials next year, while Three is expected to do the same.</p><p>However, don't expect 5G to swoop in where the National Broadband Plan fails to deliver. Senior government and industry personnel have all dismissed the idea, pointing to the need for fibre backhaul for such wireless infrastructure. \"It would be complementary,\" said Vodafone Ireland chief executive Anne O'Leary.</p><p>4 THE BOOM IN IRISH COWORKING SPACES WILL CONTINUE Last month, WeWork announced a big expansion in Dublin with a sixth building, putting the American coworking chain's investment in Ireland on par with - or ahead of - any other city in the world outside the US.</p><p>It's the clearest sign yet that Ireland's working environment in one of its biggest industries - tech is changing rapidly. And the trend looks set to continue accelerating. Indigenous coworking spaces like CHQ's Dogpatch Labs have grown to 400 seats.</p><p>It's not just a Dublin phenomenon either. Counterparts in places like Galway (Portershed), Cork (Republic Of Work) and Kerry (HQTralee) are all experiencing expansion or consistent interest.</p><p>Why will this continue to happen? Because conventional Irish offices are dull, unattractive places to startups and tech companies. Coworking spaces, in general, are more redolent of the environments that companies like Google and Facebook - and dozens of copycats - have created in Dublin.</p><p>They're not perfect, but they're much more in tune with market demand in the tech space than suburban office blocks or conventional Regus rooms.</p><p>5 AMAZON'S UNCHECKED RISE WILL UNALTERABLY CHANGE THE MAIN STREET Earlier this month, the billionaire UK retailer Mike Ashley testified before a British Parliamentary committee with a stark message. \"The high street is dead,\" he said. \"It's already dead. We cannot compete. It's the internet.\"</p><p>While it's a different market, the UK is often a bellwether for Ireland and the rest of Europe in terms of ecommerce and its effects on the economy and society.</p><p>In other words, what's happening in the UK now is a warning to what is likely (though not certain) to happen here in the next three to five years. Those warning signs are there in big neon lettering.</p><p>In its last major report on the issue, PwC found that 67pc of Irish consumers now shop on Amazon.</p><p>Of these shoppers, one in six (17pc) are Prime subscribers, meaning that they get free delivery on purchases in exchange for a monthly subscription that locks them in further to shopping predominantly on Amazon.</p><p>It's not a small amount of retailing value, either - (EURO)3bn of the (EURO)5bn spent online in Ireland last year went to retailers outside the country.</p><p>And in case there's any doubt on the effect that Amazon is having, the same PwC analysis claims that 18pc of Irish shoppers say that they shop less often at other retail stores as a result of Amazon. (This figure may well increase: in America, one in three says the same thing.) The PwC figures illustrate that almost a third of Irish consumers make significant purchases on their phones at least once a month, a figure that is rising every year.</p><p>And the evidence shows that younger people are simply turning away from buying things in physical shops. 38pc of 25-34-year-olds now shop online weekly, according to PwC.</p><p>Physical shops may not be doing enough to fight this migration, with just a third of us (36pc) satisfied with our in-store shopping experiences, according to PwC.</p><p>6 FACEBOOK IS GOING TO HAVE A TOUGH YEAR In 2018, the unwelcome side of Facebook's business model finally caught up with it.</p><p>From the Cambridge Analytica fiasco to allegations of Russian interference and a plethora of data leaks, it's a year that Mark Zuckerberg might want to forget. But it might get worse. A combination of tougher new European laws (the GDPR) and user dismay could finally bite in 2019.</p><p>The early months of the year may even bring about a groundbreaking fine from the office of the Irish Data Protection Commissioner, who has at least two serious formal investigations under way into the tech giant under the heavyweight new data law.</p><p>So will Facebook fundamentally change anything about the way its service works? So far, there's little evidence it is intending to do so. Other than patching up discovered leaks in its data-sharing systems, it has largely confined its redesign to a shift away from news and toward 'friends and family' on a typical Facebook feed.</p><p>Those who defend Facebook's corner often argue that the media outrage is a little overblown, spurred on by acute resentment among traditional publishers that Facebook (along with Google) has cornered most of the online advertising that publishers were hoping to get themselves as their own print circulation revenue fades away.</p><p>This is a fair point, especially considering that Facebook's user figures appear not to have fallen, even after 12 months' non-stop condemnation from virtually every large media outlet.</p><p>So it might be said that we, the media, may not perfectly be in step with news consumers when it comes to actual levels of concern over Facebook privacy.</p><p>But there is still ample evidence now that company can't afford to shrug its shoulders and disregard its current problems.</p><p>Other than regulatory concerns (see the DPC, above), it has a serious demographic challenge that looks worrying: its user base is getting much older. In the US, research shows that just 36pc of teens use Facebook at least once a month, down from 52pc two years ago.</p><p>And in Ireland, more pensioners than teenagers now use the social media service here, with younger people flocking to Instagram instead.</p><p>Of course, Facebook owns Instagram (and WhatsApp), so it's insulated. Even still, 2019 could be a year where Facebook faces its first real decline in influence.</p><p>7 THE FUTURE FOR CRYPTOCURRENCIES LOOKS WOBBLIER THAN IT HAS FOR YEARS Cryptocurrency valuations tanked in 2018, led by further falls in the highest profile currency, Bitcoin. While Bitcoin has rallied a little in the last few weeks, its $4,000 price is a long way off the $19,000 reached last year.</p><p>Does this mean it was always a bubble set to burst? Not so, say industry stalwarts, such as Dublin-based Circle co-founder Jeremy Allaire. The fundamentals of cryptocurrency, and especially the underlying blockchain technology, are sound, he says. This is a message echoed by other Dublin-based crypto and blockchain specialists, such as Consensys.</p><p>However, despite years of trials and encouraging noises from blue-chip industry players such as banks, the use cases for Blockchain continue to be elusive in the real world.</p><p>'Coming possibly next year' is still the phrase most used by experts and practitioners who are trying to bridge blockchain with existing businesses.</p><p>8 NEXT YEAR WILL BE PIVOTAL FOR VC FUNDING IN IRELAND Up until last year, venture capital growth was soaring in Ireland. The combination of lots of startups, cheap finance and aggressive expansion from international financiers saw the Irish industry attracting an annual run rate of (EURO)1bn for the first time.</p><p>However, things turned in 2018. According to figures from the Irish Venture Capital Association, venture funding fell by a third (to (EURO)546m) in the first nine months of the year.</p><p>The drop-off in cash accelerated during the year, with the amount raised by tech firms and startups in the last three months just half what it was last year. The figures suggested that the largest segment of funding to see a decline was in deals above (EURO)5m. These fell in value and volume by around 30pc.</p><p>So why is this happening? One reason is that 2018 has not seen the same number of headline-grabbing funding deals as 2017, with the exception of the (EURO)110m round landed by Dublin-based Intercom.</p><p>But seed funding, which is a quarter of the total funds raised and is typically associated with startups, also fell compared to last year. This was partially because the volume of these seed deals was down by a third.</p><p>So why the fall-off? Some founders and Irish financiers have complained that a gap has opened up between UK and Irish tax laws that make it far more advantageous to base a company in England.</p><p>Other VC executives point to structural funding limitations that prevent large capital funds - such as the insurance industry - from investing.</p><p>And some commentators have suggested that VCs are gradually becoming more interested solely in lower-risk Series B (or higher) rounds, which knocks out some of the market traditionally focused on Irish startups.</p><p>However, there is little sign that things will change in the early months of 2019.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Data Protection Commissioner Helen Dixon and Facebook will have a challenging New YearIn its last major report on the issue, PwC found that 67pc of Irish consumers now shop on Amazon, above.

Every phone in every city talks to every other nearby device, their exchanges floating somewhere in the ether. Cross-border travel is enabled only by governments sharing data about millions of private movements.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">These are all possible visions of a future that the coronavirus pandemic has rushed on us -- decades of change effected, sometimes it feels, in just weeks. But a lurch into an even more intense era of mass data-collection -- the vast hoovering up of who went near whom and when, who is healthy to travel, and even scraps of personal DNA languishing in databases -- appears to be on the verge of becoming the new reality.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Will this grave new world intensify our desire for privacy, or extinguish what little left of it we had?</p><p>It took the attacks of September 11, 2001 to shove aside the previous decade's phobia of mass surveillance, and usher in an era where many of us imagined the state was probably skimming our emails, in exchange for keeping us safe from terror.</p><p>Over the next 15 years, billions of people agreed to a tacit deal where Facebook or Google were permitted to learn a staggering amount about them in exchange for free access to messaging apps, news, and shared pictures of a baby dancing, or a dog driving a car.</p><p>Eventually, that mutated into the heights exemplified by Cambridge Analytica -- private companies hoovering up the online lives of tens of millions in order to try to sway elections.</p><p>But the challenge presented by Covid-19 -- and the urgent need to trace contacts and movements -- is of another scale of intimacy. South Korea located over 10,000 cellphones near the latest outbreak and texted them to suggest a coronavirus test. The UK government has toyed with a centralized database of movements and health records, secured by government cyber-spies, able potentially to see who has been sick and who they have been near. Russia and many others have issued QR codes. China is putting surveillance cameras right outside people's doors.</p><p>Technology is again claiming the mantle of the savior we need to fill the gap between where we are now, and the new, knowledgeable and capable place we need to be. Apple and Google are again offering solutions government cannot -- embedding into our phones anonymous methods of knowing who we may have infected and when. We are already seeing the extraordinary potential of these technologies in limiting the spread of the disease. But if they become ubiquitous, where does this new scrutiny end? When does it stop being helpful? Will we look back at 2020 as the moment privacy finally evaporated?</p><p>'Mission creep' feared</p><p>Few privacy advocates doubt the seismic nature of this moment. Some experts fear mission creep, while others see this as a chance to finally have our laws catch up with the digital age.</p><p>Privacy International called Covid-19's impact on privacy \"unprecedented.\"</p><p>\"9/11 ushered covert and overt surveillance regimes, many of which were unlawful,\" said Edin Omanovic, the campaign group's advocacy director. The surveillance industry \"understands that this is an opportunity comparable to 9/11 in terms of legitimizing and normalizing surveillance. We've seen a huge willingness from people to help them as much as possible. However, helping health authorities fight the virus is different to helping security authorities use this moment as an opportunity for a data grab.\"</p><p>The way in which technology chooses to adapt to the moment may also define its success after it. The urgency of action after 9/11 -- and the things that were done \"just for now\" that became commonplace and permanent -- carry valuable lessons that governments may still choose to ignore. Edward Snowden and other whistleblowers exposed how huge amounts of phone or email data had been hoovered up by governments routinely, leaving some unsure if their democratic way of life was being eroded or protected by their security agencies.</p><p>Professor Jon Crowcroft, who pioneered one of the first influenza monitoring mobile apps at Cambridge University in 2011, said governments' introduction of apps, such as those in the UK, should be explicit about \"sunsetting\" -- the removal of data after a defined period. </p><p>\"Just having a clear position on deleting that data after, say, 30 days, when it is clearly of no use for anyone -- because contacts will have recovered, epidemiologists will have improved their models -- would really help the public trust,\" he said.</p><p>Crowcroft fears two areas of \"mission creep\": the first being if the app or data is used to enforce isolation on people, and the second in imposing the need for an \"immunity certificate\" on a person who has the virus antibodies (though the science on this is far from settled).</p><p>But he added that, as we have seen in the past, practicalities may triumph over privacy: we will perhaps be less fascinated by how the apps technically gather and store data, \"but will like the idea of being able to get out (to work &amp; socialize) more safely and possibly sooner.\"</p><p>It's the same practical payoff that lured billions into social media; life was made better by platforms that did not appear to ask anything of you, yet created a trillion dollar industry boosted by the commercial and predictive power of observing social media users. Despite growing privacy concerns, some 2.5 billion people use still use Facebook every month.</p><p>'Nothing here is inevitable'</p><p>The title of Shoshana Zuboff's book \"The Age of Surveillance Capitalism\" referred to the power and wealth accrued by tech companies who amassed huge amounts of data over the past two decades. She thinks Covid-19 could mark a moment not of the continued, inevitable dominance of these giants, but instead of people reasserting their rights in the way they should have done when these new online hyperpowers emerged. </p><p>\"9/11 compromised our democracies in relationship to tech companies and their growing capabilities,\" she said. \"We ended 2019 with people around the world in the process of waking up and appreciating the fact that surveillance capitalists have amassed these immense empires of unaccountable power. They have been given a free pass to do whatever they wanted: to steal our experience secretly, and combine that data to predict our behavior, then sell those predictions and become trillion-dollar companies.\"</p><p>This is a moment for better-informed societies to create the legal framework they've lacked to master the power of technology for their benefits, she said. Public health has always had an element of surveillance and tracking in it to monitor the spread of a disease, even before big-tech came along, she added.</p><p>\"For people who are charged with tracking disease, surveillance systems are very important,\" she said, adding that we should permit some of our movements to be tracked for the good of common public health, a sacrifice of our privacy similar to how we choose to vaccinate children. But, she argued, new hi-tech surveillance has blighted that old, desperately needed health monitoring as being from the same intrusive fold.</p><p>\"What's happened now is that we're so fearful of the other kind of surveillance that these things are conflated,\" she said. \"We're hitting this wall of mistrust, because we have failed over the last 20 years to create the institutions, legislation and regulatory paradigms that allow us to trust in this new invasive world.\"</p><p>Zuboff said the current vacuum in leadership in some Western countries meant tech giants could try to insert themselves into the problem as the only and obvious solution. \"The dominant surveillance capitalists want us to believe and feel that in the vacuum that our leaders -- certainly in the UK -- have left in their wake, they are the ones to come and fill it.\"</p><p>But the pandemic could also present an opportunity to re-assert -- or finally assert -- regulation over the new digital age. \"Nothing here is inevitable,\" she said. \"We have a responsibility to society as well as to the privacy of individuals. And we can do both. The answer to that question is entirely up to us.\"</p><p>Yet, like 9/11, the moment is one of panic, coping, and rush for a return to normality, and less of a nuanced discussion about how the crisis can become an opportunity to fix the wrongs of the past. Without that discussion, our new normals may become a world in which a little bit more of our inner selves is out there in the ether, at risk of misuse.</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

Every phone in every city talks to every other nearby device, their exchanges floating somewhere in the ether. Cross-border travel is enabled only by governments sharing data about millions of private movements.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">These are all possible visions of a future that the coronavirus pandemic has rushed on us -- decades of change effected, sometimes it feels, in just weeks. But a lurch into an even more intense era of mass data-collection -- the vast hoovering up of who went near whom and when, who is healthy to travel, and even scraps of personal DNA languishing in databases -- appears to be on the verge of becoming the new reality.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Will this grave new world intensify our desire for privacy, or extinguish what little left of it we had?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It took the attacks of September 11, 2001 to shove aside the previous decade's phobia of mass surveillance, and usher in an era where many of us imagined the state was probably skimming our emails, in exchange for keeping us safe from terror.</p><p>Over the next 15 years, billions of people agreed to a tacit deal where Facebook or Google were permitted to learn a staggering amount about them in exchange for free access to messaging apps, news, and shared pictures of a baby dancing, or a dog driving a car.</p><p/><p>Eventually, that mutated into the heights exemplified by Cambridge Analytica -- private companies hoovering up the online lives of tens of millions in order to try to sway elections.</p><p>But the challenge presented by Covid-19 -- and the urgent need to trace contacts and movements -- is of another scale of intimacy. South Korea located over 10,000 cellphones near the latest outbreak and texted them to suggest a coronavirus test. The UK government has toyed with a centralized database of movements and health records, secured by government cyber-spies, able potentially to see who has been sick and who they have been near. Russia and many others have issued QR codes. China is putting surveillance cameras right outside people's doors.</p><p>Technology is again claiming the mantle of the savior we need to fill the gap between where we are now, and the new, knowledgeable and capable place we need to be. Apple and Google are again offering solutions government cannot -- embedding into our phones anonymous methods of knowing who we may have infected and when. We are already seeing the extraordinary potential of these technologies in limiting the spread of the disease. But if they become ubiquitous, where does this new scrutiny end? When does it stop being helpful? Will we look back at 2020 as the moment privacy finally evaporated?</p><p>'Mission creep' feared</p><p>Few privacy advocates doubt the seismic nature of this moment. Some experts fear mission creep, while others see this as a chance to finally have our laws catch up with the digital age.</p><p>Privacy International called Covid-19's impact on privacy \"unprecedented.\"</p><p>\"9/11 ushered covert and overt surveillance regimes, many of which were unlawful,\" said Edin Omanovic, the campaign group's advocacy director. The surveillance industry \"understands that this is an opportunity comparable to 9/11 in terms of legitimizing and normalizing surveillance. We've seen a huge willingness from people to help them as much as possible. However, helping health authorities fight the virus is different to helping security authorities use this moment as an opportunity for a data grab.\"</p><p>The way in which technology chooses to adapt to the moment may also define its success after it. The urgency of action after 9/11 -- and the things that were done \"just for now\" that became commonplace and permanent -- carry valuable lessons that governments may still choose to ignore. Edward Snowden and other whistleblowers exposed how huge amounts of phone or email data had been hoovered up by governments routinely, leaving some unsure if their democratic way of life was being eroded or protected by their security agencies.</p><p>Professor Jon Crowcroft, who pioneered one of the first influenza monitoring mobile apps at Cambridge University in 2011, said governments' introduction of apps, such as those in the UK, should be explicit about \"sunsetting\" -- the removal of data after a defined period.</p><p>\"Just having a clear position on deleting that data after, say, 30 days, when it is clearly of no use for anyone -- because contacts will have recovered, epidemiologists will have improved their models -- would really help the public trust,\" he said.</p><p>Crowcroft fears two areas of \"mission creep\": the first being if the app or data is used to enforce isolation on people, and the second in imposing the need for an \"immunity certificate\" on a person who has the virus antibodies (though the science on this is far from settled).</p><p>But he added that, as we have seen in the past, practicalities may triumph over privacy: we will perhaps be less fascinated by how the apps technically gather and store data, \"but will like the idea of being able to get out (to work &amp; socialize) more safely and possibly sooner.\"</p><p>It's the same practical payoff that lured billions into social media; life was made better by platforms that did not appear to ask anything of you, yet created a trillion dollar industry boosted by the commercial and predictive power of observing social media users. Despite growing privacy concerns, some 2.5 billion people use still use Facebook every month.</p><p/><p>'Nothing here is inevitable'</p><p>The title of Shoshana Zuboff's book \"The Age of Surveillance Capitalism\" referred to the power and wealth accrued by tech companies who amassed huge amounts of data over the past two decades. She thinks Covid-19 could mark a moment not of the continued, inevitable dominance of these giants, but instead of people reasserting their rights in the way they should have done when these new online hyperpowers emerged.</p><p>\"9/11 compromised our democracies in relationship to tech companies and their growing capabilities,\" she said. \"We ended 2019 with people around the world in the process of waking up and appreciating the fact that surveillance capitalists have amassed these immense empires of unaccountable power. They have been given a free pass to do whatever they wanted: to steal our experience secretly, and combine that data to predict our behavior, then sell those predictions and become trillion-dollar companies.\"</p><p>This is a moment for better-informed societies to create the legal framework they've lacked to master the power of technology for their benefits, she said. Public health has always had an element of surveillance and tracking in it to monitor the spread of a disease, even before big-tech came along, she added.</p><p>\"For people who are charged with tracking disease, surveillance systems are very important,\" she said, adding that we should permit some of our movements to be tracked for the good of common public health, a sacrifice of our privacy similar to how we choose to vaccinate children. But, she argued, new hi-tech surveillance has blighted that old, desperately needed health monitoring as being from the same intrusive fold.</p><p>\"What's happened now is that we're so fearful of the other kind of surveillance that these things are conflated,\" she said. \"We're hitting this wall of mistrust, because we have failed over the last 20 years to create the institutions, legislation and regulatory paradigms that allow us to trust in this new invasive world.\"</p><p>Zuboff said the current vacuum in leadership in some Western countries meant tech giants could try to insert themselves into the problem as the only and obvious solution. \"The dominant surveillance capitalists want us to believe and feel that in the vacuum that our leaders -- certainly in the UK -- have left in their wake, they are the ones to come and fill it.\"</p><p/><p>But the pandemic could also present an opportunity to re-assert -- or finally assert -- regulation over the new digital age. \"Nothing here is inevitable,\" she said. \"We have a responsibility to society as well as to the privacy of individuals. And we can do both. The answer to that question is entirely up to us.\"</p><p>Yet, like 9/11, the moment is one of panic, coping, and rush for a return to normality, and less of a nuanced discussion about how the crisis can become an opportunity to fix the wrongs of the past. Without that discussion, our new normals may become a world in which a little bit more of our inner selves is out there in the ether, at risk of misuse.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNCOM-20200514surveillance-privacy-coronavirus-npw-intl1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YX7-WCH1-JBPX-X1H2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">266325</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1404\"/><timeReceived>1:27 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CNN.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"15303\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 14, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Well, I think the UK has plenty of what it takes to grow a tech titan or two, or three. Britain consistently punches above its weight when it comes to digital innovation and technology. </p><p>In a recent OECD/McKinsey 2016 report, the UK was ranked top in its digital share of overall GDP (10 percent), beating the USA (8 percent) and Sweden (7 percent). Meanwhile, PwC has just placed London number one, for the second time, on its bi-annual list of Cities of Opportunity. London's status as a world financial center, conveniently positioned halfway between Asia and the US, has helped it foster a strong tech innovation community over several years. Six years ago the UK government decided to get behind its burgeoning tech talent, and the result is one of the most generous tax-relief systems anywhere in the world for starting a business. With supportive regulation, lots of available finance, and politicians keen to bring jobs into their neighborhoods, you can see why tech companies like Deliveroo and Shazam are thriving across the country. Indeed, over 40 percent of all European tech unicorns are based in the UK. Then there's culture. The UK's economic liberalism and cultural variety - engendered over centuries not decades - have played a crucial part in its digital success. For those considering investing in or starting up a UK-based tech business, here are a few things you should know: 1. The UK is the second biggest destination in the world for VC money, on a per capita basis Venture capitalists invested a record $3.6 billion in the UK's tech scene last year, up 70 percent from the year before. The country has consistently attracted more than 30 percent of all European VC funds for several years. On a per capita basis, the UK is the second biggest destination for VC money in the world, after the US, counting all investments made between 2009 and 2015, according to EY. According to Pitchbook, the VC database, 2015 was the fifth consecutive year of growth for the UK's tech sector. In fact, tech investment in London in 2015 was almost 20 times what it was in 2010. And in June 2016, the UK was already on track to exceed last year's funding level yet again. So far, Brexit does not appear to be having any impact. It's fair to say that leaving the European Union may not have been on the road map for many in the sector, but we'll rise to the challenge, while pushing hard for this community to become even more open to global tech talent and investment. 2. It's not just London There are 1.56 million jobs in the digital tech economy, with almost three times more jobs being created in the sector than in the wider economy. Tech hubs are emerging organically across the country, specializing in different capabilities; from cyber security to digital media. Edinburgh is home to billion-dollar companies Skyscanner and Fanduel as well as rapidly growing startups like Administrate and TV Squared. Manchester, where over 50,000 people work in the digital economy, is another fast-growing tech hub, home to MoneySuperMarket and The Hut. Newcastle has companies such as Performance Horizons and scaling mobile payment firm ImpulsePay. 3. Our internationally renowned universities are a crucial part of the ecosystem There are over 170 universities in the UK, with six in the world's top 30. Oxford University, Cambridge University, and Imperial College are in the global top 10. The turnout of graduates is the highest in Western Europe. British universities are world class and produce over 5,000 new STEM PhDs per year. Collaboration between our universities and businesses is rated as the fourth best in the world, according to the World Economic Forum's latest Global Competitiveness report. Entrepreneurialism is thriving on campuses, and connections to universities are becoming crucial in funding deals. 4. The UK is second in the world for tech startup exits, after the US Access to London's capital markets is important as businesses scale up. The London Stock Exchange is the second largest financial market in the world, based on the number of companies listed. London's recent Tech IPO successes include payments firm Worldpay, which raised over $2.6 billion, and cyber security firm Sophos, now worth more than $1.6 billion. Other listings include Zoopla and Just Eat, both valued over $1 billion in 2014. Even before last year's bumper crop of IPOs, the London market was a great place for tech firms to raise money. Between 2011 and 2015 there were 22 tech IPOs on the LSE, with the average IPO proceeds coming in at $492 million. Right now, UK firms can choose if they want to IPO and open themselves up to public scrutiny. Fortunately, there is so much VC funding around that fast-growing firms can raise capital without having to list. IPOs aside, there were 135 mergers and acquisitions in the second quarter of 2016 in the UK, accounting for 65 percent of all activity across Europe, according to CB Insights. In fact, the UK ranked second in the CB Insights Global Tech Exits listing for the first half of 2016. 5. Some of the UK's biggest tech success stories have stayed under the radar ARM Holdings is a case in point. ARM designs the chips that power 95 percent of the world's smartphones, and its technology effectively put a computer in everyone's pocket. This summer, the Cambridge-based company, which few consumers had heard of, accepted a $32 billion takeover offer from Japanese conglomerate Softbank. Other big tech successes from the UK that you may have never heard of include Imagination Technologies Group, which designs and licenses chips for use in smartphones and other household appliances. Aveva, also based in Cambridge, is an engineering software business. Meanwhile, Newbury-based Micro Focus, a software company that deals with software systems, has boldly just put in a $8 billion bid for a part of HP's business. We're proud of our home-grown success stories, but it's also important that many of the world's biggest tech companies have opened headquarters in the UK. Facebook's largest engineering team outside Silicon Valley is based here, while Google and Apple also have a substantial presence. By the end of this year, Facebook will employ 14,500 people in the UK. Proximity to these big companies helps local entrepreneurs aspire to create global companies themselves. When an innovative company like Magic Pony can be snapped up by Twitter for $150 million, as happened in July 2016, it inspires everyone in the ecosystem. 6. The UK government helps tech companies from cradle to exit There is help for tech entrepreneurs at every stage of their business evolution, ranging from R...ax credits and entrepreneurs' capital gains relief to grants to an online Digital Academy for anyone wanting to acquire the skills to digitize their business. The UK also has a dedicated visa scheme for digital innovation experts. Government-backed enterprise schemes help private investor capital find its way into the ecosystem, and coding is now taught to all primary school children, from the age of five. The UK government has put many of its biggest interactions with its people online - from voter registration to car taxes. The UN recently ranked Britain number one in the digital delivery of services to its citizens. 7. You say fintech \u2014 I say ed tech, ad tech, prop tech, health tech, media and entertainment Because of its supremacy in financial services, there is a tendency to assume London is dominated by fintech. There are plenty of businesses starting up in this space, like Monzo, Pockit, and Atom Bank, and some amazing unicorn companies like Transferwise and WorldPay. But the UK's digital economy is more diverse than you might imagine. We are seeing a rapid digitization in healthcare and education, with startups like Network Locum, a company that matches locum doctors with medical practices in need, and eSchools and RefMe in the education space. The gaming sector has already created world beaters like Tomb Raider and Grand Theft Auto, while gambling companies like Betfair, Playtech, and 888 Holdings are also international players. Property tech companies like Zoopla Property Group and Rightmove are potentially world leaders, thriving on the back of one of the most active real estate markets in the world. The flurry of proptech startups include Trussle, an online mortgage broker, and Purplebricks, which is undercutting traditional estate agents. 8. Brits are geeks at heart Britain is a nation of early adopters who have embraced smartphones and the mobile Internet more rapidly than other nations. We also spend more time online than any other European country, according to the media regulator Ofcom. Phones are widely used for music streaming, with digital formats now accounting for 54 percent of all UK music consumption. Brits also spend more time using phones for social networking than any other Europeans and spend more than double the next European country (France) online per capita. This wouldn't be possible without the UK's broadband and telecoms market, which is one of the most competitive in the world and expects to the begin commercial rollout of 5G services in 2020. 9. First-generation entrepreneurs are now creating their own funds and building a sustainable ecosystem After a wave of successful IPOs, Britain's first generation of VC funds and angel investors are looking for places to invest their money. The recycling of capital into startups is something that has helped Silicon Valley maintain its supremacy across a couple of generations. Now in the UK we are starting to see the end of one cycle and the beginning of another. While the most established VC funds were largely set up by former investment bankers, today's funds are increasingly built by successful tech entrepreneurs, such as MMC Ventures, LocalGlobe, Spring Ventures, BGF Ventures, Entrepreneur First, and others. The recent M...ctivity in the sector - particularly the takeover of ARM Holdings - will release fresh talent into the market along with a wave of investment. This is not just money; this is capital with knowledge behind it. And it's not all about the money. Which is why the UK tech community set up Founders Pledge, where tech founders donate at least 2 percent of their personal proceeds to support social causes following an exit. We're building a tech community that will last here, and we believe in paying it forward.

The name is a translation into English of the Hebrew phrase etz chaim. We sing those words as the Torah is put away on every Shabbat. They are words from the Book of Proverbs: 'She is a tree of life for those that cling to her and all who do are happy.' </p><p>The 'she' in that sentence is 'wisdom,' and the verse that precedes it is especially poignant in light of what has happened: 'Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.' Today the paths of peace were befouled by a monstrous anti-Semite who stormed the Tree of Life shouting something about Jews needing to die as he murdered and injured and then shot at some cops for good measure.In every generation they rise up against us to destroy us. In a classic act of anti-Semitic violence, which is what this is, Jews hear the echoes of every violent anti-Semitic act that has preceded it in history. And we hear those echoes because they are there. That which motivates Jew-hatred today is what has motivated it from time immemorial\u2014the poisonously attractive idea that Jews need to be extirpated because our existence is an offense or a threat to an existing larger order. The blessing of Jewish life in America is that this notion has largely been consigned to the dregs from which today's human malignancy rose. Despite the fact that most hate crimes in America are aimed at Jews, the actual number is vanishingly small\u2014especially compared to France, from which Jews are now fleeing, and England, whose Labour Party is in the hands of an actual Jew-hater.Because we are obliged by the sickness of our political culture to analyze every despicable event in a manner designed to confirm our priors, we have already, mere hours after the barbarity, sunk into a nauseating discussion about how much blame to assign to the president for this unspeakable act. The obvious answer is: None. Donald Trump should be assigned no such blame, even if the shooter were the president of the Donald Trump Fan Club, because he pulled no trigger and committed no crime. Period. To do that, to assign blame, is to whitewash the crime itself and the criminal's responsibility for it. He becomes a cultural robot, seized by an evil collective unconscious that drove him to his crimes.Based on the early evidence, the shooter was not only consumed with a hatred of Jews but possessed a kind of sneering contempt for Trump on the grounds that Trump was basically a Jewish agent or a Jew-lover himself. Trump can only be blamed for the murderous Jew-killing actions of someone who thought of him that way by people who are so consumed by hatred of him that there is nothing they won't blame him for.<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.drybonesproject.com/blog/D18A27_1.png\">https://www.drybonesproject.com/blog/D18A27_1.png</url> Ben Shapiro: Why We Cling To The Tree Of Life[2] In that Pittsburgh synagogue on Saturday morning, the Jew-hating murderer rushed into a room in which a brit milah was taking place: a circumcision ceremony, a ceremony as old as the Jewish people, a ceremony welcoming an eight-day-old child into the community of the Jews. In other parts of the synagogue, different minyanim were reading the story of Abraham's near-sacrifice of Isaac on a mountain.Why would Jews continue to inaugurate children into the most targeted community in human history? Jewish destiny may be inescapable, but why embrace that destiny? The members of the Tree of Life Synagogue were shot to death in a synagogue. So why continue to cluster in synagogues, fulfilling age-old commandments, the elderly passing down their traditions to infants?Because, as the Tree of Life Synagogue's name attests, the Torah - the Jewish destiny - is a 'tree of life for all those who cling to it.' (Proverbs 3:18) And we are enjoined to choose life. That, after all, is the story of Abraham and Isaac: a story not of God asking Abraham to kill his son, but a story of God asking if Abraham is willing to place his son in mortal danger in service to God - and God's grace in saving Isaac thanks to Abraham's commitment. That is the story of the Jewish people. That is the story members of the Tree of Life Synagogue were reading as they died al kiddush Hashem, in the sanctification of God's name.And that is the story of our civilization. An attack on the Tree of Life is an attack on all of us - those of us who wish to imbue our own children with a sense of Godliness in a dark world, a sense of eternal value in a society eating away at itself. Inside the sanctuary, all was peaceful on the Sabbath -- until the gunshots rang out.The only proper response is the same response Jews have given throughout time: to fight back. To stubbornly cling to that which stamps us with the image of God. To fight darkness with light, untruth with truth, and death with life.Victor Rosenthal: Thoughts after a mass murder of Jews[3] I lived in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighborhood for a few months when I was in grad school. It was a nice, safe, relatively friendly neighborhood.Now it will be known as the site of the worst mass murder of Jews in US history.Eleven are dead and numerous others wounded, including four responding police officers. The terrorist, Robert Bowers, as shown by this archive of social media posts, is apparently an obsessed Jew-hater, a Holocaust denier and a Nazi admirer. He appears to have become inflamed by the idea that liberal Jews were supporting uncontrolled immigration into the US (he mentions both Hispanics and Muslims), in particular the 'migrant caravan' that is presently making its way through Mexico. Interestingly, Bowers criticized Donald Trump for being 'a globalist, not a nationalist,' said that Trump was surrounded by Jews, and that he did not vote for him.His decision to act seems to have been triggered by an event held in Pittsburgh by the HIAS (Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society), an organization that once brought Jewish refugees out of Europe, but now works to resettle refugees from Syria, Central America, and even Africans in Tel Aviv.There have been various, mostly predictable, popular responses to this atrocious act. Many, if not most, miss the point. So here is what I think:This is nothing new. Synagogues and other Jewish institutions around the world and in the US are attacked all the time. Attacks in the US have been carried out by both neo-Nazi and Islamic extremists, and their number has been increasing along with polarization and anger in the country.Bowers was 'ideologically insane.' One common theme among extreme right-wing conspiracy theorists is that Jews, especially George Soros, are trying to destroy the 'white race' in America by introducing non-white immigrants. They will then take over (although they are already in charge by means of controlling politicians, even Trump), or they will somehow make a lot of money out of the collapse of the nation. Bowers seems to have believed some version of this. Social media seems to feed this kind of insanity, which often erupts into violence. Victims of Pittsburgh Synagogue Massacre Identified[4]The 11 Jews massacred on Saturday by a white supremacist gunman at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh have been identified.The victims included:- Joyce Fienberg, 75, of Oakland, City of Pittsburgh - Richard Gottfried, 65, of Ross Township - Rose Mallinger, 97, of Squirrel Hill, City of Pittsburgh - Jerry Rabinowitz, 66, of Edgewood Borough - Cecil Rosenthal, 59, of Squirrel Hill, City of Pittsburgh - David Rosenthal, 54, (brother of Cecil), of Squirrel Hill - Bernice Simon, 84, of Wilkinsburg - Sylvan Simon, 86, (husband of Bernice), of Wilkinsburg - Daniel Stein, 71, of Squirrel Hill, City of Pittsburgh - Melvin Wax, 88, of Squirrel Hill, City of PittsburghSix other people \u2014 among them four police officers \u2014 were wounded in the attack. GoFundMe has verified a contribution page for victims of the #PittsburghSynagogue[5] massacre. Contributions already coming in at rapid pace. Small point of light on a horribly bleak day.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/Fod8FrS3Y9\">https://t.co/Fod8FrS3Y9</url>[6] \u2014 Mark D. Levine (@MarkLevineNYC) October 28, 2018[7]JPoist Editorial: There should be no Left or Right when Jews are massacred in America[8] There is no Right or Left when assessing the reasons for how the groundwork could have been paved for such a horrendous act as Saturday's Pittsburgh massacre.In the worst mass attack on Jews in US history, 11 people, most of them worshipers, were killed when a gunman, apparently poisoned with timeless anti-Jewish tropes and vitriol, entered the Etz Haim Synagogue in the Squirrel Hill suburb of Pittsburgh and opened fire. When he was eventually subdued by police, he declared 'all these Jews need to die.'The shooter, Robert Bowers, has an active life on alt-right and antisemitic social media platforms, where he frequently engaged in Jewish conspiracy theories and trolled Jewish groups.As the tragedy unfolded and Israelis became aware of the news after Shabbat on Saturday night, there was a sense of experiencing a death in the family. Diaspora Affairs Minister Naftali Bennett announced that he would depart immediately to Pittsburgh, meet the local community and participate in the funerals of those killed in the attack.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu released a video message Saturday evening saying, 'The entire people of Israel grieve with the families of the dead. We stand together with the Jewish community of Pittsburgh.'Opposition leaders like Avi Gabbay and Yair Lapid emphasized that although the attack took place in a Conservative synagogue, when Jews are targeted, the attacker is not looking at affiliations.'If you are murdered for being Jewish, you are Jewish,' said Lapid, in a dig to those in Israel who do not recognize non-Orthodox Jewry as valid.Seth Frantzman: A massacre in Pittsburgh[9] In 2012, someone spray-painted swastikas and other graffiti on two synagogues in Bangor, Maine, not far from where I was born. In 2013, someone drew swastikas on a Cape Cod synagogue in Hyannis, not far from where my mom lives. When I was in high school, there used to be a middle-aged man in Prescott, Arizona, who would hold a sign downtown blaming 'the Jews' for a variety of crimes: global banking conspiracies, 9/11, the USS Liberty, etc.I always thought these things aren't really a threat. He's a crazy guy with a sign, I thought. Yes, he hates the Jews, but he's just ranting. Yes, there is some graffiti here and there. But the larger picture is that according to the FBI antisemitic incidents accounted for half of religious hate crimes in the US and 11% of all hate crimes in 2016.The mass murder in Pittsburgh, the deadliest attack on Jews in US history, comes from this milieu. It came from a swamp of hatred that percolated online. We know this because the murderer, named as Robert Bowers by authorities, left behind a large trail of hatred on social media. The last target of his hatred was HIAS, which helps refugees. He was outraged that HIAS supported a 'national refugee Shabbat.'A post he made targeted ZOG, the 'Zionist occupied government' as controlling America. The perpetrator also mocked 'Christian conservatives' for liking Jewish people, claiming that Jews only care about themselves. He thought US President Donald Trump was 'controlled' by Jews and being used to 'control Whites.'Bowers expressed a worldview, parts of which we've all become familiar with in the last few years which alleges that 'globalists' are taking over America. Globalists is a stand-in for 'Jews' often, a code word or 'dog whistle.'But Bowers believed that Trump was a globalist. Those he reposted wrote things like, 'Stop the kikes, then worry about the Muslims.' They also hated Israel. 'Refugees welcome to every nation, except Israel.' They were accusing Jews of bringing in refugees, while claiming Jews protect Israel from the same refugees. One article the perpetrator reposted noted 'we gave them Jerusalem, they gave us ISIS,' with other references to America having recognized Israel, only for Jews to 'give us anti-Christianity.' The racist posted photoshopped images of Auschwitz with the sign reading, 'Lies make money' over the gate.When we look at this worldview, what is striking is how it turns up in other forms, among other antisemites.'Today's Israelites are not real Jews,' one post says. Yes, we've seen that in other forms where Jews are called 'fake Jews.' A Washington lawmaker was called a 'fake Jew' in April at a rally. Bowers referred to a 'kike infestation,' and it turns out Louis Farrakhan has claimed he's not just 'anti-semite' but 'anti-termite.' Same terminology.There is a city councilman in Washington, DC, who claimed the Rothschilds control the weather, which is the same kind of 'dog whistle.' Recently, we also learned that some of those connected to an ostensibly 'left-wing' pro-Palestine group in the UK mocked the Holocaust as the 'muh Holocaust,' and noted that it was a 'hoax.' The online milieu in which the Pittsburgh massacre was committed is a web that unites anti-Jewish racists.What is HIAS, and why did it draw the hatred of the Pittsburgh shooter? [10] In 1881, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society was founded to assist Jews fleeing pogroms and violence in eastern Europe.In 2018, a murderer killed 11 people in a synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, citing his hatred of HIAS as justification for his heinous crime.What has HIAS done in its 137 years of operation, and why did it motivate such horrific violence?The organization has its roots on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, a neighborhood which served as a hub and home for Jewish immigration for many decades. HIAS worked to facilitate the legal, financial and physical needs of Jewish immigrants arriving in the United States.The organization offered language services, resettlement aid, hot meals, legal representation, job training and much more for new Jewish arrivals in the United States.In 1905, according to The New York Times, HIAS offered aid to a Jewish family arriving from Poland who was told that their 10-year-old son was not fit to enter the country. In 1923, according to JTA, HIAS organized a mass protest against then-president Calvin Coolidge against the detention of 3,000 Jewish immigrants on Ellis Island who surpassed the immigration quota. After World War II ended, HIAS set about aiding and resettling the tens of thousands of displaced persons and refugees in Europe after the Holocaust. In 1967, HIAS aided thousands of Jews fleeing riots that broke out in Libya after the Six Day War. For more than 100 years, HIAS has operated around the globe to bring Jewish refugees to safety. The organization estimates that it has aided \"more than 4.5 million people escape persecution\" since it was established. While HIAS's operations have often centered around Eastern European Jews, it has also worked to help and rescue Jews in Egypt, Cuba, Morocco, Ethiopia, Iran, Syria and more.Israeli psychotrauma team en route to Pittsburgh to aid terror victims [11] In the wake of Saturday's deadly mass shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, a team of volunteers from the Psychotrauma and Crisis Response Unit of United Hatzalah of Israel will arrive in the cityon Sunday to provide aid to the community and the victims.The United Hatzahal team is working in cooperation with the Diaspora Ministry and the Jewish Federation of Pittsburgh to provide psychological assistance to those affected by the mass shooting, which claimed eleven lives.\"We are heading to Pittsburgh in order to treat those who witnessed the attack and anyone else from the community who feels the need for our assistance,\" said Miriam Ballin, director of United Hatzalah's Psychotrauma and Crisis Response Unit, who is leading the team. \"We will be utilizing techniques and tools that we have developed here in Israel and have proven to be highly successful in assisting those who have suffered from similar incidents here.\"The team will assist the families of those who were killed and injured in the shooting attack as well as providing psychological and emotional stabilization and treatment to anybody in the community who is in need.\"We hope that our work will give the community a sense of solidarity on behalf of the people of Israel,\" Ballin addedBennett to leave for Pittsburgh to offer help[12] Diaspora Affairs Minister Naftali Bennett announced Saturday night that he would depart immediately to Pittsburgh following the shooting incident at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh in which 11 people were murdered.The minister will visit the scene of the attack, meet the local community and participate in the funerals of those killed in the attack.'When Jews are murdered in Pittsburgh, the people of Israel feel pain,' Bennett said. 'All Israel are responsible for one another the State of Israel is deeply pained by this terrible antisemitic murder. Our Jewish brothers and sisters came under a murderous attack while at prayer. Our hearts go out to the families of those killed, and we pray for the swift recovery of the injured, as we pray this is the last such event. Jewish blood is not free.'Bennett said he would offer strength to the Pittsburgh Jewish community and its leaders and examine how Israel can offer assistance. As Diaspora Affairs Minister, Bennett has made a point of assisting American communities when tragedies have happened, including following last year's Hurricane Harvey which caused flooding in Houston.Cabinet observes moment of silence for Pittsburgh victims[13] The weekly cabinet meeting on Sunday began with a minute of silence to honor the 11 Jewish worshipers killed in an anti-Semitic shooting attack a day earlier at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh in the US state of Pennsylvania.'It is hard to overstate the horror of a murder of Jews gathered in a synagogue on Shabbat, who were murdered just because they were Jews,' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said at the start of the meeting, held at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem.'The entire people of Israel is mourning with the families of those murdered in the shocking massacre at the synagogue,' he said after the moment of silence was observed. 'In my name and in the name of the people of Israel, I send our condolences to the grieving families. We all pray for the speedy recovery of the wounded.'Noting that the shooting apparently constituted the 'biggest anti-Semitic crime in American history,' Netanyahu added that Israel 'stands in a united front with the Jewish community in Pittsburgh, with the American Jewish public and with the American people. We stand together in a single front against anti-Semitism and these expressions of barbarity.'The gunman, identified as Robert Bowers, is said to have yelled, 'All Jews must die' as he entered the Tree of Life Synagogue, a Conservative congregation in the city, and began firing. He engaged in a shootout with responding police officers and barricaded himself inside the building before surrendering. In all, 11 people were killed and at least six wounded in the attack, at least four of them police officers, according to authorities.Throughout Israel, the attack was greeted with expressions of shock and mourning.Education Minister Naftali Bennett, who also serves as Israel's minister for Diaspora affairs, announced late on Saturday that he was 'flying tonight, as Minister of the Diaspora, to Pittsburgh to be with our sisters and brothers on their darkest hour. When Jews are murdered in Pittsburgh, the people of Israel feel the pain. Our hearts are with our brothers and sisters and with the entire American people.'LATEST: Pittsburgh Synagogue Shooter Charged, DOJ May Seek Death Penalty[14] In an additional statement Sunday morning, Federal prosecutors revealed that the shooter sustained multiple gunshot wounds in a shootout with police, but was taken alive and is expected to recover.Pittsburgh prosecutors have already charged the shooter with \"11 counts of criminal homicide, six counts of aggravated assault and 13 counts of ethnic intimidation;\" Federal prosecutors added an additional 26 charges including weapons offenses, incitement to violence, Federal firearm offenses, and U.S. civil rights violations.\"The actions of [the shooter] represent the worst of humanity. We are dedicating the entire resources of my office to this federal hate crime investigation and prosecution,\" the U.S. Attorney for Pennsylvania told reporters in a press conference Saturday night.Attorney General Jeff Sessions also announced Sunday that the Federal government may seek the death penalty against the shooter.Authorities are still struggling to understand how the shooter selected the Tree of Life Synagogue, and how law enforcement missed signs the shooter may have been intending an attack. FBI officials, processing the crime scene and conducting an initial investigation, told reporters late Saturday that the shooter was unknown to law enforcement, though he appeared to have issued anti-Semitic threats, and posted in anti-Semitic online forums, regularly.The shooter was allegedly known to have been virulently anti-Semitic, posting on Gab -- a social media network designed to be a \"Twitter alternative\" -- that organizations like the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, which helps Jewish refugees relocating from overseas, often from Communist countries, \"like[] to bring invaders in that kill our people. I can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I'm going in.\"He also expressed hatred for President Donald Trump, claiming the President was a puppet leader.President Trump responded to the shooting late Saturday, calling it a \" wicked act of pure evil\" and a \"devastating situation.\"Sessions: 'Hatred and Violence on the Basis of Religion Can Have No Place in Our Society'[15] Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Saturday released a statement thanking the FBI and Pittsburgh police in response to Saturday's shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh.\"Hatred and violence on the basis of religion can have no place in our society,\" Jeff Sessions said. \"Every American has the right to attend their house of worship in safety. Today 11 innocent people were suddenly and viciously murdered during religious services and several law enforcement officers were shot. These alleged crimes are reprehensible and utterly repugnant to the values of this nation.\"He went on to say that Department of Justice will file hate crimes and other criminal charges against Robert Bowers, the defendant, including charges that could potentially lead to the death penalty.\"It has been an important week for us to show gratitude for the hard work of our law officers around the country,\" Sessions said. \"And today was no exception. I want to thank the FBI, ATF, Pittsburgh police, and especially the heroic officers who were so quick to respond to the shooting, including the multiple officers who were shot. These officers ran to danger to save others, which reflects the highest traditions of policing in this country. There can be no doubt that they saved lives today.\"Pittsburgh gunman told police Jews were 'committing genocide to his people'[16] The suspect in the mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue told officers that Jews were committing genocide and that he wanted them all to die, according to a charging document made public early Sunday.Robert Gregory Bowers killed eight men and three women inside the Tree of Life Synagogue on Saturday during worship services before a tactical police team tracked him down and shot him, police said in the affidavit, which contained some previously unreported details on the shooting and the police response.Calls began coming in to 911 from the synagogue just before 10 a.m. Saturday, reporting 'they were being attacked,' the document said. Bowers shot one of the first two officers to respond in the hand, and the other was wounded by 'shrapnel and broken glass.'A tactical team found Bowers on the third floor, where he shot two officers multiple times, the affidavit said. One officer was described as critically wounded; the document did not describe the other officer's condition.Two other people in the synagogue, a man and a woman, were wounded by Bowers and were in stable condition, the document said.Bowers told an officer while he was being treated for his injuries 'that he wanted all Jews to die and also that they (Jews) were committing genocide to his people,' the affidavit said.Pittsburgh shooting suspect spewed anti-Semitism online[17] Robert Bowers, who was identified as the gunman who opened fire at a synagogue in Pittsburgh on Saturday, reportedly killing 11 people and injuring others before being taken into custody, had a history of promoting anti-Semitic and anti-immigrant conspiracies and had called in the past to exterminate the Jews.Bowers, a 46-year-old resident of Pittsburgh, is said to have yelled 'All Jews must die' as he entered the Tree of Life Synagogue, a Conservative congregation, in the city and began firing.He engaged in a shootout with responding police officers and barricaded himself inside the building before reportedly surrendering. Police say he was injured and crawling when he was taken into custody.The suspect is in 'fair condition' with multiple gunshot wounds, and is being treated at Allegheny General Hospital, according to Pittsburgh's public safety director.Bowers was an active poster on the social network Gab, which is considered by many to be a hub of the alt-right.In the description on his account, Bowers wrote 'jews are the children of satan.' The cover photo featured the neo-Nazi symbol '1488.' The first two numbers refer to the white supremacist '14 Words' slogan, while '88' stands for 'Heil Hitler' since 'H' is the eighth letter of the alphabet.Bowers last reported post read: 'HIAS likes to bring invaders to kill our people. I can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I'm going in.'Website 'used by synagogue shooter' and racists says it's being forced offline[18] A website that hosted anti-Semitic posts apparently authored by the man who allegedly killed 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue Saturday said it was being forced offline following the attack.Gab.com, which is popular with white nationalists and members of the so-called alt-right, said its hosting provider Joyent would be suspending its services as of Monday morning, while PayPal has also reportedly banned the site.;'Gab will likely be down for weeks because of this,' the site, which advertises itself as a 'social network that champions free speech, individual liberty and the free flow of information online,' said on its Twitter account early Sunday.'We will continue to fight for free expression and individual liberty online for all people. Big tech can not stop us. The mainstream media can not stop us.

With at least 11 confirmed casualties, the Anti-Defamation League 'believe[s] this is the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in the history of the United States.'The alleged gunman, a 46-year-old white male named Robert Bowers, shouted 'All these Jews need to die,' according to reports.As details continue to emerge about the shooting, JTA took a look at other times that U.S. Jewish institutions were targeted and the attackers' affiliations.1999 Los Angeles Jewish Community Center shooting Date: Aug. 10, 1999 Dead: 0 in JCC, 1 nearby Shooter's affiliations: Neo-Nazi, white supremacist2006 Seattle Jewish Federation shooting Date: July 28, 2006 Dead: 1 Shooter's motivation: Muslim who said he was angry at Israel2009 U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum shooting Date: June 10, 2009 Dead: 1 Shooter's affiliations: Neo-Nazi, white supremacist2014 Overland Park JCC shooting Date: April 13, 2014 Dead: 3 Shooter's affiliations: Neo-Nazi, white supremacistUN Watch: UN should condemn Pittsburgh antisemitic attack[20] UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet, along with other UN agencies, officials and experts tasked with combating racism, should join the EU, U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley and many others, and condemn today's massacre of Jews praying in a Pittsburgh synagogue, said UN Watch, a Geneva-based non-governmental human rights monitoring group.As of 11:40 pm tonight in Geneva, the twitter accounts of both the UN human rights office and its chief Michelle Bachelet were silent on the Pittsburgh attack.'At a time when Jews continue to be targeted worldwide, it's vital that the UN's top human rights official speaks out,' said Hillel Neuer, executive director of UN Watch.'Sadly, as found by our recent report on UN actions over the past decade, the world body's highest officials tasked with combating racism have failed to act against hatred, incitement and violence against Jews.''Our report's findings were disturbing and clear: key UN agencies, officials and experts are, with limited exceptions, turning a blind eye to escalating antisemitism worldwide.'For example, an examination of the 2014-2018 tenure of former UN human rights chief Zeid Raad al Hussein, which included a search of all of his statements, press releases and reports on the UN rights office website, found not a single stand-alone statement condemning anti-Jewish attacks or incitement.Similarly, Navi Pillay, who served the longest as UN rights chief, from 2008 to 2014, also failed to speak out in the face of murderous physical attacks against Jews, including the 2012 massacre at a Toulouse Jewish school.'Too often,' said Neuer, 'it seems UN human rights bodies see racism everywhere, and antisemitism nowhere.'Trump condemns Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, says 'vile' anti-Semitism must end[21]U.S. President Donald Trump condemned 'vile' anti-Semitism following a deadly mass shooting at Pittsburgh's Tree of Life Congregation Synagogue Saturday.The president suggested the person responsible should face the death penalty.'I think one thing we should do is we would stiffen up our laws with guns with the death penalty,' Trump said.'When people do this they should get the death penalty.'He said those responsible for such crimes should 'pay the ultimate price' without having to wait 'years and years.'Mattis: Pittsburgh synagogue gunman a 'coward', 'poorest excuse for a man' [22] US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Sunday the gunman who stormed a Pittsburgh synagogue and killed 11 worshippers was a coward and the \"poorest excuse for a man you could ever come up with.\"\"If there is one person responsible, this individual, I won't even call him a man, he was (the) poorest excuse for a man you could ever come up with, who would use a weapon in a house of worship on unarmed innocent people,\" Mattis told a group of reporters traveling with him to Prague.\"This is a coward and he is not a man by any definition that we use in the Department of Defense,\" Mattis said.Robert Bowers, 46, of Pittsburgh, was taken into custody after a shootout with a SWAT team on Saturday. Federal prosecutors charged him with 29 criminal counts including violence and firearms offenses, and violating US civil rights laws.\"That is tough, on the neighborhood, on the members of that synagogue, on all of us who believe in freedom of religion, it is one of our most fundamental rights that our country was founded on,\" Mattis said.Pope decries US synagogue attack as 'inhuman act of violence'[23] Pope Francis on Sunday called a deadly attack on a synagogue in the United States 'an inhuman act of violence,' expressing his 'closeness to the Jewish community.'Robert Gregory Bowers killed eight men and three women inside the Tree of Life Synagogue on Saturday during worship services before a tactical police team tracked him down, shot him and arrested him.'We are all, in truth, wounded by this inhuman act of violence,' Francis said at the end of the Angelus prayer in Saint Peter's Square.'May the Lord help us put out the flames of hate that develop in our societies, strengthening the sense of humanity, respect for life, moral and civil values and holy fear of God,' he said.Francis has frequently spoken out against religiously inspired violence and has denounced the easy availability of guns, calling arms manufacturers the 'merchants of death.'PA, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Bahrain and Qatar condemn Pittburgh shooting[24] In an unusual move, the Palestinian Authority, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Qatar have all made official statements on Sunday condemning Saturday's mass shooting in a synagogue in Pittsburgh.The Palestinian Authority and Turkey also spoke out, calling it an act of terrorism.The Saudi Embassy in Washington tweeted, 'The Embassy expresses its sincere condolences to the American people and to families of victims of the violent incident at a synagogue in Pittsburgh today. Houses of worship are meant to provide safe and spiritual refuge. Those who desecrate their sanctity attack all humanity.'Bahrain's Foreign Ministry said that it condemned 'the shooting that targeted a synagogue' and 'expresses its deep condolences to the victims' families, wishing a speedy recovery to those injured as a result of this heinous act.'The Ministry also affirms its support and solidarity with the United States, in all the measures it takes to ensure safety and security, reiterating the Kingdom's firm stance against all forms of violence and extremism,' it said.The state run Qatar News Agency said that Qatar 'strongly condemns Pittsburgh shooting in Pennsylvania, in the United States, which resulted in several deaths and injuries, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reiterated Qatar's firm stance rejecting violence and criminality regardless of their motives and reasons.'Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan called it an act of terrorism. 'I condemn the terror attack against a Pittsburgh synagogue and extend my heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims and to the American people. Turkey unequivocally condemns all forms of terrorism in all parts of the world regardless of their targets,' Erdogan said.It's a particularly dangerous form of terrorism because it exists with the society itself and targets any who disagrees with it, the PA said.PLO Ambassador Husan Zomlot, who heads the PA mission to the United Kingdom tweeted in English.'This murderous attack is pure evil ...st unite Jews, Christians and Muslims for an uncompromising fight against all forms of hatred and racism. My heart goes with the families of the victims and the American people,' Zomlot said.The Atlantic's Franklin Foer Exploits Shooting of Jews as Blood Libel Against Jews[25] I usually link to the pieces I call out. But I make special exceptions for the truly vile stuff.Franklin Foer's widely circulated Atlantic screed is the vilest media hot take on the Squirrel Hill synagogue shootings by a Neo-Nazi. It's bad enough that the media is using the act of terrorism by a Trump-hating Neo-Nazi to smear Trump, Foer goes one step further by then using it to attack conservative and pro-Israel.What better way to respond to the murder of Jews than with a blood libel.Truly vile, as I said.\"After the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, Gary Cohn couldn't bring himself to resign from his job. After Squirrel Hill, Jared Kushner and Sheldon Adelson will likely stand their ground... Any strategy for enhancing the security of American Jewry should involve shunning Trump's Jewish enablers. Their money should be refused, their presence in synagogues not welcome. They have placed their community in danger.\"This is an actual blood libel.How exactly have Kushner and Adelson placed their community in danger?Foer, like the rest of the left, lets innuendo and hysteria stand in the place of actual facts or evidence. Meanwhile, when it comes to importing synagogue shooters and bombers, it's the left that has done a fine job importing the Islamic terrorists, who when they target synagogues are defended by the left.Foer has always been an execrable creature, but he's somehow managed to blame Kushner and Adelson for a massacre committed by a Neo-Nazi. Such Neo-Nazi attacks predated Trump. They will unfortunately postdate him.As will the vileness of leftists like Foer.Jewish-American writer David Simon blames Netanyahu for Pittsburgh attack[26] Jewish-American writer David Simon slammed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Twitter, claiming Netanyahu aided US President Donald Trump to be elected and that, in turn, enabled the rise of American fascism.In response to a tweet by Diaspora Minister Naftali Bennett, who flew to Pittsburgh in support of the Jewish community, Simon wrote that the minister should \"Go Home.\"\"Netanyahu's interventions in US politics aided in the election of Donald Trump,\" wrote Simon, who argued that the US President provides \"raw and relentless validation of white nationalism and fascism.\"Simon further wrote that \"the American Jewish community is now bleeding at the hands of the Israeli Prime Minister.\" Liberal Democrats who secured Baroness Tonge's seat in the House of Lords must now actively campaign for her removal over Pittsburgh comment[27] Disgraced Baroness Tonge, who was twice suspended from the Liberal Democrats over allegations of antisemitism and eventually resigned as pressure mounted, has suggested that the Israeli government bears some responsibility for today's horrific far-right terrorist attack on the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. Her immediate response to the attack was to post on Facebook: 'Absolutely appalling and a criminal act, but does it ever occur to Bibi [as the Israeli Prime Minister is nicknamed] and the present Israeli government that it's [sic] actions against Palestinians may be re-igniting antisemitism? I suppose someone will say that it is antisemitic to say so?'       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DqiObp3WwAA7pAb.jpg\">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DqiObp3WwAA7pAb.jpg</url> Attempting to blame the Jewish state for the actions of a neo-Nazi terrorist while, the bodies of his innocent victims are not yet cold, is utterly abhorrent.We consider that Baroness Tonge's ongoing membership of the House of Lords and the medical profession are stains on both institutions and we have formally complained to both the House of Lords and the General Medical Council in the past. The Liberal Democrats, which secured Baroness Tonge's seat in the House of Lords must now campaign for her to be removed from the legislature and stripped of her title.Baroness Tonge has a long history of using inflammatory, and sometimes antisemitic, language. In 2003 she compared conditions in Gaza to those in the Warsaw Ghetto, for which she was criticised by the chairman of the Yad Vashem Holocaust museum. The following year, during a spate of suicide bombings targeting Jews in Israel, she said that she 'might just consider becoming [a suicide bomber] myself' if she was a Palestinian. After her comments were condemned as 'completely unacceptable' by her own Party leader, Charles Kennedy, she told the BBC that suicide bombers' actions are 'appalling and loathsome'. Two years later in 2006, she told a fringe meeting at her Party conference: 'The pro-Israeli lobby has got its grips on the western world, its financial grips. I think they've probably got a grip on our Party.' Once again, her Party leader, then Sir Menzies Campbell, said that her comments had 'clear antisemitic connotations', but she was unapologetic.In 2010, in response to an antisemitic blood libel alleging that Israeli soldiers providing aid in Haiti were secretly harvesting victims' organs, Baroness Tonge suggested that Israel should conduct an inquiry to 'clear the names of the team in Haiti'. The Party leader, who by then was Nick Clegg, called the comments 'wrong, distasteful and provocative', and removed her as the Party's health spokesperson. In 2012, the situation worsened when Baroness Tonge told a group at Middlesex University: 'Beware Israel. Israel is not going to be there forever in its present performance.' Party leader Nick Clegg challenged her to apologise or resign for her remarks, following which she resigned the Party whip.PreOccupiedTerritory: Palestinian Authority To Pay Lifetime Pension To Pittsburgh Shooter (satire)[28] President Abbas issued an official statement that stressed the location of the attack on Jews should in no way prejudice the payment policy against the perpetrator of the act, and that he will ensure that such an exception is specifically negated in the regulations governing those payments. 'It would be a disservice to our resistance and their families to exclude such deeds from eligibility simply because they take place overseas,' the statement read.Even before the release of the gunman's identity by law enforcement, Abbas instructed his financial officials to discover the relevant information so that payment could be arranged as soon as possible. The fact that the killer was not Palestinian, stressed Abbas, should not be factor in his family's eligibility for a pension. 'The fact that this brave wielded a weapon and yelled, 'All Jews must die!' is enough,' he observed. Abbas added that it would constitute discrimination to reward attempts to kill Jews only in one part of the world.The final amount Bowers will receive remains unknown, as several of the wounded may yet succumb. Aburdeineh explained that the payments reflect the simple calculus of how many Jews were killed by the attacker.'We can't encourage noble resistance if we equate all achievements,' he acknowledged. 'Of course we have to scale the incentives to favor larger casualty figures. With the economic desperation hitting so many people, there's bound to be someone who picks up the gauntlet for such a guaranteed lifetime income.' Aburdeineh disclosed that there had yet been no contact between Palestinian representatives and the shooter or his family, but that the establishment of direct ties was a matter of time. 'We can even put him in contact with organizations that provide free legal defense in such cases,' he boasted. 'The New Israel Fund provides support for a whole bevy of them.'PM: Israel Will Not Accept Any Ultimatum Posed by Hamas[29] Israel will not accept any ultimatums from Hamas and \u200eits policy in Gaza will be dictated solely by its security \u200einterests, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his cabinet on Sunday.Speaking ahead of the weekly cabinet meeting, Netanyahu \u200edismissed a demand by Hamas military leader Yahya \u200eSinwar, who reportedly urged Israel to pay Gaza's rulers $15 million \u200ein cash every month or face an escalation in border violence and \u200earson terrorism. 'There is no way Israel will accept any ultimatum posed by Hamas,' Netanyahu said.The terrorist group further demanded that the first \u200epayment be made by this Thursday, according to Channel 12 news.According to the report, Sinwar said the funds would go toward paying Hamas functionaries' \u200ewages. The demand seeks to circumvent the financial \u200esanctions imposed on Gaza by Palestinian Authority \u200ePresident Mahmoud Abbas, whose Ramallah-based government has frozen \u200ethe transfer of funds used to pay Hamas' \u200ewages as part of efforts to wrest control of \u200eGaza from Hamas. \u200eThe cabinet was to discuss Hamas' threats, \u200eas well as the recent border flare-up in its weekly session.The Israeli Air Force bombed 80 terrorist targets in \u200eGaza over the weekend, after Islamic Jihad terrorist \u200efired some 40 rockets at southern Israel.\u200eOman says time to accept Israel after Netanyahu historic visit[30] Oman publicly called on Middle East countries to accept Israel after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday made a historic visit to the Arab Muslim state, which has no diplomatic ties with Israel.In a speech he delivered at the IISS Manama Dialogue security summit in Bahrain, Omani Foreign Minister Yousuf bin Alawi said, 'Israel is a state present in the region, and we all understand this. The world is also aware of this and maybe it is time for Israel to be treated the same [as other states] and to also bear the same obligations.'Netanyahu traveled to Oman at the invitation of the country's leader, Sultan Sayyid Qaboos bin Said Al Said, so that the two could discuss regional issues.The visit, which was kept secret until after Netanyahu's return to Israel on Friday, came just two days after a Palestinian delegation led by Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas was in Oman. Abbas also met with Sultan Qaboos.Oman is offering ideas to help Israel and the Palestinians to come together but is not acting as mediator, Yousuf bin Alawi bin Abdullah, the sultanate's minister responsible for foreign affairs, told the IISS Manama Dialogue security summit in Bahrain.Seth Frantzman: Oman visit only latest point of support for Israel [31] Across the region, Israel appears to be enjoying points of support. For instance, the visit to Muscat was celebrated in Omani media. Israel's national anthem was also played in Doha during a sporting event, and Israeli athletes were recently in the UAE. Some voices in the Gulf are sharing the news online with obvious approval. The National in the UAE highlighted the visit and had a special photo gallery devoted to it, while noting that UAE ally Saudi Arabia had stressed that 'Iran is the primary driver of instability in the region.'The subtle message was that Iran is the problem, and Oman's gesture to Israel is good for the region.The Oman visit has caused many to wonder about the hypocrisy in the Middle East. For instance, a commentator on Al Jazeera in Arabic said she rejected 'normalization' with Israel, but many on Twitter kept asking why it is that Doha hosts Israeli athletes with the Israeli flag. Kurdish commentators in northern Iraq also noted that the Kurdish region has often been excoriated for having relations with Israel, while the Omanis are now reaching out. Halal for them, haram for us, wondered one man, using the Arabic words for acceptable and forbidden.Iranian media is perplexed by such a public welcome to Israel in Oman. For many years, Tehran has tried to keep alive the notion that Israel is the sole problem in the region, with annual 'Jerusalem Day' events, and by constantly talking about Israeli threats. But the Syrian civil war, in which Iran partnered with the regime in Damascus and was seen as aiding the slaughter of civilians, has harmed Tehran's image. All that the Iranian media could do was stress that Israel's visit to Oman was not as good as it seems. The 'sultanate was only offering ideas to help Israel and Palestinians to come together,' Iran's Press TV, claimed. Tasnim News carried an article about IRGC commander Mohammed Ali Jafari giving a speech for Arba'een, a Shi'ite pilgrimage, claiming Muslims should unite against 'global arrogance,' which tends to be a reference to the US and Israel. #OnThisDay[32] 40 years ago, Prime Minister Begin and President Sadat were awarded the @NobelPrize[33] for peace.

TIPH has come under fire for actions taken by its members against the Jewish community of Hevron, including an incident where a foreign national struck a Jewish child.The representatives of the Foreign Ministry and the Prime Minister's Office, who are authorized to provide answers regarding the mandate given to the force, did not attend the discussion.Hevron District Commander Chen Morris told the committee: \"In the past two years, I have observed exceptional incidents involving members of the organization. The first occurred on 16 July 2017. An observer [from the organization] punctures vehicle tires. He was not interrogated, but sent back to his country. In another incident, fresh from last summer, an attack by an organization observer against a boy from the settlement occurred. He wore a uniform, signed up for a Breaking the Silence tour and was filmed striking [a child]. He was not interrogated and returned to his country on Saturday night, on July 18, 2018.\"\"There are other incidents, there is almost daily friction between the TIPH and the [Jewish] settlement [in Hevron], in one way or another,\" he added.Acting Director General of the Yesha Council, Yigal Dilmuni, presented a study by the Yesha Council, in which many cases were raised in which TIPH members harmed Israeli residents, soldiers and Israel's image in the world: \"The residents of the Jewish community in Hevron benefit 1,000 times more peace and tranquility than this organization, which only provokes and causes friction, as the police chief presented here. It's time to remove TIPH.\"Trump Signs Into Law New Sanctions Against Hezbollah On 35th Anniversary Of Beirut Bombing[43] After signing the legislation, Trump spoke before a large gathering to mark the 35th anniversary of the October 1983 bombing that took the lives of 241 service personnel at a Marine barracks in Beirut, Lebanon.Regarding Hezbollah, the president said:The attack was carried out by Hezbollah, which Iran was instrumental in founding a year earlier to advance its radical agenda, and remain its main patron today - and we are doing a big number on Iran today ... Over the past year we have levied the highest sanctions ever imposed on Hezbollah in a single year, by far. Just a few moments ago, I signed legislation imposing even more hard-hitting sanctions on Hezbollah to further starve them of their funds - and they are starving of funds.We will target, disrupt, and dismantle their operational and financing efforts, of which they have plenty - they don't have plenty now - and we will never forget what they did to our great Marines in Beirut. We will never forget. In first, Israelis judokas compete in UAE games under national flag[44] Culture and Sports Minister Miri Regev attended an international judo competition that began Saturday in the United Arab Emirates, as three Israeli players were awarded bronze medals and had their country's flag displayed on a screen.Gili Cohen, Baruch Shmailov and Timna Nelson Levy all finished third in their respective weight classes at the Abu Dhabi Judo Grand Slam.This was a significant change from last year, when UAE organizers singled Israel out with a ban on displaying its flag or playing its anthem during the tournament when one of its athletes was awarded a gold medal in the 66 kilograms (145 pounds) category.Judoka Tal Flicker defied the ban, singing the Israeli anthem, \"Hatikvah,\" on the podium, with the International Judo Federation's flag and anthem in the background.The UAE does not have diplomatic relations with Israel.In first, 'Hatikva' anthem played at UAE contest as Israeli judoka wins gold[45] Israel's national anthem was played at a judo tournament in Abu Dhabi on Sunday for the first time, after one of its athletes won gold.A visibly moved Culture and Sports Minister Miri Regev, who was at the contest to support the Israeli team, presented the medals and hung the gold medallion around the neck of judoka Sagi Muki.The playing of the Israeli national anthem and Regev's attendance at the tournament were the latest milestones in Israel's gradual rapprochement with some Arab states.Muki beat Belgian competitor Matthias Casse to take first place in the under-81 kilogram category at the Abu Dhabi Grand Slam.Following the medal distribution, the tournament presenter announced, in English, 'Ladies and gentleman, please rise for the national anthem of Israel' after which the 'Hatikva' melody began playing. A glimmer of joy amidst today's gloom, as Israel's national anthem, Hatikvah, plays in Abu Dhabi for the first time ever after Israel's Sagi Muki wins gold at the Abu Dhabi Judo Grand Slam. #JudoAbuDhabi2018[46] pic.twitter.com/DRKCAez91T[47] \u2014 Avi Mayer (@AviMayer) October 28, 2018[48]; We have lots of ideas, but we need more resources to be even more effective.

It reaffirms that you were ok the first time around and so a second bite is delightful. One such moment occurred last week at The Point[1], the conference for PaymentsNZ, the governance organisation at the heart of New Zealand's payments system. I couldn't stay long and did the keynote the first day, before flying out to Hong Kong, but here's a summary the guys at PaymentsNZ sent after the event. </p><p>Very useful. The conference Twitter hashtag #ThePoint2018 trended at number one in NZ across the two days, and there was a lot of fantastic media coverage from national business media (check out links to the stories at the end of this blog). Here are the top 10 insights, in no particular order: 1) Open banking is still the topic du jour - but independent commentator Dave Birch warns that open banking, the way it is done in the UK, can have unexpected consequences. Instead of open banking, Dave says we should be thinking and talking about open data that goes two ways, otherwise there will be a 'crippling asymmetry' between the big tech companies and banks and financial institutions. We also learned that we should now drop the GAFA (Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple) acronym when talking about the big tech giants and start using FATBAG (Facebook, Amazon, Tencent, Baidu, Ant and Google). 2) 'Fin' is the parent, 'tech' is the kid - we live in an era of unprecedented technological disruption, with international keynote speaker Chris Skinner noting that the most valuable companies today are digital companies. Stripe, started by a teenager, provides 22x more value per employee than JP Morgan. There is currently a re-bundling of fintech, moving away from traditional business models where you control every part of the process, to the 'parents' being co-creators and partners with the tech whiz kids. Chris warns that if decision makers don't understand how the tech works then that's going to be a problem for them, as the kids know how to codedo you? 3) The grasshopper or the ant - open APIs is the way of the future. We're moving on from the 'set menu' style and to a more 'buffet style' when it comes to financial services thanks to open banking technology, says Ismail Chaib from TESOBE/ the Open Bank Project. Regulators want open APIs but this is also an opportunity for banks to form new partnerships, innovate, and stay relevant. You're either the grasshopper who waits for regulation and does the minimum, or you're the ant who plans ahead and prepares for the future.4. Identity is in every challenge and every opportunity - identity is an intersection of the way we're governed and our culture, says Joni Brennan from the Digital ID ...thentication Council of Canada. The role of industry and regulators is to enable individuals to have access to manage their data and empower them to do so. We can't remove complexity from systems, but we can move them away from the end users. 4) Identity is in every challenge and every opportunity - identity is an intersection of the way we're governed and our culture, says Joni Brennan from the Digital ID ...thentication Council of Canada. The role of industry and regulators is to enable individuals to have access to manage their data and empower them to do so. We can't remove complexity from systems, but we can move them away from the end users. 5) We need to stay nimble to prevent fraud - identity theft is not new, it has always historically existed but the platforms through which criminals operate has changed along with technology. Dr Leila Fourie cites IBM research that says 95% of fraud cases are caused by people who make personal mistakes. We can't introduce technology to consumers in a fragmented way, as that will create more opportunities for fraud. 6) Collaboration 'with a big, big C' - collaboration is very much the theme when it comes to creating and maintaining effective governance frameworks, particularly when tackling fraud, building new payments systems, moving into open environments and managing the likes of digital authentication. Many speakers challenged both industry and regulators to understand that it's a learning journey and be ready and willing to adjust their positioning as they move along and learn from each other. Katrina Stuart from the New Payments Platform cites the NPP as an example of success, saying early indicators are encouraging, with great broad participation by Australian financial institutions, and positive customer reach and adoption. 7) Digital wallets need to resemble physical wallets - contactless cards are so popular in Australia and New Zealand that they have proven to be a barrier to mobile wallet adoption. Kate Wilson from RFi Group suggests that for digital wallets to take off for Kiwis, the mobile wallets will have to resemble physical wallets; containing not just debit and credit card information but also things like your driver's licence, and loyalty and store cards. 8) We have never been more connected - human connectivity is accelerating and the epicentre of digital connectivity is in the Asia Pacific region, says Glenn Maguire from VISA. He states that 70% of the total growth in global internet users is in the Asia Pacific region. Eighty-one percent of adult Kiwis use a smartphone, and the app economy is growing at a 40% year on year rate. Kaila Colbin of Missing Link Consultants says our technologies are accelerating, but also starting to converge, and what this means is we can turbocharge what we're doing. New technologies like blockchain can be used in innovative ways, so we need to keep an open mind at all times. 9) Augmentation is our future - the future is augmented, so let's embrace it, says Dr Roy Davies of Kiwi mixed reality company Imersia. Dr Davies talks about the growth of experience economies, where people pay for things that are not 'real' and is within virtual spaces. We are currently in the midst of a paradigm shift, moving on from the information age to the intelligence age, which means we have powerful tools at our fingertips to increase our mental capabilities. 10) At the end of the day it is still all about the customer - if innovators want to succeed they need to turn traditional business models upside down and build apps and technology with the customer foremost in their mind, instead of building something and hoping they will come. Tech companies are great at this, because they come in with a completely new, fresh outlook. The old product-first models no longer work. The industry should be asking how they can get a startup mentality throughout the organisation, says Chris Skinner.

According to the 2019 Ad Age Leading National Advertisers report[1], the top 200 advertisers collectively spent a record $163 billion on advertising in 2018. Some of the biggest ad spending increases came from internet-based giants like Amazon (32%), Google (23%), and Facebook[2] (236%). Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[3] Companies are constantly vying for consumers' attention, and they're spending more than ever to get it. Collectively, the top 200 advertisers in the US spent a record $163 billion on advertising in 2018, up 3.6% year on year, according to Ad Age's annual Leading National Advertisers report[4]. That growth is coming solely from internet ads \u2014 radio, print, and TV ad spending[5] has been steadily decreasing since 2012 \u2014 which make up 53% of ad spending. </p><p>Some of the biggest spenders are internet-based companies. Facebook[6] increased its ad spending by 236%, well beyond any other company, to $475 million. But despite the major increase, Facebook was only ranked No. 100 in top ad spenders. Other digital companies increased their ad spending as well, like Amazon (32%), Netflix (70%), and Google's parent company, Alphabet (23%). The biggest ad spender, however, was media giant Comcast[7], with $6.12 billion spent in 2018. Overall, there were 45 marketers that spent more than $1 billion on advertising in the US last year. Here are the top 10 biggest spenders. Lara O'Reilly contributed to an earlier version of this post. 10.

You know, a lot of folks this morning --</p><p>RON BROWNSTEIN, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Hey.</p><p>ROMANS: -- the morning after analysis is that, you know, Elizabeth Warren needed to survive and advance and that she managed to hold on, especially in the first half of the debate. She was -- she's seemed to sort of command the stage. [03:35:00] But then you have these breakaway performances by Cory Booker and by Julian Castro. Do you sort of agree with that analysis this morning?</p><p>BROWNSTEIN: I do. By the way, just slightly differ. This is still the night of for me. It's not the morning after. So we're kind of like in that. Look, you know, it's interesting. I thought that the other candidates chose not to engage Elizabeth Warren. I mean, she kind of ran in her own lane. She delivered kind of diced up versions of her stump speech on her major policy ideas.</p><p>And when even prompted to challenge her, Amy Klobuchar chose not to do that on really directly on Medicare-for-all or the free college, only kind of obliquely. And Cory Booker chose not to on kind of breaking up big technology companies. It was really left to John Delaney to make the case against the Medicare-for-all.</p><p>I do think the fact that she embraced so unequivocally the idea that everyone with private health insurance, 180 million people, are going to have to give it up and move into a government-run system is something that we have not heard the last of that tonight, certainly, if she makes it to the general election and even in the primaries.</p><p>But beyond that, yes, I agree that it was basically -- the night was fine for her and that Castro and Booker probably did the most to help themselves. I thought Klobuchar and Beto O'Rourke probably had the biggest missed opportunity. And for the remaining five, they started in the asterisk zero, 1 percent, 2 percent range. And although some of them performed incredibly, I don't really see anything that would move them out of that.</p><p>BRIGGS: Yes, the health care moment was interesting because Lester Holt just did a simple show of hands. It was elementary school for a moment --</p><p>BROWNSTEIN: Yes.</p><p>BRIGGS: -- who would abolish private health care and it was just Elizabeth Warren and Bill de Blasio that did raise their hands on that stage. So there are certain ways, Ron, to quantify all of this from the first night. Google Trends says Cory Booker had the most Google searches during this debate.</p><p>ROMANS: Yes.</p><p>BRIGGS: The other way to quantify it is simply who said the most, and that was easily the same answer. Cory Booker talked for 10 minutes 55 seconds, more than twice as much as Jay Inslee and basically twice as much as Bill de Blasio as well. Cory Booker said the most. Did he make the most of those words, though?</p><p>BROWNSTEIN: Well, it was interesting. It was kind of a tale of two debates. I mean, the first half, Warren was kind of the central focus. As we said, particularly, they kept asking her more questions --</p><p>ROMANS: Right.</p><p>BROWNSTEIN: -- than the others. But I thought in the second half, Cory Booker really picked up a lot of strength. I mean, he has been an undervalued stock in this race. I mean, it's been kind of a mystery to people why he hasn't struck more of a chord. He's certainly a dynamic orator. He's got a lot of energy, but he hasn't really emerged. We'll see if this is enough. You would think that this performance would get him a second look.</p><p>And perhaps also Castro to some extent a second look from voters. But there is a lot -- there is a long way to go for these candidates who are kind of, you know, trailing in the polls in part because all of them have somebody in front of them and the lane they want to occupy.</p><p>I mean, you know, if Cory Booker is going to become a first tier candidate, he's going to have to consolidate a lot of African-American support. He's already got Kamala Harris. He's got a few steps ahead of him on that.</p><p>And same thing with Klobuchar, if she's wants to be -- if she's going to make it into the top tier, she's got to consolidate a lot of blue collar, moderate, older white support. Well, she's got a guy named Joe Biden ahead of her in that line who we're going to see tonight.</p><p>ROMANS: Yes, the breakaway performances from tonight or last night, depending on how long you've been up.</p><p>BROWNSTEIN: Yes. We have few hours ago.</p><p>ROMANS: They have today to capitalize on that because in 24 hours we're going to be talking about another field of 10 --</p><p>BRIGGS: That's right.</p><p>BROWNSTEIN: Yes.</p><p>ROMANS: -- and the breakaway moments and who won and who advanced. Let's -- there was a question asked last night that each candidate had a chance to answer and I think it's sort of revealing of the world views of these -- all of these Democratic candidates, the greatest geopolitical threat to the United States. Listen.</p><p>BROWNSTEIN: Yes.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHUCK TODD, NBC WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: The greatest Geopolitical threat to the United States right now. Congressman Delaney?</p><p>JOHN DELANEY (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, the biggest geopolitical challenge is China.</p><p>TODD: OK.</p><p>DELANEY: But the biggest geopolitical threat --</p><p>TODD: Yes.</p><p>DELANEY: -- remains nuclear weapons, right?</p><p>TODD: OK.</p><p>DELANEY: So those are --</p><p>TODD: I got you.</p><p>DELANEY: You know, those are different questions.</p><p>TODD: Totally get it. Go ahead, Governor Inslee.</p><p>GOV. JAY INSLEE (D-WA) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The biggest threat to the security of the United States is Donald Trump and there's no question.</p><p>TODD: OK. Congresswoman Gabbard?</p><p>REP. TULSI GABBARD (D-HI) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The greatest --</p><p>TODD: Greatest geopolitical threat.</p><p>GABBARD: The greatest threat that we face is the fact that we are at a greater risk of nuclear war today than ever before in history.</p><p>TODD: Senator Klobuchar.</p><p>SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Two threats, economic threat, China. But our major threat right now is what's going on in the Mideast with Tehran if we don't get our act together.</p><p>TODD: OK. Try to keep it to one -- slimmer than what we've been going here, one or two words.</p><p>REP. BETO O'ROURKE (D-TX) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Our existential threat is climate change. We have to confront it before it's too late.</p><p>TODD: Senator Warren?</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Yes, climate change.</p><p>TODD: Yes. Senator Booker?</p><p>SEN. CORY BOOKER (D-NJ) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Nuclear proliferation and climate change.</p><p>TODD: Secretary Castro?</p><p>JULIAN CASTRO, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: China and climate change.</p><p>TODD: Congressman Ryan?</p><p>REP. TIM RYAN (D-OH) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: China without a question. They're wiping us around the world economically.</p><p>TODD: Yes. And Mr. Mayor?</p><p>MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Russia, because they're trying to undermine our democracy and they've been doing a pretty damn good job of it, and we need to stop them.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: The China answer actually was interesting to me because that might be at odds with Joe Biden, who is going to be the frontrunner tonight, could say when he is asked this question, Ron.</p><p>[03:40:03] BROWNSTEIN: Yes. I was surprised that more people didn't say something along the lines of what Governor Inslee did. I mean, I would think by the time we get to the fall of 2020, the Democratic nominee is going to say the biggest threat to America's position in the world is Donald Trump's posture of alienating allies and coddling dictators, and no one really went anywhere near that direction in trying to make that case against the President.</p><p>And don't forget, I mean, you know, you're basically calling on the American people to fire someone from their job and making that case is really kind of the job one all of the time for the Democratic nominee.</p><p>Other than that, the emphasis on climate really is striking as a geopolitical threat. As was how many Democrats basically echoed the Trumpian argument that we are now in a position of strategic competition with China as opposed to what both Obama and even Bush and certainly Clinton tried to manage a more nuanced relationship.</p><p>ROMANS: Interesting. All right, Ron Brownstein, thank you so much. He's in Colorado for us tonight. Thanks, Ron.</p><p>BROWNSTEIN: Thank you.</p><p>BRIGGS: And to his point, a headline on the \"Washington Examiner\" says Donald who? There were two candidates who didn't even mention Donald Trump, Elizabeth Warren and Bill de Blasio.</p><p>ROMANS: Yes, that's right.</p><p>BRIGGS: Will that change tonight? We'll find out.</p><p>Democrats don't approve of the President's Iran policy, but which 2020 candidates says we should stay out of the nuclear deal with Iran? CNN live in Tehran, next.</p><p>[03:45:32] BRIGGS: 3:45 Eastern Time. And threats from Iran front and center at last night's Democratic presidential debate.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LESTER HOLT, NBC ANCHOR: So a show of hands, who as president would sign on to the 2015 nuclear deal as it was originally negotiated?</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: This president is literally every single day 10 minutes away from going to war, one tweet away from going to war. And I don't think we should conduct foreign policy --</p><p>HOLT: All right, your time is up.</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: -- in our bathrobe at 5:00 in the morning.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: Was in a bathrobe at 5:00 in the morning. Lester Holt stepped on her signature line there. In case you missed it, New Jersey Senator Cory Booker was the only candidate who said he would not get back in the Iran nuclear deal, but he also says he would not have pulled out in the first place.</p><p>So how is all of this playing in Iran? Let's ask Fred Pleitgen who's live in Tehran this morning. Fred, good morning to you. Is Iran even interested in rejoining that Iran deal, the JCPOA, at this point?</p><p>FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, that's a very tough question. I think it also depends on who you ask here in Iran, whether it's the moderates or the hardliners. It was quite interesting because just yesterday Iran's President, Hassan Rouhani, said the U.S. should really join the nuclear agreement. Again, he said it would be in the interest both of Iran and the U.S. and the international community as well.</p><p>On the other hand, though, we can't underestimate how much bad blood there is in Iran right now towards the Trump administration, especially after the Trump administration sanctioned Iran's supreme leader. It's something that Iranian officials are saying again and again and the foreign ministry said right now the door is absolutely closed for negotiations. Also, of course, President Trump's rhetoric about possibly obliterating Iran, not going down well at all.</p><p>Yesterday, I exclusively managed to speak to the country's foreign minister and here's what he had to say.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MOHAMMAD JAVAD ZARIF, IRAN FOREIGN MINISTER: Well, he's certainly wrong, but that statement indicates that the United States' intentions are certainly illegal. The United States is not in a position to obliterate Iran. They do not have the capability other than using prohibited weapons to do this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PLEITGEN: So there's the foreign minister of Iran. And the Iranians today once again with some pretty strong rhetoric, they're coming out earlier today. Senior Iranian lawmaker came out and said the shooting down of the U.S. drone was a lesson that America needed, showing the U.S., as they say, that Iran will stand up to American power here in the Middle East, Dave. BRIGGS: All right, 12:17 p.m. there in Tehran. Fred, thank you.</p><p>ROMANS: All right. There have been calls to break up big tech companies like Amazon, Facebook and Google. And during that debate last night, Senator Cory Booker said there's a problem with corporate consolidation.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOOKER: This is actually an economy that's hurting small businesses and not allowing them to compete. I feel very strongly about the need to check the corporate consolidation and let the free market work.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: He also said this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOOKER: Again, I will single out companies like Halliburton or Amazon that pay nothing in taxes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: Right. Amazon and Halliburton's tax rates are low, but not necessarily zero. Amazon's tax returns are private. \"The Wall Street Journal\" recently reported Amazon's tax rate from 2012 to 2018 was 8 percent.</p><p>Before the debate, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg rehashed his position on government regulation. He said Facebook is self-regulating but wants more governments to step in as it grows around the world. Here's what he said about balancing free speech and what rules to enforce around election advertising.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, FACEBOOK CEO: I really don't think that as a society we want private companies to be the final word on making these decisions.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: Well, certainly, I mean, tech had the ability to self- regulate for years and didn't, right? Facebook is facing multiple investigations and a likely multibillion dollar fine from the FTC.</p><p>BRIGGS: All right. Instagram without the likes, it could be happening. We'll get a check on CNN Business, next.</p><p>[03:52:54] ROMANS: President Trump blasted American women's soccer co-captain Megan Rapinoe, Wednesday, for saying she wouldn't visit the White House if her team won the World Cup. This provoked a series of tweets from the President. He said Rapinoe should win before she talks, and he added, finish the job.</p><p>U.S. women's national team defender Ali Krieger tweeted harsh words back to the President saying, \"I know women who you cannot control or grope anger you, but I stand by Rapinoe.\"</p><p>President Trump has invited the U.S. national team to the White House, win or lose. They play France tomorrow.</p><p>BRIGGS: It's the end of an era for sports television. Longtime ESPN Sports Anchor Bob Ley retiring at the end of the month after 40 years at the network. Ley is a legend among sport's journalists. He's been with ESPN since it launched back in 1979.</p><p>The 64-year-old Ley says he is in good health and leaving entirely on his own decision. Ley is perhaps best known for the ESPN investigative show \"Outside the Lines.\"</p><p>ROMANS: Who knew watching \"Early Start\" could be a beneficial to your health. A new study says morning people may have a lower risk of breast cancer. Researchers analyzing sleep patterns found people who enjoyed getting up early are at a lower risk than people who stay up late, those so-called night owls. The study also found surprisingly sleeping more than the average seven to eight hours per night was linked to a slightly increased risk of breast cancer.</p><p>BRIGGS: Question is, is 3:00 a.m. early or is that just late and everything's messed up?</p><p>ROMANS: If you read that study, it says people who like getting up early. I get up early. I don't necessarily like it, so I don't know if I really fit the early bird category.</p><p>BRIGGS: We shall debate that. She is the first woman to serve in the Secret Service's elite motorcycle unit. CNN's Jessica Schneider introduces us to Lauren Gunawan who broke the glass ceiling on the back of a Harley.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LAUREN GUNAWAN, SECRET SERVICE MOTORCYCLE OFFICER: It's the freedom, the freedom of riding.</p><p>JESSICA SCHNEIDER, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Lauren Gunawan has had an obsession with motorcycles since age 18.</p><p>GUNAWAN: My parents were definitely not too excited that I got a motorcycle, my dad especially. I'm daddy's little girl.</p><p>[03:55:03] SCHNEIDER (voice-over): Gunawan grew up in Neponset, Illinois, population 400. It may have been a small town, but her upbringing sparked some big dreams.</p><p>GUNAWAN: It always made me want to be a police officer.</p><p>SCHNEIDER (voice-over): Gunawan's grandfather was an auxiliary police chief. Three years ago, she set her sights even higher and made the move to D.C. to join the Secret Service. But the roar of the engines from the motorcade support unit kept calling her name.</p><p>GUNAWAN: Motors popped up and I said, that's what I want to do, and I set my heart to it.</p><p>SCHNEIDER (on camera): Landing a spot in this elite unit is no easy task. In fact, it's just about a 40% pass rate and the biggest hurdle is actually being able to lift one of these 1,100-pound motorcycles.</p><p>GUNAWAN: Yes, it's a lot of bike, 1,100 pounds worth.</p><p>SCHNEIDER: Wow. So you have to be able to actually lift this up from the ground?</p><p>GUNAWAN: Yes, ma'am.</p><p>SCHNEIDER: All 1,100 pounds?</p><p>GUNAWAN: Yes, ma'am.</p><p>SCHNEIDER: That's a tough feat.</p><p>GUNAWAN: Yes.</p><p>SCHNEIDER: Could you do it the first time you tried?</p><p>GUNAWAN: Yes, ma'am.</p><p>SCHNEIDER: You could.</p><p>GUNAWAN: I put all the hard work and dedication into it.</p><p>SCHNEIDER (voice-over): Officer Technician Gunawan makes it look easy, but she is the first woman to ever join the elite motorcade support unit. It's the division that clears the way for presidential motorcades, maneuvering through Washington gridlock, plotting a path for the president and V.P. The training and ultimate test to become part of this just 14-member team aren't easy.</p><p>Gunawan embarked on a two-week course riding her Harley eight hours a day, weaving in and out of tight spaces. The first time she tried she failed.</p><p>GUNAWAN: When I got my opportunity the first time, I was able to pick that bike up no problem. I just didn't get through the course the first time, so I was thankful that they were able to give me a second opportunity.</p><p>BRIAN POPIEL, OFFICER TECHNICIAN: She was definitely determined to become a technician on this unit and to get mounted. She just -- every day, she gave 120 percent.</p><p>SCHNEIDER: Officer Technician Popiel trained Gunawan and said her attitude made the difference.</p><p>POPIEL: There's no reason that a woman shouldn't be in this, in this unit. She brings a lot to the table. Her attitude is by far probably one of the best that, you know, I've seen.</p><p>SCHNEIDER: At just 30 years old, Lauren Gunawan has made her mark.</p><p>GUNAWAN: It was extraordinary. I feel like I got to break that glass ceiling.</p><p>SCHNEIDER: And set the bar for future females.</p><p>GUNAWAN: I don't want anybody to think that they can't get something and it looks unreachable. If you put dedication and hard work into it, you'll get it and you'll achieve your goals.</p><p>SCHNEIDER: Jessica Schneider, CNN, Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROMANS: All right. What a cool story. All right, let's get a check on CNN Business this morning. First a look at global markets, there is some cautious optimism on trade.</p><p>The South China Morning Post citing sources said Washington and Beijing are laying out an agreement that would help avert the next round of tariffs on an additional $300 billion of Chinese imports. If that's going to be the marker for success for this weekend, it looks like they're putting that marker out there.</p><p>On \"Wall Street\" right now, Futures also leaning slightly higher here. You know, stocks finished basically flat, Wednesday, despite the Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin saying a trade deal with China was about 90 percent complete.</p><p>The Dow close down about 12 points. The S&amp;P 500 finish lower and the NASDAQ ended a day up just a bit.</p><p>Look, it's been a fantastic month, right? So you're going to have to see some kind of progress or some sort of resolution in trade before you can really start to attack record highs again in the stock market.</p><p>Investors now turn their attention to that G20 and the meeting between the President and the Chinese President Xi Jinping over the weekend.</p><p>Instagram is considering a big change to the platform.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ADAM MOSSERI, HEAD OF INSTAGRAM: One of the ideas we're currently experimenting with is making like accounts private, for instance, because we don't want Instagram to be such a competition.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: That's the head of Instagram. He said the company is rethinking the whole experience of Instagram with well-being as its top priority. He added Instagram will do things to create a healthier environment and focus less on social comparison.</p><p>BRIGGS: Very much like.</p><p>ROMANS: Yes.</p><p>BRIGGS: I love that idea. Debate night was just what the doctor ordered for late night comedian Stephen Colbert went live with his take.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEPHEN COLBERT, \"THE LATE SHOW\" HOST: The first of two Democratic presidential debates. I'm going to tell you all about it if Bill de Blasio does not interrupt me. It was an excellent dress rehearsal for tomorrow's actual debate now.</p><p>DE BLASIO: (Foreign Language).</p><p>COLBERT. When Beto was hablandoing de Espanol, this is true, in the closed captioning, it just said \"speaking foreign language.\" I like that. Really got through. Really penetrated. It's a foreign language. Can we get a look at NBC's closed captioning guy? Yes, makes sense. Booker took Beto's Spanish and raised mucho mas.</p><p>BOOKER: (Foreign Language)</p><p>COLBERT. Oh, snap.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[04:00:00]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2019062706CNV34</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WFC-5C01-JB20-G1K6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3637\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 27, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0004F66</classCode><className>ESPN INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SIC4841 CABLE &amp;

The nine-year bull market is at a crossroads, and a slowdown in earnings growth may be all it takes to push stocks into bear market territory for the first time in nearly a decade. Earnings season is particularly high-stakes in the technology sector, after several large, popular <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/7-of-the-best-tech-stocks-to-buy-for-2018\">tech stocks</url> have struggled in recent weeks. Here's a preview of what Bank of America analyst Justin Post is expecting from tech stocks this earnings season. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/articles/2018-01-16/alphabet-inc-goog-googl-facebook-fb-stock\">Alphabet stock</url> is down 3 percent year-to-date, lagging the 11 percent overall gain for the technology sector. Investors are concerned about regulatory threats to Google's advertising business. Post says investor sentiment, moderating traffic acquisition costs and clarity on new European data regulations could serve as bullish catalysts. Bank of America is calling for EPS of $12.36 on revenue of $24.857 billion, above consensus estimates of $12.08 and $24.326 billion, respectively. Alphabet is expected to report earnings after the market close on April 23. Bank of America has a \"buy\" rating and $1,360 price target for GOOGL stock.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amazon.com (AMZN)</emphasis></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/articles/2018-03-28/amazon-com-inc-amzn-stock\">Amazon.com stock</url> has taken a beating in the past two weeks after President Donald Trump repeatedly publicly criticized the company's tax practices and its U.S. Postal Service shipping subsidies. Post says Amazon's underlying business is strong, and Trump poses little threat to Amazon's long-term trajectory. Bank of America is calling for EPS of $3.03 on revenue of $50.422 billion compared to consensus estimates of $3.10 and $49.942 billion, respectively. Amazon is expected to report earnings after the market close April 25. Bank of America has a \"buy\" rating and $1,650 price target for AMZN stock.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Booking Holdings (BKNG)</emphasis></p><p>Booking Holdings continues to focus on controlling its spending and sacrificing bookings growth for margin improvements. If margins stabilize, Post says booking growth could accelerate in the second half of the year. Booking has also been working on building a reliable, long-term direct traffic business. Bank of America is calling for EPS of $10.62 on revenue of $2.837 billion compared to consensus estimates of $10.59 and $2.875 billion, respectively. Booking Holdings is expected to report earnings after the market close on May 7. Bank of America has a \"buy\" rating and $2,230 price target for BKNG stock.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">eBay (EBAY)</emphasis></p><p>Gross merchandise volume has been on the upswing for eBay, and Post says margins could stabilize this year. Bank of America is forecasting GMV growth to increase by 7.4 percent in 2018. Online retailer eBay has improved its user experience, launched guaranteed delivery and improved its marketing efficiency. Bank of America is calling for EPS of 54 cents on revenue of $2.605 billion compared to consensus estimates of 54 cents and $2.590 billion, respectively. The company is expected to report earnings after the market close on April 17. Bank of America has a \"buy\" rating and $52 price target for EBAY stock.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Expedia (EXPE)</emphasis></p><p>On its fourth-quarter earnings call, Expedia management indicated that the first quarter got off to a strong start. However, Post says HomeAway losses, Trivago losses and cloud expenses will all weigh on earnings this quarter. Bank of America is calling for an EPS loss of 66 cents on revenue of $2.426 billion compared to consensus estimates of a 35-cent loss and $2.439 billion, respectively. Expedia is expected to report earnings after the market close on April 26. Bank of America has a \"buy\" rating and $134 price target for EXPE stock.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook (FB)</emphasis></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/articles/2018-01-03/facebook-inc-fb-best-stocks-to-buy-for-2018\">Facebook</url> may be the most intensely scrutinized stock of 2018 after the company's Cambridge Analytica data scandal started grabbing headlines last month. Post says investors can expect further headline risk ahead of CEO Mark Zuckerberg's upcoming congressional testimony, but advertisers appear to be staying loyal to Facebook. Bank of America is calling for EPS of $1.59 on revenue of $11.831 billion, above consensus estimates of $1.36 and $11.427 billion, respectively. Facebook is expected to report earnings after the market close on April 25. Bank of America has a \"buy\" rating and $210 price target for FB stock.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fitbit (FIT)</emphasis></p><p>Fitbit certainly has a low bar to clear this quarter after the company guided for a 15 to 20 percent revenue decline. Unfortunately, Post says the company may not even hit those depressed targets. Device sales rankings on Amazon are still declining. Bank of America is calling for an EPS loss of 20 cents on revenue of $247 million compared to consensus estimates of a 20-cent loss and $247 million, respectively. Fitbit is expected to report earnings after the market close on May 1. Bank of America has an \"underperform\" rating and $5 price target for FIT stock.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Netflix (NFLX)</emphasis></p><p>Post says the Netflix quarter will be all about international subscriber growth. Post is calling for 4.95 million net international subscriber additions and 1.46 million net domestic ads. Netflix must come up with some impressive numbers to justify its stock's 47 percent year-to-date gain. Bank of America is calling for EPS of 65 cents on revenue of $3.696 billion compared to consensus estimates of 71 cents and $3.698 billion, respectively. Netflix is expected to report earnings after the market close on April 16. Bank of America has a \"buy\" rating and $300 price target for <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/articles/2017-11-26/netflix-inc-nflx-stock-to-buy\">NFLX stock</url>.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Snap (SNAP)</emphasis></p><p>The Snapchat app redesign was supposed to be a positive catalyst for SNAP stock, but it was met with harsh public criticism. Snap investors are also bracing for new data regulations that could negatively impact Snap's advertising business. Bank of America is calling for an EPS loss of 15 cents on revenue of $248 million, above consensus estimates of a 17-cent loss and $244 million, respectively. Snap is expected to report earnings after the market close on May 8. Bank of America has a \"buy\" rating and $24 price target for SNAP stock.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Twitter (TWTR)</emphasis></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/articles/2018-02-21/twitter-inc-twtr-stock-twitterlockout\">Twitter</url> has finally shown some signs of stabilization in recent quarters, reporting year-over-year revenue growth and user engagement growth in the fourth quarter. Still, Post says Twitter's sub-5 percent subscriber growth is nothing to get excited about, and the stock already seems to be fully valued. Bank of America is calling for EPS of 14 cents on revenue of $613 million, above consensus estimates of 11 cents and $605 million, respectively. Twitter is expected to report earnings before the market open on April 24. Bank of America has an \"underperform\" rating and $26 price target for TWTR stock.</p><p/><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wayne Duggan</emphasis> is a freelance investment strategy reporter with a focus on energy and emerging market stocks.

Because of this, both the traditional banking system and fintechs are at the forefront of evolving challenges in 2020.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here are 10 points on where fintech is headed next.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Rebundling will follow the great unbundling</p><p>During the last decade, startups have unbundled financial services for easy delivery through mobile apps and direct-to-customer acquisition models. Meanwhile, banks have mostly been caught flat-footed with outdated one-size-fits-all offerings.</p><p>Well-funded, single-product disruptors have reached significant scale in many markets. As new products and services are presented, these startups will expand into modern money hubs. Their significant financial benefits and actionable financial advice will secure stickier and higher-revenue customer relationships.</p><p>Incumbents should take note: It's time to cut across product lines and resell services from industry peers (including startups), or develop more of their own, to create cohesive finance experiences for customers.</p><p>E-commerce battles are brewing</p><p>Lenders and payment processors globally will continue their quests to democratize e-commerce and prevent it from becoming concentrated on a handful of powerful platforms.</p><p>The fast-growing popularity of video-based mobile platforms will prompt the launch of more QVC- and HSN-like services across emerging markets, giving local sellers access to sizable markets that were previously unreachable.</p><p>Watch Asia for leadership: free from Amazon's dominance. Large national markets with rising underserved populations and rapid adoption of smartphones present mobile commerce opportunities.</p><p>Big tech is moving into fintech</p><p>Big tech has data and distribution locked in key elements for the launch of new businesses. To boost future revenues, the tech giants will further expand their payments businesses.</p><p>Boston Consulting Groupestimatesthat $1 trillion payments in revenue stands to be won by big tech through 2027. Bank accounts and other core banking services could follow once consumers overcome fears about a lack of privacy.</p><p>Once trust is established, machine learning and artificial intelligence assets developed by tech leaders could change how businesses and personal financial lives function. Process automation, real-time insights and safe online storage will lead to cost savings, efficiencies and better decisions for all types of consumers. Alexa, Siri and other voice-powered peers could be the future CFO and financial adviser.</p><p>As neobanks become incumbents, more will launch</p><p>Millions of global customers have adopted new digital-only \"challenger banks\" as their bank of choice. Remarkably, these neobanks are not banks, strictly speaking, and rely on a handful of licensed institutions to conduct business.</p><p>Neobanks have successfully won customer relationships away from the traditional banking sector. Given their size and success, they are unlikely to fade away anytime soon.</p><p>The banking industry needs to stop treating these new participants like underfunded, unproven upstarts and instead embrace them as peers. Success begets success.</p><p>Many more neobanks will launch in underserved markets and sectors globally. Even the saturated U.S. and Western European markets are ripe for verticalized challengers that will out-hustle incumbents. Small business, medical and legal professionals, new homebuyers and college students are huge market segments ripe for the taking.</p><p>Fintechs are facing an Amazon-like moment</p><p>Open data, open protocols and modern infrastructure platforms have thrust the financial services sector into an \"Amazon Web Services moment\" where it's cheaper, faster and more reliable than ever before to launch new fintech products or services.</p><p>Fast-moving innovators will continue to attack the most profitable elements of financial services value chains and gradually unseat incumbents - from typical sectors such as payments, savings and credit, to adjacent sectors such as insurance and real estate.</p><p>The handful of licensed financial institutions that supported the fintech industry through innovative partnership strategies will become more active in seeking equity-based upsides in the unicorns they once helped grow.</p><p>Look for relief in high customer-acquisition costs</p><p>The Achilles' heel of many startups is the high cost of acquisition of new customers. Fintech innovators have an opportunity to pursue new \"sell-through\" and \"sell-with\" strategies, thanks to recent success stories at big tech.</p><p>New high-growth services do not have to be delivered as standalone offerings; it can instead become part of the native user interface of other products, embedded as features of platforms that already have direct customer relationships.</p><p>Fintech is poised to become a new layer on a technology stack that's built on top of the internet, cloud and mobile technologies. Keep an eye on the sharing economy: Decentralized asset ownership and strong technology make this fertile ground to launch new models.</p><p>The U.S. payments market is begging to be disrupted</p><p>If any payments market has an expired \"disrupt by\" date, it's the U.S. This huge market is lagging behind global competitors, and processors experience its inefficiencies every day. Most electronic payments aren't really \"real time,\" and cash still isn't dead. Politics and practicality are keeping cash alive.</p><p>Expect that retail environments will find a happy balance between checkout-free shopping and cash-preferred customers. Specialized locations like grocery chains, airport retail stores and sports stadiums will deploy checkout-free convenience options.</p><p>Despite criticism from domestic competitors, the Federal Reserve'splanned real-time payments networkby 2024 gives hope that the U.S. market will catch up with other developed economies. This will be a massive game changer for all transactions.</p><p>Blockchain is going institutional</p><p>Over the past five years, the financial services incumbents who initially derided the promise of the blockchain have been quietly collaborating and securing IP and technology leadership in this broader digital-ledger category, with a focus on solving \"real\" financial services problems. This is still in its early stages.</p><p>As the discussion moves away from the price of a digital asset to the opportunities that a public digital ledger represents, these innovations will become critical parts of the financial services infrastructure, matched by significant investment and strong regulatory support.</p><p>It's clicks, not bricks</p><p>In the past decade, leading banks navigated a journey: from being brick-and-mortar institutions to becoming digital banks. That's where most cast anchor.</p><p>Today, these forward-looking banks are striving to become digital companies and are enjoying the benefits of having the majority of their customers engaging in digital-only channels.</p><p>The lines in the battle for wallet share and relationship banking have clearly been redrawn. Customer acquisition and retention through digital channels in a mobile-app world is the future of financial services.</p><p>Don't forget the regulators</p><p>The success of fintech is largely due to the tacit approval of hospitable regulators that have allowed unlicensed entrepreneurs to rethink and rebuild financial services, enabled by advances in technology.</p><p>As the challengers become incumbents, regulators will increase their oversight and enforcement activities. It's a welcome sign that fintech has grown up.</p><p>Privacy and competition will be top of mind for global regulators.The regulatory agenda is packed for the foreseeable future: whether it's the dominance of big tech; the launch of new global cryptocurrencies; or the entry of nonbanks into the banking system.</p><p>However, for those in the U.S., the multistate regulatory framework will be an impediment to real progress, unless well-funded challengers deploy legal strategies in support of technology strategies.</p><p>Regulators are rapidly adopting new data tools and systems as they monitor their industries and enforce regulations.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AMBNKR-0000016f-8ba5-d13f-ab6f-efe55efd0000-1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AMBNKR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XY7-7V91-F06X-W2XF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303174</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1362\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 SourceMedia, Inc.

Because of this, both the traditional banking system and fintechs are at the forefront of evolving challenges in 2020.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here are 10 points on where fintech is headed next.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Rebundling will follow the great unbundling</p><p>During the last decade, startups have unbundled financial services for easy delivery through mobile apps and direct-to-customer acquisition models. Meanwhile, banks have mostly been caught flat-footed with outdated one-size-fits-all offerings.</p><p>Well-funded, single-product disruptors have reached significant scale in many markets. As new products and services are presented, these startups will expand into modern money hubs. Their significant financial benefits and actionable financial advice will secure stickier and higher-revenue customer relationships.</p><p>Incumbents should take note: It's time to cut across product lines and resell services from industry peers (including startups), or develop more of their own, to create cohesive finance experiences for customers.</p><p>E-commerce battles are brewing</p><p>Lenders and payment processors globally will continue their quests to democratize e-commerce and prevent it from becoming concentrated on a handful of powerful platforms.</p><p>The fast-growing popularity of video-based mobile platforms will prompt the launch of more QVC- and HSN-like services across emerging markets, giving local sellers access to sizable markets that were previously unreachable.</p><p>Watch Asia for leadership: free from Amazon's dominance. Large national markets with rising underserved populations and rapid adoption of smartphones present mobile commerce opportunities.</p><p>Big tech is moving into fintech</p><p>Big tech has data and distribution locked in key elements for the launch of new businesses. To boost future revenues, the tech giants will further expand their payments businesses.</p><p>Boston Consulting Groupestimatesthat $1 trillion payments in revenue stands to be won by big tech through 2027. Bank accounts and other core banking services could follow once consumers overcome fears about a lack of privacy.</p><p>Once trust is established, machine learning and artificial intelligence assets developed by tech leaders could change how businesses and personal financial lives function. Process automation, real-time insights and safe online storage will lead to cost savings, efficiencies and better decisions for all types of consumers. Alexa, Siri and other voice-powered peers could be the future CFO and financial adviser.</p><p>As neobanks become incumbents, more will launch</p><p>Millions of global customers have adopted new digital-only \"challenger banks\" as their bank of choice. Remarkably, these neobanks are not banks, strictly speaking, and rely on a handful of licensed institutions to conduct business.</p><p>Neobanks have successfully won customer relationships away from the traditional banking sector. Given their size and success, they are unlikely to fade away anytime soon.</p><p>The banking industry needs to stop treating these new participants like underfunded, unproven upstarts and instead embrace them as peers. Success begets success.</p><p>Many more neobanks will launch in underserved markets and sectors globally. Even the saturated U.S. and Western European markets are ripe for verticalized challengers that will out-hustle incumbents. Small business, medical and legal professionals, new homebuyers and college students are huge market segments ripe for the taking.</p><p>Fintechs are facing an Amazon-like moment</p><p>Open data, open protocols and modern infrastructure platforms have thrust the financial services sector into an \"Amazon Web Services moment\\xE2  where it's cheaper, faster and more reliable than ever before to launch new fintech products or services.</p><p>Fast-moving innovators will continue to attack the most profitable elements of financial services value chains and gradually unseat incumbents - from typical sectors such as payments, savings and credit, to adjacent sectors such as insurance and real estate.</p><p>The handful of licensed financial institutions that supported the fintech industry through innovative partnership strategies will become more active in seeking equity-based upsides in the unicorns they once helped grow.</p><p>Look for relief in high customer-acquisition costs</p><p>The Achilles' heel of many startups is the high cost of acquisition of new customers. Fintech innovators have an opportunity to pursue new \"sell-through\" and \"sell-with\" strategies, thanks to recent success stories at big tech.</p><p>New high-growth services do not have to be delivered as standalone offerings; it can instead become part of the native user interface of other products, embedded as features of platforms that already have direct customer relationships.</p><p>Fintech is poised to become a new layer on a technology stack that's built on top of the internet, cloud and mobile technologies. Keep an eye on the sharing economy: Decentralized asset ownership and strong technology make this fertile ground to launch new models.</p><p>The U.S. payments market is begging to be disrupted</p><p>If any payments market has an expired \"disrupt by\" date, it's the U.S. This huge market is lagging behind global competitors, and processors experience its inefficiencies every day. Most electronic payments aren't really \"real time,\" and cash still isn't dead. Politics and practicality are keeping cash alive.</p><p>Expect that retail environments will find a happy balance between checkout-free shopping and cash-preferred customers. Specialized locations like grocery chains, airport retail stores and sports stadiums will deploy checkout-free convenience options.</p><p>Despite criticism from domestic competitors, the Federal Reserve'splanned real-time payments networkby 2024 gives hope that the U.S. market will catch up with other developed economies. This will be a massive game changer for all transactions.</p><p>Blockchain is going institutional</p><p>Over the past five years, the financial services incumbents who initially derided the promise of the blockchain have been quietly collaborating and securing IP and technology leadership in this broader digital-ledger category, with a focus on solving \"real\" financial services problems. This is still in its early stages.</p><p>As the discussion moves away from the price of a digital asset to the opportunities that a public digital ledger represents, these innovations will become critical parts of the financial services infrastructure, matched by significant investment and strong regulatory support.</p><p>It's clicks, not bricks</p><p>In the past decade, leading banks navigated a journey: from being brick-and-mortar institutions to becoming digital banks. That's where most cast anchor.</p><p>Today, these forward-looking banks are striving to become digital companies and are enjoying the benefits of having the majority of their customers engaging in digital-only channels.</p><p>The lines in the battle for wallet share and relationship banking have clearly been redrawn. Customer acquisition and retention through digital channels in a mobile-app world is the future of financial services.</p><p>Don't forget the regulators</p><p>The success of fintech is largely due to the tacit approval of hospitable regulators that have allowed unlicensed entrepreneurs to rethink and rebuild financial services, enabled by advances in technology.</p><p>As the challengers become incumbents, regulators will increase their oversight and enforcement activities. It's a welcome sign that fintech has grown up.</p><p>Privacy and competition will be top of mind for global regulators.The regulatory agenda is packed for the foreseeable future: whether it's the dominance of big tech; the launch of new global cryptocurrencies; or the entry of nonbanks into the banking system.</p><p>However, for those in the U.S., the multistate regulatory framework will be an impediment to real progress, unless well-funded challengers deploy legal strategies in support of technology strategies.</p><p>Regulators are rapidly adopting new data tools and systems as they monitor their industries and enforce regulations.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AMBNKR-0000016f-8ba5-d13f-ab6f-efe55efd0000-8</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AMBNKR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XYC-7YP1-JCRW-54PV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303174</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1362\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 SourceMedia, Inc.

Well, we have some good news for all you marketers! In this blog, we have summed up eMarketer[1]'s article about the digital landscape and predictions in the new year.Prediction #1: Social advertising transparency will become a big dealDue to Russia's meddling with the 2016 US election using both Facebook and Twitter ads, the two social platforms are taking steps to make it easier to find out who the advertiser is, how much they are spending and how the ads are targeted. Facebook said it will let anyone see what ads a page is running, even if they are not being targeted by the ads. </p><p>When it comes to political ads, the information will be deeper: showing the amount spent, number of impressions and the ways the ads were targeted. Twitter will be creating an 'ad transparency center,' showing all ads currently running, how long they have been running and targeting information. Now Facebook and Twitter must actually start to implement what they are planning/talking about, proving to be no easy task - given the volume of advertising and complicated technologies like dynamic ads. This full transparency they speak of might not be so easy to achieve.Prediction #2: Voice search will become widespreadVoice search is becoming a standard operating system in most households. Amazon's Echo and Google's Home devices are growing in popularity and being installed in more homes than ever before. eMarketer estimates the number of US voice-enabled digital assistant users will rise by 14.1% (to 69.0 million) next year, while the number of voice-enabled speaker users will climb 27.6% (to 45.4 million). With more users relying on voice to search, marketers need to adjust their SEO and content strategies. Marketers must consider content that fits in with conversational language, while knowing that the first result will only matter as voice search engines only serve voice searchers with one answer rather than a list of options.Prediction #3: Augmented reality will become mainstreamAugmented reality has something that virtual reality doesn't \u2014 it can be run on mobile devices people already have. Nothing additional like headsets needs to be purchased. Both Apple and Google are encouraging mobile experimentation, potentially making AR available to many smartphone users. Ikea recently introduced an AR-driven furniture placement app, Place[2]. This is a great example of how AR can be a part of everyday use.Prediction #4: Big Tech's image will become dirtyThings are changing for tech giants due to damaging news reports. 'Facebook as conduit for Russian meddling in elections, Google as heavily fined violator of European antitrust law, Apple as international iMaster of tax avoidance, and so on.' All of these stories will start to shift the way consumers view these companies, and create an environment for lawmakers to assert more control and squeeze more tax revenues from them. eMarketer predicts there will be even more blood in the water as these tech companies resist.Prediction #5: People will recognize Amazon's role in the advertising marketplaceAll of us are familiar with one of the largest retailers, Amazon, but not all know that Amazon is becoming a 'digital advertising powerhouse.' eMarketer expects Amazon's net US digital ad revenues will increase by 42% in 2018, reaching $2.35 billion. Amazon's strength as an ad platform is because of search and display. With search, brands with an Amazon presence are increasing their spend into highly effective cost-per-click placements, ensuring they get consumers' attention. On the display side, the Amazon Advertising Platform has targeting capabilities that allow marketers to see users' interest based on their Amazon searching, browsing and buying. Already in July 2017, a ClickZ Intelligence and Catalyst survey of business-to-consumer marketers in North America found that early two-thirds planned to increase ad spending on Amazon in the next 12 months \u2014 higher than other platforms like Google and Facebook.Prediction #6: Hacks and breaches will change the privacy landscapeSecurity hacks from Target to Equifax have made the news, and left consumers with fear of identity theft. A 2017 survey of internet users worldwide by Accenture found that just 14% of respondents were confident that their personal online data is safe. However, very few companies have stepped up their efforts when it comes to security practices, and consumers continue to shop online and share more data about themselves. This continues a vicious cycle of data collections and breaches. 2018 is the year the landscape will begin to change, partly due to the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This legislation will require companies doing business with EU citizens to follow strict data-protection requirements. Failure to do so will result in heavy fines. The GDPR will better protect organizations from cyberattacks and consumers from having their identity stolen. Companies will need to find ways to protect consumers' information and perhaps decrease the amount of data they collect. Regardless, digital privacy environment will change significantly.Prediction #7: Taking advantage of BlockchainFor marketers, Blockchain will change pieces of the digital advertising landscape. Some ad firms will begin to use Blockchain to fight ad fraud, while making the digital ad supply chain more efficient. Blockchain as a reliable ledger would mean that brands could be sure that what they thought they were buying really was what they were buying, and ultimately to trace the course of dollars put into digital advertising. According to eMarketer, this would allow advertisers to pinpoint and eliminate fraud and to make the digital media buys more efficient. 'Tracing where ad spending goes - and how much of it ends up with each ad tech firm rather than with publishers - would put pressure on those programmatic players to prove they add value.'Prediction #8: Digital video will go big and smallDigital video is concentrated now in two areas \u2014 mobile and connected devices \u2014 and there is a continuing increase in the amount of time adults spend viewing digital video. The viewership trend will encourage spending in mobile video and connected TV. Connected TV platforms faces many obstacles, including lacking the scale advertisers are used to finding on network and pay TV, and lacking programmatic advertising. According to eMarketer, these obstacles won't disappear overnight, but will take a leap forward in 2018. Ad spending will catch up with consumer behavior.Prediction #9: Gains in online-to-offline data will lead to more localized mobile advertisingImproved online-to-offline data will add another layer of understanding about mobile behavior and advertising performance, which should make advertising more personalized and localized. Location data has been available to mobile marketers for years. Facebook and Google have used this data to their advantage. Google has local inventory ads and map ads and Facebook has local awareness ads. Both companies give advertisers tools to attribute offline sales and store traffic to online ads. Mobile advertisers have also discovered that the real 'gold' in location data is in patterns of movement over time, helping to better understand their customers. For example, if you go to the batting cage every Saturday, odds are you may be interested in baseball gear and equipment. Dynamically localized ads to reflect customer behaviors and patterns on platforms like Facebook and Google is where advertisers' mobile ad dollars should go.Prediction #10: Marketing world's attention shifts to Gen-ZersMarketers started obsessing over Millennials before many of them had money to spend. All the while, they ignored Boomers and Gen-Xers who actually had money to spare. Buzz around Gen Z in the past year suggests some ill-advised marketers may start to concentrate on them. It doesn't make sense to ignore Millennials now that they are advancing in their careers and are becoming heads of households. Gen-Zers will eventually become the 'consumer powerhouse,' but that day is very far away. Marketers should be paying attention to today's main consumers.

Throughout the long pandemic shutdown, Big Tech has supplied the products and services that allow many Americans to keep working remotely and to stay in touch with family and friends while socially distancing. Our connectedness is one of the few bright spots in this ordeal. It\u2019s an odd moment for lawmakers to be expending energy on castigating America\u2019s most innovative and globally competitive companies, simply because they are big.     However, critics of the tech giants have labeled them \u201cmonopolies\u201d and increasingly advocate for regulators to break them up . With that in mind, here are 10 myths about Big Tech and antitrust you should be aware of before tuning in to the hearing.   Myth #1: \u201cBig Tech companies are monopolies\u201d   There is a difference between the layperson\u2019s use of \u201cmonopoly\u201d and the technical meaning of the term. In casual commentary, \u201cmonopoly\u201d is often used interchangeably with \u201clarge\u201d or \u201cdominant\u201d when describing a company. But the term has a much more precise legal definition, and future court cases will hinge on its technical rather than colloquial meaning. According to DOJ guidelines , a company has monopolized a market when it has \u201cmaintained a market share in excess of two-thirds for a significant period and market conditions (for example, barriers to entry) are such that the firm\u2019s market share is unlikely to be eroded in the near future.\u201d The tech companies are not above that threshold:    Amazon has 38% of the US e-commerce market, including first party sales and sales from third parties on the Amazon Marketplace.  Apple has 58% of the US smartphone operating system market.  Google has 29% of the US digital advertising market  Facebook has 23% of the US digital advertising market.    Amazon is actually a surging competitor in digital advertising, and has an estimated 10% market share this year. It is deeply ironic that multiple Big Tech companies have been accused of monopolizing the advertising market at the same time. In reality, the largest player \u2014 Google \u2014 has less than a third of the market. The second largest \u2014 Facebook \u2014 has less than a quarter of the market. And Amazon is nipping at their heels.    Critics of Big Tech often try to define arbitrarily narrow markets to show a market share in excess of two thirds. That\u2019s why you\u2019ll hear that Google has \u201c 89-93 %\u201d of the US digital search advertising market or a large share of the \u201cUS digital display advertising market\u201d or the \u201cUS digital video advertising market.\u201d What these critics fail to show is why these should be distinct antitrust product markets. Advertisers maximize return on investment. If prices increase in one advertising channel, they likely substitute that spending to other channels. If anything, the simultaneous rise of digital advertising and fall of print advertising \u2014 while other advertising channels have remained flat \u2014 suggests that \u201cUS digital advertising\u201d might be too narrow of a market. It seems that advertisers are substituting digital advertising for print advertising. A good rule of thumb in antitrust is that the more adjectives someone tries to use to define a market, the less likely it has any relation to economic reality.    It\u2019s also important to remember that in digital markets users often multi-home, meaning they use multiple services in the same market. For example, the average person has nine social media accounts. Take a look at your phone. How many messaging apps do you have? How many social media apps do you have? What about email? Does one company really have a monopoly on how you communicate with your friends, family, and coworkers? Does one company have a monopoly on the entertainment you consume? The answer for most people is no.   Myth #2: \u201cBig Tech harms consumers\u201d   Next, let\u2019s look at consumer harm. According to DOJ guidelines , an antitrust enforcer must show that a company has used its monopoly power to \u201c harm society by making output lower, prices higher, and innovation less than would be the case in a competitive market.\u201d But prices in digital markets have been falling (or at zero) for years.    The price of digital advertising has fallen more than 40% in the last decade (while the price of print advertising has increased 5% over the same period).  The price of books has fallen more than 40% since 1997, the year Amazon went public .  Social media and messaging apps are priced at zero.    Apple\u2019s 30% App Store \u201ctax\u201d is actually the going rate for platform commissions (and once you account for the revenue generated by free apps, effective app store commission rates are in the range of 4-7% ).       While the prices for these services are low or even zero, consumers value them a great deal. Research has shown that, on average, consumers value search engines at $17,530 per year, email at $8,414 per year, digital maps at $3,648 per year, and social media at $322 per year. Again, the price to access these services is typically zero.   Myth #3 \u201cBig Tech doesn\u2019t innovate\u201d   But what about innovation? It\u2019s a hard thing to measure directly. One proxy variable we can look at is spending on research and development (R&amp;D). A complacent incumbent harvesting monopoly rents tends not to invest much in the future. By contrast, in a competitive marketplace, even the dominant firms are nervous they will be unseated by nascent or potential competitors. To prevent that from happening, they invest in the next generation of technology that will benefit consumers.       Another metric that\u2019s worth looking at is capital expenditures. The line of reasoning here is similar: a monopolist secure in its market position would rather distribute profits to shareholders than make risky investments. Here again, the tech companies lead the country in spending in this category, according to the Investment Heroes report by Michael Mandel and Elliott Long at PPI.      Myth #4: \u201cNetwork effects make Big Tech unbeatable\u201d   Critics claim that digital markets are different because they have network effects. Network effects are when a service becomes more valuable to each individual user as more users join the network. Telephones are a classic example. A telephone is only valuable insofar as there are other people who also own telephones. A similar dynamic exists for many tech platforms. There are also \u201cindirect\u201d network effects, where one group of customers cares about how many people are in another, distinct group of customers.    For example, operating systems such as iOS and Android need to cater to two different groups \u2014 smartphone users and app developers. Smartphone users want to use operating systems that have a lot of apps. App developers want to develop apps for operating systems that have a lot of users. It\u2019s a virtuous cycle. And if there are high switching costs for users or if there are large platform-specific investments that developers need to make, then the equilibrium number of competitors in the market might be only one or two firms.       There are three important facts about network effects to keep in mind. First, network effects are nothing new. As shown in the chart above, many legacy markets have network effects, including fax machines, newspapers, television, shopping malls, and even nightclubs. Second, while network effects can be a source of market power, they can also create large consumer benefits. Breaking up incumbent networks would also destroy these benefits along with dispersing market power, as users lose the positive spillovers from having everyone on the same platform. Lastly, network effects also work in reverse. If a large network begins to lose users, it can quickly unravel as the service becomes less valuable to the remaining users.   Myth #5: \u201cBig Tech is killing the startup ecosystem\u201d      Some Big Tech critics believe the companies create a \u201ckill zone\u201d around their businesses. The hypothesis is that the Big Five are so dominant in their respective markets, no venture capitalists will fund startups to compete with them. Over time, as the tech giants grow and branch out into new markets, we should expect the startup ecosystem to shrivel up and die. This theory is contradicted by numerous prominent examples, including Shopify competing successfully with Amazon and TikTok with Facebook.    The data on the overall venture capital investment tells a different story. The number of venture capital deals in 2019 reached an all time high of 32,776. The total dollar value of those deals was just slightly off the all time high set in 2018. It seems more likely that startups will die from suffocating on cash than thirsting for liquidity (every Sotbank unicorn investment comes to mind).    And while there is some evidence that venture capitalists are slightly less likely to invest in startups directly competing in a core market for tech giants, this story from Will Rinehart about Google\u2019s founding shows that competition from startups often starts in one narrow market and expands from there:    Google faced a similar environment when it was trying to get off the ground in the late 1990s. Ram Shriram, one of the earliest investors in Google, recently recalled that \u201cI went up and down Sand Hill and could not get a single VC to get a check at the time. The reason? They said search was taken.\u201d Michael Moritz, another early investor in Google, confirmed Shriram\u2019s sentiment and continued by explaining that, \u201cCompanies start off with a very narrow focus, and they do one small thing very well, and then they become the best at it, and then they gradually expand.\u201d    As startups get bigger and search for new opportunities for growth, they might increasingly cast their eyes on the cash flows currently enjoyed by Big Tech.   Myth #6: \u201cBig Tech companies only compete in one market\u201d      An underrated source of competition for the tech giants is each other. While each of the Big Five has its core area of strength, they are constantly making incursions on each other\u2019s territory and jockeying for position. As the table shows, for every product or service, there are at least two Big Tech companies offering a competing service (and in many markets it\u2019s four companies). The latest example of this: Google lowered its commission fees to zero on products sold via the \u2018Buy on Google\u2019 checkout option and started allowing retailers to use third-party payment and order management services like Shopify. All in the pursuit of challenging Amazon in e-commerce.   Myth #7: \u201cData is a significant barrier to entry to competing with Big Tech\u201d    People like to say that \u201cdata is a barrier to entry.\u201d But the barrier is much smaller than many think. When data is used as an input for an algorithm, it shows rapidly diminishing returns , as the charts collected in a presentation by Google\u2019s Hal Varian demonstrate. The initial training data is hugely valuable for increasing an algorithm\u2019s accuracy. But as you increase the dataset by a fixed amount each time, the improvements steadily decline (because new data is only helpful insofar as it\u2019s differentiated from the existing dataset).     As the chart above shows, using a real world case of a machine learning algorithm in production at Netflix, adding more than 2 million training examples had very little to no effect. That means the key differentiator is often the quality of the model, not the quantity of data used to train it. And how do you engineer a better model? By hiring top-level machine learning scientists. In the end, the binding constraint is still the humans.     As I\u2019ve written previously, data is not \u201cthe new oil.\u201d Data is not like a commodity. It is more akin to a public good \u2014 non-rivalrous and non-excludable. For example, if you tell someone your birthday \u2014 a discrete piece of personal data \u2014 you can\u2019t exclude them from sharing it with other people. And by telling them you have not diminished some finite supply of \u201cbirthday tellings.\u201d That piece of information can be shared over and over. And since data is a quasi-public good, that means it is likely underprovided by the market. Private companies can\u2019t capture the full benefits of investing in collecting, processing, and using data. If anything, policymakers should be concerned with how they can promote the safe sharing of more data rather than less (by making it more excludable).   Myth #8: \u201cStock market concentration is at an all-time high due to Big Tech\u201d    The New York Times and the Financial Times have published articles recently sounding the alarm about the rising concentration in public markets, as measured by the share of the S&amp;P 500 accounted for by the five largest companies in the index (currently Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Google, and Facebook). The takeaway from these pieces is that concentration is at an all-time high and that it\u2019s unsustainable. But the charts that accompany these articles always seem to start around 1980. What happens if you extend them back further to get more historical context?       As you can see, concentration in the 1960s and 1970s was much higher than it is today. It was normal for the top 5 largest companies to account for more than 20% of the S&amp;P 500, and they even exceeded 30% around 1965. The current level of concentration is not a historical outlier.   Myth #9: \u201cThe American public hates Big Tech (\u2018techlash\u2019)\u201d   In survey after survey, Americans say they approve of the tech companies, trust them more than companies in other industries, and don\u2019t think politicians should prioritize regulating them more. According to a survey from The Verge, 91% of Americans have a favorable view of Amazon; 90% have a favorable view of Google. According to a poll by the National Research Group, 9 in 10 Americans have a better appreciation for tech during the pandemic. As shown in the chart below, when Georgetown University surveyed Americans on which institutions they had the most confidence in, Amazon and Google ranked second and third respectively, only behind the military. The institution Americans have the least confidence in? Congress.   Myth #10: \u201cIt was obvious that some approved Big Tech acquisitions were anticompetitive\u201d   Some critics have claimed that Big Tech engages in \u201ckiller acquisitions\u201d and anticompetitive mergers intended to acquire and maintain a monopoly position in the market. This NYT article points out that Google has made 270 acquisitions and Facebook has made 92 acquisitions. The large numbers are supposed to be taken as prima facie evidence of a competition problem. But many of these acquisitions are really just \u201c acqui-hires ,\u201d or when one company purchases another for its engineering talent rather than its proprietary technology. As Ben Thompson points out , these exits act as a safety net that encourages entrepreneurs to be more risky in their ventures: \u201c[I[t might have been easier to simply apply for a job at Google or Facebook, but being handed one because you worked for a failed startup reduces the risk of going to work for that startup in the first place.\u201d    Acquisitions are also an essential part of a healthy startup ecosystem. Startups generally have two methods for achieving liquidity for their shareholders: IPOs or acquisitions. According to the latest data from Orrick and Crunchbase, between 2010 and 2018 there were 21,844 acquisitions of tech startups for a total deal value of $1.193 trillion. By comparison, according to data compiled by Jay R. Ritter, a professor at the University of Florida, there were 331 tech IPOs for a total market capitalization of $649.6 billion over the same period. Those liquidity events reward investors and employees for taking risks and incentivize the next round of startup financing.    But the main problem with labeling past acquisitions \u201canticompetitive\u201d \u2014 even if they were reviewed by antitrust authorities and explicitly approved at the time \u2014  is hindsight bias. Because Instagram now has more than a billion users and is arguably a more valuable asset to Facebook than its legacy social network, critics are implicitly claiming that Instagram would have experienced the same success as an independent company. In other words, its success was a foregone conclusion.    Nothing could further from the truth. A cursory review of the historical record makes it clear how much doubt there was at the time about the wisdom of acquiring a photo-filtering app for $1 billion. Instagram had just 30 million users and zero revenue. The company had raised money at a $500 million valuation the day before Zuckerberg made the $1 billion offer. On late night TV, Jon Stewart joked about the acquisition: \u201cA billion dollars of money? For a thing that kind of ruins your pictures? The only Instagram worth a billion dollars would be an app that instantly gets you a gram.\u201d    A CNET article by Molly Wood titled \u201cFacebook buys Instagram\u2026but for what?\u201d had this conclusion:    I still feel like there are more questions than answers to why this price tag makes sense. I hope Facebook isn\u2019t getting distracted by hipster buzz or the photo-sharing bubble, especially at a time when its business decisions need to be as sound as possible to shore up future investor confidence. Don\u2019t spend those billions before you\u2019ve got them, guys.    The same is true for other Big Tech acquisitions. When it comes to a prospective merger, the tech companies are damned if they do, damned if they don\u2019t. If it fails, people call it a \u201c killer acquisition .\u201d If it succeeds, people say the company took out a future competitor.   Conclusion   One of the biggest misnomers in the antitrust discourse is that people presume all monopolies are illegal. According to the FTC ,    [I]t is not illegal for a company to have a monopoly, to charge \u201chigh prices,\u201d or to try to achieve a monopoly position by what might be viewed by some as particularly aggressive methods. The law is violated only if the company tries to maintain or acquire a monopoly through unreasonable methods. For the courts, a key factor in determining what is unreasonable is whether the practice has a legitimate business justification.    Of course, based on the evidence presented earlier, it is far from clear that the tech companies have even a legal monopoly in any antitrust product market, let alone an illegal monopoly acquired via exclusionary conduct. But it is self-evidently true that the Big Five have been wildly successful and have become dominant in their respective core areas. Upon reviewing the totality of the evidence, the more likely explanation for their size is that they\u2019ve created some of the best products in the market and are more efficient at delivering what consumers want than their competitors.    Given the facts of the market, why would Congress choose to hold a hearing about Big Tech and antitrust at a time like this? Antitrust regulators have been serving as effective watchdogs of actual anti-competitive conduct and should continue to do so in the future. There may be room for behavioral remedies in tech that strike a better balance without blowing up our most valuable and innovative companies. But, of course, that requires more focus on the boring procedural work of careful antitrust analysis \u2014 and that doesn\u2019t make good TV.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42714237528</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G7-1161-F07F-80K6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3264\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Progressive Policy</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 29, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Entering 2020, the five most valuable companies traded on U.S. exchanges were all tech stocks. As 2020 has progressed -- despite the extreme volatility and the specter of antitrust regulation -- Silicon Valley has not only become more dominant but has gone down as the standout sector in the first half of the year. Through July 7, the S&amp;P 500 was down about 2% year to date, and U.S. News' 10 best tech <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/best-stocks-to-buy-this-year\">stocks to buy for 2020</url> were up more than 11% as a portfolio. Here's a look at how each pick is faring.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Microsoft Corp. (ticker: MSFT)</emphasis></p><p>Parlaying competitive advantages it established in the 1990s, 2020 has been a great year for Microsoft. \"We've seen two years' worth of digital transformation in two months,\" CEO Satya Nadella said in its last earnings report. It's still one of the best tech stocks to buy for 2020, and the company has invested its cash brilliantly: It got into tablets with the Surface, video games with Xbox and social networks with its LinkedIn acquisition. The Windows upgrade cycle allows for guaranteed recurring revenue, as does the brilliant decision to make Microsoft Office a cloud-based subscription product. Azure, its cloud computing division that is second only to Amazon.com's (<url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/amzn-amazoncom-inc\">AMZN</url>) AWS by market share, highlights MSFT's <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/best-growth-stocks-to-buy\">growth</url> prospects, with revenue soaring 59% last quarter. Microsoft Teams, its workplace collaboration software, is seeing rapid adoption as well. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Year-to-date return:</emphasis> +32%</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dell Technologies (DELL)</emphasis></p><p>Another 1990s business that helped PCs go mainstream is Dell, which, after evolving and diversifying, is attractive enough to be one of the best tech stocks to buy for 2020. Dell isn't just a computer company anymore, with tentacles in the data center, storage, servers and the cloud -- a diversified portfolio of modestly growing business units. Its commercial PC business picked up steam last fiscal year, driving operating income growth of 60% in the client solutions group. Most importantly, Dell acquired a roughly 80% stake in VMWare (<url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/vmw-vmware-inc\">VMW</url>) in 2018, a stake currently valued around $50 billion (it was just $22 billion months ago). Dell's current market cap is actually about $10 billion lower than its VMWare stake. Now that Dell is officially \"exploring strategic alternatives\" for VMWare, the stock, which traded as low as $25 in March, is more than $50 per share. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">YTD return:</emphasis> +3%</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Adobe (ADBE)</emphasis></p><p>For a second consecutive year, application <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/top-software-stocks-to-buy\">software giant</url>Adobe makes the cut as one of U.S. News' best tech stocks to buy. ADBE stock gained 46% in 2019, but there's still long-term upside in Adobe, the company behind the suite of iconic creativity apps that includes Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator, Acrobat and Premiere, to name a few. Simply put, this is a must-have software for many industries and professionals, and Adobe's cloud-based software-as-a-service model helps bring high-margin recurring revenue -- an investor's dream. ADBE is still growing sales by about 15% to 20% a year, and it has been one of the top-performing tech stocks on this list so far, up about 36% in the first half of the year. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">YTD return:</emphasis> +36%</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AT&amp;T (T)</emphasis></p><p>Communications and media giant AT&amp;T also has an entrenched business, but it isn't growing like an Adobe or Microsoft. Across the U.S., AT&amp;T boasts more than 100 million U.S. customers paying for TV, mobile or broadband services. After acquiring WarnerMedia, the company became an entertainment empire; it's the parent company of Hollywood studio Warner Bros., DC Comics, HBO, CNN, TBS, TNT and many more. Trading around nine times forward earnings, AT&amp;T pays a sustainable 6.9% <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/dividend-stocks-aristocrats\">dividend</url>. Ironically, AT&amp;T should normally bring relative stability to the list of the best tech stocks to buy for 2020, but it has been one of the bleaker performers year to date. It expects about $28 billion of free cash flow in 2020.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">YTD return:</emphasis> -22.2%</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook (FB)</emphasis></p><p>As one of several tech names on U.S. News' list of best stocks to buy for 2020, Facebook is automatically one of the best tech stocks to buy for 2020 as well. FB trades for just 24 times forward earnings -- not bad for a company expected to grow profits by 35% next year. Although Facebook boasts more than 2.6 billion monthly active users, it's still growing that figure by about 8% annually. Around 2.9 billion people use either Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram or Messenger at least once a month. Even if a Democrat is elected in 2020 and pushes for the breakup of Facebook, investors might still benefit as Wall Street would be better suited to fully value each business segment.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">YTD return:</emphasis> +17.3%</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STMicroelectronics (STM)</emphasis></p><p>You'll be forgiven if you haven't heard of STMicroelectronics, a $25 billion Swiss semiconductor company. But for investors currently digging around for the best tech stocks to buy, STM is a contender. Its chips help power some interesting end markets, including the automotive sector, where STM chips will help the accelerating adoption of electric vehicles. STM also makes wireless charging, touch and display products for smartphones, as well as data center power solutions needed for the transition to <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/best-stocks-to-buy-for-the-5g-revolution\">5G</url>. Trading for a lowly price-earnings-growth (PEG) ratio of 0.5, analysts expect earnings per share to grow 49% annually for the next five years, making its P/E of 24 look like a steal. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">YTD return:</emphasis> +1.3%</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alibaba Group Holding (BABA)</emphasis></p><p>If you're in the habit of seeking out the top tech stocks to buy, odds are you'd like one or two of them to provide some impressive growth. Alibaba, despite already pulling down more than $70 billion annually in revenue, still qualifies as an out-and-out growth stock as the closest analogue to Amazon in China. Unlike Amazon, whose cash cow is its cloud computing division despite being dwarfed in size by its retail division, Alibaba's profit center is its core electronic retailing division, using those earnings to fund other business endeavors, which now include a booming cloud computing business of its own as well as a thriving entertainment division. Alibaba has 846 million mobile MAUs on its China retail marketplaces alone. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">YTD return:</emphasis> +11.5%</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">IAC/Interactive Corp. (IAC)</emphasis></p><p>IAC is a roughly $10 billion media and internet company that operates almost like a publicly traded incubator. Media legend, former CEO and current IAC Chairman Barry Diller has created enormous wealth for shareholders, guiding the stock from $2 a share in 1995 to $250 at the dawn of 2020. The company's nominal share price has been adjusted this year following the recent spinoff of online dating giant Match Group (<url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/mtch-match-group-inc\">MTCH</url>), in which IAC had an 80% stake. The spin has been great for shareholders, unlocking value and giving previous owners one additional IAC share and 2.1584 shares of MTCH. Previous spinoffs include Expedia (<url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/expe-expedia-group-inc\">EXPE</url>), LendingTree (<url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/tree-lendingtree-inc\">TREE</url>) and Live Nation (<url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/lyv-live-nation-entertainment-inc\">LYV</url>). It currently owns stakes in ANGI Homeservices (<url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/angi-angies-list-inc\">ANGI</url>), as well as fast-growing media companies Vimeo and Dotdash. IAC is the top-performing stock on this list.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">YTD return:</emphasis> +73%</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">58.com (WUBA)</emphasis></p><p>While it doesn't get the ink of a company like Alibaba, Chinese online classified company 58.com also made the cut as one of the best tech stocks to buy for 2020. Sometimes colloquially called \"China's Craigslist,\" WUBA is expected to grow sales by about 20% in 2021 as China's rising middle class continues to boost demand for jobs, goods, real estate and other services. Although clearly the Chinese economy's 2020 hopes have been altered by the pandemic, WUBA actually recently agreed to be taken private for $8.7 billion, making it unlikely WUBA stock will move much going forward unless lawsuits establish shareholders deserve a higher price.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">YTD return:</emphasis> -16.5%</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Rubicon Project/Magnite (RUBI, MGNI)</emphasis></p><p>Last and by far least by market cap is the roughly $800 million Rubicon Project, a volatile yet promising stock in the digital advertising space. The company's software largely focuses on automating the selling of online advertising en masse, over both mobile applications and the wider web. The company recently merged with a company called Telaria and now boasts \"the largest independent omnichannel sell-side platform in the world,\" according to its press release. Now trading under the name Magnite and adopting the ticker MGNI, analysts see 15% top-line growth in 2020 and 33% revenue growth in 2021 as the company starts to turn profitable.

Looking forward, what kind of Net companies look good to you?\u00a0</p><p>Harris: Last year, one of the themes was the Internet, and another theme was wireless. Qualcomm (QCOM:Nasdaq) was our largest holding. We had the luxury of having to keep trimming it back because it got to be such a big percentage just through performance. I think it was up around 650%. It was the best performing large-cap Nasdaq stock.\u00a0</p><p>We were early in recognizing the new dynamics within Qualcomm: management restructuring; laying off handset division; infrastructure division; concentrating on their semis and their patents on CD-made technology.\u00a0</p><p>The thing that we really look at is early recognition of unrealized growth, and I think at the beginning of '99 the out-year earnings per share estimate was at $1. After they divested and mainstreamed their products, their earnings per share went to over $3.\u00a0</p><p>Now, let's fast forward. Continuing to focus on the bottleneck is the theme. What that means is there's so much traffic being generated -- there's six billion email messages sent a day, Internet traffic around the world is doubling every four to five months. All these major carriers are trying to make their networks more data-specific as opposed to voice. You're talking about mobile-wireless connectivity, pagers, Palm Pilots, Internet access on your cell -- the networks aren't built for that, you know?\u00a0</p><p>So, we're looking for those companies that are solving that problem with the bottleneck. The two that are my largest holdings and that I think are great examples of what we're looking for are Extreme Networks(EXTR:Nasdaq) and Juniper Networks(JNPR:Nasdaq).\u00a0</p><p>Another one -- to answer the Internet one -- is Art Technology Group(RTG:NYSE).\u00a0</p><p>2. McDonald: Can you give a thumbnail of what these companies do and why they are in the sweet spot?\u00a0</p><p>Harris: Extreme makes a layer III switch. They're taking a market share -- they've got this Black Diamond Switch, which is really quickly being accepted in the enterprise. They are starting to pick up some service providers like PSI or Qwest or Level III, but they're competing and doing a pretty good job of warding off Cisco's(CSCO:Nasdaq) domination in the enterprise. So, that's been a big one.\u00a0</p><p>Juniper is a little bit more outside the network. They're a router, and they are selling directly to the service providers. They have about 22% market share in the core routing business, and I think we're going to see that accelerate.\u00a0</p><p>In the buildouts the industry is so dynamic, and in technology it's so fierce and competitive. These guys continue to have new products. Juniper has the M5N10, which are basically boxes with their Juno operating system in it. Very high profitable margin business, so I think we're going to continue to see some good business momentum there.\u00a0</p><p>Art Technology helps personalize your Web site to make it a functional, wholly integrated suite. They are one of the few that has written a full software platform using Java.\u00a0</p><p>They've got over 400 clients -- (they're) growing like a weed. Their new software platform -- it's called the Dynamo -- is picking up; I think it's taking customers from a company like Broadvision(BRVN:Nasdaq).\u00a0</p><p>3. McDonald: And part of that model, when we talk about folks that are in consultative roles -- a big part of that -- is once you get your foot in the door and solve one problem, you might have a better chance at growing with the business as they encounter other hurdles, right?\u00a0</p><p>Harris: Exactly. And that's explains our investments in other companies -- Commerce One(CMRC:Nasdaq), i2 Technologies(ITWO:Nasdaq), Manugistics(MANU:Nasdaq).\u00a0</p><p>4. McDonald: Coming into fourth quarter, we're looking at some dicey issues: a weak euro and some earnings warnings from some of the bigger bellwether tech outfits. A lot of people are saying this is going to be tough this quarter in terms of knowing where put money and feeling confident. Apart from what you've already mentioned, where do you see opportunities in a somewhat challenging environment?\u00a0</p><p>Harris: I think that's a great question, because there's been a lot of noise in, like you said, the bellwethers -- Intel(INTC:Nasdaq), Apple(AAPL:Nasdaq), SCI(SCI:NYSE), which makes boxes for Hewlett-Packard preannounced. The thing that I focus on is the dynamic nature of IT spending.\u00a0</p><p>Where is the spending going on the service level -- the AT&amp;Ts of the world, the Qwests to the enterprise -- that's your company, my company. Where are our IT managers spending money, what are the patterns and what are the solutions that are being sought after?\u00a0</p><p>There's been a lot of noise on the big telecommunications spending. Sanford Bernstein brokerage made the comment that there's kind of a disconnect between the large telco and the service provider. They're talking about a 10% capex (capital expenditure) increase next year, while the telecom equipment guys are talking about 30% demand from their customers, so there's a disconnect at 10% vs. 30%.\u00a0</p><p>I think that you have to focus on where in the enterprise are the needs. Obviously, I think optical is going to continue to be a very strong focus for companies.\u00a0</p><p>The thing about optical I think a lot of people don't understand is how much more efficient you become. With these heavy networks that we have in the ground, it's cheaper to build out an optical network now. Your return on investment is so much quicker, so I think that's going to continue to be a play.\u00a0</p><p>Another sector we haven't talked about is oil services -- oil and gas services -- where I have about 18% of the millennium growth fund.\u00a0</p><p>The thesis is: We haven't seen this type of structural imbalance between supply and demand. And that's both on the oil level as well as the gas level. Obviously, everyone knows oil has gone up about $30, but gas inventories are as low as they've been in years, and demand is picking up as we're becoming so much more industrialized.\u00a0</p><p>So, I'm focusing on R&amp;B Falcon(FLC:NYSE), Pride International(PDE:NYSE). These guys are solving the challenging industry dynamics, such as the Juniper and the Extremes in their areas. These guys are providing services such as rigs, drillers, and platforms that are being sold to the Chevrons, the Exxons and Shells of the world.\u00a0</p><p>Again, it's companies that are coming up with solutions.\u00a0</p><p>That's why it's so important to kind of understand the vision of management. I think one of the things we do very well is that we stick true to our philosophy of holding management accountable. Can they execute? We believe in the cockroach theory; if they miss one quarter, there's probably more bad news coming.\u00a0</p><p>I still think there's a lot of spending going on we're going to see in mid-October through November for the major energy companies. I think you're going to see some healthy pickup in activity there.\u00a0</p><p>5. McDonald: On the flip side, where are the traps in the fourth quarter?\u00a0</p><p>Harris: I think you're going to probably see some of the Internet content names are going to start to trade a little bit like retail. Again, back to the whole visibility -- are these guys making money, do they have sustainable business models? Also, Internet advertising is a little bit dangerous.\u00a0</p><p>McDonald: Clearly, Yahoo!(YHOO:Nasdaq) told us that.\u00a0</p><p>Harris: And if Yahoo! is telling you that, then advertising's in trouble. They're the king. They've been the metric in terms of CPMs, which stands for click per thousand impressions. It's an advertising model, so if you're Nike, you're going to charge them $22 for 1000 impressions to be guaranteed.\u00a0</p><p>They were the only ones where, because they had so much scale, their CPM was sustainable at that level. I think you're going to start to see that pricing coming under pressure. And if they're having problems, I think a lot of Internet advertising companies are going to have problems.\u00a0</p><p>McDonald: So, we're talking about the DoubleClicks(DCLK:Nasdaq) and the like?\u00a0</p><p>Harris: Yeah, those second- and third-tier guys don't have the scale and maybe the brand of Yahoo!. Beyond that, I don't know about other sectors that are a \"must miss.\" Right now, what's going on with PC sell through \u2026 people are talking about Windows 2000. I think Windows 2000's rollout and the acceptance has been sluggish and disappointing. It has not sparked the hardware upgrade that people were talking about. I think we're going to need to watch commodity memory, DRAM pricing as an indicator for what's going on.\u00a0</p><p>McDonald: There is that line between old tech and new tech; PCs are pretty mature.\u00a0</p><p>Harris: Yeah, you still hear 15% to 18% PC growth. That's not what it has been historically, but there is still growth. You talk about Handspring(HAND:Nasdaq). These guys are having some good quarters. I find it very difficult to monitor consumer spending habits, but there is definitely a trend going on where people want to get online -- maybe the PC isn't the only way to do it any more?\u00a0</p><p>So, PCs marks a percent of market share of people getting online. It's more competitive \u2026\u00a0</p><p>McDonald: Every dollar that goes to a Palm is a dollar not going to a PC.\u00a0</p><p>Harris: Exactly.\u00a0</p><p>6. McDonald: This is a good segue, actually. What's your take on the bellwether, maturing tech stocks? For example, let's look at Microsoft(MSFT:Nasdaq), Cisco and Intel. A lot of folks own those stocks. They've made an awful lot of money on them in recent years, but there are some tough questions going forward.\u00a0</p><p>Harris: Well, Microsoft and Intel -- let's talk about them, because I think they're somewhat related. I think you have to see Windows operating systems -- Windows 2000 operating system -- really being digested. That is going to drive PC demand, and that is going to drive Intel. So, those two are somewhat tied.\u00a0</p><p>I still think they're phenomenal companies. One thing about Intel is that it is so PC-oriented that you're going to need to see the company make some moves outside of that -- be it in wireless or in other types of semiconductors. Maybe they need to look more like Broadcom(BRCM:Nasdaq) -- more diversified outside of being a pure PC name. So, those are things to monitor; where is management taking Intel?\u00a0</p><p>The other thing with Intel -- the Athlon Processor, which is AMD's(AMD:NYSE) higher-end microprocessor that's actually picked up some good share. The competition from AMD has surprised some people.\u00a0</p><p>Microsoft has regulatory issues going on. It's a distraction for management and it's keeps a cloud overhanging Microsoft.\u00a0</p><p>I like Cisco. I like Cisco a lot. There have been concerns about the quarter. I think that these guys have great visibility. You look in their backlog, I think their quarter is done, I think they're probably 3/4 of the way done for fourth quarter -- deferred revenues are up. I think these guys are winning 70% of all network buildouts. They've got some new products coming out, a LAN switch called the Constellation -- I won't get into that too much, but I think Cisco is the networking company to own.\u00a0</p><p>I don't think it's a Cisco wins, everybody else loses, or other people win, Cisco loses. I think Cisco's going to continue to grow. There are companies like Juniper and Extreme that are also growing and picking up market share. I think Cisco's got a very broad product portfolio. It's doing great.\u00a0</p><p>I also own Nortel Networks(NT:NYSE). I think Nortel is doing great. Actually there was news about them winning some business from Cable &amp; Wireless in Europe.\u00a0</p><p>I own Alteon Websystems(ATON:Nasdaq). They're a hardware/software switching company. So, as data comes into your server, it can prioritize (it): Is Ian a first-time browser on Amazon.com's(AMZN:Nasdaq) site, or has Ian been on Amazon.com 10 different times and bought about 10 different books, so (he's) going to get priority packaging. That's why I own Alteon.\u00a0</p><p>7. McDonald: One sector we haven't discussed is health care. Do you have interest there?\u00a0</p><p>Harris: I have interest there. I do own a little bit of health care. I own Allergen(AGN:NYSE). They're about a $10 billion market-cap company that's been a really strong performer.\u00a0</p><p>I haven't had a lot of focus here for a couple of reasons. I think that there's more regulatory issues going on there than technology. It's about 5% of the fund right now. That's very likely to change as we kind of broaden the prospectus parameters. It could be higher. Let me put it this way: It's a place that I'm focusing on.\u00a0</p><p> I'm doing research, talking to analysts, talking to companies; it's really kind of a wait-and-see in terms of certain sectors.\u00a0</p><p>8. McDonald: What do you see in the wireless area? Obviously, Qualcomm had that stunning year last year, and things can't keep going up, but what do you see as a wireless plays?\u00a0</p><p>Harris: I think Qualcomm's a great example of what we're doing. It's capturing change early in its effect on numbers. I would make the argument that this year, I think Qualcomm is gone from (around) $150 to $65 to $70. It's down probably 70%, whatever that percentage is. I'd make the argument that Qualcomm is a better company this year than it was last year.\u00a0</p><p>Let me say, I don't own Qualcomm. And let me give you kind of the macro of what I think about wireless.\u00a0</p><p>Nokia(NOK:NYSE ADR), Ericsson(ERICY:Nasdaq ADR), Motorola(MOT:NYSE) -- all of the major wireless handset companies have guided down numbers.\u00a0</p><p>We have seen in the last two years ingenious pricing plans to get consumer and corporate penetration up on the wireless. That's not new, you've heard about that; wireless penetration is picking up, you hear all the stories about how the Netherlands and Finland are 100% penetrated.\u00a0</p><p>There was a lot of expectation at the beginning of the year for the continuing second acceleration of wireless demands, and that hasn't come through. And I think some of the reason is because people are saying you have a six-month life cycle on your handset. Well, when was the last time you bought a handset?\u00a0</p><p>There are a lot of problems right now with wireless access in the U.S. Again, the networks aren't built out for it. So, why go out and spend $500 on a cell phone when you're not sure you're going to really get the functionality of the PC? Now, don't get me wrong -- I think that's something we're going to see, but it's been a little bit slower than people had hoped for.\u00a0</p><p>So, you've got that, you've got the major wireless guys and infrastructure guys moderating expectations. And the other thing, too, is that China's a big wild card. China is so massive, with so many people. But there's a lot of regulatory problems with trying to introduce new technology in China.\u00a0</p><p>So, that's my thesis. I actually don't own anything wireless right now. I own the Nortels and the Ciscos, which help provide some of the infrastructure, but I don't own Ericsson; I don't own Nokia; I don't own Motorola.\u00a0</p><p>9. McDonald: If you had to buy three stocks and hold them for five years, what would they be?\u00a0</p><p>Harris: I buy stocks for the reasons I talked about: management's ability to execute and to differentiate between a good company and a good stock. Ultimately, are we going to see the realized growth from these companies? So, I don't put a time horizon in terms of days, weeks, years.\u00a0</p><p>Extreme, Juniper -- I think they're going to continue to be leading this technology revolution. That said, this is an aggressive growth fund, where this year the turnover's going to be probably 300% to 350%. But keep in mind, there are some names in there: Extreme and Juniper that are going to be core holdings of mine, and I might trade around the position a little bit if there's good news; (if there's) bad news I might trim or I might add to the names, but those are core holdings.\u00a0</p><p>McDonald: Part of the turnover is probably driven by inheriting someone else's portfolio, right?\u00a0</p><p>Harris: Exactly. That was my next point.\u00a0</p><p>One company I haven't mentioned is a semiconductor company that makes silicon and puts their software on chips. It goes into DSL, and they're selling to Lucent and some of the DSL providers. It's a company called Globespan(GSPN:Nasdaq). It's a little bit of a smaller cap (than) Extreme (or) Juniper. Actually, one I haven't mentioned -- if you put a gun to my head and say five years from now -- it'd probably be Flextronics(FLEX:Nasdaq).\u00a0</p><p>They're a contract manufacturer. So, they are outsourcing the hardware components of the product for Motorola, Cisco, Ericsson. If Cisco has a new product, they go to Flextronics and use their manufacturing capabilities, and they'll put Cisco's label on it and sell it. This company, five years ago, was the number 24 or 25 contract manufacturer in the world. They've done such a great job with people's products that now they're the number 3.\u00a0</p><p>They've really been executing. They've made some acquisitions, but they're really focusing on outsourcing for networking and telecommunication equipment. That represents over half of their business. Motorola just recently signed a $30 billion deal over the next five years with Flex. This is interesting: I heard that the relationship between Cisco and Flex is so strong that every three days Flex produces a new Cisco product.\u00a0</p><p>They've got about 150 or 200 products that Cisco has done with Flextronics. So, they continue to execute, visibility's great there. The trending for this type of outsourcing is going to continue, because the Motorolas, Ericssons, Ciscos don't want to be in manufacturing. They want to be in the technology business where they're focusing just on the core technology and outsourcing the actual manufacturing. So, that trend is going to continue.\u00a0</p><p>10. McDonald: Lastly, what's the most recent new name added to the fund, and also to your personal portfolio?\u00a0</p><p>Harris: Personally, I buy my fund. For the fund, I've been adding to my oil service names: Global Marine(GLM:NYSE).</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSC-#1115695#</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSC2000</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:41D1-WY30-00MP-T2XK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">220623</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3122\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>TheStreet.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19301\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><copyright>Copyright 2000 TheStreet.com, Inc.</copyright><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"10\" year=\"2000\"><dateText>October 9, 2000 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>JUNIPER NETWORKS INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>\u00a0QUALCOMM INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>JNPR (NYSE)\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>\u00a0QCOM (NASDAQ)\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS334210 TELEPHONE APPARATUS MANUFACTURING\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>\u00a0NAICS334118 COMPUTER TERMINAL &amp;

In that time, he's trounced his peers and shown an uncanny knack for digging up unloved stocks before the market loves them again.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Unlike strict or pure value investors, tech stocks aren't off his menu and given the beating many big tech outfits have taken lately, now is a good time to pick his brain. Unlike a lot of pros, he likes Lucent Technologies(LU:NYSE) and he's also bullish on telecommunications behemoth Verizon Communciations(VZ:NYSE). And he's not too cool to admit he missed the boat on health care this year -- how refreshing.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0(Chart Omitted)\u00a0</p><p>1. The definition of value investing varies greatly. How do you define it?\u00a0</p><p> Tim Quinlisk: We have a fairly simple philosophy as it relates to value investing. It centers around the idea that buying cheap companies isn't a strategy that we deploy.\u00a0</p><p>What we try to do ultimately is find great companies when they go on sale. So we're really focused on looking at undervaluation in companies, but, most importantly, we really want to own the great businesses when they go on sale.\u00a0</p><p>What we would focus on are typical valuation metrics such as price to cash flow multiples, a company's ability to generate high returns on invested capital and its ability to generate substantial free cash flow.\u00a0</p><p>So, it's a little different, vs. your traditional or deep value manager in the sense that we really want to own only companies that have the ability to grow and create value, fundamentally, over a longer period of time.\u00a0</p><p>One, it's got to be undervalued, but there are other components. Two, it's got to be a good business; and three, it's going to have to have a catalyst that's going to get other people excited about what we have identified. Our investment process looks at both valuation and fundamental momentum in the business. So we're trying to pick up catalysts several ways.\u00a0</p><p>One type of catalyst is exceeding expectations, which I call fundamental momentum. We also look at catalysts that are very specific, either on a micro or a macro level. It could be a new management team, a new product cycle or a change in industry regulation. Those items that will help other people, or help us better time the inflection point of when that value is recognized.\u00a0</p><p>2. Within these parameters, would you name a few sectors that look promising, and perhaps a few stocks specifically?\u00a0</p><p> Tim Quinlisk: Two areas that we're really focused on heavily are the telecom services area, and also some business services companies.\u00a0</p><p>The market has been almost indiscriminate in the telecom services area, in terms of taking down the valuations of the group. As value managers, we've found some pretty good opportunities within that space.\u00a0</p><p>In the large-cap area in the telecom services, we like Verizon Communications, one of the leading regional Bell telephone companies, but also extremely well-positioned on the wireless side, selling at a very attractive cash flow multiple.\u00a0</p><p>We're also looking selectively in other areas -- names like Centurytel(CTL:NYSE).\u00a0</p><p>On the business services side, there's a couple of stocks that I really like a lot. One would be Waste Management(WMI:NYSE), which does waste collection. Clearly undervalued, a catalyst in place is the fact that the new management team has been in place for roughly a year plus, is executing on its plan, and is delivering, fundamentally, earnings that are exceeding expectations.\u00a0</p><p>We think there's a significant amount of operating leverage as they continue to improve internally, some of the operations there.\u00a0</p><p>3. Value investors always warn investors, don't get caught up in value traps -- stocks that look cheap that are touted as undervalued but that might not be the case. What are one or two sectors that look like value traps to you?\u00a0</p><p> Tim Quinlisk: We have really stayed away from the retail area. We've been extremely and very much underweighted that group all year long. In fact, even the exposure that we have there involves stocks that we think are less sensitive to decelerating consumer spending trends.\u00a0</p><p>So we've really stayed away from the retail area -- given the macroeconomic environment that's out there, those could be conceived to be value traps. So we stay away from retail, some of the other consumer-cyclical-type areas -- homebuilders, the auto parts guys, or even the big autos, for example, or the airlines. We've just really stayed away from those businesses. They're classic value traps.\u00a0</p><p>The valuation case is based on earnings that you know are most likely going to decline pretty dramatically in an economic environment that decelerates. Even more than that, we really believe you've got to buy businesses that create economic value, and for some of these businesses you can't make that argument. A lot of them you can't.\u00a0</p><p>4. One thing that folks will find interesting is that you're a value manager, and you have a significant part of the portfolio allocated to technology. Where are you finding value in the tech sector?\u00a0</p><p> Tim Quinlisk: We think technology is an area that value managers cannot afford to overlook. In our assessment, it has been and will continue to be the capital-goods driver of this -- and the next -- economic cycle. I don't think many people would dispute that.\u00a0</p><p>The orientation that we take in technology is valued-based, hence, a big position in Lucent Technologies. Lucent, at these levels, is trading at roughly 23 times next year's earnings, so roughly a discount to the market.\u00a0</p><p>Lucent is in an industry where you've got very solid, secular growth, probably north of 20%, as the telecom infrastructure is built out. There are some management execution issues but we believe they'll get resolved. Lucent's probably trading on most metrics from a valuation perspective at a third vs. Nortel(NT:NYSE), which is in the same business, which is executed.\u00a0</p><p>Other stock would be in the software area, where there's been a lot of carnage in technology, stocks like Parametric Technologies(PMTC:Nasdaq).\u00a0</p><p>Parametric is a CAD company, mechanical CAD company, it's extremely well-positioned, particularly as they launch a new, Web commerce-enabled product called Windchill. We believe that Windchill has a value that's worth more than the overall enterprise value of the company, and we're basically getting for free a mature mechanical CAD business. Expectations have been set low and we think the company is in position to now finally start to exceed earnings expectations.\u00a0</p><p>5. Would you ever consider looking at some of the companies that have been hit hardest in the Internet area, or is that an area where you just don't see value?\u00a0</p><p>Tim Quinlisk: We'll look anywhere. But first and foremost, the business model has to work. So, what we try not to do is confuse significant price deterioration or price declines with value.\u00a0</p><p>A 50% move down in the price doesn't necessarily mean value. We will look selectively at some of these stocks, but we want to make sure that we can make a value we can build, that the model makes sense fundamentally, and we know we're going to get paid from the business model.\u00a0</p><p>6. You've got a significant weighting to financials. We've seen a lot of consolidation recently in that area, and that's a story that folks have been talking about for a long time. What do you see in financials?\u00a0</p><p>Tim Quinlisk: I still think financials are attractive, we're still overweight in financials. We've been pretty selective with regard to our positions there. We've been underweighted in the banks and overweighted either in specialty finance and/or specialty insurance. We like stocks like Ace Limited(ACL:NYSE), Ambac Financial(ABK:NYSE), Associates First(AFS:NYSE), Freddie Mac(FRE:NYSE), Fannie Mae(FNM:NYSE), Citigroup(C:NYSE) and Progressive(PGR:NYSE).\u00a0</p><p>We think it's more difficult now in financials than it was, say nine months ago, or a year ago. You have to be selective, given the economic environment that we're in, given those companies that are exposed on the credit side. We're certainly watching that. We don't have a lot of exposure there, and so we're really looking for financials that have decent growth prospects, the ability to grow and are still undervalued.\u00a0</p><p>7. Your portfolio, at the end of August, had a modest weighting to health care stocks. It's been a good year for health care. What kept you out of there? What do you see going forward?\u00a0</p><p> Tim Quinlisk: Can I say stupidity? I missed it. Just, frankly, flat out missed it.\u00a0</p><p> As a value manager, really the only space that was attractive was big pharma. And it was attractive for roughly a quarter or two last year, and we just didn't pull the trigger on it. I'll miss things from time to time, and I missed the big pharma move. I missed the health-services move, but fundamentally, again, that doesn't sit with my orientation toward great businesses.\u00a0</p><p>These are tough businesses -- the HMOs, the hospitals. There are a lot of cost pressures on them.\u00a0</p><p>With big pharma, at this stage of the game, I'm looking for the political uncertainty and hopefully all the rhetoric that's going on will give me an opportunity here to reload a little bit.\u00a0</p><p>There are some stocks in the group like the Abbott Labs(ABT:NYSE) of the world, and others that are kind of a little bit more product/pharma that have reasonable valuations selling at modest premiums to the market. I'm sensitive to health care/pharma valuations in that I don't want to pay too high multiples for growth rates that have decelerated off their mid-'90s kind of growth rates because of the generic exposure that we've got out there.\u00a0</p><p>We probably wouldn't have had this discussion if we didn't have the carnage in technology because there would have been no migration to health care, but I missed it.\u00a0</p><p>8. What are two or three companies that have the strongest stories you've come across in the small-cap area?\u00a0</p><p> Tim Quinlisk: There are two companies that I really like. One is called Hain Celestial Group(HAIN:Nasdaq). It's a consumer-product company; they are a leader in the natural-foods product line.\u00a0</p><p>Historically, they sold their product line through the natural, or whole foods, supermarket chains and are migrating that toward major food store chains. They're just very well-positioned, very solid top line growth, one of the few companies in this space that is actually seeing double-digit kind of revenue due to volume growth.\u00a0</p><p> It's a very strategic asset. They did an acquisition, they're integrating, on the cost side there's cross-selling opportunities, just a very solid story.\u00a0</p><p>And the other one that I would highlight is ACNielsen(ART:NYSE).\u00a0</p><p>This is a duopoly business in the U.S., where it's clearly the leading share. It's a great business, 65%-plus of recurring revenue, not very capital intensive, good return metrics, earnings have been under pressure here recently on a core basis, because they're spending on Internet and restructuring initiatives in Europe. The company is selling at roughly seven times cash flow, and I think, based on private market transactions for a sister company, which is Nielsen Media Research, it's worth probably double what it's currently trading.\u00a0</p><p>9. If you had to pick three stocks to hold for five years, what would they be and why?\u00a0</p><p> Tim Quinlisk: It's a great question. I didn't tell you what my top three holdings were, there's no doubt about it. Or they wouldn't be my top three. Ace Limited, Tyco International(TYC:NYSE) and Lucent Technologies.\u00a0</p><p>Tyco is probably one of the better-managed companies that I follow. It's a multi-industry company with a solid history of creating value for shareholders, primarily through a combination of internal growth plus very strategic acquisition capabilities -- not only the ability to acquire but then the ability to integrate acquisitions into the fold to create additional value for shareholders. It's just a premier company.\u00a0</p><p>10. What are the most recent stocks added to the funds you manage, and what's the most recent addition to your personal portfolio?\u00a0</p><p>Tim Quinlisk: My own. I don't really invest on my own, because I buy the fund. I've got all of mine in the 401(k), my small-cap value fund.\u00a0</p><p>For my funds, I've added a few, actually. The two names that I've added most recently to the large-cap fund have been Gillette(G:NYSE) and Albertson's(ABS:NYSE). And the most recent addition to the small-cap fund would be Valassis Communications(VCI:NYSE).</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSC-#1105172#</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSC2000</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:41BB-0RG0-00MP-T214-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">220623</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2099\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>TheStreet.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19301\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><copyright>Copyright 2000 TheStreet.com, Inc.</copyright><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"10\" year=\"2000\"><dateText>October 2, 2000 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"70\"><className>ALCATEL-LUCENT SA\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>\u00a0VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"70\"><className>ALU (PAR)\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><className>\u00a0ALU (NYSE)\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><className>\u00a0ALU (BIT)\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>\u00a0VZC (LSE)\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>\u00a0VZ (NYSE)\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"70\"><className>NAICS334220 RADIO &amp;

SOURCE: Future500[1]DESCRIPTION: SAN FRANCISCO, March 15, 2018 /3BL Media/ \u2014 A revealing new report shows the future of sustainability is now in the hands of worldwide brands, their consumers, and the NGOs holding them accountable. Global stakeholder engagement nonprofit Future 500 explores the evolving risks + opportunities of corporate stewardship in its latest report, Top 10 Stakeholder Engagement Trends of 2018. The report identifies 10 key drivers shaping modern business\u2014including fleet electrification, marine plastic pollution, environmental justice, and predictions for the looming clash between regulators and Big Tech. </p><p>Each trend comes with suggested actions for corporations to respond to threats and position themselves as industry leaders. 'At the core of our mission is to cultivate the future leaders of sustainable business,' said Future 500 CEO Bill Shireman. '2018 is particularly interesting for us. It's a make-or-break year for corporate stewardship. Brands can be assured that their stakeholders will hold them to account on any and all commitments to leadership.' This is the seventh report in Future 500's annual Stakeholder Engagement Trends series. Each year, the nonprofit compiles a broad set of industry data along with firsthand feedback from its network of CEOs, activist leaders, investment experts and major funders. With a unique birds-eye industry view, the team ties together environmental, economic, and social trends to make keen predictions for the coming year and beyond. In 2017, Future 500 saw growing global unity around ocean pollution, just transition and freshwater conservation, while greater engagement on the local and state level empowered social justice groups and vocal brand advocacy. Many of these predictions proved accurate as leaders emerged to fill the political stewardship vacuum\u2014held accountable by increasingly sophisticated stakeholder campaigns. This year's report continues along this trajectory to its real-world outcomes, exploring advancements in renewable energy, data technology and campaign tactics in an evolving stakeholder landscape. Shireman expressed optimism for a global community moving forward on COP21 and Sustainable Development Goals. 'If we can take something away from our political gridlock, it's that there is much more to unite us than divide on sustainability issues.' 'The challenge, and the key measure for success in the coming year, is how we convert this knowledge into lasting, real-world impact.' The report's top insights include:Corporations modernize with all-electric fleets\u2014implications for sustainable business, as well as the impact on utilities + traditional fuel producers NGOs and advocacy groups are forming an unlikely alliance with major investors like Blackrock, becoming the new corporate regulators Environmental justice goes mainstream, putting stricter micro-level demands on corporate sustainability. Global standards from COP21 and the UN's Sustainable Development Goals are internalized on state, local and corporate levels\u2014now, these groups must measure real-world operations against these goals.The report is available to download on the Future 500 web page[2].Tweet me: Contact Info: Matt Stites Future 500 +1 (503) 974-6426 <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:mstites@future500.org[3]\">mstites@future500.org[3]</email>;

Many feel without Net Neutrality, the internet will be taken over by greedy corporations. Celebrities like John Oliver have convinced the masses that Net Neutrality is a great thing, but he couldn't be more wrong. The future of the internet is incredibly serious, and Net Neutrality will change it for the worst. </p><p>Here are 10 reasons why Net Neutrality is destructive and unnecessary.1. The Internet Was Open and Free Before Net NeutralityContrary to popular opinion, Net Neutrality has only been around for two years. That means the internet was growing and prospering for the first 25+ years of its existence with little government interference. If you enjoyed using the internet before 2015, when Net Neutrality was passed, then you have no problem with the unregulated internet.2. Fast Lanes and Slow Lanes Are FairNet Neutrality seeks to prevent internet service providers (ISPs) from charging companies higher prices for more bandwidth. Companies that don't pay more will get less bandwidth. If this sounds familiar, it's because this is similar to the way the internet works for the rest of us. We are given a set of data packages based on speeds; the higher the speed, the higher the cost. There is nothing nefarious about this. It's just business. If a website owner can't afford to pay for a package with more bandwidth, they are given the option of a cheaper package with less bandwidth. This tiered system makes sure that even small businesses can afford access to the internet. Traffic from popular websites takes up a lot of space on network lines. Why should a large, wealthy company taking up all this space be allowed to pay a similar price to a smaller company that takes up less space?3. Not All Websites Are Created EqualNet Neutrality intends to prevent ISPs from 'discriminating' against certain companies for any reason, providing a level playing field. This idea defies the basic economic principle of supply and demand. Why should companies that provide better products at better prices have that competitive advantage taken away? Consumers want faster access to Netflix and Hulu over smaller streaming services because they are better. Discrimination is not inherently a bad thing. We discriminate all the time. We discriminate against Long John Silver's when we eat at Red Lobster because we think it has better quality food. We discriminate against Bing when we use Google because we believe it provides better search results.4. Competition Amongst ISPs Is Not a ProblemNet Neutrality advocates often state that there is little competition among internet service providers, but the numbers say otherwise. An FCC report[1] in 2008 showed that 94.6% of zip codes had 4 or more internet service providers available to them. On top of existing competition, the advancement of wireless services, such as 4G and WiMax, will provide consumers with even more options to choose from.5. Increased Prices for ConsumersNet neutrality seeks to classify internet service providers as Common Carrier entities, under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934. This classification 'opens the door to billions of dollars in new taxes[2].' FCC officials in support of net neutrality say they are deferring the option to impose taxesfor now. They still maintain the option to levy a tax on ISPs in the future which will lead to higher prices for consumers. Another factor leading to increased prices is the price limitations net neutrality imposes on ISPs. Economist Gary Becker said[3] these price controls are 'expected to result in higher prices to broadband subscribers.'6. Growth in Internet Speeds Will Slow DownBecause Net Neutrality is essentially a price control, investment in internet infrastructure will slow down. This is so because ISPs will be limited in setting prices at a point that will allow them to earn enough to cover investments. Companies with large profit margins, such as Verizon and Comcast, can afford to continue to invest in infrastructure and just take the hit. More realistically, they will simply raise prices for consumers to assure that they will get a sufficient return on investment. Smaller ISPs with smaller profit margins will just have to suffer. They will more likely halt infrastructure investment in order to not raise prices. But Net Neutrality will ultimately result in less competition when small ISPs have to close down from unaffordable regulations.7. Politicians Are No Guardians of PrivacyProponents of net neutrality express fears of ISPs selling their browsing history to other corporations. Their solution appears to be to hand over the internet to politicians. Politicians, Democrat and Republican, are the biggest offenders of privacy. They are constantly seeking new ways and justifications to invade our privacy online. Former government contractor Edward Snowden revealed numerous documents of illegal NSA programs to monitor Americans on a massive scale. There is even increased talk in Washington of limiting encryption technology[4]. If privacy is truly a concern, making politicians the gatekeepers of the internet is not the solution.8. Governments Love CensorshipPoliticians have a long history of prohibition and censorship, and not just those in totalitarian governments[5], but representative ones as well. Once they get their hands on the internet, they won't be able to stop themselves from imposing more rules and regulations. If not through the FCC, they will find some way to ruin the internet just like they did TV[6] and radio.9. Tech Companies Want More FreebiesA lot of big tech companies have come out in support of Net Neutrality. Google, Netflix, and Amazon have all expressed 'vigorous support' for the FCC's internet restrictions.  These tech companies support Net Neutrality because it's cheaper for them. They will have to pay more money without Net Neutrality. With Net Neutrality, they can get more, reliable connections to their sites for the price of a much smaller website, essentially getting free extra bandwidth. Google, Amazon, and Facebook are simply looking out for their bottom line. It's worth noting that these companies all made their billions before Net Neutrality, when the internet was actually open and free. Now that they've amassed so much wealth, they appear to want politicians to come in and impose limitations on the internet. Not all tech companies are onboard though. Many companies critical to the growth of the internet, such as IBM, Intel, Cisco, and Juniper, have come out against Net Neutrality.10. Private Property MattersOne aspect that is always overlooked is that of private property. The internet is comprised of various networks. Comcast has their own network, and AT...as their own network. These networks are property of their respective companies. ISPs invest billions of dollars into their networks, and should receive full control of their property. Governments should not have the right to tell individuals or businesses what they can and cannot do with their own property.

Many feel without Net Neutrality, the internet will be taken over by greedy corporations. Celebrities like John Oliver have convinced the masses that Net Neutrality is a great thing, but he couldn't be more wrong. The future of the internet is incredibly serious, and Net Neutrality will change it for the worst. </p><p>Here are 10 reasons why Net Neutrality is destructive and unnecessary.1. The Internet Was Open and Free Before Net NeutralityContrary to popular opinion, Net Neutrality has only been around for two years. That means the internet was growing and prospering for the first 25+ years of its existence with little government interference. If you enjoyed using the internet before 2015, when Net Neutrality was passed, then you have no problem with the unregulated internet.2. Fast Lanes and Slow Lanes Are FairNet Neutrality seeks to prevent internet service providers (ISPs) from charging companies higher prices for more bandwidth. Companies that don't pay more will get less bandwidth. If this sounds familiar, it's because this is similar to the way the internet works for the rest of us. We are given a set of data packages based on speeds; the higher the speed, the higher the cost. There is nothing nefarious about this. It's just business. If a website owner can't afford to pay for a package with more bandwidth, they are given the option of a cheaper package with less bandwidth. This tiered system makes sure that even small businesses can afford access to the internet. Traffic from popular websites takes up a lot of space on network lines. Why should a large, wealthy company taking up all this space be allowed to pay a similar price to a smaller company that takes up less space?3. Not All Websites Are Created EqualNet Neutrality intends to prevent ISPs from 'discriminating' against certain companies for any reason, providing a level playing field. This idea defies the basic economic principle of supply and demand. Why should companies that provide better products at better prices have that competitive advantage taken away? Consumers want faster access to Netflix and Hulu over smaller streaming services because they are better. Discrimination is not inherently a bad thing. We discriminate all the time. We discriminate against Long John Silver's when we eat at Red Lobster because we think it has better quality food. We discriminate against Bing when we use Google because we believe it provides better search results.4. Competition Amongst ISPs Is Not a ProblemNet Neutrality advocates often state that there is little competition among internet service providers, but the numbers say otherwise. An FCC report[1] in 2008 showed that 94.6% of zip codes had 4 or more internet service providers available to them. On top of existing competition, the advancement of wireless services, such as 4G and WiMax, will provide consumers with even more options to choose from.5. Increased Prices for ConsumersNet neutrality seeks to classify internet service providers as Common Carrier entities, under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934. This classification 'opens the door to billions of dollars in new taxes[2].' FCC officials in support of net neutrality say they are deferring the option to impose taxesfor now. They still maintain the option to levy a tax on ISPs in the future which will lead to higher prices for consumers. Another factor leading to increased prices is the price limitations net neutrality imposes on ISPs. Economist Gary Becker said[3] these price controls are 'expected to result in higher prices to broadband subscribers.'6. Growth in Internet Speeds Will Slow DownBecause Net Neutrality is essentially a price control, investment in internet infrastructure will slow down. This is so because ISPs will be limited in setting prices at a point that will allow them to earn enough to cover investments. Companies with large profit margins, such as Verizon and Comcast, can afford to continue to invest in infrastructure and just take the hit. More realistically, they will simply raise prices for consumers to assure that they will get a sufficient return on investment. Smaller ISPs with smaller profit margins will just have to suffer. They will more likely halt infrastructure investment in order to not raise prices. But Net Neutrality will ultimately result in less competition when small ISPs have to close down from unaffordable regulations.7. Politicians Are No Guardians of PrivacyProponents of net neutrality express fears of ISPs selling their browsing history to other corporations. Their solution appears to be to hand over the internet to politicians. Politicians, Democrat and Republican, are the biggest offenders of privacy. They are constantly seeking new ways and justifications to invade our privacy online. Former government contractor Edward Snowden revealed numerous documents of illegal NSA programs to monitor Americans on a massive scale. There is even increased talk in Washington of limiting encryption technology[4]. If privacy is truly a concern, making politicians the gatekeepers of the internet is not the solution.8. Governments Love CensorshipPoliticians have a long history of prohibition and censorship, and not just those in totalitarian governments[5], but representative ones as well. Once they get their hands on the internet, they won't be able to stop themselves from imposing more rules and regulations. If not through the FCC, they will find some way to ruin the internet just like they did TV[6] and radio.9. Tech Companies Want More FreebiesA lot of big tech companies have come out in support of Net Neutrality. Google, Netflix, and Amazon have all expressed 'vigorous support' for the FCC's internet restrictions.  These tech companies support Net Neutrality because it's cheaper for them. They will have to pay more money without Net Neutrality. With Net Neutrality, they can get more, reliable connections to their sites for the price of a much smaller website, essentially getting free extra bandwidth. Google, Amazon, and Facebook are simply looking out for their bottom line. It's worth noting that these companies all made their billions before Net Neutrality, when the internet was actually open and free. Now that they've amassed so much wealth, they appear to want politicians to come in and impose limitations on the internet. Not all tech companies are onboard though. Many companies critical to the growth of the internet, such as IBM, Intel, Cisco, and Juniper, have come out against Net Neutrality.10. Private Property MattersOne aspect that is always overlooked is that of private property. The internet is comprised of various networks. Comcast has their own network, and ATT has their own network. These networks are property of their respective companies. ISPs invest billions of dollars into their networks, and should receive full control of their property. Governments should not have the right to tell individuals or businesses what they can and cannot do with their own property.

Robinhood investors are generally considered to be younger and more tech savvy than the typical investor, with an average age of about 31. However, they are also relatively inexperienced; Robinhood says half of its new users have never invested. Several top Robinhood stocks have been among the best performers in the market since the S&amp;P 500 bottomed in March. Here are the 10 stocks Robinhood investors bought most aggressively in the last month.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tesla (ticker: TSLA)</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Electric vehicles have been one of the hottest investing trends of 2020, and Robinhood users have been aggressively scooping up <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/articles/tesla-inc-tsla-stock\">Tesla stock</url>. Tesla reported a fourth consecutive profitable quarter in July, qualifying the stock for inclusion in the S&amp;P 500. After gaining about 30% in June, Tesla shares rallied about another 33% in July. Tesla's market cap now stands at nearly $267 billion, making it the most valuable auto company in the world. Despite the profit, revenue for Tesla was down 4.9% year over year last quarter. More than 210,000 Robinhood users added TSLA stock to their holdings in the last 30 days.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amazon.com (AMZN)</emphasis></p><p>It seems nothing can stop e-commerce and cloud computing giant <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/articles/pros-cons-to-buying-amazon-amzn-stock\">Amazon</url>. In fact, the company's blowout second-quarter earnings report in July highlights just how much the shelter-in-place environment is seemingly helping Amazon's business. Second-quarter revenue was up 40% over the same quarter last year, and Amazon guided for third-quarter revenue growth of at least 24%. Cloud revenue was up 29%, but grocery sales more than tripled from a year ago thanks to the current climate. While other retailers are struggling to survive, Amazon is gaining more retail market share each quarter. About 110,000 Robinhood users added AMZN stock to their holdings in the last month.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Apple (AAPL)</emphasis></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/articles/pros-and-cons-to-buying-apple-aapl-stock\">Apple</url> also reported a blowout second quarter despite the economic disruption. The technology company reported 11% revenue growth, including 14.8% growth from its services segment. Apple's iPhone sales were up just 1.6% from a year ago, but iPad sales rose 31%. Apple also announced a 4-for-1 stock split ahead of a 5G iPhone launch later this year. Shares are up about 20% in the last month and about 50% year to date, pushing the company's market cap to more than $1.8 trillion. More than 110,000 Robinhood users added AAPL stock to their holdings in the last 30 days.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Moderna (MRNA)</emphasis></p><p>Shares of <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/dividends/slideshows/best-pharmaceutical-stocks-to-buy-for-income\">biotech</url> company Moderna are up more than 280% so far in 2020 and about 28% in the last month thanks to optimism about the company's potential coronavirus vaccine. Moderna received $472 million in government funding in July on top of the $483 million it accepted in April to support development of its vaccine candidate. Investors recognize the potential upside for the first company to get a vaccine to market, and Moderna, Pfizer (<url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/pfe-pfizer-inc\">PFE)</url> and AstraZeneca (<url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/azn-astrazeneca-plc-adr\">AZN</url>) appear to be the top three contenders. About 100,000 Robinhood accounts added MRNA stock in the last month.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Pfizer (PFE)</emphasis></p><p>Robinhood users are hedging their <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/pharmaceutical-companies-racing-for-a-vaccine\">vaccine</url> bets by buying Pfizer as well. Pfizer announced the beginning of its late-stage human trials in late July for its vaccine candidate. Pfizer and partner BioNTech said the new study includes 30,000 participants, and the vaccine could be ready for final regulatory review as soon as October. Pfizer previously said it could have up to 100 million doses ready by the end of the year. Pfizer shares are up 11% in the last month, and about 90,000 Robinhood users have added the stock to their holdings in that time.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Eastman Kodak Co. (KODK)</emphasis></p><p>The year is 2020, and Kodak is one of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/high-risk-stocks-for-aggressive-investors\">hottest stocks</url> among the youngest generation of investors. After pivoting from cameras to blockchain technology in 2017, Kodak took another right turn in late July. The company announced it had secured a $765 million U.S. government loan to produce generic drug ingredients under the Defense Production Act. The announcement sent Kodak shares skyrocketing more than 1,780% in just four days, and Robinhood traders rushed to be part of the action. More than 90,000 Robinhood users added Kodak to their portfolios in the last 30 days.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nio (NIO)</emphasis></p><p>Nio is one of the most popular ways for investors to play the <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/top-auto-related-stocks-to-buy\">electric vehicle</url> trend in China. Nio has struggled with balance sheet issues in the past. However, the company announced in April a nearly $1 billion funding deal with a group of investors led by Hefei City Construction and Investment Holding Co. Nio reported a record 3,740 vehicle deliveries in June and surpassed 10,000 deliveries in a single quarter for the first time in the second quarter. More than 92,000 Robinhood users added Nio stock in the last 30 days.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)</emphasis></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/articles/pros-and-cons-to-buying-microsoft-msft-stock\">Microsoft</url> recently joined its big tech peers in reporting stellar earnings numbers for the second quarter. The technology company reported 13% revenue growth, including 47% growth in Microsoft Azure cloud sales. Office 365 commercial sales growth dropped below 20% for the first time last quarter, but the company's Xbox and gaming services revenue jumped 65% because of the shelter-in-place environment. Microsoft is releasing the next-generation Xbox X gaming console before the holiday shopping season. Microsoft shares are up about 35% in 2020. More than 78,000 Robinhood users added MSFT stock in the last month.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Netflix (NFLX)</emphasis></p><p>Unlike other popular large-cap tech stocks, Netflix had second-quarter numbers and guidance in July that disappointed the market. <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/articles/pros-and-cons-of-buying-netflix-inc-nflx-stock\">Netflix</url> guided for only 2.5 million net subscriber additions in the third quarter, less than half of the 5.2 million that analysts had been expecting. Netflix shares initially dropped 7% following the news, but they remain up more than 50% year to date. Robinhood users seem happy to buy the earnings dip in Netflix. About 76,000 Robinhood users bought the stock in the last 30 days. Netflix investors are seemingly ignoring the lackluster near-term guidance and focusing instead on the company's long-term growth opportunities.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Spartan Energy Acquisition Corp. (SPAQ)</emphasis></p><p>Tesla competitor Fisker is following the path that fuel cell vehicle maker Nikola Corp. (<url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/nkla-nikola-corporation\">NKLA</url>) took earlier this year and reverse-merging with publicly traded special acquisition company Spartan Energy. Such mergers are an alternative to <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/why-you-shouldnt-buy-an-ipo\">initial public offerings</url>, and the Spartan merger will provide Fisker with more than $1 billion in funding. Spartan shares jumped 29% the day the merger agreement was announced. Robinhood investors were eager to immediately get their hands on Spartan shares, even though the merger is not expected to close until at least September. More than 58,000 Robinhood users bought SPAQ stock in the last 30 days.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robinhood users are buying these stocks:</emphasis></p><p>-- Tesla (<url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/tsla-tesla-inc\">TSLA</url>)</p><p>-- Amazon.com (<url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/amzn-amazoncom-inc\">AMZN</url>)</p><p>-- Apple (<url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/aapl-apple-inc\">AAPL</url>)</p><p>-- Moderna (<url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/mrna-moderna-inc\">MRNA</url>)</p><p>-- Pfizer (<url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/pfe-pfizer-inc\">PFE</url>)</p><p>-- Eastman Kodak Co.

As the world becomes more connected, the companies that profit off that connectivity are thriving. Apple (ticker: <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/aapl-apple-inc\">AAPL</url>),       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/articles/pros-cons-to-buying-amazon-amzn-stock\">Amazon.com</url> (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/amzn-amazoncom-inc\">AMZN</url>), Microsoft Corp. (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/msft-microsoft-corp\">MSFT</url>) and Google (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/goog-alphabet-inc\">GOOG</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/googl-alphabet-inc\">GOOGL</url>) now all have market caps at or more than $1 trillion. Bank of America analyst Justin Post is anticipating another big year for tech in 2020, particularly for stocks within the internet group. Investors who identify the right themes to play could have another big year. Here are the top 10 internet stock themes Bank of America is watching in 2020.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Slowing economic growth.</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Bank of America sees a relatively low chance of a U.S. economic recession in 2020, but economic growth will likely continue to slow. Post says consumer activity in most developed markets remains relatively strong, but <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/portfolio-management/articles/how-to-recession-proof-your-investments\">recession</url> risks are rising. For investors looking to capitalize on tech sector growth while taking a more defensive approach in an uncertain global economy, stocks with high cash flows and strong balance sheets are likely the safest plays. In the event of an economic downturn, Post says Alphabet, Facebook (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/fb-facebook-inc\">FB</url>), Twitter (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/twtr-twitter-inc\">TWTR</url>), Booking Holdings (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/bkng-booking-holdings-inc\">BKNG</url>) and eBay (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/ebay-ebay-inc\">EBAY</url>) are relatively well-positioned.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Big events.</emphasis></p><p>The 2020 U.S. presidential elections and the 2020 Summer Olympics in Japan are large enough that they could be catalysts for certain <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/best-tech-stocks-to-buy-this-year\">tech stocks</url>. Post says both the election and the Olympics will likely boost advertising spend on most social media platforms, providing a tailwind for Facebook and Snap (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/snap-snap-inc\">SNAP</url>). Twitter recently announced a ban on political advertising, but Post says Twitter is best-positioned to benefit from Olympic ad spending. In addition, Twitter is President Donald Trump's preferred mode of communicating with supporters, and the election should boost user engagement even without direct political ad revenue.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Over-the-top streaming.</emphasis></p><p>Cord-cutting and over-the-top, or OTT, streaming video are certainly not new themes for investors, but Post says 2020 could be a \"banner year\" for OTT services. Netflix (<url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/nflx-netflix-inc\">NFLX</url>) and Amazon are expecting to aggressively ramp up content spending, while legacy media companies like Walt Disney Co. (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/dis-walt-disney-company\">DIS</url>) and Comcast Corp. (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/cmcsa-comcast-corp\">CMCSA</url>) heavily promote their new services. Post anticipates OTT viewership growth will accelerate in 2020, which will serve as a headwind for linear TV advertising and a tailwind for online video ad spend. Post says the shift to OTT video should benefit Netflix, Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook and Snap.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">E-commerce meets advertising.</emphasis></p><p>Online sales leaders like Amazon continue to invest in advertising, and Amazon's share of the U.S. digital ad market has grown from 2% in 2017 to 9% in 2019. At the same time, Post says Facebook and Google are testing new direct response ad formats and attempting to boost advertising conversion by adding more checkout functionality to their platforms. Post says these initiatives could improve advertising yields, boost advertising revenues and potentially make Facebook and Google more competitive in <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/funds/slideshows/smart-etfs-to-invest-in-the-e-commerce-revolution\">the e-commerce space</url>. Post says the integration of e-commerce and advertising is bullish for Alphabet, Facebook and even Pinterest (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/pins-pinterest-inc\">PINS</url>).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">5G networks.</emphasis></p><p>Post says 5G handsets will hit the ground running in 2020, opening the door for much higher-quality internet content. Higher bandwidth will pave the way for more HD video and augmented and virtual reality content. In addition, Post says 5G should grease the wheels of the internet of things and serve as a demand catalyst for cloud data services. Bandwidth will no longer limit these technologies. Initial speed tests on major 5G network providers suggest 5G networks will be 200% to 800% faster than 4G LTE networks. Post's top three global 5G stock picks are Alphabet, Snap and Amazon.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rise of the millennials.</emphasis></p><p>The world population is now 46% comprised of <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/portfolio-management/articles/how-millennials-can-invest-wisely-for-retirement\">millennials</url> and the younger Gen Z generation. Post says these young adults are \"digital natives,\" meaning they are the first generations to have grown up in a connected and device-driven world. In 2020, Post says millennials will account for a higher percentage of global income and consumption and will help drive the secular digital transformation of the global economy. He says companies geared toward millennials will benefit, while companies with older customer bases could struggle. His top millennial generation stock picks include Facebook, Snap, Amazon, Alphabet, Netflix and Uber Technologies (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/uber-uber-technologies-inc\">UBER</url>).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Initial public offerings.</emphasis></p><p>Unfortunately, 2019 saw its fair share of unicorn IPO flops, including Uber, Lyft (<url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/lyft-lyft-inc\">LYFT</url>) and WeWork. Post says the struggles of the 2019 class of tech IPOs is a signal that the market is shifting its preference away from growth and toward profitability. In that sense, 2020       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/the-smarter-mutual-fund-investor/articles/why-investors-should-look-beyond-the-ipo-hype\">IPO investors</url> should look for tech stocks that are managing expenses, and have shorter paths to positive cash flow and income. At the same time, the market could start to reward recent IPO stocks for demonstrating progress on profitability. Potential winners include Lyft, Pinterest, Uber, Chewy (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/chwy-chewy-inc\">CHWY</url>) and Peloton Interactive (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/pton-peloton-interactive-inc-ordinary-shares-class-a\">PTON</url>).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Airbnb disruption.</emphasis></p><p>Post has named Airbnb its disruptor of the year for 2020. He says Airbnb has already completely changed the nature of the travel business. Recently, the company has shifted its attention to vacation rentals, luxury, hotel and corporate bookings, and even trip experiences. The Airbnb IPO has been the subject of much speculation, and the company reportedly plans to go public sometime in 2020. Airbnb is valued at around $31 billion in the private market. Post says the potential winners from Airbnb's disruption are its distribution partners, while competitors like Expedia Group (<url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/expe-expedia-group-inc\">EXPE</url>) and Booking Holdings are potential losers.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Regulations.</emphasis></p><p>Regulatory concerns have been a dark cloud over an otherwise booming tech sector in recent years, and Post says regulatory scrutiny will likely intensify in 2020. Post says there are four primary concerns for tech investors. First, big tech revenue models could be called into question. Second, regulatory compliance could drive up operating costs. Third, companies could be subject to compliance penalties. And finally, some of the largest companies could be subject to antitrust legislation. Post says Facebook, Alphabet and Amazon are potentially vulnerable to antitrust regulation, while Twitter and Snap are also at risk of user data regulation.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Continuation of secular trends.</emphasis></p><p>Post is also watching three long-term trends that may not make a huge splash in 2020 but will continue to emerge as growth drivers. The first trend is artificial intelligence and machine learning, the second is delivery robotics and the third trend is self-driving cars. Artificial intelligence and machine learning will help to optimize the business world like never before, eliminating bloat, identifying opportunities and potentially dramatically reducing labor costs. Post says artificial intelligence winners include platform companies like Amazon and Alphabet. Autonomous vehicles could also completely transform the business models of rideshare companies Lyft and Uber.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tech investing themes for 2020:</emphasis></p><p>-- Slowing economic growth.</p><p>-- Big events.</p><p>-- Over-the-top streaming.</p><p>-- E-commerce meets advertising.</p><p>-- 5G networks.</p><p>-- Rise of the millennials.</p><p>-- Initial public offerings.</p><p>-- Airbnb disruption.</p><p>-- Regulations.</p><p>-- Continuation of secular trends.</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, (Getty Images)</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, (Getty Images)</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, (Getty Images)</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, (Getty Images)</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, (Getty Images)</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, (Getty Images)</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, (Getty Images)</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, (JOHANNES EISELE/AFP via Getty Images)</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, (LIONEL BONAVENTURE/AFP via Getty Images)</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call)</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, (Getty Images)</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, (Getty Images)</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USNCOM-200210investing.techtheme</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USNCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y62-G1B1-F02J-83TR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">297647</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1266\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 U.S. News &amp;

This is the tech news you need to know this Wednesday. Sign up here[1] to get this email in your inbox every morning. Facebook announced on Tuesday it had uncovered an operation on its site linked to Russian's Internet Research Agency, which interfered in the 2016 US election to help elect President Donald Trump[2]. The target audience of the operation, called Peace Data, was \"Democratic Socialists, environmentalists, and disgruntled Democrats,\" according to an analysis[3] by the social media experts at Graphika.Amazon contract drivers are hanging smartphones in trees outside Whole Foods stores and delivery stations to more quickly grab new online orders, according to a new Bloomberg report[4]. Amazon's system chooses drivers based on who is closest to the pickup location \u2014 meaning drivers with access to phones even slightly closer to the stores and delivery stations have a leg up on accepting orders before competing drivers.A fourth suspect is being investigated on suspicion of being involved in last month's massive Twitter hack that hijacked dozens of high-profile accounts[5]. According to The New York Times[6], federal authorities are looking into a 16-year-old in Massachusetts who sources claimed may have played a key, if not leading role in the hack, though he has not yet been charged.Amazon posted \u2014 and then deleted \u2014 a job listing for an 'intelligence analyst' to monitor workers' efforts to unionize[7]. The analyst's job duties would also include gathering information for use in Amazon's legal actions, including restraining orders against labor groups, according to the now-deleted listing.Facebook has threatened to block Australians from sharing news content on its platforms if the government's proposed media bargaining code goes ahead[8]. The code would set out standards for big tech platforms like Facebook to pay news publishers for displaying their content.Facebook is warning it can remove any content that might put it at regulatory or legal risk[9]. Facebook has started issuing a warning to users that from October 1 it will reserve the right to take down content if it thinks it necessary to \"avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts to Facebook.\"Five incredible charts show Zoom's meteoric rise in the past year \u2014 including a 355% revenue boost \u2014 as the pandemic has turned it into a household name[10]. Zoom is now halfway through its fiscal year, and its first two quarterly reports revealed what analysts described as \"historic\" growth, as it soared past analyst expectations.Samsung's new Galaxy Z Fold 2 will be available for preorder starting September 2, and will cost $2,000[11]. The company's second-generation flagship foldable smartphone features several upgrades over the previous version, including an improved screen and hinge system.Apple is said to be manufacturing about 75 million new iPhones in 2020, according to a new Bloomberg report \u2014 about the same amount the company made in previous years[12]. Apple is expected to launch four new models of the iPhone this year[13], all with 5G connectivity: the iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Max, iPhone 12 Pro, and iPhone 12 Pro Max.Netflix announced on Tuesday that it is developing a series based on the sci-fi \"Three-Body Problem\" book trilogy by the Chinese author Liu Cixin[14]. The former \"Game of Thrones\" showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss are writing and executive producing along with Alexander Woo, who recently executive produced AMC's \"The Terror: Infamy.\" </p><p>Have an Amazon Alexa device?

This is the tech news you need to know this Thursday. Instagram says it will require all new users to provide their birthdates, starting Wednesday.[1] In a blog post, the company said it wants to \"help keep young people safer and enable more age-appropriate experiences.\" It won't require users to verify the birthdates they provide, however. </p><p>Amazon cloud CEO Andy Jassy said the company feels strongly that Microsoft's $10 billion JEDI cloud win 'was not adjudicated fairly' because of political interference[2]. Jassy said that there was \"significant political interference,\" as President Donald Trump has a feud with Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. Current and former Googlers are furious that Larry Page and Sergey Brin stepped back instead of fixing the culture[3]. Several prominent Googlers have used Twitter to vent their frustration at Brin and Page's decision. Elon Musk opened up about his wealth during second day of testimony in 'pedo guy' defamation trial[4]. The Tesla CEO said he was worth around $20 billion but most of that isn't cash. Elizabeth Warren tweeted at Larry Page that Congress will still hold him accountable for Google, regardless of his job title[5]. The presidential candidate, who has made regulating big tech a key part of her campaign, said Page was still responsible for Google's practices. Microsoft is reportedly working on two new Xbox consoles for 2020, and one of them won't have a disc drive[6]. The company has already confirmed that the next Xbox, codenamed Project Scarlett, will launch during the 2020 holiday season. Leaked internal Peloton documents revealed how the fitness startup is trying to shed its 'cultish' image as it plots its post-IPO expansion[7]. Documents issued to ad agencies pitching for Peloton's business earlier this year show how it hopes to grow its customer base. Slack's CEO has dissed the hyper growth of Microsoft Teams, saying users of dead Microsoft products are being 'force migrated'[8]. Stewart Butterfield addressed the competition with Microsoft Teams in the company's latest earnings call. Tesla refused to help the police with an investigation into stolen copper wire after Elon Musk learned about the incident because the company was scared of bad press[9].
