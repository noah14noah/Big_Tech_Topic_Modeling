In October, he       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhQs5STtwUY\">received an award</url> for a donation to a marriage equality campaign.</p><p>Jennifer Cast, an Amazon executive who solicited the donation from him, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.amazon.com/p/feature/7e6gv5jjb92e4t3\">said at the event</url> that they could have donated anonymously to the campaign. \u201cBut just as critical as the money was Jeff\u2019s offer to let us publicly acknowledge their gifts,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cBy allowing us to take their donation public,\u201d she added, \u201cthe world quickly knew that Jeff Bezos supported marriage equality.\u201d</p><p>The appearances and actions are a new look for Mr. Bezos.</p><p>As he was shaping Amazon into one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies, Mr. Bezos developed a reputation as a brilliant but mysterious and coldblooded corporate titan. He preferred to hunker down in Amazon\u2019s hometown, Seattle, at least partly because he thought it was better for Amazon\u2019s growing business, largely avoiding public causes and the black-tie circuit.</p><p>But while Mr. Bezos \u2014 who at 54 is the world\u2019s richest person, with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/\">a net worth of more than $100 billion</url> \u2014 can afford virtually any luxury, obscurity is no longer among them.</p><p>Amazon, now a behemoth valued at more than $600 billion, has become one of the faces of \u201cbig tech,\u201d along with Apple, Alphabet\u2019s Google and Facebook. These companies are facing a backlash. Amazon is under the microscope for what critics say is its corrosive effect on jobs and competition, and Mr. Bezos has become a b\u00eate noire for President Trump, who repeatedly singles out him and Amazon for scorn on Twitter.</p><p>\u201cPeople are starting to get scared of Amazon,\u201d said Steve Case, a co-founder of America Online, who <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/04/business/dealbook/midwest-start-ups.html\">recently started</url> an investment fund focused on start-ups in underserved areas, with Mr. Bezos among its contributors. \u201cIf Jeff continues to hang out in Seattle, he\u2019s going to get a lot more incoming. Even for just defense reasons, he has to now play offense.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Bezos\u2019 portfolio of other ventures has thrust him farther into the spotlight. In October 2013, he bought The Washington Post for $250 million, jump-starting a renaissance of the paper. In 2016, Mr. Bezos bought a $23 million home in Washington, one of the city\u2019s most expensive, which is undergoing extensive renovations to make it a suitable party spot for the city\u2019s political class. Nearby neighbors include former President Barack Obama and his family, and Mr. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner.</p><p>Mr. Bezos\u2019 space start-up, Blue Origin, is also making its efforts more public, giving him another stage. The company is trying to rescue Earth by helping to move pollution-belching heavy industries off the planet.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s getting thanked at the Golden Globes and targeted by presidential tweet tantrums \u2014 not even Steve Jobs had that kind of pop-culture currency,\u201d said Margaret O\u2019Mara, a professor of history at the University of Washington, who curated a museum exhibit in Seattle endowed by Mr. Bezos.</p><p>In a statement, Drew Herdener, an Amazon spokesman, said, \u201cJeff loves what he is doing, at Amazon, Blue Origin and The Washington Post, and he enjoys sharing his enthusiasm in public as he works with the teams to build and invent.\u201d</p><p>But interviews with more than 30 people who know Mr. Bezos, most of whom declined to be identified to protect their relationships with him, revealed his awareness of the growing opposition to Amazon and his growing comfort with being in the public eye.<br/></p><p>Mr. Bezos, they said, accepts the probability of greater government scrutiny of Amazon. The chief executive has advised Amazon executives to conduct themselves so that they can pass any legal or regulatory test.</p><p>The investor Warren E. Buffett, who has known Mr. Bezos since the 1990s, said the cautionary tale of Microsoft, which faced a landmark antitrust case by the government that decade, must loom in Mr. Bezos\u2019 mind. Microsoft, by far the most dominant technology company at the time, lost its footing after the case, opening an unexpected opportunity for competitors.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to get a lot of scrutiny if you\u2019re disrupting other people\u2019s livelihoods,\u201d Mr. Buffett said.</p><p>Some of the people who know Mr. Bezos said his new public face was for business expediency. Others believe it is a result of personal growth.</p><p>But they all said it was clear that Mr. Bezos and Amazon were trying to go beyond his tech persona to show the world his other sides.</p><p>Hiding in Plain Sight</p><p>Mr. Bezos has always been happy to play the role of Amazon\u2019s chief pitchman, especially when he perceives some benefit to Amazon customers from doing so, people who have worked with him said. He submits to interviews and speaks at events when, for instance, a new company product like the Kindle electronic reader or Echo speaker needs to be explained to the world.</p><p>But for nearly two decades, he was adamant that the company should largely stay out of the political limelight and not make a stir in local communities. It also had a bare-bones lobbying operation.</p><p>Even as he was named Time magazine\u2019s person of the year in 1999, he tried to avoid politics. He was even reluctant to do photo opportunities with politicians, standard fare for executives, one longtime former employee said.</p><p>There were business benefits to staying out of the glare.</p><p>A hedge fund executive in New York who caught the internet bug early, Mr. Bezos piled into a vehicle with his wife in 1994 with the intention of finding a place to start a business selling books on the internet. He founded Amazon later that year in Seattle, in part because of the growing pool of technical talent Microsoft had brought to the area.</p><p>But putting his start-up in Washington also meant Amazon would not have to collect sales tax in the country\u2019s most populous states, like California, Texas and New York. Retailers typically have an obligation to collect sales tax in states where they have a physical presence.</p><p>For a time, for the same reason, the company would not publicly discuss where most of its warehouses were. And Amazon employees in Seattle who planned to travel out of state for work had to submit itineraries for review to avoid triggering unwanted sales tax liabilities.</p><p>Those efforts would, in turn, give his fledgling company a further price advantage against established physical retailers like Barnes &amp; Noble.</p><p>It also meant that, despite its growing legions of customers, Amazon remained almost invisible in politics.</p><p>By the end of 2012, the company had swelled to more than 88,000 employees and over $61 billion in annual sales, creating huge businesses like its Prime membership service and Amazon Web Services along the way. Yet that year the company was criticized by leaders in Seattle and the news media for being disengaged from civic life compared with stalwarts like Boeing and Starbucks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not aware of what Amazon does in the community,\u201d Sally Jewell, the chief executive of the retailer R.E.I. at the time, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/business/amazon-a-virtual-no-show-in-hometown-philanthropy/\">said in The Seattle Times</url> in 2012. \u201cIt\u2019s not a name that comes up often in the nonprofit organizations I\u2019m involved with.\u201d</p><p>With investors, Mr. Bezos gave just enough of a peek at Amazon\u2019s business to win their confidence while <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/amazon-and-the-perils-of-non-disclosure\">saying as little as possible</url> to keep competitors guessing. To this day, Amazon will not disclose exactly how many Kindles, Echoes and other devices it has sold, and for years it refused to reveal financial details about Amazon Web Services, its highly profitable cloud computing business.</p><p>Despite the paucity of details, investors have sent its stock up more than 1,100 percent over the last decade, dazzled by its growth.</p><p>A Growing Spotlight</p><p>A turning point came for Mr. Bezos around 2011 when Amazon faced a public showdown with state governments.</p><p>At the time, legislators began hounding internet retailers like Amazon to collect sales tax. In California, Amazon initially campaigned to overturn a new law imposing an internet sales tax. But Mr. Bezos backed off after it became clear that Amazon\u2019s image could be tarnished, a former employee involved in the matter said.</p><p>Instead, Amazon began to make peace. In 2011, it signed an agreement with California to collect sales tax in the state, reaching numerous similar agreements around the same time.</p><p>As part of those state deals, Amazon began building warehouses across the country, which allowed Amazon to deliver orders more quickly and let local politicians trumpet the arrival of thousands of jobs.</p><p>Suddenly, a company that once <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/02/17/cheap-words\">refused to confirm</url> how many employees it had at its Seattle headquarters       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176060&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1642267\">could not stop talking</url>about how many jobs it was creating. It now has 542,000 employees.</p><p>As Mr. Bezos and the company talked about creating jobs, though, he and Amazon faced a counternarrative from critics that the company was really a job-killing bully.</p><p>Waves of store closings by bricks-and-mortar retailers like Barnes &amp; Noble and Macy\u2019s increased the volume. \u201dAmazon Must Be Stopped,\u201d <url normalizedValue=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/119769/amazons-monopoly-must-be-broken-radical-plan-tech-giant\">read a 2014 New Republic article</url> about the company\u2019s growing market power.</p><p>That year, a nasty fight over e-book prices with Hachette, the book publisher, solidified Amazon\u2019s reputation for using brass-knuckle tactics. At one point, Amazon slowed delivery times for the publisher\u2019s titles and took other steps to make them less attractive to order.</p><p>After the matter was resolved, Mr. Bezos <url normalizedValue=\"https://youtu.be/Xx92bUw7WX8?t=25m15s\">told an interviewer</url> that Amazon was simply negotiating hard on behalf of its customers.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for incumbents who have a sweet thing to accept change,\u201d he said, referring to book publishers.</p><p>Another blow to the company\u2019s public standing landed in 2015 when The New York Times <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/technology/inside-amazon-wrestling-big-ideas-in-a-bruising-workplace.html?_r=0\">published a lengthy examination</url> of Amazon\u2019s corporate work culture, which was depicted as an unforgiving environment. \u201cThe article doesn\u2019t describe the Amazon I know or the caring Amazonians I work with every day,\u201d Mr. Bezos       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2015/full-memo-jeff-bezos-responds-to-cutting-nyt-expose-says-tolerance-for-lack-of-empathy-needs-to-be-zero/\">said in an email</url> to the company\u2019s employees after the article came out.</p><p>According to two people who work closely with Mr. Bezos, the chief executive became more focused on corporate reputation issues after The Times article and the Hachette uproar.</p><p>By late 2015, a few months after Mr. Trump announced his campaign for president, he started his Twitter broadsides against Mr. Bezos, which often coincided with critical coverage of the candidate in The Washington Post.</p><p>\u201cThe @washingtonpost loses money (a deduction) and gives owner @JeffBezos power to screw public on low taxation of @Amazon!\u201d he <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/673884271954776064\">tweeted</url> in December that year. \u201cBig tax shelter.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Bezos <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/JeffBezos/status/674008204838199297\">responded</url> by offering to launch the future president of the United States into space on a Blue Origin rocket.</p><p>A White House spokesman did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>The attention in Washington edged up in June when Amazon announced it was buying Whole Foods Markets. Though Amazon remains a niche player in the grocery business, the deal drove home the power of the company and led some lawmakers to question its power.</p><p>\u201cThe purchase of Whole Foods was a moment when people looked up and recognized this company as a force in the economy,\u201d said Stacy Mitchell, a co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a nonprofit advocacy group for local businesses, which has published <url normalizedValue=\"https://ilsr.org/amazon-stranglehold/\">a critical report</url> on Amazon\u2019s impact on jobs and communities.</p><p>Mr. Bezos Goes to the Other Washington</p><p>People who have known Mr. Bezos for a long time say they see a concerted effort by him and Amazon to show more of his personality.</p><p>He became an active user of Twitter in late 2015, posting a photo of himself <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/JeffBezos/status/716288257722482689\">wearing his lucky cowboy boots</url> and a video clip of him       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/JeffBezos/status/920999561564274688\">standing atop a wind turbine</url> in Texas. At an event with his brother in Los Angeles in November, as part of a long lineup of presentations by an array of business, wellness and entertainment leaders, he said his ideal job would be bartender, partly because he enjoys talking to people.</p><p>\u201cI pride myself on my craft cocktails,\u201d he said.</p><p>If there\u2019s an image that captures Mr. Bezos at the moment, it\u2019s a picture of him with his biceps bulging out of a polo shirt at a business conference in Idaho from July. <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2017/07/17/swole_jeff_bezos_is_exactly_the_meme_the_world_needed.html\">\u201cSwole Jeff Bezos\u201d</url> instantly became an internet meme, with one tweet juxtaposing shots of a doughy Mr. Bezos from the late 1990s (caption: \u201cI sell books\u201d) and the brawny 2017 version (\u201cI sell whatever I want\u201d).</p><p>The details people are willing to talk about include scraps about his daily routine. On most days, he leaves his lakefront estate in the affluent town of Medina, Wash., for a sparkling new 37-story office tower in Seattle, where he runs Amazon.</p><p>On Wednesdays, he heads south to an industrial office park in the suburb of Kent, where rockets are assembled for Blue Origin.</p><p>Every other week, he huddles on conference calls with The Post\u2019s leadership, and twice a year they visit him at his home. He communicates with the newspaper\u2019s top brass with an email list called the Pancakes Group. The Amazon chief once made members of the group flapjacks from a favorite recipe in \u201cJoy of Cooking\u201d on their first visit to his house.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like we went to some billionaire\u2019s house and the help outnumbered the guests,\u201d said Shailesh Prakash, the newspaper\u2019s chief information officer. \u201cHe was trying to get the dog off the couch.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Bezos\u2019 more public-facing work was abetted by a management change nearly two years ago at Amazon, when he put Jeff Wilke in charge of its consumer business and Andy Jassy in charge of cloud computing. That freed him up to devote more time to The Post and Blue Origin, though he remains deeply engaged at Amazon, dedicating most of his time to initiatives that are two to four years away from hitting the market.</p><p>Mr. Bezos has also pushed using publicity to the company\u2019s advantage. In September, he masterminded the company\u2019s splashy search for a place to locate a second headquarters. In the hoopla, Amazon highlighted the jobs it planned to create with the move \u2014 up to 50,000 total \u2014 and spurred a horde of towns, from Dallas to Boston, to apply.</p><p>In the future, that means Mr. Bezos will most likely be a more familiar presence in Washington. Mr. Bezos now visits Washington about 10 times a year, dropping in at The Post for forums, discussions with engineers and meals with journalists. In the capital\u2019s stately Kalorama neighborhood, just off Massachusetts Avenue\u2019s row of embassies, renovations are proceeding on his home \u2014 two combined properties that used to be the city\u2019s Textile Museum.</p><p>Mr. Bezos plans to host salon-style dinners at the house, drawing inspiration from the celebrated dinner parties thrown by Katharine Graham, the former publisher of The Post, for the city\u2019s movers and shakers from both parties. Mr. Bezos is known for asking his dinner guests to stick to a single conversation topic at a time to keep people from splintering off into private side discussions.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very big house,\u201d said Martin Baron, the executive editor of The Post. \u201cI hope he has a party for us in the house.\u201d</p><p>Sally Quinn, a longtime Post writer and an arbiter of the city\u2019s social mores, said she had no firsthand knowledge of Mr. Bezos\u2019 plans for his home. But she praised the idea of attempting to bring together guests from across the political spectrum.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s really no one who is doing that kind of thing in Washington right now,\u201d said Ms. Quinn, who bumped into Mr. Bezos recently at the screening of \u201cThe Post.\u201d \u201cIt would be like a throwback to the old days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think Jeff,\u201d she said, \u201cis the only person who could do that.\u201d</p><p>Follow Nick Wingfield and Nellie Bowles on Twitter: <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/nickwingfield\">@nickwingfield</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/NellieBowles\">@NellieBowles</url></p><p>Nick Wingfield reported from Seattle, and Nellie Bowles from San Francisco.

Following is a transcript of the video. D\u00f6pfner: But, your most prominent critic at the moment is the President of the United States. </p><p>People are even saying that he may be willing to prepare initiatives to break upAmazon,because it's too big, it's too successful, it's too dominant in too many sectors, or for varied other reasons, including the fact that he doesn't like the \"Post\". Is this break up scenario something that you take seriously, or do you think it's just a fantasy?Bezos: For me again, this is one of those things where I focus on and ask our teams to focus on what we can control, and I expect - whether it's the current US administration or any other government agency around the world - Amazon is now a large corporation and I expect us to be scrutinized. We should be scrutinized. I think all large institutions should be scrutinized and examined. It's reasonable. And one thing to note about is that we have gotten big in absolute terms only very recently. So we've always been growing very fast in percentage terms, but in 2010 just 8 years ago, we had 30,000 employees. So in the last 8yearswe've gone from 30,000 employees to 560,000 employees. You know in my mind I'm still delivering the packages to the post office myself. You see what I'm saying? I still have all the memories of hoping that one day we could afford a forklift. So obviously my intellectual brain knows that's just not the case anymore. We have 560,000 employees all over the world.And I know we should be scrutinized and I think it's true that big government institutions should be scrutinized, big non-profit institutions should be scrutinized, big universities should be scrutinized. It just makes sense. And that's, by the way, why the work at the \"Washington Post\" and all other great newspapers around the world do is so important. They are often the ones doing that initial scrutiny, even before the government agencies do.D\u00f6pfner: The general sentiment concerning the big innovative tech companies has changed. Facebook, Google, Amazon, Apple - they used to be seen as the nice guys in T-shirts that are saving the world. Now they are sometimes portrayed as the evil of the world. And the debate about the Big 4 or the Big 5 is heating up: Professors like Scott Galloway and \"The Economist\" are suggesting a split-up, other powerful people like George Soros are giving very critical speeches at Davos, and the EU Commission is taking pretty tough positions here. Do you think that there is a change in the mindset of society, and how should the big tech companies, how should Amazon deal with that?Bezos: I think it's a natural instinct, I think we humans, especially in the western world, and especially inside democracies are wired to be skeptical and mindful of large institutions of any kind. We're skeptical always of our government in the United States, state governmentsandlocal governments. Iassumeit's similar in Germany. It'shealthy,because they're big, powerful institutions - the police, the military, or whatever it is. It doesn't mean you don't trust them, or that they're bad or evil or anything like that. It's just that they have a lot of power and control, and so you want to inspect them. Maybe that's a better word. You kind of want to always be inspecting them. And if you look at the big tech companies, they have gotten large enough that they need and are going to be inspected. And by the way, it's not personal. I think you can go astray on this if you're the founder of a company - one of these big tech companies, or any other big institution. If you go astray on this, you might start to take it personally. Like \"Why are you someone inspecting me?\" And I wish that people would just say, \"Yes, it's fine\".

Amazon has seen major growth[4] in a short period of time \u2014 according to Bezos, the company went from 30,000 employees to 560,000 employees in eight years. Watch the video above to see what Bezos has to say about the possibility of breaking up Amazon and the importance of scrutinizing big institutions.  Following is a transcript of the video. </p><p>D\u00f6pfner: But, your most prominent critic at the moment is the President of the United States. People are even saying that he may be willing to prepare initiatives to break upAmazon,because it's too big, it's too successful, it's too dominant in too many sectors, or for varied other reasons, including the fact that he doesn't like the \"Post\". Is this break up scenario something that you take seriously, or do you think it's just a fantasy? Bezos: For me again, this is one of those things where I focus on and ask our teams to focus on what we can control, and I expect \u2014 whether it's the current US administration or any other government agency around the world \u2014 Amazon is now a large corporation and I expect us to be scrutinized. We should be scrutinized. I think all large institutions should be scrutinized and examined. It's reasonable. And one thing to note about is that we have gotten big in absolute terms only very recently. So we've always been growing very fast in percentage terms, but in 2010 just 8 years ago, we had 30,000 employees. So in the last 8yearswe've gone from 30,000 employees to 560,000 employees. You know in my mind I'm still delivering the packages to the post office myself. You see what I'm saying? I still have all the memories of hoping that one day we could afford a forklift. So obviously my intellectual brain knows that's just not the case anymore. We have 560,000 employees all over the world.And I know we should be scrutinized and I think it's true that big government institutions should be scrutinized, big non-profit institutions should be scrutinized, big universities should be scrutinized. It just makes sense. And that's, by the way, why the work at the \"Washington Post\" and all other great newspapers around the world do is so important. They are often the ones doing that initial scrutiny, even before the government agencies do. D\u00f6pfner: The general sentiment concerning the big innovative tech companies has changed. Facebook, Google, Amazon, Apple \u2014 they used to be seen as the nice guys in T-shirts that are saving the world. Now they are sometimes portrayed as the evil of the world. And the debate about the Big 4 or the Big 5 is heating up: Professors like Scott Galloway and \"The Economist\" are suggesting a split-up, other powerful people like George Soros are giving very critical speeches at Davos, and the EU Commission is taking pretty tough positions here. Do you think that there is a change in the mindset of society, and how should the big tech companies, how should Amazon deal with that? Bezos: I think it's a natural instinct, I think we humans, especially in the western world, and especially inside democracies are wired to be skeptical and mindful of large institutions of any kind. We're skeptical always of our government in the United States, state governmentsandlocal governments. Iassumeit's similar in Germany. It'shealthy,because they're big, powerful institutions \u2014 the police, the military, or whatever it is. It doesn't mean you don't trust them, or that they're bad or evil or anything like that. It's just that they have a lot of power and control, and so you want to inspect them. Maybe that's a better word. You kind of want to always be inspecting them. And if you look at the big tech companies, they have gotten large enough that they need and are going to be inspected. And by the way, it's not personal. I think you can go astray on this if you're the founder of a company \u2014 one of these big tech companies, or any other big institution. If you go astray on this, you might start to take it personally. Like \"Why are you someone inspecting me?\" And I wish that people would just say, \"Yes, it's fine\".

Speaking in Germany, Bezos said Amazon has a duty to educate regulators, but will work with whatever new constraints it is given \u2014 even if they damage its business model. The CEO warned, however, that regulation can stifle innovation. </p><p>Jeff Bezos has said that Amazon is ready for a debate about its enormous scale after coming under repeated attack from US President Donald Trump. Trump has called out Amazon in a number of tweets in recent months[1], questioning its impact on the US Postal Office, the amount of tax it pays, and the potential harm it is causing other retailers. Bezos said it is right that governments and the public want to investigate the power of huge tech companies \u2014 and he doesn't take the urge for regulation personally. \"If you look at the big tech companies, they have gotten large enough that they are going to be inspected. It's not personal,\" Bezos said at an event hosted by Business Insider US Editor in Chief Alyson Shontell in Germany on Tuesday, where he was awarded a prize for business innovation and social responsibility by Business Insider's parent company Axel Springer. The Amazon CEO said policing the power of online companies is \"one of the great questions of our age\" because as the internet has reached a level of maturity over the past decade \"we haven't learned as a civilization, as a human species, how to operate it yet.\"Amazon, Bezos said, is ready to help educate regulators and will work with whatever new constraints it is given \u2014 even if they have damaging consequences for the company. \"We have a duty, on behalf of society, to try and help educate any regulators, give them our view on this, sincerely without any cynicism or skepticism,\" he said in a conversation withAxel Springer CEO Mathias D\u00f6pfner. \"So we will work with any set of regulations we are given. Ultimately, society decides that, and we will follow those rules, regardless of the impact that they have on our business. And we will find a new way, if need be, to delight customers.\" Bezos did make clear, however, that the urge to curb the power of companies like Amazon, Facebook, and Google, should be balanced with the need to continue incentivising innovation in the tech industry. \"What I would not want to see happen is you do not want to block invention and innovation.

Andrew Carnegie's hearths forged the steel that became the skeleton of the railroad and the city. John D. Rockefeller refined 90 percent of American oil, which supplied the pre-electric nation with light. Bill Gates created a program that was considered a prerequisite for turning on a computer.</p><p><br/>To hear more feature stories, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/audio-articles/?utm_source=feed\">see our full list</url> or <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.audm.com/utm_source=soundcloud&amp;amp;utm_medium=embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=atlantic&amp;amp;utm_content=bezos_master_plan%0D%0A\">get the Audm iPhone app.</url><br/>At 55, Bezos has never dominated a major market as thoroughly as any of these forebears, and while he is presently the richest man on the planet, he has less wealth than Gates did at his zenith. Yet Rockefeller largely contented himself with oil wells, pump stations, and railcars; Gates's fortune depended on an operating system. The scope of the empire the founder and CEO of Amazon has built is wider. Indeed, it is without precedent in the long history of American capitalism.<br/>Today, Bezos controls nearly 40 percent of all e-commerce in the United States. More product searches are conducted on Amazon than on Google, which has allowed Bezos to build an advertising business as valuable as the entirety of IBM. One estimate has Amazon Web Services controlling almost half of the cloud-computing industry-institutions as varied as General Electric, Unilever, and even the CIA rely on its servers. Forty-two percent of paper book sales and a third of the market for streaming video are controlled by the company; Twitch, its video platform popular among gamers, attracts 15 million users a day. Add The Washington Post to this portfolio and Bezos is, at a minimum, a rival to the likes of Disney's Bob Iger or the suits at AT&amp;amp;T, and arguably the most powerful man in American culture.<br/>I first grew concerned about Amazon's power five years ago. I felt anxious about how the company bullied the book business, extracting ever more favorable terms from the publishers that had come to depend on it. When the conglomerate Hachette, with which I'd once published a book, refused to accede to Amazon's demands, it was punished. Amazon delayed shipments of Hachette books; when consumers searched for some Hachette titles, it redirected them to similar books from other publishers. In 2014, I wrote a cover story for The New Republic with a pugilistic title: \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/119769/amazons-monopoly-must-be-broken-radical-plan-tech-giant\">Amazon Must Be Stopped</url>.\" Citing my article, the company subsequently terminated an advertising campaign for its political comedy, Alpha House, that had been running in the magazine.<br/>Since that time, Bezos's reach has only grown. To the U.S. president, he is a nemesis. To many Americans, he is a beneficent wizard of convenience and abundance. Over the course of just this past year, Amazon has announced the following endeavors: It will match potential home buyers with real-estate agents and integrate their new homes with Amazon devices; it will enable its voice assistant, Alexa, to access health-care data, such as the status of a prescription or a blood-sugar reading; it will build a 3-million-square-foot cargo airport outside Cincinnati; it will make next-day delivery standard for members of its Prime service; it will start a new chain of grocery stores, in addition to Whole Foods, which it already owns; it will stream Major League Baseball games; it will launch more than 3,000 satellites into orbit to supply the world with high-speed internet.<br/>Bezos's ventures are by now so large and varied that it is difficult to truly comprehend the nature of his empire, much less the end point of his ambitions. What exactly does Jeff Bezos want? Or, to put it slightly differently, what does he believe? Given his power over the world, these are not small questions. Yet he largely keeps his intentions to himself; many longtime colleagues can't recall him ever expressing a political opinion. To replay a loop of his interviews from Amazon's quarter century of existence is to listen to him retell the same unrevealing anecdotes over and over.<br/>To better understand him, I spent five months speaking with current and former Amazon executives, as well as people at the company's rivals and scholarly observers. Bezos himself declined to participate in this story, and current employees would speak to me only off the record. Even former staffers largely preferred to remain anonymous, assuming that they might eventually wish to work for a business somehow entwined with Bezos's sprawling concerns.<br/>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/11/alexa-how-will-you-change-us/570844/?utm_source=feed\">From November 2018: Alexa, should we trust you?</url>]<br/>In the course of these conversations, my view of Bezos began to shift. Many of my assumptions about the man melted away; admiration jostled with continued unease. And I was left with a new sense of his endgame.<br/>Bezos loves the word relentless-it appears again and again in his closely read annual letters to shareholders-and I had always assumed that his aim was domination for its own sake. In an era that celebrates corporate gigantism, he seemed determined to be the biggest of them all. But to say that Bezos's ultimate goal is dominion over the planet is to misunderstand him. His ambitions are not bound by the gravitational pull of the Earth.<br/>Before Bezos settled on Amazon.com, he toyed with naming his unlaunched store MakeItSo.com. He entertained using the phrase because he couldn't contain a long-standing enthusiasm. The rejected moniker was a favored utterance of a man Bezos idolizes: the captain of the starship USS Enterprise-D, Jean-Luc Picard.<br/>Bezos is unabashed in his fanaticism for Star Trek and its many spin-offs. He has a holding company called Zefram, which honors the character who invented warp drive. He persuaded the makers of the film Star Trek Beyond to give him a cameo as a Starfleet official. He named his dog Kamala, after a woman who appears in an episode as Picard's \"perfect\" but unattainable mate. As time has passed, Bezos and Picard have physically converged. Like the interstellar explorer, portrayed by Patrick Stewart, Bezos shaved the remnant strands on his high-gloss pate and acquired a cast-iron physique. A friend once said that Bezos adopted his strenuous fitness regime in anticipation of the day that he, too, would journey to the heavens.<br/>When reporters tracked down Bezos's high-school girlfriend, she said, \"The reason he's earning so much money is to get to outer space.\" This assessment hardly required a leap of imagination. As the valedictorian of Miami Palmetto Senior High School's class of 1982, Bezos used his graduation speech to unfurl his vision for humanity. He dreamed aloud of the day when millions of his fellow earthlings would relocate to colonies in space. A local newspaper reported that his intention was \"to get all people off the Earth and see it turned into a huge national park.\"<br/>Most mortals eventually jettison teenage dreams, but Bezos remains passionately committed to his, even as he has come to control more and more of the here and now. Critics have chided him for philanthropic stinginess, at least relative to his wealth, but the thing Bezos considers his primary humanitarian contribution isn't properly charitable. It's a profit-seeking company called Blue Origin, dedicated to fulfilling the prophecy of his high-school graduation speech. He funds that venture-which builds rockets, rovers, and the infrastructure that permits voyage beyond the Earth's atmosphere-by selling about $1 billion of Amazon stock each year. More than his ownership of his behemoth company or of The Washington Post-and more than the $2 billion he's pledged to nonprofits working on homelessness and education for low-income Americans-Bezos calls Blue Origin his \"most important work.\"<br/>He considers the work so important because the threat it aims to counter is so grave. What worries Bezos is that in the coming generations the planet's growing energy demands will outstrip its limited supply. The danger, he says, \"is not necessarily extinction,\" but stasis: \"We will have to stop growing, which I think is a very bad future.\" While others might fret that climate change will soon make the planet uninhabitable, the billionaire wrings his hands over the prospects of diminished growth. But the scenario he describes is indeed grim. Without enough energy to go around, rationing and starvation will ensue. Over the years, Bezos has made himself inaccessible to journalists asking questions about Amazon. But he shares his faith in space colonization with a preacher's zeal: \"We have to go to space to save Earth.\"<br/>At the heart of this faith is a text Bezos read as a teen. In 1976, a Princeton physicist named Gerard K. O'Neill wrote a populist case for moving into space called The High Frontier, a book beloved by sci-fi geeks, NASA functionaries, and aging hippies. As a Princeton student, Bezos attended O'Neill seminars and ran the campus chapter of Students for the Exploration and Development of Space. Through Blue Origin, Bezos is developing detailed plans for realizing O'Neill's vision.<br/>The professor imagined colonies housed in miles-long cylindrical tubes floating between Earth and the moon. The tubes would sustain a simulacrum of life back on the mother planet, with soil, oxygenated air, free-flying birds, and \"beaches lapped by waves.\" When Bezos describes these colonies-and presents artists' renderings of them-he sounds almost rapturous. \"This is Maui on its best day, all year long. No rain, no storms, no earthquakes.\" Since the colonies would allow the human population to grow without any earthly constraints, the species would flourish like never before: \"We can have a trillion humans in the solar system, which means we'd have a thousand Mozarts and a thousand Einsteins. This would be an incredible civilization.\"<br/>Bezos rallies the public with passionate peroration and convincing command of detail. Yet a human hole remains in his presentation. Who will govern this new world? Who will write its laws? Who will decide which earthlings are admitted into the colonies? These questions aren't explicitly answered, except with his fervent belief that entrepreneurs, those in his own image, will shape the future. And he will do his best to make it so. With his wealth, and the megaphone that it permits him, Bezos is attempting to set the terms for the future of the species, so that his utopia can take root.<br/>In a way, Bezos has already created a prototype of a cylindrical tube inhabited by millions, and it's called Amazon.com. His creation is less a company than an encompassing system. If it were merely a store that sold practically all salable goods-and delivered them within 48 hours-it would still be the most awe-inspiring creation in the history of American business. But Amazon is both that tangible company and an abstraction far more powerful.<br/>Bezos's enterprise upends long-held precepts about the fundamental nature of capitalism-especially an idea enshrined by the great Austrian economist Friedrich Hayek. As World War II drew to its close, Hayek wrote the essay \"The Use of Knowledge in Society,\" a seminal indictment of centralized planning. Hayek argued that no bureaucracy could ever match the miracle of markets, which spontaneously and efficiently aggregate the knowledge of a society. When markets collectively set a price, that price reflects the discrete bits of knowledge scattered among executives, workers, and consumers. Any governmental attempt to replace this organic apparatus-to set prices unilaterally, or even to understand the disparate workings of an economy-is pure hubris.<br/>Amazon, however, has acquired the God's-eye view of the economy that Hayek never imagined any single entity could hope to achieve. At any moment, its website has more than 600 million items for sale and more than 3 million vendors selling them. With its history of past purchases, it has collected the world's most comprehensive catalog of consumer desire, which allows it to anticipate both individual and collective needs. With its logistics business-and its growing network of trucks and planes-it has an understanding of the flow of goods around the world. In other words, if Marxist revolutionaries ever seized power in the United States, they could nationalize Amazon and call it a day.<br/>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2018/08/the-problem-with-bezos-billions/566552/?utm_source=feed\">Read: Jeff Bezos's $150 billion fortune is a policy failure</url>]<br/>What makes Amazon so fearsome to its critics isn't purely its size but its trajectory. Amazon's cache of knowledge gives it the capacity to build its own winning version of an astonishing array of businesses. In the face of its growth, long-dormant fears of monopoly have begun to surface-and Amazon has reportedly found itself under review by the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice. But unlike Facebook, another object of government scrutiny, Bezos's company remains deeply trusted by the public. A 2018 poll sponsored by Georgetown University and the Knight Foundation found that Amazon engendered greater confidence than virtually any other American institution. Despite Donald Trump's jabs at Bezos, this widespread faith in the company makes for a source of bipartisan consensus, although the Democrats surveyed were a touch more enthusiastic than the Republicans were: They rated Amazon even more trustworthy than the U.S. military. In contrast to the dysfunction and cynicism that define the times, Amazon is the embodiment of competence, the rare institution that routinely works.<br/>All of this confidence in Bezos's company has made him a singular figure in the culture, which, at times, regards him as a flesh-and-blood Picard. If \"Democracy dies in darkness\"-the motto of the Bezos-era Washington Post-then he is the rescuer of the light, the hero who reversed the terminal decline of Woodward and Bernstein's old broadsheet. When he wrote <url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/@jeffreypbezos/no-thank-you-mr-pecker-146e3922310f\">a Medium post alleging that the National Enquirer had attempted to extort him</url>, he was hailed for taking a stand against tabloid sleaze and cyberbullying.<br/>As Amazon has matured, it has assumed the trappings of something more than a private enterprise. It increasingly poses as a social institution tending to the common good. After it earned derision for the alleged treatment of its workers-some warehouse employees reported feeling pressured to forgo bathroom breaks to meet productivity targets, to cite just one example-it unilaterally raised its minimum wage to $15 an hour in the U.S., then attempted to shame competitors that didn't follow suit. (Amazon says that employees are allowed to use the bathroom whenever they want.) As technology has reshaped its workforce, Amazon has set aside $700 million to retrain about a third of its U.S. employees for roles with new demands.<br/>These gestures are partly gambits to insulate the company's reputation from accusations of rapaciousness. But they also tie Amazon to an older conception of the corporation. In its current form, Amazon harkens back to Big Business as it emerged in the postwar years. When Charles E. Wilson, the president of General Motors, was nominated to be secretary of defense in 1953, he famously told a Senate confirmation panel, \"I thought what was good for our country was good for General Motors, and vice versa.\" For the most part, this was an aphorism earnestly accepted as a statement of good faith. To avert class warfare, the Goliaths of the day recognized unions; they bestowed health care and pensions upon employees. Liberal eminences such as John K. Galbraith hailed the corporation as the basis for a benign social order. Galbraith extolled the social utility of the corporation because he believed that it could be domesticated and harnessed to serve interests other than its own bottom line. He believed businesses behave beneficently when their self-serving impulses are checked by \"countervailing power\" in the form of organized labor and government.<br/>Of course, those powers have receded. Unions, whose organizing efforts Amazon has routinely squashed, are an unassuming nub of their former selves; the regulatory state is badly out of practice. So while Amazon is trusted, no countervailing force has the inclination or capacity to restrain it. And while power could amass in a more villainous character than Jeff Bezos, that doesn't alleviate the anxiety that accompanies such concentration. Amazon might be a vast corporation, with more than 600,000 employees, but it is also the extension of one brilliant, willful man with an incredible knack for bending the world to his values.<br/>2.0<br/>After Jackie Bezos's shotgun marriage to a member of a traveling unicyclist troupe dissolved, she dedicated herself to their only progeny. The teenage mother from Albuquerque became her son's intellectual champion. She would drive him 40 miles each day so that he could attend an elementary school for high-testing kids in Houston. When a wait list prevented him from entering the gifted track in middle school, she wheedled bureaucrats until they made an exception. Over the course of Bezos's itinerant childhood, as his family traversed the Sun Belt of the '70s, Jackie encouraged her son's interest in tinkering by constantly shuttling him to RadioShack.<br/>\"I have always been academically smart,\" Bezos told an audience in Washington, D.C., last year. This was a sentiment ratified by the world as he ascended the meritocracy. At Princeton, he flirted with becoming a theoretical physicist. On Wall Street, he joined D. E. Shaw, arguably the brainiest and most adventurous hedge fund of the '90s. The firm would send unsolicited letters to dean's-list students at top universities, telling them: \"We approach our recruiting in unapologetically elitist fashion.\"<br/>The computer scientist who founded the firm, David E. Shaw, had dabbled in the nascent internet in the '80s. This provided him with unusual clarity about the coming revolution and its commercial implications. He anointed Bezos to seek out investment opportunities in the newly privatized medium-an exploration that led Bezos to his own big idea.<br/>When Bezos created Amazon in 1994, he set out to build an institution like the ones that had carried him through the first three decades of his life. He would build his own aristocracy of brains, a place where intelligence would rise to the top. Early on, Bezos asked job candidates for their SAT scores. The company's fifth employee, Nicholas Lovejoy, later told Wired that interviews would take the form of a Socratic test. Bezos would probe logical acuity with questions like Why are manhole covers round? According to Lovejoy, \"One of his mottos was that every time we hired someone, he or she should raise the bar for the next hire, so that the overall talent pool was always improving.\" When Bezos thought about talent, in other words, he was self-consciously in a Darwinian mode.<br/>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/09/amazon-doubles-down-new-alexa-products-echo-loop/598906/?utm_source=feed\">Read: The world wants less tech. Amazon gives it more</url>]<br/>By the logic of natural selection, it was hardly obvious that a bookstore would become the dominant firm in the digital economy. From Amazon's infancy, Bezos mastered the art of coyly deflecting questions about where he intended to take his company. But back in his hedge-fund days, he had kicked around the idea of an \"everything store\" with Shaw. And he always conveyed the impression of having grand plans-a belief that the fiction aisle and the self-help section might serve as the trailhead to commanding heights.<br/>In the vernacular, Amazon is often lumped together with Silicon Valley. At its spiritual center, however, Amazon is a retailer, not a tech company. Amazon needed to elbow its way into a tightly packed and unforgiving industry, where it faced entrenched entities such as Barnes &amp;amp; Noble, Walmart, and Target. In mass-market retail, the company with the thinnest margin usually prevails, and a soft December can ruin a year. Even as Bezos prided himself on his capacity for thinking far into the future, he also had to worry about the prospect of tomorrow's collapse. At tightfisted Amazon, there were no big bonuses at year's end, no business-class flights for executives on long hauls, no employee kitchens overflowing with protein bars.<br/>Bezos was hardly a mellow leader, especially in the company's early days. To mold his organization in his image, he often lashed out at those who failed to meet his high standards. The journalist Brad Stone's indispensable book about the company, The Everything Store, contains a list of Bezos's cutting remarks: \"Are you lazy or just incompetent?\" \"This document was clearly written by the B team. Can someone get me the A-team document?\" \"Why are you ruining my life?\" (Amazon says this account is not reflective of Bezos's leadership style.) This was the sarcastic, demeaning version of his endless questioning. But Bezos's waspish intelligence and attention to detail-his invariable focus on a footnote or an appendix-elicited admiration alongside the dread. \"If you're going in for a Bezos meeting, you're preparing as if the world is going to end,\" a former executive told me. \"You're like, I've been preparing for the last three weeks. I've asked every damn person that I know to think of questions that could be asked. Then Bezos will ask you the one question you hadn't considered.\"<br/>The growth of the company-which already brought in nearly $3 billion in revenue in its seventh year of existence-prodded Bezos to adapt his methods. He created a new position, technical adviser, to instill his views in top managers; the technical advisers would shadow the master for at least a year, and emerge as what executives jokingly refer to as \"Jeff-bots.\" His managerial style, which had been highly personal, was codified in systems and procedures. These allowed him to scale his presence so that even if he wasn't sitting in a meeting, his gestalt would be there.<br/>In 2002, Amazon distilled Bezos's sensibility into a set of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles\">Leadership Principles</url>, a collection of maxims including \"Invent and Simplify,\" \"Bias for Action,\" and \"Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit.\" To an outside ear, these sound too hokey to be the basis for fervent belief. But Amazonians, as employees call themselves, swear by them. The principles, now 14 in number, are the subject of questions asked in job interviews; they are taught in orientations; they are the qualities on which employees are judged in performance reviews.<br/>Of all the principles, perhaps the most sacrosanct is \"Customer Obsession\"-the commandment to make decisions only with an eye toward pleasing the consumer, rather than fixating on competitors-a pillar of faith illustrated by the Great Lube Scandal. About 10 years ago, Bezos became aware that Amazon was sending emails to customers suggesting the purchase of lubricants. This fact made him apoplectic. If such an email arrived at work, a boss might glimpse it. If it arrived at home, a child might pose uncomfortable questions. Bezos ordered the problem solved and threatened to shut down Amazon's email promotions in their entirety if it wasn't. Kristi Coulter, who served as the head of worldwide editorial and site merchandising, led a group that spent weeks compiling a list of verboten products, which Bezos's top deputies then reviewed. She told me, \"It wasn't just, like, hemorrhoid cream, or lube, it was hair color, any kind of retinol. They were so conservative about what they thought would be embarrassing. Even tooth-whitening stuff, they were like, ~No. That could be embarrassing.'%o\"<br/>To climb Amazon's organizational chart is to aspire to join the inner sanctum at the very peak, called the S-Team (\"the senior team\"). These are the 17 executives who assemble regularly with Bezos to debate the company's weightiest decisions. Bezos treats the S-Team with familial affection; its members come closest to being able to read his mind. The group has absorbed the Bezos method and applies it to the corners of the company that he can't possibly touch. According to James Thomson, a manager who helped build Amazon Marketplace, where anyone can sell new or used goods through the website, \"At most companies, executives like to show how much they know. At Amazon, the focus is on asking the right question. Leadership is trained to poke holes in data.\"<br/>Once an executive makes it to the S-Team, he remains on the S-Team. The stability of the unit undoubtedly provides Bezos a measure of comfort, but it also calcifies this uppermost echelon in an antiquated vision of diversity. The S'Team has no African Americans; the only woman runs human resources. Nor does the composition of leadership change much a step down the ladder. When CNBC examined the 48 executives who run Amazon's core businesses (including retail, cloud, and hardware), it found only four women.<br/>One former team leader, who is a person of color, told me that when top executives hear the word diversity, they interpret it to mean \"the lowering of standards.\" \"It's this classic libertarian thinking,\" Coulter told me. \"They think Amazon is a meritocracy based on data, but who's deciding what gets counted and who gets to avail themselves of the opportunity? If VP meetings are scheduled at 7 a.m., how many mothers can manage that?\"<br/>(Amazon disputes the methodology CNBC used to tally women in its senior leadership ranks. \"There are dozens of female executives that play a critical role in Amazon's success,\" a spokesman told me in an email. He cited the company's generous parental-leave policy, a commitment to flexible scheduling, and the fact that more than 40 percent of its global workforce is female as evidence of its pursuit of gender equity. He also said that its Leadership Principles insist that employees \"seek diverse perspectives.\")<br/>The meritocrat's blind spot is that he considers his place in the world well earned by dint of intelligence and hard work. This belief short-circuits his capacity to truly listen to critics. When confronted about the composition of the S-Team in a company-wide meeting two years ago, Bezos seemed to dismiss the urgency of the complaint. According to CNBC, he said that he expected \"any transition there to happen very incrementally over a long period of time.\" The<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/23/who-are-amazons-top-executives-2019.html\">latest addition to the group</url>, made this year, was another white male.<br/>Bezos built his organization to be an anti-bureaucracy. To counter the tendency of groups to bloat, he instituted something called \"two-pizza teams.\" (Like Bezos's other managerial innovations, this sounds like a gimmick, except that advanced engineers and economists with doctorates accept it as the organizing principle of their professional lives.) According to the theory, teams at Amazon should ideally be small enough to be fed with two pizzas.<br/>In its warehouses, Amazon has used video games to motivate workers-the games, with names like MissionRacer, track output and pit workers against one another, prodding them to move faster. The two-pizza teams represent a more subtle, white-collar version of this gamification. The small teams instill a sense of ownership over projects. But employees placed on such small teams can also experience a greater fear of failure, because there's no larger group in which to hide or to more widely distribute blame.<br/>Amazon has a raft of procedures to guide its disparate teams. Bezos insists that plans be pitched in six-page memos, written in full sentences, a form he describes as \"narrative.\" This practice emerged from a sense that PowerPoint had become a tool for disguising fuzzy thinking. Writing, Bezos surmised, demands a more linear type of reasoning. As John Rossman, an alumnus of the company who wrote a book called Think Like Amazon, described it, \"If you can't write it out, then you're not ready to defend it.\" The six-pagers are consumed at the beginning of meetings in what Bezos has called a \"study hall\" atmosphere. This ensures that the audience isn't faking its way through the meeting either. Only after the silent digestion of the memo-which can be an anxiety-inducing stretch for its authors-can the group ask questions about the document.<br/>Most teams at Amazon are hermetic entities; required expertise is embedded in each group. Take Amazon's robust collection of economists with doctorates. In the past several years, the company has hired more than 150 of them, which makes Amazon a far larger employer of economists than any university in the country. Tech companies such as Microsoft and Uber have also hired economists, although not as many. And while other companies have tended to keep them in centralized units, often working on forecasting or policy issues, Amazon takes a different approach. It distributes economists across a range of teams, where they can, among other things, run controlled experiments that permit scientific, and therefore effective, manipulation of consumer behavior.<br/>Relentless might be the most Amazonian word, but Bezos also talks about the virtues of wandering. \"Wandering is an essential counterbalance to efficiency,\" he wrote in a letter to shareholders this year. When I spoke with workers based at Amazon's Seattle headquarters, they said what they appreciated most about their employer was the sense of intellectual autonomy it allowed. Once they had clearly articulated a mission in an approved six-pager, they typically had wide latitude to make it happen, without having to fight through multiple layers of approval. The wandering mentality has also helped Amazon continually expand into adjacent businesses-or businesses that seem, at first, unrelated. Assisted by the ever growing consumer and supplier data it collects, and the insights into human needs and human behavior it is constantly uncovering, the company keeps finding new opportunities for growth.<br/>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/02/when-amazon-went-from-big-to-unbelievably-big/582097/?utm_source=feed\">Read: When Amazon went from big to unbelievably big</url>]<br/>What is Amazon, aside from a listing on Nasdaq? This is a flummoxing question. The company is named for the world's most voluminous river, but it also has tributaries shooting out in all directions. Retailer hardly captures the company now that it's also a movie studio, an artificial-intelligence developer, a device manufacturer, and a web-services provider. But to describe it as a conglomerate isn't quite right either, given that so many of its businesses are tightly integrated or eventually will be. When I posed the question to Amazonians, I got the sense that they considered the company to be a paradigm-a distinctive approach to making decisions, a set of values, the Jeff Bezos view of the world extended through some 600,000 employees. This description, of course, means that the company's expansion has no natural boundary; no sector of the economy inherently lies beyond its core competencies.<br/>3.0<br/>In late 2012, Donald Graham prepared to sell his inheritance, The Washington Post. He wanted to hand the paper over to someone with pockets deep enough to hold steady through the next recession; he wanted someone techie enough to complete the paper's digital transition; above all, he wanted someone who grasped the deeper meaning of stewardship. Graham came up with a shortlist of ideal owners he would pursue, including the financier David M. Rubenstein, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, eBay founder Pierre Omidyar, and Bezos.<br/>The last of the names especially enticed Graham. That January, he had breakfast with his friend and adviser Warren Buffett, who also happened to be a shareholder in the Post. Buffett mentioned that he considered Bezos the \"best CEO in the United States\"-hardly an unconventional opinion, but Graham had never heard it from Buffett before. After the breakfast, Graham set out to better understand Bezos's ideological predilections. \"I did a primitive Google search and found nothing, as close to nothing for somebody with that kind of wealth. I didn't know what his politics were,\" he told me. This blankness suggested to Graham the stuff of an ideal newspaper owner.<br/>Graham dispatched an emissary to make the pitch. It was a polite but hardly promising conversation: Bezos didn't rule out the possibility of bidding for the Post, but he didn't display any palpable enthusiasm, either. The fact that he dropped the subject for several months seemed the best gauge of his interest. While Bezos ghosted Graham, Omidyar, the most enthusiastic of the bidders, continued to seek the prize.<br/>Bezos's past pronouncements may not have revealed partisanship, but they did suggest little appetite for stodgy institutionalism. Like so many CEOs of the era, Bezos figured himself an instrument of creative destruction, with little sympathy for the destroyed. \"Even well-meaning gatekeepers slow innovation,\" he wrote in his 2011 letter to shareholders. He was critiquing New York book publishers, whose power Amazon had aimed to diminish. But he harbored a similarly dim view of self-satisfied old-media institutions that attempted to preserve their cultural authority.<br/>It therefore came as a surprise when, after months of silence, Bezos sent a three-sentence email expressing interest in the Post. Graham made plans to lunch with Bezos in Sun Valley, Idaho, where they would both be attending Allen &amp;amp; Company's summer conference. Over sandwiches that Graham brought back to his rental, the old proprietor made his preferred buyer a counterintuitive pitch: He explained all the reasons owning a newspaper was hard. He wanted Bezos to know that a newspaper was a self-defeating vehicle for promoting business interests or any preferred agenda. The conversation was a tutorial in the responsibilities of the elite, from a distinguished practitioner.<br/>Graham didn't need to plead with Bezos. In Sun Valley, they hardly haggled over terms. \"We had brunch twice, and at the end we shook hands, unlike almost any deal I've ever made in business,\" Graham told me. The man who decried gatekeepers was suddenly the keeper of one of the nation's most important gates.<br/>Buying the Post was not a financially momentous event in the life of Jeff Bezos. In addition to the billions in Amazon stock he owned, he had quietly invested in Google and Uber in their infancy. The Bezos imprimatur, the young companies had understood, would burnish their chances with any other would-be investor. (Uber's initial public offering alone earned him an estimated $400 million earlier this year, far more than he paid for the Post in 2013.)<br/>But the purchase was a turning point in Bezos's reputational history-and realigned his sense of place in the world. On the eve of the acquisition, Amazon's relationship with New York publishing was contentious. The friendly guy who professed his love of Kazuo Ishiguro novels and had created a cool new way to buy books was now seen in some quarters as an enemy of literary culture and a successor to the monopolist Rockefeller. Not long before the acquisition, he had written a memo, obtained by Brad Stone, titled \"Amazon.love,\" asking the S-Team to ponder how the company could avoid becoming as feared as Walmart, Goldman Sachs, and Microsoft. Although he never justified the purchase of the Post as a response to his anxieties about Amazon's image-and, of course, his own-the question must have been on his mind as he considered the opportunity. To save a civically minded institution like the Post was a chance to stake a different legacy for himself.<br/>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/06/amazon-flex-workers/563444/?utm_source=feed\">Read: I delivered packages for Amazon and it was a nightmare</url>]<br/>Bezos keeps the Post structurally separate from Amazon-his family office monitors the business of the paper-but he runs it in the same expansionist spirit as he does his company. He vowed to put every dollar of profit back into the enterprise. In the six years of his ownership, the Post newsroom has grown from 500 to just over 850.<br/>Despite his investments in the institution, Bezos's transition to Washington, D.C., was halting and awkward. It took him several months to visit the Post newsroom and try to allay rank-and-file nervousness about the intentions of the new owner. When the Post's great editor Ben Bradlee died several months into his regime, he decided to attend the funeral only after Bob Woodward explained its spiritual significance. His attachment to the paper didn't seem to acquire emotional depth until he sent his jet to retrieve the reporter Jason Rezaian from Iran, where he'd been imprisoned for 18 months, and personally accompanied him home. The press hailed Bezos for displaying such a strong interest in the fate of his reporter, a taste of how media extol those they regard as their own saviors.<br/>It may have taken him a moment to realize that Washington would be a new center of his life, but once he did, he rushed to implant himself there. In 2016, he paid $23 million to buy the site of a former museum just down the block from Woodrow Wilson's old home. The museum had joined together two mansions, one of which had been designed by John Russell Pope, the architect of the Thomas Jefferson Memorial. Bezos kept one of the buildings as his residential quarters and set about renovating the other for the sake of socializing, a space that seemed to self-consciously recall Katharine Graham's old salon, except with geothermal heat. Washingtonian magazine, which obtained Bezos's blueprints, predicted that, once complete, it will become \"a veritable Death Star of Washington entertaining.\"<br/>While Bezos made himself at home in Washington, so did his company, but on its own terms. The Obama years were a boom time for Big Tech. Executives regularly shuffled through the White House. Visitor logs record that no American company visited more often than Google. Silicon Valley hurled itself into policy debates with its characteristic pretense of idealism, even as it began to hire Brioni-clad influence peddlers. It was, by its own account, battling for nothing less than the future of the free internet, a fight to preserve net neutrality and prevent greedy telecoms from choking the liberatory promise of the new medium.<br/>As the tech companies invested heavily in policy, Amazon would occasionally cheer them on and join their coalitions. But mostly it struck a pose of indifference. Amazon didn't spend as much on lobbyists as most of its Big Tech brethren did, at least not until the late Obama years. Amazon seemed less concerned about setting policy than securing lucrative contracts. It approached government as another customer to be obsessed over.<br/>Given the way Democrats now bludgeon Big Tech, it's hard to remember how warmly Barack Obama embraced the industry, and how kindly Big Tech reciprocated with campaign donations. But there was a less visible reason for the alliance: As the debacle of healthcare.gov graphically illustrated, Obama badly needed a geek squad. He installed the nation's first-ever chief technology officer, and the administration began to importune the federal bureaucracy to upload itself to the cloud, a move it promised would save money and more effectively secure sensitive material.<br/>Cloud First was the official name of the policy. Amazon had nothing to do with its inception, but it stood to make billions from it. It had wandered into the cloud-computing business long before its rivals. Amazon Web Services is, at its most elemental, a constellation of server farms around the world, which it rents at low cost as highly secure receptacles for data. Apple, the messaging platform Slack, and scores of start-ups all reside on AWS.<br/>If retail was a maddeningly low-margin business, AWS was closer to pure profit. And Amazon had the field to itself. \"We faced no like-minded competition for seven years. It's unbelievable,\" Bezos boasted last year. AWS is such a dominant player that even Amazon's competitors, including Netflix, house data with it-although Walmart resolutely refuses, citing anxieties about placing its precious secrets on its competitor's servers. Walmart is more suspicious than the intelligence community: In 2013, the CIA agreed to spend $600 million to place its data in Amazon's cloud.<br/>Other Big Tech companies have fretted about the morality of becoming entangled with the national-security state. But Bezos has never expressed such reservations. His grandfather developed missile-defense systems for the Pentagon and supervised nuclear labs. Bezos grew up steeped in the romance of the Space Age, a time when Big Business and Big Government linked arms to achieve great national goals. Besides, to be trusted with the secrets of America's most secretive agency gave Amazon a talking point that it could take into any sales pitch-the credentials that would recommend it to any other government buyer.<br/>One of Amazon's great strengths is its capacity to learn, and it eventually acclimated itself to the older byways of Washington clientelism, adding three former congressmen to its roster of lobbyists. (Amazon's spending on lobbying has increased by almost 470 percent since 2012.) It also began to hire officials as they stepped out of their agencies. When the Obama administration's top procurement officer, Anne Rung, left her post, she headed straight to Amazon.<br/>The goal wasn't just to win cloud-computing contracts. Amazon sold facial-recognition software to law-enforcement agencies and has reportedly pitched it to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Amazon also wanted to become the portal through which government bureaus buy staples, chairs, coffee beans, and electronic devices. This wasn't a trivial slice of business; the U.S. government spends more than $50 billion on consumer goods each year. In 2017, the House of Representatives quietly passed the so-called Amazon amendment, buried within a larger appropriations bill. The provisions claimed to modernize government procurement, but also seemed to set the terms for Amazon's dominance of this business. Only after competitors grasped the significance of the amendment did a backlash slow the rush toward Amazon. (The government is preparing to run a pilot program testing a few different vendors.)<br/>Still, government's trajectory was easy to see, especially if one looked outside the capital city. In 2017, Amazon signed an agreement with a little-known organization called U.S. Communities, with the potential to yield an estimated $5.5 billion. U.S. Communities negotiates on behalf of more than 55,000 county and municipal entities (school districts, library systems, police departments) to buy chalk, electronics, books, and the like. A 2018 report by the Institute for Local Self-Reliance documented how a growing share of the physical items that populate public spaces has come to be supplied by Amazon.<br/>At the heart of Amazon's growing relationship with government is a choking irony. Last year, Amazon didn't pay a cent of federal tax. The company has mastered the art of avoidance, by exploiting foreign tax havens and moonwalking through the seemingly infinite loopholes that accountants dream up. Amazon may not contribute to the national coffers, but public funds pour into its own bank accounts. Amazon has grown enormous, in part, by shirking tax responsibility. The government rewards this failure with massive contracts, which will make the company even bigger.<br/>What type of ego does Jeff Bezos possess? The president of the United States has tested his capacity for sublimation by pummeling him mercilessly. In Trump's populist morality play, \"Jeff Bozo\" is cast as an overlord. He crushes small businesses; he rips off the postal service; he stealthily advances corporate goals through his newspaper, which Trump misleadingly refers to as the \"Amazon Washington Post.\" During the 2016 campaign, Trump vowed to use the machinery of state to flay Amazon: \"If I become president, oh do they have problems.\" Don Graham's warnings about the downsides of newspaper ownership suddenly looked prophetic.<br/>It's not that Bezos has always whistled past these attacks: In a countertweet, he once joked about launching Donald Trump into space. However, the nature of Bezos's business, with both government and red-state consumers, means that he would rather avoid presidential hostility.<br/>Despite the vitriol, or perhaps because of it, Amazon hired the lobbyist Jeff Miller, a prodigious Trump fundraiser; Bezos conveys his opinions to the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner. In 2017, Bezos won a nomination to join a panel advising the Defense Department on technology, although the swearing-in was canceled after Pentagon officials realized that he had not undergone a background check. (He never joined the panel.) One former White House aide told me, \"If Trump knew how much communication Bezos has had with officials in the West Wing, he would lose his mind.\"<br/>In the fall of 2017, the Pentagon announced a project called the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI. The project would migrate the Defense Department's data to a centralized cloud, so that the agency could make better use of artificial intelligence and more easily communicate across distant battlefields. The Pentagon signaled the importance of the venture with the amount it intended to spend on it: $10 billion over 10 years. But it has the potential to be even more lucrative, since the rest of the federal government tends to follow the Pentagon's technological lead.<br/>Firms vied ferociously to win the contract. Because Amazon was widely seen as the front-runner, it found itself on the receiving end of most of the slings. Its rivals attempted to stoke Trump's disdain for Bezos. An executive at the technology company Oracle created a flowchart purporting to illustrate Amazon's efforts, titled \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/07/30/pentagon-issues-forceful-rebuke-oracle-debate-over-massive-federal-contract-turns-caustic/\">A Conspiracy to Create a Ten Year DoD Cloud Monopoly</url>.\" Oracle has denied slipping the graphic to the president, but a copy landed in Trump's hands.<br/>Oracle also tried to block Amazon in court. Its filings spun a sinister narrative of Amazon infiltrating the Pentagon. A former consultant for Amazon Web Services had landed a top job in the secretary of defense's office, but at the heart of Oracle's tale was a project manager who had arrived at the Pentagon by way of Amazon named Deap Ubhi. Even as he worked in government, Ubhi tweeted: \"Once an Amazonian, always an Amazonian.\" Oracle alleged that he stayed true to that self-description as he helped shape JEDI to favor his alma mater. (Amazon countered that dozens of people developed the contract, and that Ubhi worked on JEDI for only seven weeks, in its early stages.) When the Pentagon formally announced JEDI's specifications, only Amazon and Microsoft met them.<br/>Ubhi's role in the project was concerning, but not enough for either a federal judge or the Pentagon to halt JEDI. There was \"smoke,\" the judge said, but no \"fire.\" This victory should have paved the way for Amazon. But with the Pentagon nearly set to award JEDI this summer, the president's new secretary of defense, Mark Esper, announced that he was delaying the decision and reexamining the contract. A Pentagon official told me that Trump had seen Tucker Carlson inveigh against JEDI on Fox News and asked for an explanation. Senator Marco Rubio, who received more than $5 million in campaign contributions from Oracle during the 2016 campaign cycle, called for the Pentagon to delay awarding the bid, and reportedly pressed the case in a phone call with Trump. (Rubio received a much smaller donation from Amazon in the same period.) Trump seems to have been unable to resist a chance to stick it to his enemy, perhaps mortally imperiling Amazon's chance to add $10 billion to its bottom line.<br/>Given Trump's motives, it's hard not to sympathize with Bezos. But Trump's spite-and the terrible precedent set by his punishment of a newspaper owner-doesn't invalidate the questions asked of Amazon. Its critics have argued that government shouldn't latch itself onto a single company, especially not with a project this important. They noted that storing all of the Pentagon's secrets with one provider could make them more vulnerable to bad actors. It could also create an unhealthy dependence on a firm that might grow complacent with its assured stream of revenue and lose its innovative edge over time.<br/>JEDI sits within the context of larger questions about the government's relationship to Amazon. Fears that the public was underwriting the company's continued growth haunted Amazon's attempt to build a second headquarters in Queens-New York government looked like it was providing tax breaks and subsidies to the business that least needs a boost.<br/>While Amazon's aborted move to Long Island City attracted all the attention, the building of a similar bastion just outside Washington, D.C., is more ominous. Of course, there are plenty of honorable reasons for a company to set up shop in the prosperous shadow of the Capitol. But it's hard to imagine that Amazon wasn't also thinking about its budding business with the government-an opportunity that the delay of JEDI will hardly dissuade it from pursuing. According to a Government Accountability Office survey of 16 agencies, only 11 percent of the federal government has made the transition to the cloud.<br/>The company is following in its owner's tracks. Just as Bezos has folded himself into the fraternity of Washington power-yukking it up at the Alfalfa and Gridiron Clubs-thousands of Amazon implants will be absorbed by Washington. Executives will send their kids to the same fancy schools as journalists, think-tank fellows, and high-ranking government officials. Amazonians will accept dinner-party invites from new neighbors. The establishment, plenty capacious, will assimilate millionaire migrants from the other Washington. Amazon's market power will be matched by political power; the interests of the state and the interests of one enormous corporation will further jumble-the sort of combination that has, in the past, never worked out well for democracy.<br/>4.0<br/>Jeff Bezos was with his people, the feted guest at the 2018 meeting of the National Space Society. The group awarded him a prize it could be sure he would appreciate: the Gerard K. O'Neill Memorial Award for Space Settlement Advocacy. After a dinner in his honor, Bezos sat onstage to chat with an editor from GeekWire. But before the discussion could begin, Bezos interjected a question: \"Does anybody here in this audience watch a TV show called The Expanse?\"<br/>The question pandered to the crowd, eliciting applause, hoots, and whistles. The Expanse, which had been broadcast on the Syfy channel, is about the existential struggles of a space colony, set in the far future, based on novels that Bezos adores. Despite the militancy of its devoted fans, Syfy had canceled The Expanse. Angry protests had ensued. A plane had flown over an Amazon office in Santa Monica, California, with a banner urging the company to pick up the show.<br/>As the Space Society's exuberant reaction to Bezos's first question began to wane, Bezos juiced the crowd with another: \"Do you guys know that the cast of The Expanse is here in the room?\" He asked the actors to stand. From his years overseeing a movie studio, Bezos has come to understand the dramatic value of pausing for a beat. \"Ten minutes ago,\" he told the room, \"I just got word that The Expanse is saved.\" And, in fact, he was its benefactor. Invoking the name of the spaceship at the center of the series, he allowed himself to savor the fist-pumping euphoria that surrounded him. \"The Rocinante is safe.\"<br/>The Expanse was one small addition to Bezos's Hollywood empire, which will soon be housed in the old Culver Studios, where Hitchcock once filmed Rebecca and Scorsese shot Raging Bull. Amazon will spend an estimated $5 billion to $6 billion on TV shows and movies this year.<br/>When Bezos first announced Amazon's arrival in Hollywood, he bluntly stated his revolutionary intent. He vowed to create \"a completely new way of making movies,\" as he put it to Wired. Amazon set up a page so that anyone, no matter their experience, could submit scripts for consideration. It promised that it would let data drive the projects it commissioned-some in the company liked to describe this as the marriage of \"art and science.\"<br/>This bluster about Amazon's heterodox approach turned out to be unreflective of the course it would chart. When it streamed its second batch of pilots, in 2014, it analyzed viewing patterns, then set aside the evidence. Bezos walked into the green-light meeting and announced that Amazon needed to press forward with the least-watched of the five pilots: Transparent, a show about a transgender parent of three adult children. Bezos had read the rave reviews and made up his mind.<br/>The critical success of Transparent set the template for Amazon Studios. In the early 2010s, the best talent still preferred to work for cable networks. For a new platform to pry that talent away and attract viewers, it needed to generate attention, to schedule a noisy slate. Instead of playing to the masses, Amazon defined itself as an indie studio, catering to urban upper-middle-class tastes, although the executives in Seattle were hardly hipsters themselves. One former executive from Amazon's book-publishing arm told me, \"I remember when Lena Dunham's proposal was going out, they were like, ~Who is Lena Dunham?'%o\"<br/>As a nascent venture, Amazon Studios was forced to hew closely to one of Amazon's Leadership Principles: Frugality. Executives rummaged through other companies' rejection piles for unconventional scripts. It bought Catastrophe, a cast-aside comedy, for $100,000 an episode. With the BBC, it acquired the first season of Fleabag for about $3 million.<br/>Parsimony proved to be a creative stimulant. The studio's risky projects were awards magnets. Amazon won Golden Globes in all five years it was in contention. When the camera panned for black-tie reaction shots to these victories, the glare of Bezos's unmistakable scalp would jump off the screen. According to his colleagues, these awards provided him with palpable pleasure, and he thrust himself into their pursuit. To curry favor with those who cast ballots for big prizes, he hosted parties at his Beverly Hills property, which had once been owned by DreamWorks co-founder David Geffen.<br/>Reading interviews with Bezos from back in the days of his rapid ascent, it's hard to believe that he ever imagined becoming a king of Hollywood or that leading men like Matt Damon would drape their arms over his shoulders and pose for photographs as if they were chums. When he talked about his own nerdiness, he was self-effacing, sometimes painfully so. He once told Playboy, \"I am not the kind of person women fall in love with. I sort of grow on them, like a fungus.\"<br/>When Bezos attended the 2013 Vanity Fair Oscars party, he didn't act as if he owned the room. Still, while Google co-founder Sergey Brin kept to a corner, Bezos and his now ex-wife, MacKenzie, circulated through the throngs. They might have clung to each other, but they also gamely engaged whoever approached them. MacKenzie once admitted to Vogue that her introversion made her nervous at such events, but she described her husband as a \"very social guy.\"<br/>Hollywood, both the business and the scene, is an intoxicant. Just as in Washington, Bezos immersed himself in a new culture. Paparazzi captured him yachting with the media mogul Barry Diller. He got to know the powerful agent Patrick Whitesell, whose wife, Lauren Sanchez, would later become Bezos's girlfriend. He began to appear at the parties of famous producers, such as Mark Burnett, the creator of Survivor and The Apprentice. As one Hollywood executive told me, \"Bezos is always showing up. He would go to the opening of an envelope.\"<br/>Bezos has justified Amazon's investment in Hollywood with a quip: \"When we win a Golden Globe, it helps us sell more shoes.\" This is an intentionally glib way of saying that Amazon is different from its competitors. It's not just a streaming service (like Netflix) or a constellation of channels (like Comcast), although it's both of those things. Amazon is an enclosed ecosystem, and it hopes that its video offerings will prove a relatively inexpensive method of convincing people to live within it.<br/>Amazon's goal is visible in one of the metrics that it uses to judge the success of its programming. It examines the viewing habits of users who sign up for free trials of Amazon Prime, and then calculates how many new subscriptions to the service a piece of programming generates. As it deliberates over a show's fate, Amazon considers a program's production costs relative to the new subscriptions it yields. In the earliest days of the studio, nice reviews might have been enough to overcome these analytics. But Amazon has demonstrated that it will cancel even a Golden Globe winner, such as I Love Dick, if the metrics suggest that fate.<br/>Back in the '60s, countercultural critiques of television regarded it as a form of narcotic that induced a state of mindless consumerism. That's not an unfair description of television's role in Prime's subscription model. Despite its own hyperrational approach to the world, Amazon wants to short-circuit the economic decision making of its consumers. Sunil Gupta, a Harvard Business School professor who has studied the company, told me, \"When Amazon started Prime, it cost $79 and the benefit was two-day free shipping. Now, most smart people will do the math and they will ask, Is $79 worth it? But Bezos says, I don't want you to do this math. So I'll throw in movies and other benefits that make the computation of value difficult.\"<br/>When Amazon first created Prime, in 2005, Bezos insisted that the price be set high enough that the program felt like a genuine commitment. Consumers would then set out to redeem this sizable outlay by faithfully consuming through Amazon. One hundred million Prime subscribers later, this turned out to be a masterstroke of behavioral economics. Prime members in the U.S. spend $1,400 a year on Amazon purchases, compared with $600 by nonmembers, according to a survey by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. It found that 93 percent of Prime customers keep their subscription after the first year; 98 percent keep it after the second. Through Prime, Bezos provided himself a deep pool of cash: When subscriptions auto-renew each year, the company instantly has billions in its pockets. Bezos has turned his site into an almost unthinking habit. The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel and Jack Ryan are essential tools for patterning your existence.<br/>As Bezos has deepened his involvement in the studio, it has begun to make bigger bets that reflect his sensibility. It spent $250 million to acquire the rights to produce a Lord of the Rings TV series. It reportedly paid nine figures for the services of the husband-and-wife team behind HBO's Westworld and has plans to adapt novels by such sci-fi eminences as Neal Stephenson and William Gibson. Bezos has involved himself in wrangling some of these projects. He made personal pleas to J. R. R. Tolkien's estate as the Lord of the Rings deal hung in the balance. An agent told me that Bezos has emailed two of his clients directly; Amazon executives apply pressure by invoking his name in calls: He's asking about this project every day.<br/>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/11/amazon-and-the-myth-of-moneyball-media/545792/?utm_source=feed\">Read: Why Amazon just spent a fortune to turn ~Lord of the Rings' into TV</url>]<br/>As a kid, Bezos would spend summers at his grandfather's ranch in Cotulla, Texas, where he would help castrate bulls and install pipes. He would also watch soap operas with his grandmother. But his primary entertainment during those long days was science fiction. A fanatic of the genre had donated a robust collection to the local library, and Bezos tore his way through shelves of Isaac Asimov and Jules Verne. Describing his affinity for the novels of the sci-fi writer Iain M. Banks, he once said, \"There's a utopian element to it that I find very attractive.\" The comment contains a flash of self-awareness. For all his technocratic instincts, for all his training as an engineer and a hedge-fund quant, a romantic impulse coexists with his rationalism, and sometimes overrides it.<br/>It is perhaps fitting that Bezos's lone brush with scandal transpired in Hollywood. What befuddled so many of his admirers is that the scandal revealed a streak of indiscipline that doesn't mesh with the man who created a company so resolutely fixated on the long term, so committed to living its values. The expectation embedded in this confusion is unfair. While the culture has sometimes touted Bezos as a superhero, he's an earthling in the end. When he creates the terms for his business, or for society, he's no more capable of dispassion than anyone else. To live in the world of Bezos's creation is to live in a world of his biases and predilections.<br/>5.0<br/>I'm loath to look back at my Amazon purchase history, decades long and filled with items of questionable necessity. The recycling bin outside my house, stuffed full of cardboard covered with arrows bent into smiles, tells enough of a story. I sometimes imagine that the smile represents the company having a good laugh at me. My fidelity to Amazon comes despite my record of criticizing it.<br/>When we depend on Amazon, Amazon gains leverage over us. To sell through the site is to be subjected to a system of discipline and punishment. Amazon effectively dictates the number of items that a seller can place in a box, and the size of the boxes it will handle. (To adhere to Amazon's stringent requirements, a pet-food company recently reduced its packaging by 34 percent.) Failure to comply with the rules results in a monetary fine. If a company that sells through Amazon Marketplace feels wronged, it has little recourse, because its contract relinquishes the right to sue. These are just the terms of service.<br/>Is there even a choice about Amazon anymore? This is a question that haunts businesses far more than consumers. Companies such as Nike resisted Amazon for years; they poured money into setting up their own e-commerce sites. But even when Nike didn't sell its products on Amazon, more Nike apparel was sold on the site than any other brand. Anyone could peddle Nike shoes on Amazon without having to explain how they obtained their inventory. Because Amazon Marketplace had become a pipeline connecting Chinese factories directly to American homes, it also served as a conduit for counterfeit goods, a constant gripe of Nike's. Wired reported that, at one point during this year's Women's World Cup, six of Amazon's 10 best-selling jerseys appeared to be knockoffs. To have any hope of controlling this market, Nike concluded that it had no option but to join its rival. (Amazon has said that it prohibits the sale of counterfeit products.)<br/>Ben Thompson, the founder of Stratechery, a website that vivisects Silicon Valley companies, has incisively described Amazon's master plan. He argues that the company wants to provide logistics \"for basically everyone and everything,\" because if everything flows through Amazon, the company will be positioned to collect a \"tax\" on a stunning array of transactions. When Amazon sells subscriptions to premium cable channels such as Showtime and Starz, it reportedly takes anywhere from a 15 to 50 percent cut. While an item sits in an Amazon warehouse waiting to be purchased, the seller pays a rental fee. Amazon allows vendors to buy superior placement in its search results (it then marks those results as sponsored), and it has carved up the space on its own pages so that they can be leased as advertising. If a business hopes to gain access to Amazon's economies of scale, it has to pay the tolls. The man who styles himself as the heroic Jean-Luc Picard has thus built a business that better resembles Picard's archenemy, the Borg, a society-swallowing entity that informs victims, You will be assimilated and Resistance is futile.<br/>In the end, all that is admirable and fearsome about Amazon converges. Every item can be found on its site, which makes it the greatest shopping experience ever conceived. Every item can be found on its site, which means market power is dangerously concentrated in one company. Amazon's smart speakers have the magical power to translate the spoken word into electronic action; Amazon's doorbell cameras have the capacity to send video to the police, expanding the surveillance state. With its unique management structure and crystalline articulation of values and comprehensive collection of data, Amazon effortlessly scales into new businesses, a reason to marvel and cower. Jeff Bezos has won capitalism. The question for the democracy is, are we okay with that? <br/>On Jeff Bezos's ranch in West Texas, there is a mountain. Burrowed inside its hollowed-out core is a cascading tower of interlaced Geneva wheels, levers, and a bimetallic spring. These innards, still not fully assembled, will move the Clock of the Long Now, a timepiece that has been designed to run with perfect accuracy for 10,000 years, with a hand that advances with each turn of the century. Bezos has supplied $42 million to fund the clock's construction, an attempt to dislodge humans from the present moment, to extend the species' sense of time. Bezos has argued that if humans \"think long term, we can accomplish things that we wouldn't otherwise accomplish.\"<br/><br/>Performance reviews at Amazon ask employees to name their \"superpower.\" An employer probably shouldn't create the expectation that its staff members possess qualities that extend beyond mortal reach, but I'm guessing Bezos would answer by pointing to his ability to think into the future. He dwells on the details without sacrificing his clarity about the ultimate destination. It's why he can simultaneously prod one company to master the grocery business while he pushes another to send astronauts to the moon by 2024, in the hope that humans will eventually mine the astronomical body for the resources needed to sustain colonies. Bezos has no hope of ever visiting one of these colonies, which wouldn't arise until long after his death, but that fact does nothing to diminish the intensity of his efforts.<br/>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/05/jeff-bezos-moon-nasa/589150/?utm_source=feed\">Read: Jeff Bezos has plans to extract the moon's water</url>]<br/>That Donald Trump has picked Jeff Bezos as a foil is fitting. They represent dueling reactions to the dysfunction of so much of American life. In the face of the manipulative emotionalism of this presidency, it's hard not to pine for a technocratic alternative, to yearn for a utopia of competence and rules. As Trump runs down the country, Bezos builds things that function as promised.<br/>Yet the erosion of democracy comes in different forms. Untrammeled private power might not seem the biggest threat when public power takes such abusive form. But the country needs to think like Bezos and consider the longer sweep of history before permitting so much responsibility to pool in one man, who, without ever receiving a vote, assumes roles once reserved for the state. His company has become the shared national infrastructure; it shapes the future of the workplace with its robots; it will populate the skies with its drones; its website determines which industries thrive and which fall to the side. His investments in space travel may remake the heavens. The incapacity of the political system to ponder the problem of his power, let alone check it, guarantees his Long Now. He is fixated on the distance because he knows it belongs to him.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ATLANT-whatjeffbezoswants598363</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ATLANT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X8N-9231-DYY9-J0M3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">368376</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"11163\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc.

The shares were in addition to the $1.8 billion worth of stock he sold earlier in the week. It's unclear why he's selling. But the moves come amid growing scrutiny of Amazon and follow a disappointing earnings report. </p><p>Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[3]. Jeff Bezos' selling spree didn't stop at $1.8 billion. By the end of last week, he'd dumped nearly a $1 billion more of his Amazon stock. On Thursday and Friday last week, Bezos, the CEO of the e-commerce giant, sold 531,852 shares, or about 1% of his total stake, for $990 million, according to documents he filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. He also donated another 268 shares \u2014 worth nearly $500,000 \u2014 to an unnamed nonprofit organization. The end-of-the-week moves capped off a big week of sales for Amazon's founder. Over the first three days of last week \u2014 the last three days of July \u2014 Bezos sold 965,612 shares, garnering more than $1.8 billion[4]. In total, he sold about 2.5% of his shares. Read more: Jeff Bezos just sold $1.8 billion worth of Amazon shares \u2014 here's our best guess at why[5] The sales were part of a trading plan that Bezos put in place, according to the regulatory documents. It's not clear when he put the plan in place. Before last week's sales, he had sold any of his shares since last October, although he'd donated some to unnamed non-profit groups. It was also unclear why Bezos is selling stock. The Amazon spokesman Dan Perlet declined to comment on the sales. Investors often consider sales by a CEO or other top executives at company to be a bad sign, potentially an indication that the insiders are anticipating their company's performance to deteriorate or not meet the market's expectations. Amazon's second-quarter profit came in below Wall Street forecasts[6], and company executives warned its third-quarter report could similarly disappoint, amid rising costs. Amazon is also under scrutiny for its business practices amid a wide-ranging antitrust investigation[7] by federal officials and a similar inquiry in Europe[8]. And the US Defense Department last week announced an indefinite delay[9] in awarding a $10 billion cloud-computing contract that Amazon was widely expected to win. Even with the stock sales, Bezos remains Amazon's biggest stakeholder. He now owns 57.6 million shares, or about 11% of the company. Got a tip about Amazon or another tech company?

When that is the case, then investing strategies often shift from indexing to a more disciplined stock picking routine, and that's when investors need solid growth ideas. Jefferies highlights the firm's top growth stocks to buy each week, and this week is no exception. </p><p>While these companies are better suited for accounts that have a higher risk tolerance, they all make good sense now, and all have outstanding upside potential. We found four that look extremely good now, and they are among Jefferies top U.S. Growth Calls for this week. Alphabet The search giant has been under pressure as there have been calls for Congress to break-up the big tech leaders. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is a global technology company focused around key areas, such as search, advertising, operating systems and platforms, enterprise and hardware products.The Company generates revenue primarily by delivering online advertising and by selling apps and contents on Google Play as well as hardware products.The Company provides its products and services in more than 100 languages and in 190 countries, regions, and territories.Alphabet offers performance and brand advertising services. It operates through Google and Other Bets segments. The Google segment includes principal Internet products, such as search, Ads, Commerce, Maps, YouTube, Apps, Cloud, Android, Chrome, and Google Play, as well as technical infrastructure and newer efforts, such as Virtual Reality. Google has outlined expanding capabilities to facilitate commerce, capitalizing on the 'treasure trove' of data provided by seven different properties each with at least one billion active users (Android, Search, Chrome, Maps, Play, YouTube, and Gmail). Smart shopping campaigns leverage machine learning to make sense of touch points along the consumer purchase path, including better offline attribution capabilities (locally-oriented searches +200% over the last two years) and improved purchase conversion rates (20% on average). The Jefferies team said this about the tech Goliath's potential antitrust issues: We hosted a conference call with an antitrust focused legal expert this week. Our expert noted that the breakup scenarios for mega cap tech companies is unlikely, and that actual regulation action would likely take more than just a few years. In order to make a case, regulators need to prove that the target company has: 1) gained or maintained monopoly through unlawful practices or 2) a past merger substantially decreased competition. US regulators focus on 'consumer welfare' so it might be hard to argue that lower prices or better products are hurting consumers. The Jefferies price target is posted at $1450, and the Wall Street consensus is set at $1343.80 The shares closed Friday at $1086.30. FibroGen This company has big upside potential for investors with only a moderate risk profile. FibroGen, Inc. (NASDAQ: FGEN) engages in the discovery, development, and commercialization of therapeutics. It focuses on hypoxia-inducible factor and connective tissue growth factor biology to develop innovative medicines for the treatment of anemia, fibrotic disease, and cancer. Fibrogen is focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of novel therapeutics to treat serious unmet medical needs.The company has capitalized on extensive experience in fibrosis and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) biology to generate multiple programs targeting various therapeutic areas. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-TFS1000061560773150892251762500218</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TFS-5001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WC4-5S41-F03R-N421-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"631\"/><timeReceived>12:05 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>24/7 Wall St.</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 17, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>CC0002JIM</classCode><className>ALPHABET INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Our previous 2004 estimate of $1.66 per share is unchanged. Recently, the Company raised 3Q03 guidance to $0.45-$0.49 from $0.27-$0.31 per share due to improved credit quality on three fronts: recoveries from past charge-offs, lower gross charge-offs, and gains on direct venture investments. What's changed? Simply put, the 35% increase in the NASDAQ Composite since the beginning of the year has rekindled big tech's love affair for small companies with big ideas. Our $34 price target is conservative and doesn't assume any appreciation in SIVB's tangible book value multiple, just $1.50 or more per share going to tangible book over the next 15 months.</p><p>ADP: Reit Underperform - Management commentary at the company's analyst meeting on Friday did little to dispel our cautious view of the company's fundamentals and our opinion that the shares appear overvalued. Maintaining Underperform rating. We believe that the update was incrementally negative inasmuch as ADP's new Employer Services sales are tracking below plan so far in fiscal 2004. Other business metrics also appear decidedly mixed, with some mild positives in Brokerage. While we believe the company remains on track to achieve its '04 revenue guidance and our '04 EPS estimate of $1.57, we think the sales shortfall could adversely impact our fiscal 2005 estimates which are unchanged. We continue to believe ADP shares are overvalued, with the recent share performance tracking well ahead of fundamentals and inconsistent with the firm's intrinsic growth prospects. We believe ADP is fairly valued in the $29-31 range.<br/><br/>EFX: Reit Buy - The House approved the permanent extension of FCRA that expires January 1. The legislation blocks states from enacting credit reporting and usage laws and would also allow consumers to receive one free credit report per year. Senator Shelby introduced a bill that supports permanent extension of FCRA, largely mirroring the House bill. This move was counter to speculation that he would push for a temporary extension or more rigorous provisions than the House bill. Permanent extension of FCRA seems likely to include provisions for one free annual credit report; we believe this would have a negligible impact on Equifax's consumer direct unit, where an estimated 2% of total revenue is from single reports. We continue to recommend EFX shares based on a reasonable valuation, attractive cash flow and ROC. Our $32 target price implies a 2004 P/E multiple of 19.5x and is corroborated by DCF analysis which indicates fair value of $32.<br/><br/>JCOM: Reit Buy - j2 Global announced last week that it has implemented a price increase for its entire Web Channel subscriber base, to be phased in during the next 12 months. We are marginally increasing our 2003 estimates to reflect the earlier than expected implementation of the Web Channel price increase. We expect revenue of $72 million, EBITDA of $30 million, and EPS of $1.01. In 2004, revenue should increase 41% to $102 million, up from our previous estimate of $101 million. We are increasing our EBITDA estimate to $49 million from $47 million. We expect EPS of $1.34 and FCF/share of $1.33. JCOM trades at 21x 2004 EBITDA and 32x EPS. JCOM stock has improved dramatically as operational execution has generated improved results. As further profitability is uncovered, the stock could respond favorably.<br/><br/>IGT: Reit Hold - We are lowering our EPS estimates for IGT by $0.04 for FY04 to account for the expected sale of the company's online lottery operations to Scientific Games. Scientific Games announced today its intent to buy IGT Online for $143 million. Given IGT recently lost its bid to renew Florida contract, which expires at end of calendar 2004, we are not surprised the company decided to get out of the lottery business. In addition, IGT recently lost its contract for the Minnesota online lottery. Because IGT Online has been losing share in the last few years and because it would have required a real effort from IGT to turn the lottery business into a dominant player, we believe the sale makes sense. The disposal would let IGT more fully concentrate on its core slot business (Product Sales and Gaming Operations). IGT acquired the lottery business when it acquired Anchor Gaming on December 30, 2001.<br/><br/>SGMS: Reit Buy - We're maintaining our Buy rating &amp; raising our price target to $13.50 from $11 on Scientific Games. SGMS its acquisition of IGT OnLine Entertainment Systems, Inc. from IGT for $143 m in cash. IGT OnLine holds contracts for DE, FL (contract ends 12/04), IN, MD, PE, SD, WV, &amp; a Korean lottery contract. For FY 2003 we're forecasting IGT OnLine will conservatively contribute $140m to revs &amp; $35m to EBITDA. We see $5m of annual savings, which is not included in our 2004 forecast. These savings should fully offset the loss of the Florida lottery contract in 2005. SGMS also receives the rights to IGT's slot titles for its lottery games. We believe this acquisition makes complete sense for SGMS. We think it will take at least 30 dys to receive regulatory approvals. This acquisition gives SGMS a larger presence in the online lottery.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">JAGCOM-#40259251#</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">JAGCOM2003</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:49J6-MFV0-01S2-J15P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">270024</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"888\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>JAGfn.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"13518\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><copyright>Copyright 2003 Comtex News Network, Inc.</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2003 JAGfn.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><bodyText><p>This content is provided to LexisNexis by Comtex News Network, Inc.</p></bodyText><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"09\" year=\"2003\"><dateText>September 15, 2003 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>JEFFERIES LLC\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>\u00a0EQUIFAX INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>EFX (NYSE)\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS561450 CREDIT BUREAUS\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>\u00a0SIC7323 CREDIT REPORTING SERVICES\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>Automatic Data Processing, Inc.;

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DAVID WESTIN, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Joining us now is Jeff Jarvis, CUNY Newmark, School of Journalism professor and former Advance.net President. Jonathan Golub of Credit Suisse is also still with us. So, Jeff, welcome back. Great to have you here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JEFF JARVIS, PROFESSOR, CUNY: Thank you.</p><p>WESTIN: Two questions. What are they going to hear from these leaders of tech, and what should they hear? Is there a difference?</p><p>JARVIS: I also want to ask the reverse question, are we going to hear anything of intelligence from our own representatives?</p><p>WESTIN: No, no, no, no.</p><p>JARVIS: Because last time, they proved to be absolute dundering idiots about the internet. So I don't think I've learned much since then. So what we're going to see I think is the big tech companies rolling over the legislators with their knowledge of internet in the future, which legislators don't have. So this is a political show. I don't think we'll hear much or some things at all.</p><p>WESTIN: So are they going to come forward with a plan to address -- this is specifically having to do with Russian interference with U.S. elections, pretty timely given the fact that we have an election just like 62 days from now?</p><p>JARVIS: I think it's really important to recognize that, like it or not, love them or hate them, the platforms are the best ally against Russian election manipulation. Our own government is not. Witness from the top. And Donald Trump changed the language over the last couple of days, about for weeks, where he is now attacking not just us in media and journalism, he's also attacking Google and Facebook and the platforms. He attacks any source of facts and information, trying to devalue them. So now, I think media and the platforms end up on the same side, in defense of truth, including defense against manipulation.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>WESTIN: Well at least the political arena, it's going to happen, whether it should happen or not. For two reasons, one is, when is the last time you had any industry become this dominant without the government taking a hard look or regulation, like standard oil? When you put that together with people, electing people, people from Capitol Hill really care about how they get elected. So it's a practical matter. Aren't they going to take a hard look at possible government regulation?</p><p>JARVIS: I hope not, or I hope they do it as inefficiently as they do everything else. If you look at the regulation that's occurred in Europe is well-meaning, but there's now a record of unintended consequences. GDP or the privacy regulation means that there are thousands of publishers in the U.S. who cut off Europeans. The right to be forgotten -- Google is in a position of deciding what's to be remembered or not.</p><p>The ancillary copyright which is coming is really going to have a huge impact on the freedom of everyone's speech. I think it is too soon to regulate the internet, because we don't know what it is yet, David.</p><p>WESTIN: Why isn't there a simple regulation? Maybe there should be more of a simple regulation, which is, eliminate anonymity. When you have these powerful ads, I need to know who is advertising -- in any other space, I know who is advertising my mattress. I know who it is. I can hold them to account. In the political realm, I have no idea where it's coming from. Why do we simply required --</p><p>JARVIS: That's easy for us to say here, with Republican privilege. If you are in the Philippines and you're facing jail or murder, or you're in Russia and anonymity is a protection for those who are vulnerable. And I do think, however, transparency about advertising would be a good policy.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>WESTIN: But if there a big difference to the broadsheets, is there were so many of them. When you come down to the fangs, you only have Facebook and Google and --</p><p>JARVIS: No, David, what you have been said is -- you know, now that's the differences. You used to have a certain number of newspaper and networks, now 2 billion people can speak on Facebook. That's the diversity.

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its  accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DAVID WESTIN, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  Joining us now is Jeff Jarvis, CUNY  Newmark, School of Journalism professor and former Advance.net President.   Jonathan Golub of Credit Suisse is also still with us.  So, Jeff, welcome  back.  Great to have you here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JEFF JARVIS, PROFESSOR, CUNY:  Thank you.</p><p>WESTIN:  Two questions.  What are they going to hear from these leaders of  tech, and what should they hear?  Is there a difference?</p><p>JARVIS:  I also want to ask the reverse question, are we going to hear  anything of intelligence from our own representatives?</p><p>WESTIN:  No, no, no, no.</p><p>JARVIS:  Because last time, they proved to be absolute dundering idiots  about the internet.  So I don't think I've learned much since then.  So  what we're going to see I think is the big tech companies rolling over the  legislators with their knowledge of internet in the future, which  legislators don't have.  So this is a political show.  I don't think we'll  hear much or some things at all.</p><p>WESTIN:  So are they going to come forward with a plan to address -- this  is specifically having to do with Russian interference with U.S. elections,  pretty timely given the fact that we have an election just like 62 days  from now?</p><p>JARVIS:  I think it's really important to recognize that, like it or not,  love them or hate them, the platforms are the best ally against Russian  election manipulation.  Our own government is not.  Witness from the top.   And Donald Trump changed the language over the last couple of days, about  for weeks, where he is now attacking not just us in media and journalism,  he's also attacking Google and Facebook and the platforms.  He attacks any  source of facts and information, trying to devalue them.  So now, I think  media and the platforms end up on the same side, in defense of truth,  including defense against manipulation.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>WESTIN:  Well at least the political arena, it's going to happen, whether  it should happen or not.  For two reasons, one is, when is the last time  you had any industry become this dominant without the government taking a  hard look or regulation, like standard oil?  When you put that together  with people, electing people, people from Capitol Hill really care about  how they get elected.  So it's a practical matter.  Aren't they going to  take a hard look at possible government regulation?</p><p>JARVIS: I hope not, or I hope they do it as inefficiently as they do  everything else.  If you look at the regulation that's occurred in Europe  is well-meaning, but there's now a record of unintended consequences.  GDP  or the privacy regulation means that there are thousands of publishers in  the U.S. who cut off Europeans.  The right to be forgotten -- Google is in  a position of deciding what's to be remembered or not.</p><p>The ancillary copyright which is coming is really going to have a huge  impact on the freedom of everyone's speech.  I think it is too soon to  regulate the internet, because we don't know what it is yet, David.</p><p>WESTIN:  Why isn't there a simple regulation?  Maybe there should be more  of a simple regulation, which is, eliminate anonymity.  When you have these  powerful ads, I need to know who is advertising -- in any other space, I  know who is advertising my mattress.  I know who it is.  I can hold them to  account.  In the political realm, I have no idea where it's coming from.   Why do we simply required --</p><p>JARVIS:  That's easy for us to say here, with Republican privilege.  If you  are in the Philippines and you're facing jail or murder, or you're in  Russia and anonymity is a protection for those who are vulnerable.  And I  do think, however, transparency about advertising would be a good policy.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>WESTIN:  But if there a big difference to the broadsheets, is there were so  many of them.  When you come down to the fangs, you only have Facebook and  Google and --</p><p>JARVIS:  No, David, what you have been said is -- you know, now that's the  differences.  You used to have a certain number of newspaper and networks,  now 2 billion people can speak on Facebook.  That's the diversity.  Now the  public speaks not just the privilege can keep us.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>WESTIN:  When there were three networks, the FCC was approving just about  every darn that was being done.  You had all kinds of regulations.  So if  you go that way, boy, you're going to have a lot of regulations.</p><p>JARVIS:  We'll go instead two, three newspapers in New York, where you had  The New York Times, and the New York Daily News, and the New York Post.

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its  accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> DAVID WESTIN, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  Joining us now is Jeff Jarvis, CUNY  Newmark, School of Journalism professor and former Advance.net President.   Jonathan Golub of Credit Suisse is also still with us.  So, Jeff, welcome  back.  Great to have you here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> JEFF JARVIS, PROFESSOR, CUNY:  Thank you.</p><p> WESTIN:  Two questions.  What are they going to hear from these leaders of  tech, and what should they hear?  Is there a difference?</p><p> JARVIS:  I also want to ask the reverse question, are we going to hear  anything of intelligence from our own representatives?</p><p> WESTIN:  No, no, no, no.</p><p> JARVIS:  Because last time, they proved to be absolute dundering idiots  about the internet.  So I don't think I've learned much since then.  So  what we're going to see I think is the big tech companies rolling over the  legislators with their knowledge of internet in the future, which  legislators don't have.  So this is a political show.  I don't think we'll  hear much or some things at all.</p><p> WESTIN:  So are they going to come forward with a plan to address -- this  is specifically having to do with Russian interference with U.S. elections,  pretty timely given the fact that we have an election just like 62 days  from now?</p><p> JARVIS:  I think it's really important to recognize that, like it or not,  love them or hate them, the platforms are the best ally against Russian  election manipulation.  Our own government is not.  Witness from the top.   And Donald Trump changed the language over the last couple of days, about  for weeks, where he is now attacking not just us in media and journalism,  he's also attacking Google and Facebook and the platforms.  He attacks any  source of facts and information, trying to devalue them.  So now, I think  media and the platforms end up on the same side, in defense of truth,  including defense against manipulation.</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> WESTIN:  Well at least the political arena, it's going to happen, whether  it should happen or not.  For two reasons, one is, when is the last time  you had any industry become this dominant without the government taking a  hard look or regulation, like standard oil?  When you put that together  with people, electing people, people from Capitol Hill really care about  how they get elected.  So it's a practical matter.  Aren't they going to  take a hard look at possible government regulation?</p><p> JARVIS: I hope not, or I hope they do it as inefficiently as they do  everything else.  If you look at the regulation that's occurred in Europe  is well-meaning, but there's now a record of unintended consequences.  GDP  or the privacy regulation means that there are thousands of publishers in  the U.S. who cut off Europeans.  The right to be forgotten -- Google is in  a position of deciding what's to be remembered or not.</p><p> The ancillary copyright which is coming is really going to have a huge  impact on the freedom of everyone's speech.  I think it is too soon to  regulate the internet, because we don't know what it is yet, David.</p><p> WESTIN:  Why isn't there a simple regulation?  Maybe there should be more  of a simple regulation, which is, eliminate anonymity.  When you have these  powerful ads, I need to know who is advertising -- in any other space, I  know who is advertising my mattress.  I know who it is.  I can hold them to  account.  In the political realm, I have no idea where it's coming from.   Why do we simply required --</p><p> JARVIS:  That's easy for us to say here, with Republican privilege.  If you  are in the Philippines and you're facing jail or murder, or you're in  Russia and anonymity is a protection for those who are vulnerable.  And I  do think, however, transparency about advertising would be a good policy.</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> WESTIN:  But if there a big difference to the broadsheets, is there were so  many of them.  When you come down to the fangs, you only have Facebook and  Google and --</p><p> JARVIS:  No, David, what you have been said is -- you know, now that's the  differences.  You used to have a certain number of newspaper and networks,  now 2 billion people can speak on Facebook.  That's the diversity.  Now the  public speaks not just the privilege can keep us.</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> WESTIN:  When there were three networks, the FCC was approving just about  every darn that was being done.  You had all kinds of regulations.  So if  you go that way, boy, you're going to have a lot of regulations.</p><p> JARVIS:  We'll go instead two, three newspapers in New York, where you had  The New York Times, and the New York Daily News, and the New York Post.   Not regulated, thank god, constitutionally, by our government.  TV never  should have been, I would argue.  So I think your point absolutely had a  chance.</p><p> ALIX STEEL, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  All right, we have to leave it there  unfortunately, but that was really good debate.  Jeff Jarvis of CUNY,  Newmark School of Journalism and Jonathan Golub of Credit Suisse, thank you  both very much.  Great to see you.</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p> THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DAVID WESTIN, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Joining us now is Jeff Jarvis, CUNY Newmark, School of Journalism professor and former Advance.net President. Jonathan Golub of Credit Suisse is also still with us. So, Jeff, welcome back. Great to have you here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JEFF JARVIS, PROFESSOR, CUNY: Thank you.</p><p>WESTIN: Two questions. What are they going to hear from these leaders of tech, and what should they hear? Is there a difference?</p><p>JARVIS: I also want to ask the reverse question, are we going to hear anything of intelligence from our own representatives?</p><p>WESTIN: No, no, no, no.</p><p>JARVIS: Because last time, they proved to be absolute dundering idiots about the internet. So I don't think I've learned much since then. So what we're going to see I think is the big tech companies rolling over the legislators with their knowledge of internet in the future, which legislators don't have. So this is a political show. I don't think we'll hear much or some things at all.</p><p>WESTIN: So are they going to come forward with a plan to address -- this is specifically having to do with Russian interference with U.S. elections, pretty timely given the fact that we have an election just like 62 days from now?</p><p>JARVIS: I think it's really important to recognize that, like it or not, love them or hate them, the platforms are the best ally against Russian election manipulation. Our own government is not. Witness from the top. And Donald Trump changed the language over the last couple of days, about for weeks, where he is now attacking not just us in media and journalism, he's also attacking Google and Facebook and the platforms. He attacks any source of facts and information, trying to devalue them. So now, I think media and the platforms end up on the same side, in defense of truth, including defense against manipulation.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>WESTIN: Well at least the political arena, it's going to happen, whether it should happen or not. For two reasons, one is, when is the last time you had any industry become this dominant without the government taking a hard look or regulation, like standard oil? When you put that together with people, electing people, people from Capitol Hill really care about how they get elected. So it's a practical matter. Aren't they going to take a hard look at possible government regulation?</p><p>JARVIS: I hope not, or I hope they do it as inefficiently as they do everything else. If you look at the regulation that's occurred in Europe is well-meaning, but there's now a record of unintended consequences. GDP or the privacy regulation means that there are thousands of publishers in the U.S. who cut off Europeans. The right to be forgotten -- Google is in a position of deciding what's to be remembered or not.</p><p>The ancillary copyright which is coming is really going to have a huge impact on the freedom of everyone's speech. I think it is too soon to regulate the internet, because we don't know what it is yet, David.</p><p>WESTIN: Why isn't there a simple regulation? Maybe there should be more of a simple regulation, which is, eliminate anonymity. When you have these powerful ads, I need to know who is advertising -- in any other space, I know who is advertising my mattress. I know who it is. I can hold them to account. In the political realm, I have no idea where it's coming from. Why do we simply required --</p><p>JARVIS: That's easy for us to say here, with Republican privilege. If you are in the Philippines and you're facing jail or murder, or you're in Russia and anonymity is a protection for those who are vulnerable. And I do think, however, transparency about advertising would be a good policy.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>WESTIN: But if there a big difference to the broadsheets, is there were so many of them. When you come down to the fangs, you only have Facebook and Google and --</p><p>JARVIS: No, David, what you have been said is -- you know, now that's the differences. You used to have a certain number of newspaper and networks, now 2 billion people can speak on Facebook. That's the diversity. Now the public speaks not just the privilege can keep us.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>WESTIN: When there were three networks, the FCC was approving just about every darn that was being done. You had all kinds of regulations. So if you go that way, boy, you're going to have a lot of regulations.</p><p>JARVIS: We'll go instead two, three newspapers in New York, where you had The New York Times, and the New York Daily News, and the New York Post. Not regulated, thank god, constitutionally, by our government. TV never should have been, I would argue. So I think your point absolutely had a chance.</p><p>ALIX STEEL, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: All right, we have to leave it there unfortunately, but that was really good debate. Jeff Jarvis of CUNY, Newmark School of Journalism and Jonathan Golub of Credit Suisse, thank you both very much.

These columns can sometimes be way off the mark. At the beginning of 2019, for instance, you probably would have thought me a Pollyanna if I had predicted that the S...00 index SPX, -0.04%[1] would surge 27% amid all the trade-war talk and interest-rate uncertainty. I didn't, of course, but that's where we are at as of Tuesday night \u2014 the second-best showing for stocks since 2003, with a few trading days left to churn even higher. Even when incorrect, these pieces looking ahead do have value, however. </p><p>They help investors to take stock of their holdings and think seriously about strategy. The best-laid plans can still fall to pieces, of course, but entering 2020 with no plan at all seems very unwise. Read: If you believe stock market bulls have the bears locked out, this will rattle your cage[2]  So here are my 10 bold calls for next year:GE sees (temporary) rebirthOn the single-stock front, I'm sticking my neck out on General Electric GE, -1.26%[3]. Sure, this company has a checkered past. But CEO Larry Culp has restored a bit of credibility and hope as the company streamlines and looks to the future. And Wall Street is taking notice; one Wall Street analyst's recent bullish take[4] for 2020 boosted the stock 4% in a single session.  I'm realistic about GE's challenges, but the stock is still trading at a 20% discount to sales \u2014 and while earnings are mediocre in a vacuum, a series of big beats under Culp prove this company knows how to keep expectations in check as it recovers. I won't claim 2021 will be a good year but 2020 may be. Google gets goingIt wasn't a bad year for Alphabet  GOOG, -0.18%[5] GOOGL, -0.22%[6], per se. Shares have risen by more than 20% this year through Tuesday, so I'm not holding a bake sale for the folks in Mountain View.  However, with Apple  AAPL, -0.24%[7] up more than 70% in the same period and Microsoft  MSFT, -0.21%[8] up 50%, it's easy to think this Big Tech giant is on the outside looking in. But in 2020, Alphabet will stand out as it offers 'growth at a reasonable price' with a forward P/E of less than 25 even as the top line is forecast to grow about 19% and earnings should grow 17%. As winners become harder to identify as the big run of the last 12 months plateaus, Google will stand out.U.S. rates will keep fallingTraditional economic theory holds that the U.S. should be raising rates right now amid robust U.S. consumer and labor-market data. But since Donald Trump sees the entirety of America \u2014 including the Federal Reserve \u2014 as his personal plaything, he has browbeaten the central bank into actually cutting rates three times in 2019.  Investors should bank on the Fed at worst standing pat but likely cutting rates again in 2020 to help Trump get re-elected. Who cares if it's bad for the long-term health of the U.S. economy as long as Donny gets his second term, right? As investors, that means continuing to keep a foot in bond funds like the popular iShares iBoxx Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF  LQD, -0.07%[9] that will rise in value as rates fall.Brexit blowupSpeaking of irrational short-term moves for political gain, I remain convinced that the world is not pricing in just how terrible a hard Brexit would be for the U.K. and for the world economy in general.  The U.K. is indeed a powerful country, ranking in the top seven in global GDP depending on how you measure it. But the Bank of England itself said a no-deal Brexit would be worse than the 2008 financial crisis[10] for businesses \u2014 and it's naive to think the global economy can simply ignore that disruption as a local occurrence. The iShares MSCI United Kingdom ETF EWU  EWU, 0.12%[11] has climbed about 15% year-to-date so it's easy to claim all's well. But in a more modest environment and with the realities of Brexit hitting home, I would tread carefully in U.K. investments.Global stocks shineThe U.K. aside, it is certainly worth looking outside the U.S. After all, it's fun to be all-in on domestic equity when the S...s surging 20%, but as domestic growth plateaus in 2020 and overseas markets pick up steam, investors will be reminded of the importance global diversification. Not only will growth trends favor overseas markets, but ballooning federal debt and falling rates in the U.S. will ease the currency headwind that existed for international stocks in a strong dollar environment. If you're intimidated by global markets, even a vanilla play like Vanguard Total International Stock ETF  VXUS, 0.07%[12] may be a decent way to add geographic diversification.China back on trackChina's GDP growth is likely to continue its slowdown in 2020, moderating to 5.8% according to many forecasts. However, this trend is well-known on Wall Street and nobody should be surprised by the lower growth rate. Furthermore, China has learned from the U.S. subprime lending crisis; household balance sheets look very good. Some hysterical traders will note how China is broadly a highly leveraged economy, but the risk mostly comes from big loans to big corporations \u2014 with the backstop of Beijing to keep things strong.  While trade conflicts kept funds like the iShares China Large-Cap ETF  FXI, 0.28%[13] from delivering more than low single-digit returns in 2019, the New Year could see these funds really take off as investors realize things aren't so bad after all.Banks outperform big timeYou may not have noticed how strong bank stocks have been. After all, the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF  XLF, -0.42%[14] is up 28% vs. about 27% for the broader S...hrough Tuesday. But the rally in big banks could get serious in 2020 for a host of reason, the least of which being the Sun Trust and BB#38;T  US:BBT[15] merger plans that hint at a very favorable regulatory environment.  And while the yield curve has been flattening over the past few years, we've seen a widening gap in long-term rates TMUBMUSD10Y, 0.32%[16] vs. short-term ones since August and that will help lending operations next year.Energy stocks continue to fadeIf the dollar does soften as I expect, commodity prices will ease up \u2014 which is even worse news for an already battered energy sector. Long-term moves toward efficiency as well as a transition away from fossil fuels in the age of global warming means that the deck is stacked against stocks in energy, and 2020 isn't going to change that narrative.  Of particular interest to tactical traders may be the suite of funds from MicroSectors that include the -1x Inverse Big Oil ETN  YGRN, -0.33%[17] and the -3x Inverse Big Oil ETN  NRGD, -0.98%[18] that bet against a focused list of the 10 biggest names in energy (the latter with three times the leverage.) Now read: Here are Wall Street's favorite stocks for an oil-sector recovery in 2020[19] ESG is ascendantIn the context of global warming as a long-term trend, there is a ton of new money out there looking for investments as awareness grows about the risks of climate change. And increasingly, potential shareholders are looking for clear alternatives to the old world of Wall Street through funds like the Xtrackers MSCI U.S.A. ESG Leaders Equity ETF  USSG, -0.01%[20] and the iShares MSCI KLD 400 Social ETF  DSI, 0.08%[21] that weed out big energy firms, firearm companies or other publicly traded companies that don't fit with the ethos of many investors.  With both of these funds boasting more than $1 billion in assets, ESG is not just a cutesy niche strategy. Increasingly, it's where young investors are putting their money \u2014 and 2020 will see that trend only gain momentum.  Read: Here's what you need to know about the $12 trillion ESG investment world[22] You will regret one or more tradesThere is no such thing as a 'perfect portfolio.' And unlike American Ninja Warrior or chess, investing is one of these absurd ventures where doing more work doesn't actually make you any 'better' at this game. So make your peace now with the fact that you will have pieces of your portfolio that disappoint you \u2014 not just because they lost you money, but because you put a lot of time and effort into building these positions.  Like everything in life, these unhealthy pieces of your diet are OK as long as you consume them in moderation and focus on the long term. Embrace that, and stay focused on the big picture in 2020.

Whether the market is surging higher or dropping like a stone, taking the other side of the trade can often end up costing you. That doesn't mean your only choice is to stampede with the herd and settle for a vanilla S&amp;#38;P 500 SPX, +2.62%[1] index fund. A number of stocks are outpacing the market so far in 2020, avoiding deep losses in March and rallying more strongly than their peers in April.Investors can come out significantly ahead simply by reallocating a bit of your portfolio from the laggards and into the top performers. </p><p>Here are five trades that offer high-potential alternatives to stocks you may have already heard about. 1. Buy Alibaba, not Amazon Global growth in e-commerce was already well underway before coronavirus pandemic created an even bigger tailwind for this megatrend. But if you think Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +0.91%[2] is the only online game in town, think again. Alibaba Group Holding BABA, +0.69%[3] is plotting 30% revenue growth this fiscal year and another 25% growth next year \u2014 figures that top the admittedly impressive growth of Amazon. Furthermore, while Western nations continue to wring their hands over the influence of Big Tech, with President Trump[4] and the European Union[5] finding a rare issue of agreement as they take aim at Amazon, Alibaba remains quite cozy[6] with the Chinese government and carries much lower political risk. Even if investors want to believe Amazon can keep growing market share and avoid any regulatory pain, the more than 30% surge of Amazon stock since Jan. 1 seems to indicate that the shares have already priced in much of the stock's current and expected success. Alibaba is the go-to choice in Asia, a high-growth market with nowhere near the maturity of Europe or North America, which Amazon dominates. So if you want to ride true e-commerce growth, you should consider Alibaba over Amazon. 2. Buy Regeneron, not Big Pharma In times of uncertainty, megacap healthcare stocks get a lot of attention as recession-proof investments. After all, people will cut back on just about any other expense before they stop buying the medicine that keeps them healthy. Yet Big Pharma names including Merck &amp;#38; Co. MRK, +0.87%[7] , GlaxoSmithKline GSK, +0.12%[8] and Pfizer Inc. PFE, -0.05%[9] have all performed worse than the S&amp;#38;P 500 since Jan. 1 \u2014 proving bigger isn't always better and even supposedly stable healthcare companies can suffer when they are reliant on an aging drug pipeline and a growth-by-acquisition strategy. That's where Regeneron Pharmaceuticals REGN, -0.25%[10] stands out. The company has received a lot of attention since news in February that it entered an agreement[11]with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to develop vaccines to fight coronavirus. But beyond that short-term potential should Regeneron succeed, the firm has an aggressive research strategy as it develops treatments for other pathogens including influenza virus strains, and embarks on clinical trials for antibody-based treatments to fight conditions ranging from cancer to arthritis. This high-growth and research-driven firm is uniquely positioned for the future of healthcare[12] \u2014 not tying its success to an old generation of drugs. If you need proof beyond its research plans, consider that Regeneron stock has gained an impressive 60% year-to-date. 3. Buy Cheniere, not Haliburton After oil tumbled into the low $20s this spring \u2014 and briefly even saw prices go negative[13] thanks to storage issues \u2014 it looked like energy stocks were done. But now oil is back in the high $30s and bargain hunters are rummaging through the oil patch on hopes of a rebound. The logic (if it can be called that) is that oil servicers such as Haliburton Company HAL, +10.08%[14] and Schlumberger SLB, +8.16%[15] are natural beneficiaries as energy companies start spending again and resume production in earnest. That strategy may work as a swing trade, as Schlumberger is up about 60% from its March lows and Haliburton has surged almost three-fold from the low $4 range to back over $12 a share. However, depending on this run to continue seems a dangerous strategy. Part of the coronavirus response, particularly in Europe[16], has been tied to 'green' stimulus efforts and not simply a bailout of the old economy. Furthermore, countless think pieces have been written about how the pandemic has once and for all established telework as a permanent model[17]. And don't forget that electric car adoption continues to steadily kill gasoline demand,. It's hard to find any certainty in the energy sector these days as a result of these trends. But Cheniere Energy Partners CQP, +4.19%[18] seem to hold less risk than most right now. Cheniere is a midstream natural gas player, a glorified 'toll taker' that charges to transport and store natural gas, which is seen by many as a bridge to a clean energy future thanks to its low cost and comparatively cleaner status. There's admittedly not a ton of growth in this stock, but there's reliability \u2014 and a generous 7.3% dividend as a hedge. 4. Buy Visa, not Wells Fargo The stock market rebound is partly due to optimism that the admittedly steep job losses[19] this spring will quickly be reversed as the U.S. economy begins to reopen in earnest. So what better way to play this recovery than via financial stocks? Wells Fargo &amp;#38; Co. WFC, +4.79%[20] has started to attract some attention among bargain hunters, as the $110 billion bank looks to turn the page on past missteps over the last few years with a new CEO and new structure[21], including a dedicated focus on small businesses. Trading at less than 70% of its book value, this stock seems quite interesting to many right now. But the past scandals of Wells are only the beginning of what should worry investors. A bigger challenge is the wholesale decline of traditional banking in the digital economy. If investors really want a recovery play tied to spending and lending, they should look at payments giant Visa Inc. V, +3.08%[22] as a true financial leader of the future. Remember, Wells Fargo has seen its revenue grow by an average of about 2% over the past five years \u2014 a sign that there's more going on here than just headlines about fake accounts[23]. Over the same period Visa's revenue growth rate has topped 20% on average. As the push towards cashless and mobile payments continues, this processor will continue to thrive. As the economy revives, more payments means more profits for Visa. 5. Buy Nike, not Campbell Soup As quarantine life forces people to cook at home, shares of Campbell Soup Company CPB, -1.21%[24] have surged an impressive 25% from the March lows. Yet this short-term trend can't counteract the longer-term challenges that have been holding this stock back \u2014 namely, an aging brand lineup that doesn't connect with younger consumers at all. Campbell Soup has made a few big moves in the last year or two, including unloading international businesses to pay down debt and fund the acquisition of North American snack food brand Snyder's-Lance[25]. But that's not a long-term plan for growth, and neither is depending on coronavirus to keep people buying your products instead of dining out. In stark contrast to Campbell is Nike Inc. NKE, +1.41%[26] , a sports behemoth with one of the most valuable brands on the planet. The stock not only has a powerful name but a powerful and growing online presence that allows it to sell directly to consumers and enjoy juicy margins. When you consider that Nike's March earnings report boasted 36%[27] year-over-year growth in its digital sales model, it's easy to understand the potential here. Remember, Campbell Soup has suffered chronically shrinking revenue in the past few years. Unless you expect coronavirus to last or condensed soup to make a big comeback, then it may not be wise to favor this stock over a growing consumer brand with a decent e-commerce footprint.

Whether the market is surging higher or dropping like a stone, taking the other side of the trade can often end up costing you. That doesn't mean your only choice is to stampede with the herd and settle for a vanilla S&amp;#38;P 500 SPX, +1.36%[1] index fund. A number of stocks are outpacing the market so far in 2020, avoiding deep losses in March and rallying more strongly than their peers in April.Investors can come out significantly ahead simply by reallocating a bit of your portfolio from the laggards and into the top performers. </p><p>Here are five trades that offer high-potential alternatives to stocks you may have already heard about. 1. Buy Alibaba, not Amazon Global growth in e-commerce was already well underway before coronavirus pandemic created an even bigger tailwind for this megatrend. But if you think Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +0.24%[2] is the only online game in town, think again. Alibaba Group Holding BABA, +1.99%[3] is plotting 30% revenue growth this fiscal year and another 25% growth next year \u2014 figures that top the admittedly impressive growth of Amazon. Furthermore, while Western nations continue to wring their hands over the influence of Big Tech, with President Trump[4] and the European Union[5] finding a rare issue of agreement as they take aim at Amazon, Alibaba remains quite cozy[6] with the Chinese government and carries much lower political risk. Even if investors want to believe Amazon can keep growing market share and avoid any regulatory pain, the more than 30% surge of Amazon stock since Jan. 1 seems to indicate that the shares have already priced in much of the stock's current and expected success. Alibaba is the go-to choice in Asia, a high-growth market with nowhere near the maturity of Europe or North America, which Amazon dominates. So if you want to ride true e-commerce growth, you should consider Alibaba over Amazon. 2. Buy Regeneron, not Big Pharma In times of uncertainty, megacap healthcare stocks get a lot of attention as recession-proof investments. After all, people will cut back on just about any other expense before they stop buying the medicine that keeps them healthy. Yet Big Pharma names including Merck &amp;#38; Co. MRK, +1.50%[7] , GlaxoSmithKline GSK, +0.21%[8] and Pfizer Inc. PFE, <url normalizedValue=\"http://feeds.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/PFE?mod=MW_story_quote\">http://feeds.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/PFE?mod=MW_story_quote</url> have all performed worse than the S&amp;#38;P 500 since Jan. 1 \u2014 proving bigger isn't always better and even supposedly stable healthcare companies can suffer when they are reliant on an aging drug pipeline and a growth-by-acquisition strategy. That's where Regeneron Pharmaceuticals REGN, -2.16%[9] stands out. The company has received a lot of attention since news in February that it entered an agreement[10]with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to develop vaccines to fight coronavirus. But beyond that short-term potential should Regeneron succeed, the firm has an aggressive research strategy as it develops treatments for other pathogens including influenza virus strains, and embarks on clinical trials for antibody-based treatments to fight conditions ranging from cancer to arthritis. This high-growth and research-driven firm is uniquely positioned for the future of healthcare[11] \u2014 not tying its success to an old generation of drugs. If you need proof beyond its research plans, consider that Regeneron stock has gained an impressive 60% year-to-date. 3. Buy Cheniere, not Haliburton After oil tumbled into the low $20s this spring \u2014 and briefly even saw prices go negative[12] thanks to storage issues \u2014 it looked like energy stocks were done. But now oil is back in the high $30s and bargain hunters are rummaging through the oil patch on hopes of a rebound. The logic (if it can be called that) is that oil servicers such as Haliburton Company HAL, +3.07%[13] and Schlumberger SLB, +3.97%[14] are natural beneficiaries as energy companies start spending again and resume production in earnest. That strategy may work as a swing trade, as Schlumberger is up about 60% from its March lows and Haliburton has surged almost three-fold from the low $4 range to back over $12 a share. However, depending on this run to continue seems a dangerous strategy. Part of the coronavirus response, particularly in Europe[15], has been tied to 'green' stimulus efforts and not simply a bailout of the old economy. Furthermore, countless think pieces have been written about how the pandemic has once and for all established telework as a permanent model[16]. And don't forget that electric car adoption continues to steadily kill gasoline demand,. It's hard to find any certainty in the energy sector these days as a result of these trends. But Cheniere Energy Partners CQP, +2.70%[17] seem to hold less risk than most right now. Cheniere is a midstream natural gas player, a glorified 'toll taker' that charges to transport and store natural gas, which is seen by many as a bridge to a clean energy future thanks to its low cost and comparatively cleaner status. There's admittedly not a ton of growth in this stock, but there's reliability \u2014 and a generous 7.3% dividend as a hedge. 4. Buy Visa, not Wells Fargo The stock market rebound is partly due to optimism that the admittedly steep job losses[18] this spring will quickly be reversed as the U.S. economy begins to reopen in earnest. So what better way to play this recovery than via financial stocks? Wells Fargo &amp;#38; Co. WFC, +5.21%[19] has started to attract some attention among bargain hunters, as the $110 billion bank looks to turn the page on past missteps over the last few years with a new CEO and new structure[20], including a dedicated focus on small businesses. Trading at less than 70% of its book value, this stock seems quite interesting to many right now. But the past scandals of Wells are only the beginning of what should worry investors. A bigger challenge is the wholesale decline of traditional banking in the digital economy. If investors really want a recovery play tied to spending and lending, they should look at payments giant Visa Inc. V, +0.26%[21] as a true financial leader of the future. Remember, Wells Fargo has seen its revenue grow by an average of about 2% over the past five years \u2014 a sign that there's more going on here than just headlines about fake accounts[22]. Over the same period Visa's revenue growth rate has topped 20% on average. As the push towards cashless and mobile payments continues, this processor will continue to thrive. As the economy revives, more payments means more profits for Visa. 5. Buy Nike, not Campbell Soup As quarantine life forces people to cook at home, shares of Campbell Soup Company CPB, -6.13%[23] have surged an impressive 25% from the March lows. Yet this short-term trend can't counteract the longer-term challenges that have been holding this stock back \u2014 namely, an aging brand lineup that doesn't connect with younger consumers at all. Campbell Soup has made a few big moves in the last year or two, including unloading international businesses to pay down debt and fund the acquisition of North American snack food brand Snyder's-Lance[24]. But that's not a long-term plan for growth, and neither is depending on coronavirus to keep people buying your products instead of dining out. In stark contrast to Campbell is Nike Inc. NKE, +3.34%[25] , a sports behemoth with one of the most valuable brands on the planet. The stock not only has a powerful name but a powerful and growing online presence that allows it to sell directly to consumers and enjoy juicy margins. When you consider that Nike's March earnings report boasted 36%[26] year-over-year growth in its digital sales model, it's easy to understand the potential here. Remember, Campbell Soup has suffered chronically shrinking revenue in the past few years. Unless you expect coronavirus to last or condensed soup to make a big comeback, then it may not be wise to favor this stock over a growing consumer brand with a decent e-commerce footprint.

But these days, Big Tech stocks like Google parent Alphabet  GOOG, -0.94%[1] GOOGL, -0.82%[2] and Facebook  FB, -0.91%[3] are increasingly drawing the ire of politicians and regulators for their scale and power. So while being dominant is great, it also pays to make sure you're not irritating the wrong people in the wrong places.  And besides, history shows that even deep-pocketed tech companies can still turn out to be disappointing from an investment perspective. </p><p>Consider dot-com darling Cisco Systems  CSCO, -0.86%[4] that boasts some $30 billion in cash and investments lying around but has a share price that chronically underperformed the S...00 index SPX, -0.38%[5] for several years. If you really want investments that avoid competition and pay off, it's worth looking past the rather fashionable monopolies in Big Tech and going old school. Instead of chasing the next internet Unicorn, take a look at boring but oligopolies instead. Unlike a true monopoly run by a single dominant players, oligopolies are characterized by a small group of entrenched peers who at best compete only theoretically and at worst collude to run a small corner of the economy however they see fit.  However you slice it, it adds up to consistent revenue \u2014 and reliable investment returns.Payments and credit cardsThere's a lot of talk among bros with man buns about how cryptocurrency like bitcoin BTCUSD, -2.60%[6] will decentralize the money system and allow folks to transact without the big banks. In the meantime, we are all stuck with three payment processing options: Visa  V, -0.61%[7], Mastercard  MA, 0.02%[8] and American Express  AXP, -0.58%[9]. Visa operates the largest credit card networks in the U.S., with 2018 payment volume of $1.95 trillion and 336 million Visa credit cards in circulation in the United States. That averages out to a card per person! Mastercard 'only' tallied $811 billion in U.S. credit purchase volume with 231 million credit cards, with upscale issuer American Express close behind with $776 billion in 2018 volume despite a comparatively small 54 million cards in circulation. That adds up to a stunning $3.5 trillion[10] in volume. As for what the future holds, let's remember that's just U.S. data. For instance, there are another 771 million Visa credit cards in circulation that bring the operator's grand total to 1.1 billion pieces of plastic \u2014 enough for 1 out of every 7 people on the planet, and growing. Furthermore, these payments leaders continue to invest heavily in fintech applications such as mobile payments and blockchain \u2014 think Visa's Fintech Fast Track[11] effort to integrate into startups and AXP's recent acquisition of payment automation platform acompay.  One way or another, all roads lead to these three payment kings. And it's a pretty nice ride for investors, too: Visa is up more than 220% in the last five years to lap the S...00 index more than four times over, with no signs of slowing down.TelecomBlockchain proponents may stubbornly stick to the notion that even entrenched financial players can be disrupted by a few good lines of code. So let's move one step back to all the infrastructure that makes those mobile payments and internet connections possible: Big Telecom. You can't just drop out of Harvard and erect a network of wireless towers and fiber-optic cables overnight, which creates a massive barrier to entry for new players.  With the recent approval[12] of a merger between T-Mobile US  TMUS, 0.62%[13] and Sprint  S, -1.92%[14], there's now theoretically a three-horse race in America; T-Mobile had 66.5 million[15] subscribers as of the third quarter while Sprint had 53.9 million[16]. Combined, that's around 120 million wireless customers, neck-and-neck with Verizon VZ, -0.03%[17] Wireless, and only modestly behind the roughly 160 million at AT#38;T T, -2.16%[18]. Here's the thing though: AT...ulled off an $85 billion acquisition of content king Time Warner in 2018, and Verizon's Oath unit owns portals AOL, the Huffington Post and Yahoo! Not only will the combined Sprint/T-Mobile have a big hole when it comes to in-house content, it also has the dubious responsibility of financing $33 billion in outstanding debt at Sprint.  Is the best 'competition' American consumers can expect in telecom? A merger of also-rans, stuffed to the gills with IOUs? If you think the state of U.S. telecom competition is ugly, however, take a look at China Mobile  CHL, -0.28%[19] 941, -1.77%[20]. The firm is the largest mobile telecom play in the world with more than 900 million subscribers and effectively has the blessing of Beijing to stay as big as it likes. The internet is going nowhere, and neither are the big wireless telecoms at the top \u2014 no matter what happens in Washington, D.C., on Wall Street or anywhere else. Though Verizon and AT...tock haven't blown off the doors lately, with share price returns only slightly outperforming the S...00 in the last year with 20% and 23% gains respectively, they both offer generous and reliable dividends on top of that. Verizon yields 4.1% and AT....4% at current prices.RailroadsMore tangible than the information superhighway, America's railroad system is just as integral to the U.S. economy. After all, those electronics and toys you order online have to eventually make their way from container ships to warehouses before they get delivered. Similar to telecom, too, is the massive capital required to participate in this marketplace and the regulatory oversight that makes it incredibly difficult for new entrants to pop up. The result are regional networks: CSX CSX, -2.04%[21] and Norfolk Southern  NSC, -1.41%[22] that share the denser operations on the east coast of the U.S., and Union Pacific  UNP, -1.74%[23] in the West. According to the Association of American Railroads, there are 600 freight railroads in the nation but just seven 'Class I' operations[24] at the top of the scale \u2014 and that's counting players like Canadian National Railway  CNI, -2.11%[25] that operates largely north of the border save for key hubs and BNSF Railway owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway BRK.A, -0.57%[26] BRK.B, -0.71%[27]. Even more impressive is that, according to AAR, these seven rail giants account for around 69% of freight rail mileage and a staggering 94% of all revenue. It begs the question: Who are these suckers splitting the other 31% of actual work for a crummy 6% share of the total payday? Sure, the golden age of passenger railroads is long past. But there's constant demand to move shipping containers from ports, automobiles on flatbeds and oil in tanker cars. That makes America's big three railroads all but bulletproof investments. Over the last five years,CSX and NSC have significantly outperformed the broader market with returns of 92% and 72%, respectively, vs. a five-year return of about 51% for the S#38;P.UtilitiesPublicly traded utility stocks provide another vital service to the U.S. economy, and have little regional overlap \u2014 or serious competition.  The landscape is admittedly more fragmented, but U.S. power giant NextEra Energy  NEE, 1.10%[28] boasts a $110 billion market capitalization and more than 5 million customers. Mid-Atlantic utility giant Duke Energy DUK, 0.11%[29] is fairly impressive, too, with more than 1 million customers and a market cap north of $60 billion. These customers are effectively a captive audience, with little choice but to keep paying their electric bill or simply live life off the grid altogether. There are pockets of mild overlap and competition, but players remain largely regional monopolies \u2014 and even amid rumblings of deregulation to foster competition, there is little real choice for regular Americans. Consider a 2018 report from the Baltimore Sun about deregulation in Maryland. Though third parties could go door to door to peddle services, the local utility \u2014 now a subsidiary of $40 billion giant Exelon  EXC, -0.02%[30] \u2014 retained ownership and distribution responsibilities across the network. The result was unsurprisingly a bunch of middle men who simply layered on extra costs instead of fostering a competitive electricity market.  According to the report[31], 'confusing terms, teaser rates and in some cases deceptive marketing tactics have sent bills soaring by as much as 50% to 75%.' But that's all we can really hope for when it comes to competition in a highly regulated and territorially entrenched utility market. The good news for investors, at least, is that they can share in this sure-thing business model by becoming shareholders. NextEra proves the profitability that comes from little regional competition, with more than 120% returns for shareholders in the last five years \u2014 and a current dividend yield of 2.2% on top. Read: Here's how the fight to control the utility involved in California wildfires could play out[32] Health-care providersWhile all of these previous lines of business are vital to the U.S. economy, there's one final area worth noting that is literally a life-or-death issue \u2014 dominant for-profit health-care providers that are patients' only option in an emergency. Take HCA Healthcare  HCA, 0.68%[33], a $45 billion network of 185 hospitals and 119 surgery centers that touches 28 million patients a year. By some measures, this makes HCA larger even than the state-run Veterans Health Administration. But unlike the VA, which tends to locate facilities in centralized areas where it can serve the most veterans possible, HCA operates a host of smaller facilities in places like Dublin, Ga., where there aren't a lot of health-care options \u2014 or a lot of competition. Universal Health SystemsUHS, -0.91%[34] is another example, with a smaller $12 billion market cap but an equally impressive 350 inpatient facilities across 37 states. These include hospitals in places like Enid, Okla., more than an hour's drive outside Oklahoma City. If you're seriously ill in the region, it's Universal Health Systems or bust. Though there may not be much prospect of organic growth for these smaller health-care facilities out in the boonies, they are virtually guaranteed to have a steady baseline of revenue from 'customers' who have no other realistic options.  It's understanding if some bristle at the harsh realities of this system. Investors, though, can profit nicely alongside these insulated regional health-care providers, as evidenced by HCA stock. It has doubled the S...00's five-year performance with a return north of 100% vs. just 51% for the benchmark index.  Jeff Reeves is a MarketWatch columnist.

Amid the simmering trade war, which has seemed to benefit nobody other than import/export consultants[1], the looming holiday shopping season presents problems over how manufacturers and consumers could be hurt.  And to make matters worse, remarks from President Trump[2] about limiting investment in the region or even delisting Chinese stocks altogether has sparked uncertainty into how to manage exposure to the region. But investors should take a deep breath before they buy into the panic. </p><p>Just as the doom-and-gloom crowd hasn't managed to sink the U.S. stock market yet in 2019, with the S...00 Index  SPX, 0.80%[3] still sitting on a year-to-date return of about 15% through Thursday's closing bell, neither have the bears been able to gain traction in China. In fact, the Shanghai Composite  SHCOMP, -0.92%[4] has actually slightly outperformed the S...00 this year. There are always risks in every investment, and you won't find a single region in the world where all the analysts are bullish. But in many ways, the negativity around China may be setting up investors for a nice relief rally if and when the gloomy trade environment clears. If you're afraid of China, here are five big reasons to reconsider \u2014 and a bunch of trading ideas to gain exposure to the region:The case for ChinaAside from day-to-day gyrations based on tweets, commodity prices or economic reports, there are a few bigger points worth making about investments in China: You can't avoid it: China's national economy is the second largest on the planet, behind only the United States. But perhaps more importantly, its national stock market is also No. 2 behind the U.S. when measured by market capitalization. Beyond names most investors are familiar with, including massive state-run energy firm Sinopec  SHI, 0.17%[5], there are also a host of smaller firms that are among the 1,500 or so 'A shares' listed on the Shanghai stock exchange, and another 1,400 stocks listed onshore on the Shenzhen exchange. That means blanket statements like 'China stocks are too risky' are actually more like saying 'the stock market is too risky.' If you think that way, be my guest and attempt to time the market or hide out in an all-cash portfolio. But if you believe in diversified investing for the long term, then China must be part of your portfolio. Still growing: Yes, in 2019 China GDP growth will likely hit the lowest level in nearly three decades. But let's remember that growth rate is still forecast to be 6% to 6.5%, comfortably double that of the U.S. and multiples of other economies including Japan's. As an investor, it is proper to worry about recent trends and near-future expectations. But just as quibbling over what kind multiple is 'fair' for a tech stock sometimes can overshadow the long-term growth story, it's important to remember that the underlying fundamentals here. Opening up: China is only getting bigger, too. Recent trade challenges with the U.S. aside, it's important to keep in mind the general opening of China's economy over the past several years. Consider a big change to ownership restrictions[6] in the financial sector, announced this summer in the thick of tariff talks, which is set to take effect in 2020, a year earlier than previously planned. Also this summer, a highly anticipated stock connection between London and Shanghai created a direct link to Western investors in place of previous efforts routed through Hong Kong.  Benchmarks adding China: On a related topic, this opening up means that structural challenges limiting institutional investors are falling away. For instance, in 2018 it was announced that the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index would start to phase in Chinese debt[7] across the next few years. And in regards to equities, leading stock index provider MSCI added more than 230 mainland China stocks to a flagship emerging market benchmark.  (Relative) political certainty: Perhaps the most ironic of all arguments for China investing is that investors may have the most visibility into the politics and policies of this region next year vs. any other major market in the world. The U.K. was already a bit of a mess thanks to Brexit drama, but is even more uncertain after the recent antics of Boris Johnson. And as a result, the European Union's relationship with the rest of the world has been thrown in to question, even as EU politics have been disrupted by a major European Parliament election in May that brought in new leadership as part of a new five-year legislative cycle. And let's not even talk about impeachment and what the 2020 U.S. election holds. If you're looking for political stability and a long-term vision, China's tradition of crafting 'five-year plans' for its economy is a breath of fresh air. What's the China trade?If you want broad China exposure, unsurprisingly there are a bunch of ETFs for that. The iShares China Large-Cap ETF  FXI, 1.61%[8] is the largest by assets, with some $4.7 billion under management, and provides easy access to 50 of the largest publicly traded corporations in China. IShares also has the No. 2 fund via the iShares MSCI China ETF  MCHI, 1.76%[9], a 43.6 billion fund with a deeper bench of roughly 470 China corporations. These are the most obvious and liquid options, but certainly not the only ones. For those particularly bullish on Chinese technology stocks as the economy transitions away from its old manufacturing dominance and into a digital age, the KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF  KWEB, 2.21%[10] is worth a look. Though not sponsored by a big ETF shop, the KraneShares fund is definitely legitimate with more than a million shares traded daily and nearly $1.5 billion in total assets. Holdings for this fund are focused, with a list of only about 40 stocks, but the lineup avoids the sprawling state-run financial and energy stocks that can be big parts of other ETFs in this region. If you're a stock-picker, then conversation about China is less about general opportunities and sentiment and more about individual companies with a uniquely bullish outlook. And just like Big Tech in the U.S., China's technology giants including Alibaba Group Holdings  BABA, 2.24%[11] and Tencent Holdings  TCEHY, 1.44%[12] are worth your attention because of their scale and entrenched operations in fast-growing areas including cloud computing and e-commerce. If you worry about chasing growth in the region, however, there are still plenty of value-oriented plays in China that are looking increasingly attractive. Take telecom behemoth China Mobile Limited  CHL, 1.76%[13], which boasts a staggering 925 million wireless customers, more than double the entire population of the United States. It has a forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 10, compared with U.S. telecom giant Verizon's  VZ, 0.17%[14] 12. Throw in CHL's 4.7% dividend yield, which tops the 4.2% offered by Verizon, and income investors may want to consider this China telecom over domestic options. And while not as obvious, it's important to note that growing interconnectedness means that China plays don't have to be headquartered in the nation. Case in point: Aerospace giant Boeing  BA, 1.28%[15], which is incredibly dependent on Chinese aircraft sales and books more than 13% of total revenue in the region.  Or better yet, look at Apple  AAPL, 0.85%[16], which booked 17% of total revenue in Greater China last quarter. Obviously how these companies manage their strategy matters just as much as mere exposure to the region. However, they also illustrate how major U.S. stocks may in fact be indirect ways to capitalize on China. Jeff Reeves is a MarketWatch columnist.

Sharecare was developed to create a secure place for patients to feel in control of their health and to connect with their doctors.  </p><p>      Since its founding in 2010 Sharecare has raised a total of $350 million in three rounds of financing, partnering with a diverse group of strategic investors including media companies like Discovery Communications, Harpo Productions that's Oprah for those of you who don't know, and First Co Corporation. We welcome now the chairman and co-founder and CEO of Sharecare, Jeff Arnold. So, Jeff, welcome. It's good to have you in Bloomberg.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ARNOLD</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WESTIN</emphasis>:  And you know this area so well because among others, you were actually were co-founder of WebMD as well, so that we all know about it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ARNOLD</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WESTIN</emphasis>:  Explain to us what exactly is going on as tech meets health care right now? What's the transformation we're watching?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ARNOLD</emphasis>:  Well, I think even 20 years ago when we started WebMD, we thought health need a home page. There needed to be a destination where doctors and patients could go that wasn't so fragmented. Back then, just getting help information not from your doctor was a big deal. But with all these other industries being disrupted, hospitality, transportation, financial services, smart phones being so pervasive now, why can't health care be next?  </p><p>      And so this idea of all of your health in one place where all the various stakeholders are coming together, health plans, providers, large employers to empower consumers, to take control of their health, to reduce health care cost is I think the timing is now.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WESTIN</emphasis>:  Jeff, we've been hearing about this for some time. And it certainly makes good sense if you won't be keeping scraps of paper and big files. And yet we don't seem to be getting there. What's the resistance? What's between us and really having an electronic way to access our health care data?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ARNOLD</emphasis>:  I think it's the consumer taking control. You know, now we have a smart phone, we have a common platform that we can develop to. But consider the hospital saying, you patient come to my portal and the health plans in, you as my member download my app. It's now about, you know, can you create a health profile on behalf of the person and use the technology to bring the stakeholders to that person's hand.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEEL</emphasis>:  Help guide those portal apps kill me every time. And like 17 is, oh my god. So if you talk about tech and health care, the first thing that come in to your mind is Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and J.P. Morgan.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ARNOLD</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEEL</emphasis>:  What do you think they're going to do for the industry?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ARNOLD</emphasis>:  I think they're creating a catalyst for change. So, you know, all the incumbents have, you know, woke up and said, you know, we have to embrace technology, we have to embrace consumerism and we need to do things differently. I think the winner in this phase is whose going to be able to do manage the data, right.  </p><p>      So you have self-reported data, direct -- device driven, claims driven data, social determinants of health data and medical records. It's also going to come down to who can drive engagement, who can get the person to actually take that first step and take control of their health? And then lastly, there'll be awareness. You know, how do these new platforms make people feel?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WESTIN</emphasis>:  When you tell like what kind of do (ph), we're pretty sensitive in general about our health care data. How are you going to guarantee that it's not going to be hacked or it's not going to be shared because we have a lot of digital companies right now who are under siege most recently Facebook.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ARNOLD</emphasis>:  Well, I think in health, trust is paramount. So what we try to do in health care is try to build your health profile, somewhere to help linked in your business profile. But empower the consumer to own their data. So the health plan doesn't own the data, the PBM doesn't own the data. The health EMR system doesn't own the data. The person does. The person controls the permissions. So the same way they can turn on and off WiFi. They can exchange their medical records.  </p><p>      So trust is everything. But I think us breaking through and saying it's not the insurance company that owns the data, the person owns the data. If the person changes health plans, the data goes with them. If the person changes doctors, the data goes with them.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEEL</emphasis>:  But you've got to protect it. What do you think the threat is? We're going to see some federal regulation on big tech companies that would encompass something that you do.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ARNOLD</emphasis>:  Well, I think, you know, outside of trust and transparency protecting the data is, you know, rule number one. And so we're embracing, you know, the best practices, you know, Blockchain's other technology is try to lock down the sensitive information. But it's a concern everybody has in the industry.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WESTIN</emphasis>:  Could we guys actually help you as you delve your business as they were reassure the consumer is out there that actually there is some protection.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ARNOLD</emphasis>:  I think so, I having standards that, you know, all of this fragmented data can talk to will help not only make the platforms more robust but, you know, build more consumer confidence.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEEL</emphasis>:  So what do you make of Mark Zuckerberg going to Capitol Hill over the next two days and facing Congress? So how do you think of this plays out in that industry?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ARNOLD</emphasis>:  Well, you know, I think that, you know, people are so used to using these social platforms, it become such a daily way of life that the train someone has left the station. But I think it's all about transparency. I think people want to know, what are you doing with my data? And then people can make the choice, do they want to share that information or not. Are they willing to pray for premium services or is this going to be app supported? But I think all the facts are going to need to be on the table.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WESTIN</emphasis>:  It's not just about convenience and actually it's also about cost over all. We've got a problem in this country as an increasing percentage of GDP is health care. Will your approach, if it becomes a standard will it bend the cost curve?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ARNOLD</emphasis>:  It will bend the cost curve. And so we talk a lot about engagement, how does the application make you feel. But the key objectives are, how do you make people more self-aware about their health? How do you reduce risk escalation? How do you not overuse the emergency room? How do you optimize provider networks to get the right person to the right doctor? How do you help people at pharmacy stand which is out of control? You know, moving from branded drugs to generic drugs from retial to home delivery.  </p><p>      We can get the people on their smart phones at the right moment to help them make better decisions and how they control their health care which is ultimately going to reduce the cost.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEEL</emphasis>:  What's the biggest health care increase that you can take out? The biggest health care cost that you can help us take out?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ARNOLD</emphasis>:  Well, I think, you know, there's a lot of areas because there's about eight key objectives that we work on. And at the first is making people more self-aware about their health in general. And we want to keep the people that are healthy, healthy right. So we don't want them to turn into chronic patients for us. Disease management and lifestyle management, I think you're going to see a revolution there.  </p><p>      It's almost going to be as this theory or Alexa which is your coach. So instead of somebody sitting on a call center trying to manage you remotely it's going to feel to that person like you're being coached 24/7, and so there's all of this data and A.I. and machine learning talk, starts to take shape of your health. You're going to be in control like you've never had before.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WESTIN</emphasis>:  So finally, what's the biggest advantage you have because you're up against some pretty big players out there, big pharma, big PBMs, big health care organizations. How could you get an advantage?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ARNOLD</emphasis>:  So we think ours is, you know, everybody talks about being disruptive. We think that want to be disruptive but not disenfranchised. So how do we work with the big health systems? How do we work with the big health plan and help them understand the consumer and bring their data to the palm in that person's hand. That's where we thrive today is working with these big organizations, helping them come into the consumerism age.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEEL</emphasis>:  All right, Jeff, great to catch up with you. Thank you so much. Jeff Arnold, CEO of Sharecare, help start WebMD disrupting the health care industry.  </p><p>      END   </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FMRWRE2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S2W-RV01-JDPT-T3TC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">345281</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>Financial Markets Regulatory Wire</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

You know, how do these new platforms make  people feel?</p><p> WESTIN:  When you tell like what kind of do (ph), we're pretty sensitive in  general about our health care data.  How are you going to guarantee that  it's not going to be hacked or it's not going to be shared because we have  a lot of digital companies right now who are under siege most recently  Facebook.</p><p> ARNOLD:  Well, I think in health, trust is paramount.  So what we try to do  in health care is try to build your health profile, somewhere to help  linked in your business profile.  But empower the consumer to own their  data.  So the health plan doesn't own the data, the PBM doesn't own the  data.  The health EMR system doesn't own the data.  The person does.  The  person controls the permissions.  So the same way they can turn on and off  WiFi.  They can exchange their medical records.</p><p> So trust is everything.  But I think us breaking through and saying it's  not the insurance company that owns the data, the person owns the data.  If  the person changes health plans, the data goes with them.  If the person  changes doctors, the data goes with them.</p><p> STEEL:  But you've got to protect it.  What do you think the threat is?   We're going to see some federal regulation on big tech companies that would  encompass something that you do.</p><p> ARNOLD:  Well, I think, you know, outside of trust and transparency  protecting the data is, you know, rule number one.  And so we're embracing,  you know, the best practices, you know, Blockchain's other technology is  try to lock down the sensitive information.  But it's a concern everybody  has in the industry.</p><p> WESTIN:  Could we guys actually help you as you delve your business as they  were reassure the consumer is out there that actually there is some  protection.</p><p> ARNOLD:  I think so, I having standards that, you know, all of this  fragmented data can talk to will help not only make the platforms more  robust but, you know, build more consumer confidence.</p><p> STEEL:  So what do you make of Mark Zuckerberg going to Capitol Hill over  the next two days and facing Congress?  So how do you think of this plays  out in that industry?</p><p> ARNOLD:  Well, you know, I think that, you know, people are so used to  using these social platforms, it become such a daily way of life that the  train someone has left the station.  But I think it's all about  transparency.  I think people want to know, what are you doing with my  data?  And then people can make the choice, do they want to share that  information or not.  Are they willing to pray for premium services or is  this going to be app supported?  But I think all the facts are going to  need to be on the table.</p><p> WESTIN:  It's not just about convenience and actually it's also about cost  over all.  We've got a problem in this country as an increasing percentage  of GDP is health care.  Will your approach, if it becomes a standard will  it bend the cost curve?</p><p> ARNOLD:  It will bend the cost curve.  And so we talk a lot about  engagement, how does the application make you feel.  But the key objectives  are, how do you make people more self-aware about their health?  How do you  reduce risk escalation?  How do you not overuse the emergency room?  How do  you optimize provider networks to get the right person to the right doctor?   How do you help people at pharmacy stand which is out of control?  You  know, moving from branded drugs to generic drugs from retial to home  delivery.</p><p> We can get the people on their smart phones at the right moment to help  them make better decisions and how they control their health care which is  ultimately going to reduce the cost.</p><p> STEEL:  What's the biggest health care increase that you can take out?  The  biggest health care cost that you can help us take out?</p><p> ARNOLD:  Well, I think, you know, there's a lot of areas because there's  about eight key objectives that we work on.  And at the first is making  people more self-aware about their health in general.  And we want to keep  the people that are healthy, healthy right.  So we don't want them to turn  into chronic patients for us.  Disease management and lifestyle management,  I think you're going to see a revolution there.</p><p> It's almost going to be as this theory or Alexa which is your coach.  So  instead of somebody sitting on a call center trying to manage you remotely  it's going to feel to that person like you're being coached 24/7, and so  there's all of this data and A.I. and machine learning talk, starts to take  shape of your health.  You're going to be in control like you've never had  before.</p><p> WESTIN:  So finally, what's the biggest advantage you have because you're  up against some pretty big players out there, big pharma, big PBMs, big  health care organizations.  How could you get an advantage?</p><p> ARNOLD:  So we think ours is, you know, everybody talks about being  disruptive.  We think that want to be disruptive but not disenfranchised.   So how do we work with the big health systems?  How do we work with the big  health plan and help them understand the consumer and bring their data to  the palm in that person's hand.  That's where we thrive today is working  with these big organizations, helping them come into the consumerism age.</p><p> STEEL:  All right, Jeff, great to catch up with you.  Thank you so much.   Jeff Arnold, CEO of Sharecare, help start WebMD disrupting the health care  industry.</p><p> [*]</p><p> ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p> THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JEFFREY ARNOLD, CEO, SHARECARE, IS INTERVIEWED ON BB TV</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">APRIL 09, 2018</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SPEAKERS: JEFFREY ARNOLD, CEO, SHARECARE</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ALIX STEEL, BLOOMBERG NEWS</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DAVID WESTIN, BLOOMBERG NEWS</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[*] DAVID WESTIN, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Technology has become a driving force that is changing the health care area. Sharecare was developed to create a secure place for patients to feel in control of their health and to connect with their doctors.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Since its founding in 2010 Sharecare has raised a total of $350 million in three rounds of financing, partnering with a diverse group of strategic investors including media companies like Discovery Communications, Harpo Productions that's Oprah for those of you who don't know, and First Co Corporation. We welcome now the chairman and co-founder and CEO of Sharecare, Jeff Arnold. So, Jeff, welcome. It's good to have you in Bloomberg.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JEFFREY ARNOLD, CEO, SHARECARE: Thank you.</p><p>WESTIN: And you know this area so well because among others, you were actually were co-founder of WebMD as well, so that we all know about it.</p><p>ARNOLD: Yes.</p><p>WESTIN: Explain to us what exactly is going on as tech meets health care right now? What's the transformation we're watching?</p><p>ARNOLD: Well, I think even 20 years ago when we started WebMD, we thought health need a home page. There needed to be a destination where doctors and patients could go that wasn't so fragmented. Back then, just getting help information not from your doctor was a big deal. But with all these other industries being disrupted, hospitality, transportation, financial services, smart phones being so pervasive now, why can't health care be next?</p><p>And so this idea of all of your health in one place where all the various stakeholders are coming together, health plans, providers, large employers to empower consumers, to take control of their health, to reduce health care cost is I think the timing is now.</p><p>WESTIN: Jeff, we've been hearing about this for some time. And it certainly makes good sense if you won't be keeping scraps of paper and big files. And yet we don't seem to be getting there. What's the resistance? What's between us and really having an electronic way to access our health care data?</p><p>ARNOLD: I think it's the consumer taking control. You know, now we have a smart phone, we have a common platform that we can develop to. But consider the hospital saying, you patient come to my portal and the health plans in, you as my member download my app. It's now about, you know, can you create a health profile on behalf of the person and use the technology to bring the stakeholders to that person's hand.</p><p>ALIX STEEL, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Help guide those portal apps kill me every time. And like 17 is, oh my god. So if you talk about tech and health care, the first thing that come in to your mind is Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and J.P. Morgan.</p><p>ARNOLD: Yes.</p><p>STEEL: What do you think they're going to do for the industry?</p><p>ARNOLD: I think they're creating a catalyst for change. So, you know, all the incumbents have, you know, woke up and said, you know, we have to embrace technology, we have to embrace consumerism and we need to do things differently. I think the winner in this phase is whose going to be able to do manage the data, right.</p><p>So you have self-reported data, direct -- device driven, claims driven data, social determinants of health data and medical records. It's also going to come down to who can drive engagement, who can get the person to actually take that first step and take control of their health? And then lastly, there'll be awareness.

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its  accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JEFFREY ARNOLD, CEO, SHARECARE,  IS INTERVIEWED ON BB TV</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">APRIL 09, 2018</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SPEAKERS: JEFFREY ARNOLD, CEO, SHARECARE</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ALIX STEEL, BLOOMBERG NEWS</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DAVID WESTIN, BLOOMBERG NEWS</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[*] DAVID WESTIN, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  Technology has become a driving force that  is changing the health care area.  Sharecare was developed to create a  secure place for patients to feel in control of their health and to connect  with their doctors.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Since its founding in 2010 Sharecare has raised a total of $350 million in  three rounds of financing, partnering with a diverse group of strategic  investors including media companies like Discovery Communications, Harpo  Productions that's Oprah for those of you who don't know, and First Co  Corporation.  We welcome now the chairman and co-founder and CEO of  Sharecare, Jeff Arnold.  So, Jeff, welcome.  It's good to have you in  Bloomberg.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JEFFREY ARNOLD, CEO, SHARECARE:  Thank you.</p><p>WESTIN:  And you know this area so well because among others, you were  actually were co-founder of WebMD as well, so that we all know about it.</p><p>ARNOLD:  Yes.</p><p>WESTIN:  Explain to us what exactly is going on as tech meets health care  right now?  What's the transformation we're watching?</p><p>ARNOLD:  Well, I think even 20 years ago when we started WebMD, we thought  health need a home page.  There needed to be a destination where doctors  and patients could go that wasn't so fragmented.  Back then, just getting  help information not from your doctor was a big deal.  But with all these  other industries being disrupted, hospitality, transportation, financial  services, smart phones being so pervasive now, why can't health care be  next?</p><p>And so this idea of all of your health in one place where all the various  stakeholders are coming together, health plans, providers, large employers  to empower consumers, to take control of their health, to reduce health  care cost is I think the timing is now.</p><p>WESTIN:  Jeff, we've been hearing about this for some time.  And it  certainly makes good sense if you won't be keeping scraps of paper and big  files.  And yet we don't seem to be getting there.  What's the resistance?   What's between us and really having an electronic way to access our health  care data?</p><p>ARNOLD:  I think it's the consumer taking control.  You know, now we have a  smart phone, we have a common platform that we can develop to.  But  consider the hospital saying, you patient come to my portal and the health  plans in, you as my member download my app.  It's now about, you know, can  you create a health profile on behalf of the person and use the technology  to bring the stakeholders to that person's hand.</p><p>ALIX STEEL, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  Help guide those portal apps kill me every  time.  And like 17 is, oh my god.  So if you talk about tech and health  care, the first thing that come in to your mind is Amazon, Berkshire  Hathaway and J.P. Morgan.</p><p>ARNOLD:  Yes.</p><p>STEEL:  What do you think they're going to do for the industry?</p><p>ARNOLD:  I think they're creating a catalyst for change.  So, you know, all  the incumbents have, you know, woke up and said, you know, we have to  embrace technology, we have to embrace consumerism and we need to do things  differently.  I think the winner in this phase is whose going to be able to  do manage the data, right.</p><p>So you have self-reported data, direct -- device driven, claims driven  data, social determinants of health data and medical records.  It's also  going to come down to who can drive engagement, who can get the person to  actually take that first step and take control of their health?  And then  lastly, there'll be awareness.  You know, how do these new platforms make  people feel?</p><p>WESTIN:  When you tell like what kind of do (ph), we're pretty sensitive in  general about our health care data.  How are you going to guarantee that  it's not going to be hacked or it's not going to be shared because we have  a lot of digital companies right now who are under siege most recently  Facebook.</p><p>ARNOLD:  Well, I think in health, trust is paramount.  So what we try to do  in health care is try to build your health profile, somewhere to help  linked in your business profile.  But empower the consumer to own their  data.  So the health plan doesn't own the data, the PBM doesn't own the  data.  The health EMR system doesn't own the data.  The person does.  The  person controls the permissions.  So the same way they can turn on and off  WiFi.  They can exchange their medical records.</p><p>So trust is everything.  But I think us breaking through and saying it's  not the insurance company that owns the data, the person owns the data.  If  the person changes health plans, the data goes with them.  If the person  changes doctors, the data goes with them.</p><p>STEEL:  But you've got to protect it.  What do you think the threat is?   We're going to see some federal regulation on big tech companies that would  encompass something that you do.</p><p>ARNOLD:  Well, I think, you know, outside of trust and transparency  protecting the data is, you know, rule number one.  And so we're embracing,  you know, the best practices, you know, Blockchain's other technology is  try to lock down the sensitive information.  But it's a concern everybody  has in the industry.</p><p>WESTIN:  Could we guys actually help you as you delve your business as they  were reassure the consumer is out there that actually there is some  protection.</p><p>ARNOLD:  I think so, I having standards that, you know, all of this  fragmented data can talk to will help not only make the platforms more  robust but, you know, build more consumer confidence.</p><p>STEEL:  So what do you make of Mark Zuckerberg going to Capitol Hill over  the next two days and facing Congress?  So how do you think of this plays  out in that industry?</p><p>ARNOLD:  Well, you know, I think that, you know, people are so used to  using these social platforms, it become such a daily way of life that the  train someone has left the station.  But I think it's all about  transparency.  I think people want to know, what are you doing with my  data?  And then people can make the choice, do they want to share that  information or not.  Are they willing to pray for premium services or is  this going to be app supported?  But I think all the facts are going to  need to be on the table.</p><p>WESTIN:  It's not just about convenience and actually it's also about cost  over all.  We've got a problem in this country as an increasing percentage  of GDP is health care.  Will your approach, if it becomes a standard will  it bend the cost curve?</p><p>ARNOLD:  It will bend the cost curve.  And so we talk a lot about  engagement, how does the application make you feel.  But the key objectives  are, how do you make people more self-aware about their health?  How do you  reduce risk escalation?  How do you not overuse the emergency room?  How do  you optimize provider networks to get the right person to the right doctor?   How do you help people at pharmacy stand which is out of control?  You  know, moving from branded drugs to generic drugs from retial to home  delivery.</p><p>We can get the people on their smart phones at the right moment to help  them make better decisions and how they control their health care which is  ultimately going to reduce the cost.</p><p>STEEL:  What's the biggest health care increase that you can take out?  The  biggest health care cost that you can help us take out?</p><p>ARNOLD:  Well, I think, you know, there's a lot of areas because there's  about eight key objectives that we work on.  And at the first is making  people more self-aware about their health in general.  And we want to keep  the people that are healthy, healthy right.  So we don't want them to turn  into chronic patients for us.  Disease management and lifestyle management,  I think you're going to see a revolution there.</p><p>It's almost going to be as this theory or Alexa which is your coach.  So  instead of somebody sitting on a call center trying to manage you remotely  it's going to feel to that person like you're being coached 24/7, and so  there's all of this data and A.I. and machine learning talk, starts to take  shape of your health.  You're going to be in control like you've never had  before.</p><p>WESTIN:  So finally, what's the biggest advantage you have because you're  up against some pretty big players out there, big pharma, big PBMs, big  health care organizations.  How could you get an advantage?</p><p>ARNOLD:  So we think ours is, you know, everybody talks about being  disruptive.  We think that want to be disruptive but not disenfranchised.   So how do we work with the big health systems?  How do we work with the big  health plan and help them understand the consumer and bring their data to  the palm in that person's hand.  That's where we thrive today is working  with these big organizations, helping them come into the consumerism age.</p><p>STEEL:  All right, Jeff, great to catch up with you.  Thank you so much.   Jeff Arnold, CEO of Sharecare, help start WebMD disrupting the health care  industry.</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JEFFREY ARNOLD, CEO, SHARECARE, IS INTERVIEWED ON BB TV</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">APRIL 09, 2018</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SPEAKERS: JEFFREY ARNOLD, CEO, SHARECARE</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ALIX STEEL, BLOOMBERG NEWS</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DAVID WESTIN, BLOOMBERG NEWS</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[*] DAVID WESTIN, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Technology has become a driving force that is changing the health care area. Sharecare was developed to create a secure place for patients to feel in control of their health and to connect with their doctors.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Since its founding in 2010 Sharecare has raised a total of $350 million in three rounds of financing, partnering with a diverse group of strategic investors including media companies like Discovery Communications, Harpo Productions that's Oprah for those of you who don't know, and First Co Corporation. We welcome now the chairman and co-founder and CEO of Sharecare, Jeff Arnold. So, Jeff, welcome. It's good to have you in Bloomberg.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JEFFREY ARNOLD, CEO, SHARECARE: Thank you.</p><p>WESTIN: And you know this area so well because among others, you were actually were co-founder of WebMD as well, so that we all know about it.</p><p>ARNOLD: Yes.</p><p>WESTIN: Explain to us what exactly is going on as tech meets health care right now? What's the transformation we're watching?</p><p>ARNOLD: Well, I think even 20 years ago when we started WebMD, we thought health need a home page. There needed to be a destination where doctors and patients could go that wasn't so fragmented. Back then, just getting help information not from your doctor was a big deal. But with all these other industries being disrupted, hospitality, transportation, financial services, smart phones being so pervasive now, why can't health care be next?</p><p>And so this idea of all of your health in one place where all the various stakeholders are coming together, health plans, providers, large employers to empower consumers, to take control of their health, to reduce health care cost is I think the timing is now.</p><p>WESTIN: Jeff, we've been hearing about this for some time. And it certainly makes good sense if you won't be keeping scraps of paper and big files. And yet we don't seem to be getting there. What's the resistance? What's between us and really having an electronic way to access our health care data?</p><p>ARNOLD: I think it's the consumer taking control. You know, now we have a smart phone, we have a common platform that we can develop to. But consider the hospital saying, you patient come to my portal and the health plans in, you as my member download my app. It's now about, you know, can you create a health profile on behalf of the person and use the technology to bring the stakeholders to that person's hand.</p><p>ALIX STEEL, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Help guide those portal apps kill me every time. And like 17 is, oh my god. So if you talk about tech and health care, the first thing that come in to your mind is Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and J.P. Morgan.</p><p>ARNOLD: Yes.</p><p>STEEL: What do you think they're going to do for the industry?</p><p>ARNOLD: I think they're creating a catalyst for change. So, you know, all the incumbents have, you know, woke up and said, you know, we have to embrace technology, we have to embrace consumerism and we need to do things differently. I think the winner in this phase is whose going to be able to do manage the data, right.</p><p>So you have self-reported data, direct -- device driven, claims driven data, social determinants of health data and medical records. It's also going to come down to who can drive engagement, who can get the person to actually take that first step and take control of their health? And then lastly, there'll be awareness. You know, how do these new platforms make people feel?</p><p>WESTIN: When you tell like what kind of do (ph), we're pretty sensitive in general about our health care data. How are you going to guarantee that it's not going to be hacked or it's not going to be shared because we have a lot of digital companies right now who are under siege most recently Facebook.</p><p>ARNOLD: Well, I think in health, trust is paramount. So what we try to do in health care is try to build your health profile, somewhere to help linked in your business profile. But empower the consumer to own their data. So the health plan doesn't own the data, the PBM doesn't own the data. The health EMR system doesn't own the data. The person does. The person controls the permissions. So the same way they can turn on and off WiFi. They can exchange their medical records.</p><p>So trust is everything. But I think us breaking through and saying it's not the insurance company that owns the data, the person owns the data. If the person changes health plans, the data goes with them. If the person changes doctors, the data goes with them.</p><p>STEEL: But you've got to protect it. What do you think the threat is? We're going to see some federal regulation on big tech companies that would encompass something that you do.</p><p>ARNOLD: Well, I think, you know, outside of trust and transparency protecting the data is, you know, rule number one. And so we're embracing, you know, the best practices, you know, Blockchain's other technology is try to lock down the sensitive information. But it's a concern everybody has in the industry.</p><p>WESTIN: Could we guys actually help you as you delve your business as they were reassure the consumer is out there that actually there is some protection.</p><p>ARNOLD: I think so, I having standards that, you know, all of this fragmented data can talk to will help not only make the platforms more robust but, you know, build more consumer confidence.</p><p>STEEL: So what do you make of Mark Zuckerberg going to Capitol Hill over the next two days and facing Congress? So how do you think of this plays out in that industry?</p><p>ARNOLD: Well, you know, I think that, you know, people are so used to using these social platforms, it become such a daily way of life that the train someone has left the station. But I think it's all about transparency. I think people want to know, what are you doing with my data? And then people can make the choice, do they want to share that information or not. Are they willing to pray for premium services or is this going to be app supported? But I think all the facts are going to need to be on the table.</p><p>WESTIN: It's not just about convenience and actually it's also about cost over all. We've got a problem in this country as an increasing percentage of GDP is health care. Will your approach, if it becomes a standard will it bend the cost curve?</p><p>ARNOLD: It will bend the cost curve. And so we talk a lot about engagement, how does the application make you feel. But the key objectives are, how do you make people more self-aware about their health? How do you reduce risk escalation? How do you not overuse the emergency room? How do you optimize provider networks to get the right person to the right doctor? How do you help people at pharmacy stand which is out of control? You know, moving from branded drugs to generic drugs from retial to home delivery.</p><p>We can get the people on their smart phones at the right moment to help them make better decisions and how they control their health care which is ultimately going to reduce the cost.</p><p>STEEL: What's the biggest health care increase that you can take out? The biggest health care cost that you can help us take out?</p><p>ARNOLD: Well, I think, you know, there's a lot of areas because there's about eight key objectives that we work on. And at the first is making people more self-aware about their health in general. And we want to keep the people that are healthy, healthy right. So we don't want them to turn into chronic patients for us. Disease management and lifestyle management, I think you're going to see a revolution there.</p><p>It's almost going to be as this theory or Alexa which is your coach. So instead of somebody sitting on a call center trying to manage you remotely it's going to feel to that person like you're being coached 24/7, and so there's all of this data and A.I. and machine learning talk, starts to take shape of your health. You're going to be in control like you've never had before.</p><p>WESTIN: So finally, what's the biggest advantage you have because you're up against some pretty big players out there, big pharma, big PBMs, big health care organizations. How could you get an advantage?</p><p>ARNOLD: So we think ours is, you know, everybody talks about being disruptive. We think that want to be disruptive but not disenfranchised. So how do we work with the big health systems? How do we work with the big health plan and help them understand the consumer and bring their data to the palm in that person's hand. That's where we thrive today is working with these big organizations, helping them come into the consumerism age.</p><p>STEEL: All right, Jeff, great to catch up with you. Thank you so much. Jeff Arnold, CEO of Sharecare, help start WebMD disrupting the health care industry.</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Could we have a lot more fiscal stimulus, could that make a difference actually in the markets?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOLOMON</emphasis>:  It would be tax cuts 2.0, I think you'd have a lot more stimulus. I do think that they do much more aggressive on things like trade policy. I do think that would happen, no question about it.  </p><p>      If the Republican state both it'll be business as usual and we continue to have the regular tour rollbacks, probably accelerates into 2020.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WESTIN</emphasis>:  That's at the marco level, what about a specific sector take pharmaceuticals.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOLOMON</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WESTIN</emphasis>:  Because some people think that that someplace, that President Trump could be align with the Democrats on prescription drug prices.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOLOMON</emphasis>:  Yes, I think that's a big pharma, you have to be worried. If you have both houses to flip Democratic then I think you're what we'll see. One of the first things we'll see is we'll see drug pricing policy being discussed.  </p><p>      I still think it's going to be difficult to have a national drug rising policy, but there'll be a lot of hearings and big pharma executives will be dragged onto the floor. And I think there the President has had said pretty clearly he'd like to try do something.  </p><p>      I also think that pharma is ready for this, though. So let's be really clear. You've got a strategy, I think you're already starting to see industry began to take matters into its own hands and anticipation of something like this because it something that the industry has been talking about and wrestling with for a long time.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEEL</emphasis>:  Jeffrey, how are you position in for 2019? Like where do you think you're going to see the most activity? What's going to be the risk that you're looking for?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOLOMON</emphasis>:  So we still think there's some pretty big tailwinds behind to our discovery early stage, biotech and biopharma.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEEL</emphasis>:  Doesn't have to be biotech be anywhere --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOLOMON</emphasis>:  Yes. I'm saying even with the drug pricing juxtopition, I still think -- we think there's a lot innovation there to happen. Obviously we've bee very involve in the cannabis area and we actually think that if you look at a lot state houses and you look at a lot of the national polling.  </p><p>      I think there's a real push by the populist to figure out a way to have a national cannabis policy. And so, we would expect that at some point over the next two years that comes into play, certainly of both Houses with Democratic and you got a lot of statehouses that flip, there'll be a lot more of that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WESTIN</emphasis>:  So you think they actually could repeal the federal statute on cannabis?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOLOMON</emphasis>:  I think it's on the table. The Trump Administration hasn't exactly been hard line on this, I think that attorney general has been hard line on this but I'm not sure how much longer he stays around after the turn, and if that happens. There's a possibility. I would just say it opens it up and certainly if you watch with happening in Canada and you watch what happening in globally, this is a real business.  </p><p>      And so, we're continuing to think that over the next few years this plays out in a positive way.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEEL</emphasis>:  What do you think?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOLOMON</emphasis>:  I actually agree with that. I think that there's a big dichotomy between big banks and the rest of us. And I think if you're in the big bank game, you've got a lot more to worry about for a regulatory standpoint. I also think in big tech you have to worry about.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEEL</emphasis>:  I was just going to ask some more (ph) investigation.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOLOMON</emphasis>:  I think big tech has a lot to worry about both from Democrats and Republicans. And I would say regardless of the outcome here, I would expect to see more -- more investigation or more hearing around privacy and cyber security and all of these things that I think are impacting your average American.  </p><p>      And so, there I think Maxine Waters has been pretty clear that that something that she want's to do. And I think that they won't get a lot of push back from their Republicans on that either.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEEL</emphasis>:  Yes, all right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WESTIN</emphasis>:  So Jeffrey, at the same time we had Peter Mandelson saying that we had Nigel Farage over at London saying does (ph) agree of Brexit at all because they really caving in. What's your view on what's going to happen and how does it affect your business?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOLOMON</emphasis>:  So I think if you're running a business there, you've got to consider a hard Brexit. That's our default, right. If that happens, you have to be repaired for that. So, it's even harder probable lies it. But if it happens, if there's a one percent or two percent or five percent chance that it happens, you have to be prepared for that.  </p><p>      So, I think a lot of folks I know are really saying, listen we've got to prepare for a hard Brexit if it acts away from that, then we can adjust. But if you don't prepare for hard Brexit then I think you'll probably -- you're making be a big mistake.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEEL</emphasis>:  The people that you talk to in clients, how do they prepare for hard Brexit?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOLOMON</emphasis>:  Yes. A lot of it is moving people into areas where you can engage with the European Union. I think a lot of folks are looking at places where there's already financial infrastructure and support, a lot of people at Luxembourg, a lot of people are moving to the Republic of Ireland in places that are likely to end up in a much more favorable engagement.  </p><p>      And then you have to your London just be running as what any other place in the world. London and U.K. will be set of regimes and the U.E will be another and you'll have to have multiple offices in order to handle that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEEL</emphasis>:  Because I feel like the narrative when Brexit happen was that, if it's a hard Brexit everything is off like the world is going to hell. It's going to be terrible. It'll be awful (ph). But with the way you're talking it seems like clients are already working towards some kind of hard Brexit and it's not breaking the system.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOLOMON</emphasis>:  I think that it depends on what business is you're in. So when we look at it. We cover Europe out of London. But is it really going to change. It'll be harder for people to move. We're still going to have most of our people in London and calling on European clients to say when we have people in New York calling European clients.  </p><p>      So that doesn't change much. But I think things like funding slows, if you're in the banking system there's a lot more challenges around that. We're on the side of that a little bit more. We're not really in the deposit taking mode or like that. If you're in that mode, I think it much more complicated.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CANTRILL</emphasis>:  So yes, there's a lot of uncertainly. We won't we be surprise if the deadline is pushed out even further.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOLOMON</emphasis>:  Yes. But look what happen with MiFID II, that's a smaller microcosmos of what happened. So people put their head in the sand on MiFID II until it absolute certainly. And then all of sudden people scramble to figure out how to do MiFID II. And the regulators ultimately, backing away in terms of implementation and penalties and things like that so that people could get their act together.  </p><p>      But for a long time people just ignore it like it wasn't going to happen. And so, again I don't want to equate the two because I think Brexit has much more complicated thing in MiFID II. But we all adjusted to MiFID II and we had business plans and contingencies ready to go.  </p><p>      And so, I think might be that was a dry run.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEEL</emphasis>:  Well, there's a narrative in the market though that it is enough financial pressure on the U.K. or the E.U. to actually make a deal. We've heard the same thing with Italy in terms of their budget deficit to your point. You're not going to make a deal into your fear literally in the fire.  </p><p>      So, that is true. And I think if you look at what's really driving Brexit, it's really not economic in many instances. It's immigration and social. And these things ebb and flow, the impetus may be to bring about Brexit and to get the vote out a couple of years ago was really at the height of this immigration crisis that was happening, this migration was happening for the Middle East.  </p><p>      Like, is that moderates and people adjust to the new normal, does Britain take a step back and say well, maybe it's not as bad as we thought it was going to be and I think the border with Ireland is the really -- there are not a lot of people who want to go back to a hard border with Ireland.  </p><p>      And so, I'm taking a look at the social aspects of this and try to take my cues there rather than economic because let's acknowledge it. It is way better for Britain and way better in the E.U.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEEL</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOLOMON</emphasis>:  From economic standpoint if things stay as is. It just the social issues and how can you bridge that gap.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEEL</emphasis>:  So we're going to leave it there. And much come with Libby Cantrill with PIMCO and Jeffrey Solomon of Cowen. This is Bloomberg.  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEEL</emphasis>:  And look at that. Look who we have, it so happen that we have Jeffrey Solomon of Cowen, so in pivoting real quickly up is SKIP McGee there (ph). What can opportunity set did you see there?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOLOMON</emphasis>:  Well, I think there's a tremendous amount of opportunity of opportunity both to provide financial, advice in financing. And I think this is -- what were seeing here is that, for us to try to recreate the kind of financial advice that Skip McGee and Chris Winchenbaugh team can do is just -- it would be really hard for us to do that. They're excellent at it.  </p><p>      And we're excellent into capital raising and financing and resurge and sales and trading. And you're not going to create that infrastructure. So for us, there's a national place where we can align with them, to really address the total needs of client in that space.  </p><p>      And it's a great cultural fit because Skip and Chris teams spent a lot of time with Larry Wieseneck who's our Co-President. There's a great cultural. Today, there so were co-pitching and doing things where we can work collectively to solve problems for clients across financing and strategic advice. So, it just makes sense to do that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEEL</emphasis>:  Is that mean that you see more M&amp;A going forward for the space? Debt is still a concern for a lot of them. Is it M&amp;A?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOLOMON</emphasis>:  Yes, I think it could be M&amp;A and I think it can be refinancing. I think this is -- like a lot of businesses that are capital intention, there's always capital raising going on. And I think if you're a manager in that business, you go to look at strategic as well as financing concurrently.  </p><p>      And so, we'll leave it right a full range of services collectively between both of our organization and of course, most of those folks want research coverage and sales and trading and support the after market if you're public.  </p><p>      And that something that we have an excellent footprint in already and we can bring that to bear for a lot of clients.  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WESTIN</emphasis>:  So Jeffrey, as we're resetting our economic relationship, China on its own is resetting its economy. I mean, you see a slow down in GDP growth. They were trying to deleverage. They can't quite afford to do that. What is the risk to global growth overall?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOLOMON</emphasis>:  I actually think it's pretty significant. When you got the two large economist at odds at one another, that's generally not good for global GDP growth. I actually think, China is struggling with meeting domestically and it's one belt one road strategy.  </p><p>      If you think about the amount of capital that it spent in Eastern Europe for example, I don't know how that sustainable if the home economy is really working that well. It turns out that whether you're a sort of plan capital economy or market capital economy, either one.  </p><p>      It's hard to spend money both domestically to fix domestic problems and invest globally to protect your interest. So, that's what the U.S. has been facing over the last view decades, certainly after the financial crisis. It's harder for us to spend money abroad to do Pax Americana when we've got fundamental issues here.  </p><p>      I think China has the same issues because at the end of the day you got to take care of the home front first before you can think about the rest of the world.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WESTIN</emphasis>:  At the same time China again and again has over performed, I mean done better than what we thought they would do.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOLOMON</emphasis>:  Or so they like you to think. I mean I think it's really hard to know.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEEL</emphasis>:  But they do come in and do back stopping. I mean, they made money available to small and medium size businesses. I mean, they use to pop up SOEs like there in there.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOLOMON</emphasis>:  They are in there, just like we're in there with our government propping up our businesses. We do this. It's funny to me, when we had a financial crisis. We propped up steel. We propped up autos. We propped up the financial system like we did it because we needed to.  </p><p>      And they will do it because they may need to. So, I actually don't think there's a tremendous amount of out difference between the way that we approach our businesses in times of stress and the way that they approach their businesses in times of economic stress.  </p><p>      I actually I think it's actually pretty similar.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEEL</emphasis>:  So what does mean for actually business. Like if you ask anyone two years ago in investment banking. They would say cross board or M&amp;A, China buying companies elsewhere whether in Europe and the U.S. was the thing.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOLOMON</emphasis>:  Yes. I was. So we have personal -- first hand experiences as we have a deal to have sell 20 percent of our company to a Chinese private investors, a private company and it was one of the largest oil importers in refiners.  </p><p>      We did it not because we needed the money. We did it because we really thought it was going to give us a window and in doing cross boarder transaction of financing in China with the strategic partner. Today, we can't even find that guy just to be really clear.  </p><p>      Like, they're literally dismantling that his empire, which is huge amounts of money was spent in Eastern Europe with a big, all the old Eastern Bloc nations that part of the one belt, one road strategy. There's a lot of capital was spent there like, I just will say like what we heard 18 months ago and what's actually happening are two very different things.  </p><p>      And we're super thankful that ultimately we didn't do that deal. Because I guess I'm not sure how we would have been able to approach doing business in China given really the bipolar nature of it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CANTRILL</emphasis>:  So it's not to say that they necessarily won't boycott American companies but at this point it's been interesting that they have necessary pulled on that lever yet.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOLOMON</emphasis>:  Yes. I don't disagree with that. I think it's better if we have a more friendly engagement with China, particularly given our current account deficit, right. I think we have to figure out how to create the new balance.  </p><p>      And I've always said that I think tariff is a blunt force instrument to bring people to the table. I think if you're the Trump administration, you're trying to reset the table for global trade. Tariff is a way to bring everybody to the table.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WESTIN</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOLOMON</emphasis>:  That is a strategy in and of itself. But let's face it. If we can figure out what the new normal looks like and create better trade and balance between the two countries, everybody wins. How do we get from here to there? That's the big question.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WESTIN</emphasis>:  If we can, as (INAUDIBLE) phrase there. OK. Libby Cantrill of PIMCO and Jeffrey Solomon of Cowen, thank so much for being with us.  </p><p>      END   </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FMRWRE2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TNW-S441-JDPT-T009-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">345281</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>Financial Markets Regulatory Wire</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DAVID WESTIN, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Welcome now Libby Cantrill, PIMCO's Head of Public Policy and Jeffrey Solomon Cowen CEO.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So, at the same time, if in fact the Republicans took both and that seems unlikely at this point. Could we have a lot more fiscal stimulus, could that make a difference actually in the markets?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JEFFEREY SOLOMON, CEO, COWEN: It would be tax cuts 2.0, I think you'd have a lot more stimulus. I do think that they do much more aggressive on things like trade policy. I do think that would happen, no question about it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">If the Republican state both it'll be business as usual and we continue to have the regular tour rollbacks, probably accelerates into 2020.</p><p>WESTIN: That's at the marco level, what about a specific sector take pharmaceuticals.</p><p>SOLOMON: Yes.</p><p>WESTIN: Because some people think that that someplace, that President Trump could be align with the Democrats on prescription drug prices.</p><p>SOLOMON: Yes, I think that's a big pharma, you have to be worried. If you have both houses to flip Democratic then I think you're what we'll see. One of the first things we'll see is we'll see drug pricing policy being discussed.</p><p>I still think it's going to be difficult to have a national drug rising policy, but there'll be a lot of hearings and big pharma executives will be dragged onto the floor. And I think there the President has had said pretty clearly he'd like to try do something.</p><p>I also think that pharma is ready for this, though. So let's be really clear. You've got a strategy, I think you're already starting to see industry began to take matters into its own hands and anticipation of something like this because it something that the industry has been talking about and wrestling with for a long time.</p><p>ALIX STEEL, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Jeffrey, how are you position in for 2019? Like where do you think you're going to see the most activity? What's going to be the risk that you're looking for?</p><p>SOLOMON: So we still think there's some pretty big tailwinds behind to our discovery early stage, biotech and biopharma.</p><p>STEEL: Doesn't have to be biotech be anywhere --</p><p>SOLOMON: Yes. I'm saying even with the drug pricing juxtopition, I still think -- we think there's a lot innovation there to happen. Obviously we've bee very involve in the cannabis area and we actually think that if you look at a lot state houses and you look at a lot of the national polling.</p><p>I think there's a real push by the populist to figure out a way to have a national cannabis policy. And so, we would expect that at some point over the next two years that comes into play, certainly of both Houses with Democratic and you got a lot of statehouses that flip, there'll be a lot more of that.</p><p>WESTIN: So you think they actually could repeal the federal statute on cannabis?</p><p>SOLOMON: I think it's on the table. The Trump Administration hasn't exactly been hard line on this, I think that attorney general has been hard line on this but I'm not sure how much longer he stays around after the turn, and if that happens. There's a possibility. I would just say it opens it up and certainly if you watch with happening in Canada and you watch what happening in globally, this is a real business.</p><p>And so, we're continuing to think that over the next few years this plays out in a positive way.</p><p>STEEL: What do you think?</p><p>SOLOMON: I actually agree with that. I think that there's a big dichotomy between big banks and the rest of us. And I think if you're in the big bank game, you've got a lot more to worry about for a regulatory standpoint. I also think in big tech you have to worry about.</p><p>STEEL: I was just going to ask some more (ph) investigation.</p><p>SOLOMON: I think big tech has a lot to worry about both from Democrats and Republicans. And I would say regardless of the outcome here, I would expect to see more -- more investigation or more hearing around privacy and cyber security and all of these things that I think are impacting your average American.</p><p>And so, there I think Maxine Waters has been pretty clear that that something that she want's to do. And I think that they won't get a lot of push back from their Republicans on that either.</p><p>STEEL: Yes, all right.</p><p>WESTIN: So Jeffrey, at the same time we had Peter Mandelson saying that we had Nigel Farage over at London saying does (ph) agree of Brexit at all because they really caving in. What's your view on what's going to happen and how does it affect your business?</p><p>SOLOMON: So I think if you're running a business there, you've got to consider a hard Brexit. That's our default, right. If that happens, you have to be repaired for that. So, it's even harder probable lies it. But if it happens, if there's a one percent or two percent or five percent chance that it happens, you have to be prepared for that.</p><p>So, I think a lot of folks I know are really saying, listen we've got to prepare for a hard Brexit if it acts away from that, then we can adjust. But if you don't prepare for hard Brexit then I think you'll probably -- you're making be a big mistake.</p><p>STEEL: The people that you talk to in clients, how do they prepare for hard Brexit?</p><p>SOLOMON: Yes. A lot of it is moving people into areas where you can engage with the European Union. I think a lot of folks are looking at places where there's already financial infrastructure and support, a lot of people at Luxembourg, a lot of people are moving to the Republic of Ireland in places that are likely to end up in a much more favorable engagement.</p><p>And then you have to your London just be running as what any other place in the world. London and U.K. will be set of regimes and the U.E will be another and you'll have to have multiple offices in order to handle that.</p><p>STEEL: Because I feel like the narrative when Brexit happen was that, if it's a hard Brexit everything is off like the world is going to hell. It's going to be terrible. It'll be awful (ph). But with the way you're talking it seems like clients are already working towards some kind of hard Brexit and it's not breaking the system.</p><p>SOLOMON: I think that it depends on what business is you're in. So when we look at it. We cover Europe out of London. But is it really going to change. It'll be harder for people to move. We're still going to have most of our people in London and calling on European clients to say when we have people in New York calling European clients.</p><p>So that doesn't change much. But I think things like funding slows, if you're in the banking system there's a lot more challenges around that. We're on the side of that a little bit more. We're not really in the deposit taking mode or like that. If you're in that mode, I think it much more complicated.</p><p>LIBBY CANTRILL, HEAD OF PUBLIC POLICY FOR PIMCO: So yes, there's a lot of uncertainly. We won't we be surprise if the deadline is pushed out even further.</p><p>SOLOMON: Yes. But look what happen with MiFID II, that's a smaller microcosmos of what happened. So people put their head in the sand on MiFID II until it absolute certainly. And then all of sudden people scramble to figure out how to do MiFID II. And the regulators ultimately, backing away in terms of implementation and penalties and things like that so that people could get their act together.</p><p>But for a long time people just ignore it like it wasn't going to happen. And so, again I don't want to equate the two because I think Brexit has much more complicated thing in MiFID II. But we all adjusted to MiFID II and we had business plans and contingencies ready to go.</p><p>And so, I think might be that was a dry run.</p><p>STEEL: Well, there's a narrative in the market though that it is enough financial pressure on the U.K. or the E.U. to actually make a deal. We've heard the same thing with Italy in terms of their budget deficit to your point. You're not going to make a deal into your fear literally in the fire.</p><p>So, that is true. And I think if you look at what's really driving Brexit, it's really not economic in many instances. It's immigration and social. And these things ebb and flow, the impetus may be to bring about Brexit and to get the vote out a couple of years ago was really at the height of this immigration crisis that was happening, this migration was happening for the Middle East.</p><p>Like, is that moderates and people adjust to the new normal, does Britain take a step back and say well, maybe it's not as bad as we thought it was going to be and I think the border with Ireland is the really -- there are not a lot of people who want to go back to a hard border with Ireland.</p><p>And so, I'm taking a look at the social aspects of this and try to take my cues there rather than economic because let's acknowledge it. It is way better for Britain and way better in the E.U.</p><p>STEEL: Right.</p><p>SOLOMON: From economic standpoint if things stay as is. It just the social issues and how can you bridge that gap.</p><p>STEEL: So we're going to leave it there. And much come with Libby Cantrill with PIMCO and Jeffrey Solomon of Cowen. This is Bloomberg.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>STEEL: And look at that. Look who we have, it so happen that we have Jeffrey Solomon of Cowen, so in pivoting real quickly up is SKIP McGee there (ph). What can opportunity set did you see there?</p><p>SOLOMON: Well, I think there's a tremendous amount of opportunity of opportunity both to provide financial, advice in financing. And I think this is -- what were seeing here is that, for us to try to recreate the kind of financial advice that Skip McGee and Chris Winchenbaugh team can do is just -- it would be really hard for us to do that. They're excellent at it.</p><p>And we're excellent into capital raising and financing and resurge and sales and trading. And you're not going to create that infrastructure. So for us, there's a national place where we can align with them, to really address the total needs of client in that space.</p><p>And it's a great cultural fit because Skip and Chris teams spent a lot of time with Larry Wieseneck who's our Co-President. There's a great cultural. Today, there so were co-pitching and doing things where we can work collectively to solve problems for clients across financing and strategic advice. So, it just makes sense to do that.</p><p>STEEL: Is that mean that you see more M&amp;A going forward for the space? Debt is still a concern for a lot of them. Is it M&amp;A?</p><p>SOLOMON: Yes, I think it could be M&amp;A and I think it can be refinancing. I think this is -- like a lot of businesses that are capital intention, there's always capital raising going on. And I think if you're a manager in that business, you go to look at strategic as well as financing concurrently.</p><p>And so, we'll leave it right a full range of services collectively between both of our organization and of course, most of those folks want research coverage and sales and trading and support the after market if you're public.</p><p>And that something that we have an excellent footprint in already and we can bring that to bear for a lot of clients.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>WESTIN: So Jeffrey, as we're resetting our economic relationship, China on its own is resetting its economy. I mean, you see a slow down in GDP growth. They were trying to deleverage. They can't quite afford to do that. What is the risk to global growth overall?</p><p>SOLOMON: I actually think it's pretty significant. When you got the two large economist at odds at one another, that's generally not good for global GDP growth. I actually think, China is struggling with meeting domestically and it's one belt one road strategy.</p><p>If you think about the amount of capital that it spent in Eastern Europe for example, I don't know how that sustainable if the home economy is really working that well. It turns out that whether you're a sort of plan capital economy or market capital economy, either one.</p><p>It's hard to spend money both domestically to fix domestic problems and invest globally to protect your interest. So, that's what the U.S. has been facing over the last view decades, certainly after the financial crisis. It's harder for us to spend money abroad to do Pax Americana when we've got fundamental issues here.</p><p>I think China has the same issues because at the end of the day you got to take care of the home front first before you can think about the rest of the world.</p><p>WESTIN: At the same time China again and again has over performed, I mean done better than what we thought they would do.</p><p>SOLOMON: Or so they like you to think. I mean I think it's really hard to know.</p><p>STEEL: But they do come in and do back stopping. I mean, they made money available to small and medium size businesses. I mean, they use to pop up SOEs like there in there.</p><p>SOLOMON: They are in there, just like we're in there with our government propping up our businesses. We do this. It's funny to me, when we had a financial crisis. We propped up steel. We propped up autos. We propped up the financial system like we did it because we needed to.</p><p>And they will do it because they may need to. So, I actually don't think there's a tremendous amount of out difference between the way that we approach our businesses in times of stress and the way that they approach their businesses in times of economic stress.</p><p>I actually I think it's actually pretty similar.</p><p>STEEL: So what does mean for actually business. Like if you ask anyone two years ago in investment banking. They would say cross board or M&amp;A, China buying companies elsewhere whether in Europe and the U.S. was the thing.</p><p>SOLOMON: Yes. I was. So we have personal -- first hand experiences as we have a deal to have sell 20 percent of our company to a Chinese private investors, a private company and it was one of the largest oil importers in refiners.</p><p>We did it not because we needed the money. We did it because we really thought it was going to give us a window and in doing cross boarder transaction of financing in China with the strategic partner. Today, we can't even find that guy just to be really clear.</p><p>Like, they're literally dismantling that his empire, which is huge amounts of money was spent in Eastern Europe with a big, all the old Eastern Bloc nations that part of the one belt, one road strategy. There's a lot of capital was spent there like, I just will say like what we heard 18 months ago and what's actually happening are two very different things.</p><p>And we're super thankful that ultimately we didn't do that deal. Because I guess I'm not sure how we would have been able to approach doing business in China given really the bipolar nature of it.</p><p>CANTRILL: So it's not to say that they necessarily won't boycott American companies but at this point it's been interesting that they have necessary pulled on that lever yet.</p><p>SOLOMON: Yes. I don't disagree with that. I think it's better if we have a more friendly engagement with China, particularly given our current account deficit, right. I think we have to figure out how to create the new balance.</p><p>And I've always said that I think tariff is a blunt force instrument to bring people to the table. I think if you're the Trump administration, you're trying to reset the table for global trade. Tariff is a way to bring everybody to the table.</p><p>WESTIN: Yes.</p><p>SOLOMON: That is a strategy in and of itself. But let's face it. If we can figure out what the new normal looks like and create better trade and balance between the two countries, everybody wins. How do we get from here to there? That's the big question.</p><p>WESTIN: If we can, as (INAUDIBLE) phrase there. OK. Libby Cantrill of PIMCO and Jeffrey Solomon of Cowen, thank so much for being with us.</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its  accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> DAVID WESTIN, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  Welcome now Libby Cantrill, PIMCO's Head  of Public Policy and Jeffrey Solomon Cowen CEO.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> So, at the same time, if in fact the Republicans took both and that seems  unlikely at this point.  Could we have a lot more fiscal stimulus, could  that make a difference actually in the markets?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> JEFFEREY SOLOMON, CEO, COWEN:  It would be tax cuts 2.0, I think you'd have  a lot more stimulus.  I do think that they do much more aggressive on  things like trade policy.  I do think that would happen, no question about  it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> If the Republican state both it'll be business as usual and we continue to  have the regular tour rollbacks, probably accelerates into 2020.</p><p> WESTIN:  That's at the marco level, what about a specific sector take  pharmaceuticals.</p><p> SOLOMON:  Yes.</p><p> WESTIN:  Because some people think that that someplace, that President  Trump could be align with the Democrats on prescription drug prices.</p><p> SOLOMON:  Yes, I think that's a big pharma, you have to be worried.  If you  have both houses to flip Democratic then I think you're what we'll see.   One of the first things we'll see is we'll see drug pricing policy being  discussed.</p><p> I still think it's going to be difficult to have a national drug rising  policy, but there'll be a lot of hearings and big pharma executives will be  dragged onto the floor.  And I think there the President has had said  pretty clearly he'd like to try do something.</p><p> I also think that pharma is ready for this, though.  So let's be really  clear.  You've got a strategy, I think you're already starting to see  industry began to take matters into its own hands and anticipation of  something like this because it something that the industry has been talking  about and wrestling with for a long time.</p><p> ALIX STEEL, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  Jeffrey, how are you position in for 2019?   Like where do you think you're going to see the most activity?  What's  going to be the risk that you're looking for?</p><p> SOLOMON:  So we still think there's some pretty big tailwinds behind to our  discovery early stage, biotech and biopharma.</p><p> STEEL:  Doesn't have to be biotech be anywhere --</p><p> SOLOMON:  Yes.  I'm saying even with the drug pricing juxtopition, I still  think -- we think there's a lot innovation there to happen.  Obviously  we've bee very involve in the cannabis area and we actually think that if  you look at a lot state houses and you look at a lot of the national  polling.</p><p> I think there's a real push by the populist to figure out a way to have a  national cannabis policy.  And so, we would expect that at some point over  the next two years that comes into play, certainly of both Houses with  Democratic and you got a lot of statehouses that flip, there'll be a lot  more of that.</p><p> WESTIN:  So you think they actually could repeal the federal statute on  cannabis?</p><p> SOLOMON:  I think it's on the table.  The Trump Administration hasn't  exactly been hard line on this, I think that attorney general has been hard  line on this but I'm not sure how much longer he stays around after the  turn, and if that happens.  There's a possibility.  I would just say it  opens it up and certainly if you watch with happening in Canada and you  watch what happening in globally, this is a real business.</p><p> And so, we're continuing to think that over the next few years this plays  out in a positive way.</p><p> STEEL:  What do you think?</p><p> SOLOMON:  I actually agree with that.  I think that there's a big dichotomy  between big banks and the rest of us.  And I think if you're in the big  bank game, you've got a lot more to worry about for a regulatory  standpoint.  I also think in big tech you have to worry about.</p><p> STEEL:  I was just going to ask some more (ph) investigation.</p><p> SOLOMON:  I think big tech has a lot to worry about both from Democrats and  Republicans.  And I would say regardless of the outcome here, I would  expect to see more -- more investigation or more hearing around privacy and  cyber security and all of these things that I think are impacting your  average American.</p><p> And so, there I think Maxine Waters has been pretty clear that that  something that she want's to do.  And I think that they won't get a lot of  push back from their Republicans on that either.</p><p> STEEL:  Yes, all right.</p><p> WESTIN:  So Jeffrey, at the same time we had Peter Mandelson saying that we  had Nigel Farage over at London saying does (ph) agree of Brexit at all  because they really caving in.  What's your view on what's going to happen  and how does it affect your business?</p><p> SOLOMON:  So I think if you're running a business there, you've got to  consider a hard Brexit.  That's our default, right.  If that happens, you  have to be repaired for that.  So, it's even harder probable lies it.  But  if it happens, if there's a one percent or two percent or five percent  chance that it happens, you have to be prepared for that.</p><p> So, I think a lot of folks I know are really saying, listen we've got to  prepare for a hard Brexit if it acts away from that, then we can adjust.   But if you don't prepare for hard Brexit then I think you'll probably --  you're making be a big mistake.</p><p> STEEL:  The people that you talk to in clients, how do they prepare for  hard Brexit?</p><p> SOLOMON:  Yes.  A lot of it is moving people into areas where you can  engage with the European Union.  I think a lot of folks are looking at  places where there's already financial infrastructure and support, a lot of  people at Luxembourg, a lot of people are moving to the Republic of Ireland  in places that are likely to end up in a much more favorable engagement.</p><p> And then you have to your London just be running as what any other place in  the world.  London and U.K. will be set of regimes and the U.E will be  another and you'll have to have multiple offices in order to handle that.</p><p> STEEL:  Because I feel like the narrative when Brexit happen was that, if  it's a hard Brexit everything is off like the world is going to hell.  It's  going to be terrible.  It'll be awful (ph).  But with the way you're  talking it seems like clients are already working towards some kind of hard  Brexit and it's not breaking the system.</p><p> SOLOMON:  I think that it depends on what business is you're in.  So when  we look at it.  We cover Europe out of London.  But is it really going to  change.  It'll be harder for people to move.  We're still going to have  most of our people in London and calling on European clients to say when we  have people in New York calling European clients.</p><p> So that doesn't change much.  But I think things like funding slows, if  you're in the banking system there's a lot more challenges around that.   We're on the side of that a little bit more.  We're not really in the  deposit taking mode or like that.  If you're in that mode, I think it much  more complicated.</p><p> LIBBY CANTRILL, HEAD OF PUBLIC POLICY FOR PIMCO:  So yes, there's a lot of  uncertainly.  We won't we be surprise if the deadline is pushed out even  further.</p><p> SOLOMON:  Yes.  But look what happen with MiFID II, that's a smaller  microcosmos of what happened.  So people put their head in the sand on  MiFID II until it absolute certainly.  And then all of sudden people  scramble to figure out how to do MiFID II.  And the regulators ultimately,  backing away in terms of implementation and penalties and things like that  so that people could get their act together.</p><p> But for a long time people just ignore it like it wasn't going to happen.   And so, again I don't want to equate the two because I think Brexit has  much more complicated thing in MiFID II.  But we all adjusted to MiFID II  and we had business plans and contingencies ready to go.</p><p> And so, I think might be that was a dry run.</p><p> STEEL:  Well, there's a narrative in the market though that it is enough  financial pressure on the U.K. or the E.U. to actually make a deal.  We've  heard the same thing with Italy in terms of their budget deficit to your  point.  You're not going to make a deal into your fear literally in the  fire.</p><p> So, that is true.  And I think if you look at what's really driving Brexit,  it's really not economic in many instances.  It's immigration and social.   And these things ebb and flow, the impetus may be to bring about Brexit and  to get the vote out a couple of years ago was really at the height of this  immigration crisis that was happening, this migration was happening for the  Middle East.</p><p> Like, is that moderates and people adjust to the new normal, does Britain  take a step back and say well, maybe it's not as bad as we thought it was  going to be and I think the border with Ireland is the really -- there are  not a lot of people who want to go back to a hard border with Ireland.</p><p> And so, I'm taking a look at the social aspects of this and try to take my  cues there rather than economic because let's acknowledge it.  It is way  better for Britain and way better in the E.U.</p><p> STEEL:  Right.</p><p> SOLOMON: From economic standpoint if things stay as is.  It just the social  issues and how can you bridge that gap.</p><p> STEEL:  So we're going to leave it there.  And much come with Libby  Cantrill with PIMCO and Jeffrey Solomon of Cowen.  This is Bloomberg.</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> STEEL:  And look at that.  Look who we have, it so happen that we have  Jeffrey Solomon of Cowen, so in pivoting real quickly up is SKIP McGee  there (ph).  What can opportunity set did you see there?</p><p> SOLOMON:  Well, I think there's a tremendous amount of opportunity of  opportunity both to provide financial, advice in financing.  And I think  this is -- what were seeing here is that, for us to try to recreate the  kind of financial advice that Skip McGee and Chris Winchenbaugh team can do  is just -- it would be really hard for us to do that.  They're excellent at  it.</p><p> And we're excellent into capital raising and financing and resurge and  sales and trading.  And you're not going to create that infrastructure.  So  for us, there's a national place where we can align with them, to really  address the total needs of client in that space.</p><p> And it's a great cultural fit because Skip and Chris teams spent a lot of  time with Larry Wieseneck who's our Co-President.  There's a great  cultural.  Today, there so were co-pitching and doing things where we can  work collectively to solve problems for clients across financing and  strategic advice.  So, it just makes sense to do that.</p><p> STEEL:  Is that mean that you see more M&amp;A going forward for the space?   Debt is still a concern for a lot of them.  Is it M&amp;A?</p><p> SOLOMON:  Yes, I think it could be M&amp;A and I think it can be refinancing.   I think this is -- like a lot of businesses that are capital intention,  there's always capital raising going on.  And I think if you're a manager  in that business, you go to look at strategic as well as financing  concurrently.</p><p> And so, we'll leave it right a full range of services collectively between  both of our organization and of course, most of those folks want research  coverage and sales and trading and support the after market if you're  public.</p><p> And that something that we have an excellent footprint in already and we  can bring that to bear for a lot of clients.</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> WESTIN:  So Jeffrey, as we're resetting our economic relationship, China on  its own is resetting its economy.  I mean, you see a slow down in GDP  growth.  They were trying to deleverage.  They can't quite afford to do  that.  What is the risk to global growth overall?</p><p> SOLOMON:  I actually think it's pretty significant.  When you got the two  large economist at odds at one another, that's generally not good for  global GDP growth.  I actually think, China is struggling with meeting  domestically and it's one belt one road strategy.</p><p> If you think about the amount of capital that it spent in Eastern Europe  for example, I don't know how that sustainable if the home economy is  really working that well.  It turns out that whether you're a sort of plan  capital economy or market capital economy, either one.</p><p> It's hard to spend money both domestically to fix domestic problems and  invest globally to protect your interest.  So, that's what the U.S. has  been facing over the last view decades, certainly after the financial  crisis.  It's harder for us to spend money abroad to do Pax Americana when  we've got fundamental issues here.</p><p> I think China has the same issues because at the end of the day you got to  take care of the home front first before you can think about the rest of  the world.</p><p> WESTIN:  At the same time China again and again has over performed, I mean  done better than what we thought they would do.</p><p> SOLOMON:  Or so they like you to think.  I mean I think it's really hard to  know.</p><p> STEEL:  But they do come in and do back stopping.  I mean, they made money  available to small and medium size businesses.  I mean, they use to pop up  SOEs like there in there.</p><p> SOLOMON:  They are in there, just like we're in there with our government  propping up our businesses.  We do this.  It's funny to me, when we had a  financial crisis.  We propped up steel.  We propped up autos.  We propped  up the financial system like we did it because we needed to.</p><p> And they will do it because they may need to.  So, I actually don't think  there's a tremendous amount of out difference between the way that we  approach our businesses in times of stress and the way that they approach  their businesses in times of economic stress.</p><p> I actually I think it's actually pretty similar.</p><p> STEEL:  So what does mean for actually business.  Like if you ask anyone  two years ago in investment banking.  They would say cross board or M&amp;A,  China buying companies elsewhere whether in Europe and the U.S. was the  thing.</p><p> SOLOMON:  Yes.  I was.  So we have personal -- first hand experiences as we  have a deal to have sell 20 percent of our company to a Chinese private  investors, a private company and it was one of the largest oil importers in  refiners.</p><p> We did it not because we needed the money.  We did it because we really  thought it was going to give us a window and in doing cross boarder  transaction of financing in China with the strategic partner.  Today, we  can't even find that guy just to be really clear.</p><p> Like, they're literally dismantling that his empire, which is huge amounts  of money was spent in Eastern Europe with a big, all the old Eastern Bloc  nations that part of the one belt, one road strategy.  There's a lot of  capital was spent there like, I just will say like what we heard 18 months  ago and what's actually happening are two very different things.</p><p> And we're super thankful that ultimately we didn't do that deal.  Because I  guess I'm not sure how we would have been able to approach doing business  in China given really the bipolar nature of it.</p><p> CANTRILL:  So it's not to say that they necessarily won't boycott American  companies but at this point it's been interesting that they have necessary  pulled on that lever yet.</p><p> SOLOMON:  Yes.  I don't disagree with that.  I think it's better if we have  a more friendly engagement with China, particularly given our current  account deficit, right.  I think we have to figure out how to create the  new balance.</p><p> And I've always said that I think tariff is a blunt force instrument to  bring people to the table.  I think if you're the Trump administration,  you're trying to reset the table for global trade.  Tariff is a way to  bring everybody to the table.</p><p> WESTIN:  Yes.</p><p> SOLOMON:  That is a strategy in and of itself.  But let's face it.  If we  can figure out what the new normal looks like and create better trade and  balance between the two countries, everybody wins.  How do we get from here  to there?  That's the big question.</p><p> WESTIN:  If we can, as (INAUDIBLE) phrase there.  OK.  Libby Cantrill of  PIMCO and Jeffrey Solomon of Cowen, thank so much for being with us.</p><p> ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p> THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DAVID WESTIN, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Welcome now Libby Cantrill, PIMCO's Head of Public Policy and Jeffrey Solomon Cowen CEO.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So, at the same time, if in fact the Republicans took both and that seems unlikely at this point. Could we have a lot more fiscal stimulus, could that make a difference actually in the markets?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JEFFEREY SOLOMON, CEO, COWEN: It would be tax cuts 2.0, I think you'd have a lot more stimulus. I do think that they do much more aggressive on things like trade policy. I do think that would happen, no question about it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">If the Republican state both it'll be business as usual and we continue to have the regular tour rollbacks, probably accelerates into 2020.</p><p>WESTIN: That's at the marco level, what about a specific sector take pharmaceuticals.</p><p>SOLOMON: Yes.</p><p>WESTIN: Because some people think that that someplace, that President Trump could be align with the Democrats on prescription drug prices.</p><p>SOLOMON: Yes, I think that's a big pharma, you have to be worried. If you have both houses to flip Democratic then I think you're what we'll see. One of the first things we'll see is we'll see drug pricing policy being discussed.</p><p>I still think it's going to be difficult to have a national drug rising policy, but there'll be a lot of hearings and big pharma executives will be dragged onto the floor. And I think there the President has had said pretty clearly he'd like to try do something.</p><p>I also think that pharma is ready for this, though. So let's be really clear. You've got a strategy, I think you're already starting to see industry began to take matters into its own hands and anticipation of something like this because it something that the industry has been talking about and wrestling with for a long time.</p><p>ALIX STEEL, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Jeffrey, how are you position in for 2019? Like where do you think you're going to see the most activity? What's going to be the risk that you're looking for?</p><p>SOLOMON: So we still think there's some pretty big tailwinds behind to our discovery early stage, biotech and biopharma.</p><p>STEEL: Doesn't have to be biotech be anywhere --</p><p>SOLOMON: Yes. I'm saying even with the drug pricing juxtopition, I still think -- we think there's a lot innovation there to happen. Obviously we've bee very involve in the cannabis area and we actually think that if you look at a lot state houses and you look at a lot of the national polling.</p><p>I think there's a real push by the populist to figure out a way to have a national cannabis policy. And so, we would expect that at some point over the next two years that comes into play, certainly of both Houses with Democratic and you got a lot of statehouses that flip, there'll be a lot more of that.</p><p>WESTIN: So you think they actually could repeal the federal statute on cannabis?</p><p>SOLOMON: I think it's on the table. The Trump Administration hasn't exactly been hard line on this, I think that attorney general has been hard line on this but I'm not sure how much longer he stays around after the turn, and if that happens. There's a possibility. I would just say it opens it up and certainly if you watch with happening in Canada and you watch what happening in globally, this is a real business.</p><p>And so, we're continuing to think that over the next few years this plays out in a positive way.</p><p>STEEL: What do you think?</p><p>SOLOMON: I actually agree with that. I think that there's a big dichotomy between big banks and the rest of us. And I think if you're in the big bank game, you've got a lot more to worry about for a regulatory standpoint. I also think in big tech you have to worry about.</p><p>STEEL: I was just going to ask some more (ph) investigation.</p><p>SOLOMON: I think big tech has a lot to worry about both from Democrats and Republicans. And I would say regardless of the outcome here, I would expect to see more -- more investigation or more hearing around privacy and cyber security and all of these things that I think are impacting your average American.</p><p>And so, there I think Maxine Waters has been pretty clear that that something that she want's to do. And I think that they won't get a lot of push back from their Republicans on that either.</p><p>STEEL: Yes, all right.</p><p>WESTIN: So Jeffrey, at the same time we had Peter Mandelson saying that we had Nigel Farage over at London saying does (ph) agree of Brexit at all because they really caving in. What's your view on what's going to happen and how does it affect your business?</p><p>SOLOMON: So I think if you're running a business there, you've got to consider a hard Brexit. That's our default, right. If that happens, you have to be repaired for that. So, it's even harder probable lies it. But if it happens, if there's a one percent or two percent or five percent chance that it happens, you have to be prepared for that.</p><p>So, I think a lot of folks I know are really saying, listen we've got to prepare for a hard Brexit if it acts away from that, then we can adjust. But if you don't prepare for hard Brexit then I think you'll probably -- you're making be a big mistake.</p><p>STEEL: The people that you talk to in clients, how do they prepare for hard Brexit?</p><p>SOLOMON: Yes. A lot of it is moving people into areas where you can engage with the European Union. I think a lot of folks are looking at places where there's already financial infrastructure and support, a lot of people at Luxembourg, a lot of people are moving to the Republic of Ireland in places that are likely to end up in a much more favorable engagement.</p><p>And then you have to your London just be running as what any other place in the world. London and U.K. will be set of regimes and the U.E will be another and you'll have to have multiple offices in order to handle that.</p><p>STEEL: Because I feel like the narrative when Brexit happen was that, if it's a hard Brexit everything is off like the world is going to hell. It's going to be terrible. It'll be awful (ph). But with the way you're talking it seems like clients are already working towards some kind of hard Brexit and it's not breaking the system.</p><p>SOLOMON: I think that it depends on what business is you're in. So when we look at it. We cover Europe out of London. But is it really going to change. It'll be harder for people to move. We're still going to have most of our people in London and calling on European clients to say when we have people in New York calling European clients.</p><p>So that doesn't change much. But I think things like funding slows, if you're in the banking system there's a lot more challenges around that. We're on the side of that a little bit more. We're not really in the deposit taking mode or like that. If you're in that mode, I think it much more complicated.</p><p>LIBBY CANTRILL, HEAD OF PUBLIC POLICY FOR PIMCO: So yes, there's a lot of uncertainly. We won't we be surprise if the deadline is pushed out even further.</p><p>SOLOMON: Yes. But look what happen with MiFID II, that's a smaller microcosmos of what happened. So people put their head in the sand on MiFID II until it absolute certainly. And then all of sudden people scramble to figure out how to do MiFID II. And the regulators ultimately, backing away in terms of implementation and penalties and things like that so that people could get their act together.</p><p>But for a long time people just ignore it like it wasn't going to happen. And so, again I don't want to equate the two because I think Brexit has much more complicated thing in MiFID II. But we all adjusted to MiFID II and we had business plans and contingencies ready to go.</p><p>And so, I think might be that was a dry run.</p><p>STEEL: Well, there's a narrative in the market though that it is enough financial pressure on the U.K. or the E.U. to actually make a deal. We've heard the same thing with Italy in terms of their budget deficit to your point. You're not going to make a deal into your fear literally in the fire.</p><p>So, that is true. And I think if you look at what's really driving Brexit, it's really not economic in many instances. It's immigration and social. And these things ebb and flow, the impetus may be to bring about Brexit and to get the vote out a couple of years ago was really at the height of this immigration crisis that was happening, this migration was happening for the Middle East.</p><p>Like, is that moderates and people adjust to the new normal, does Britain take a step back and say well, maybe it's not as bad as we thought it was going to be and I think the border with Ireland is the really -- there are not a lot of people who want to go back to a hard border with Ireland.</p><p>And so, I'm taking a look at the social aspects of this and try to take my cues there rather than economic because let's acknowledge it. It is way better for Britain and way better in the E.U.</p><p>STEEL: Right.</p><p>SOLOMON: From economic standpoint if things stay as is. It just the social issues and how can you bridge that gap.</p><p>STEEL: So we're going to leave it there. And much come with Libby Cantrill with PIMCO and Jeffrey Solomon of Cowen. This is Bloomberg.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>STEEL: And look at that. Look who we have, it so happen that we have Jeffrey Solomon of Cowen, so in pivoting real quickly up is SKIP McGee there (ph). What can opportunity set did you see there?</p><p>SOLOMON: Well, I think there's a tremendous amount of opportunity of opportunity both to provide financial, advice in financing. And I think this is -- what were seeing here is that, for us to try to recreate the kind of financial advice that Skip McGee and Chris Winchenbaugh team can do is just -- it would be really hard for us to do that. They're excellent at it.</p><p>And we're excellent into capital raising and financing and resurge and sales and trading. And you're not going to create that infrastructure. So for us, there's a national place where we can align with them, to really address the total needs of client in that space.</p><p>And it's a great cultural fit because Skip and Chris teams spent a lot of time with Larry Wieseneck who's our Co-President. There's a great cultural. Today, there so were co-pitching and doing things where we can work collectively to solve problems for clients across financing and strategic advice. So, it just makes sense to do that.</p><p>STEEL: Is that mean that you see more M&amp;A going forward for the space? Debt is still a concern for a lot of them. Is it M&amp;A?</p><p>SOLOMON: Yes, I think it could be M&amp;A and I think it can be refinancing. I think this is -- like a lot of businesses that are capital intention, there's always capital raising going on. And I think if you're a manager in that business, you go to look at strategic as well as financing concurrently.</p><p>And so, we'll leave it right a full range of services collectively between both of our organization and of course, most of those folks want research coverage and sales and trading and support the after market if you're public.</p><p>And that something that we have an excellent footprint in already and we can bring that to bear for a lot of clients.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>WESTIN: So Jeffrey, as we're resetting our economic relationship, China on its own is resetting its economy. I mean, you see a slow down in GDP growth. They were trying to deleverage. They can't quite afford to do that. What is the risk to global growth overall?</p><p>SOLOMON: I actually think it's pretty significant. When you got the two large economist at odds at one another, that's generally not good for global GDP growth. I actually think, China is struggling with meeting domestically and it's one belt one road strategy.</p><p>If you think about the amount of capital that it spent in Eastern Europe for example, I don't know how that sustainable if the home economy is really working that well. It turns out that whether you're a sort of plan capital economy or market capital economy, either one.</p><p>It's hard to spend money both domestically to fix domestic problems and invest globally to protect your interest. So, that's what the U.S. has been facing over the last view decades, certainly after the financial crisis. It's harder for us to spend money abroad to do Pax Americana when we've got fundamental issues here.</p><p>I think China has the same issues because at the end of the day you got to take care of the home front first before you can think about the rest of the world.</p><p>WESTIN: At the same time China again and again has over performed, I mean done better than what we thought they would do.</p><p>SOLOMON: Or so they like you to think. I mean I think it's really hard to know.</p><p>STEEL: But they do come in and do back stopping. I mean, they made money available to small and medium size businesses. I mean, they use to pop up SOEs like there in there.</p><p>SOLOMON: They are in there, just like we're in there with our government propping up our businesses. We do this. It's funny to me, when we had a financial crisis. We propped up steel. We propped up autos. We propped up the financial system like we did it because we needed to.</p><p>And they will do it because they may need to. So, I actually don't think there's a tremendous amount of out difference between the way that we approach our businesses in times of stress and the way that they approach their businesses in times of economic stress.</p><p>I actually I think it's actually pretty similar.</p><p>STEEL: So what does mean for actually business. Like if you ask anyone two years ago in investment banking. They would say cross board or M&amp;A, China buying companies elsewhere whether in Europe and the U.S. was the thing.</p><p>SOLOMON: Yes. I was. So we have personal -- first hand experiences as we have a deal to have sell 20 percent of our company to a Chinese private investors, a private company and it was one of the largest oil importers in refiners.</p><p>We did it not because we needed the money. We did it because we really thought it was going to give us a window and in doing cross boarder transaction of financing in China with the strategic partner. Today, we can't even find that guy just to be really clear.</p><p>Like, they're literally dismantling that his empire, which is huge amounts of money was spent in Eastern Europe with a big, all the old Eastern Bloc nations that part of the one belt, one road strategy. There's a lot of capital was spent there like, I just will say like what we heard 18 months ago and what's actually happening are two very different things.</p><p>And we're super thankful that ultimately we didn't do that deal. Because I guess I'm not sure how we would have been able to approach doing business in China given really the bipolar nature of it.</p><p>CANTRILL: So it's not to say that they necessarily won't boycott American companies but at this point it's been interesting that they have necessary pulled on that lever yet.</p><p>SOLOMON: Yes. I don't disagree with that. I think it's better if we have a more friendly engagement with China, particularly given our current account deficit, right. I think we have to figure out how to create the new balance.</p><p>And I've always said that I think tariff is a blunt force instrument to bring people to the table. I think if you're the Trump administration, you're trying to reset the table for global trade. Tariff is a way to bring everybody to the table.</p><p>WESTIN: Yes.</p><p>SOLOMON: That is a strategy in and of itself. But let's face it. If we can figure out what the new normal looks like and create better trade and balance between the two countries, everybody wins. How do we get from here to there? That's the big question.</p><p>WESTIN: If we can, as (INAUDIBLE) phrase there. OK.

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its  accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DAVID WESTIN, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  Welcome now Libby Cantrill, PIMCO's Head  of Public Policy and Jeffrey Solomon Cowen CEO.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So, at the same time, if in fact the Republicans took both and that seems  unlikely at this point.  Could we have a lot more fiscal stimulus, could  that make a difference actually in the markets?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JEFFEREY SOLOMON, CEO, COWEN:  It would be tax cuts 2.0, I think you'd have  a lot more stimulus.  I do think that they do much more aggressive on  things like trade policy.  I do think that would happen, no question about  it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">If the Republican state both it'll be business as usual and we continue to  have the regular tour rollbacks, probably accelerates into 2020.</p><p>WESTIN:  That's at the marco level, what about a specific sector take  pharmaceuticals.</p><p>SOLOMON:  Yes.</p><p>WESTIN:  Because some people think that that someplace, that President  Trump could be align with the Democrats on prescription drug prices.</p><p>SOLOMON:  Yes, I think that's a big pharma, you have to be worried.  If you  have both houses to flip Democratic then I think you're what we'll see.   One of the first things we'll see is we'll see drug pricing policy being  discussed.</p><p>I still think it's going to be difficult to have a national drug rising  policy, but there'll be a lot of hearings and big pharma executives will be  dragged onto the floor.  And I think there the President has had said  pretty clearly he'd like to try do something.</p><p>I also think that pharma is ready for this, though.  So let's be really  clear.  You've got a strategy, I think you're already starting to see  industry began to take matters into its own hands and anticipation of  something like this because it something that the industry has been talking  about and wrestling with for a long time.</p><p>ALIX STEEL, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  Jeffrey, how are you position in for 2019?   Like where do you think you're going to see the most activity?  What's  going to be the risk that you're looking for?</p><p>SOLOMON:  So we still think there's some pretty big tailwinds behind to our  discovery early stage, biotech and biopharma.</p><p>STEEL:  Doesn't have to be biotech be anywhere --</p><p>SOLOMON:  Yes.  I'm saying even with the drug pricing juxtopition, I still  think -- we think there's a lot innovation there to happen.  Obviously  we've bee very involve in the cannabis area and we actually think that if  you look at a lot state houses and you look at a lot of the national  polling.</p><p>I think there's a real push by the populist to figure out a way to have a  national cannabis policy.  And so, we would expect that at some point over  the next two years that comes into play, certainly of both Houses with  Democratic and you got a lot of statehouses that flip, there'll be a lot  more of that.</p><p>WESTIN:  So you think they actually could repeal the federal statute on  cannabis?</p><p>SOLOMON:  I think it's on the table.  The Trump Administration hasn't  exactly been hard line on this, I think that attorney general has been hard  line on this but I'm not sure how much longer he stays around after the  turn, and if that happens.  There's a possibility.  I would just say it  opens it up and certainly if you watch with happening in Canada and you  watch what happening in globally, this is a real business.</p><p>And so, we're continuing to think that over the next few years this plays  out in a positive way.</p><p>STEEL:  What do you think?</p><p>SOLOMON:  I actually agree with that.  I think that there's a big dichotomy  between big banks and the rest of us.  And I think if you're in the big  bank game, you've got a lot more to worry about for a regulatory  standpoint.  I also think in big tech you have to worry about.</p><p>STEEL:  I was just going to ask some more (ph) investigation.</p><p>SOLOMON:  I think big tech has a lot to worry about both from Democrats and  Republicans.  And I would say regardless of the outcome here, I would  expect to see more -- more investigation or more hearing around privacy and  cyber security and all of these things that I think are impacting your  average American.</p><p>And so, there I think Maxine Waters has been pretty clear that that  something that she want's to do.  And I think that they won't get a lot of  push back from their Republicans on that either.</p><p>STEEL:  Yes, all right.</p><p>WESTIN:  So Jeffrey, at the same time we had Peter Mandelson saying that we  had Nigel Farage over at London saying does (ph) agree of Brexit at all  because they really caving in.  What's your view on what's going to happen  and how does it affect your business?</p><p>SOLOMON:  So I think if you're running a business there, you've got to  consider a hard Brexit.  That's our default, right.  If that happens, you  have to be repaired for that.  So, it's even harder probable lies it.  But  if it happens, if there's a one percent or two percent or five percent  chance that it happens, you have to be prepared for that.</p><p>So, I think a lot of folks I know are really saying, listen we've got to  prepare for a hard Brexit if it acts away from that, then we can adjust.   But if you don't prepare for hard Brexit then I think you'll probably --  you're making be a big mistake.</p><p>STEEL:  The people that you talk to in clients, how do they prepare for  hard Brexit?</p><p>SOLOMON:  Yes.  A lot of it is moving people into areas where you can  engage with the European Union.  I think a lot of folks are looking at  places where there's already financial infrastructure and support, a lot of  people at Luxembourg, a lot of people are moving to the Republic of Ireland  in places that are likely to end up in a much more favorable engagement.</p><p>And then you have to your London just be running as what any other place in  the world.  London and U.K. will be set of regimes and the U.E will be  another and you'll have to have multiple offices in order to handle that.</p><p>STEEL:  Because I feel like the narrative when Brexit happen was that, if  it's a hard Brexit everything is off like the world is going to hell.  It's  going to be terrible.  It'll be awful (ph).  But with the way you're  talking it seems like clients are already working towards some kind of hard  Brexit and it's not breaking the system.</p><p>SOLOMON:  I think that it depends on what business is you're in.  So when  we look at it.  We cover Europe out of London.  But is it really going to  change.  It'll be harder for people to move.  We're still going to have  most of our people in London and calling on European clients to say when we  have people in New York calling European clients.</p><p>So that doesn't change much.  But I think things like funding slows, if  you're in the banking system there's a lot more challenges around that.   We're on the side of that a little bit more.  We're not really in the  deposit taking mode or like that.  If you're in that mode, I think it much  more complicated.</p><p>LIBBY CANTRILL, HEAD OF PUBLIC POLICY FOR PIMCO:  So yes, there's a lot of  uncertainly.  We won't we be surprise if the deadline is pushed out even  further.</p><p>SOLOMON:  Yes.  But look what happen with MiFID II, that's a smaller  microcosmos of what happened.  So people put their head in the sand on  MiFID II until it absolute certainly.  And then all of sudden people  scramble to figure out how to do MiFID II.  And the regulators ultimately,  backing away in terms of implementation and penalties and things like that  so that people could get their act together.</p><p>But for a long time people just ignore it like it wasn't going to happen.   And so, again I don't want to equate the two because I think Brexit has  much more complicated thing in MiFID II.  But we all adjusted to MiFID II  and we had business plans and contingencies ready to go.</p><p>And so, I think might be that was a dry run.</p><p>STEEL:  Well, there's a narrative in the market though that it is enough  financial pressure on the U.K. or the E.U. to actually make a deal.  We've  heard the same thing with Italy in terms of their budget deficit to your  point.  You're not going to make a deal into your fear literally in the  fire.</p><p>So, that is true.  And I think if you look at what's really driving Brexit,  it's really not economic in many instances.  It's immigration and social.   And these things ebb and flow, the impetus may be to bring about Brexit and  to get the vote out a couple of years ago was really at the height of this  immigration crisis that was happening, this migration was happening for the  Middle East.</p><p>Like, is that moderates and people adjust to the new normal, does Britain  take a step back and say well, maybe it's not as bad as we thought it was  going to be and I think the border with Ireland is the really -- there are  not a lot of people who want to go back to a hard border with Ireland.</p><p>And so, I'm taking a look at the social aspects of this and try to take my  cues there rather than economic because let's acknowledge it.  It is way  better for Britain and way better in the E.U.</p><p>STEEL:  Right.</p><p>SOLOMON: From economic standpoint if things stay as is.  It just the social  issues and how can you bridge that gap.</p><p>STEEL:  So we're going to leave it there.  And much come with Libby  Cantrill with PIMCO and Jeffrey Solomon of Cowen.  This is Bloomberg.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>STEEL:  And look at that.  Look who we have, it so happen that we have  Jeffrey Solomon of Cowen, so in pivoting real quickly up is SKIP McGee  there (ph).  What can opportunity set did you see there?</p><p>SOLOMON:  Well, I think there's a tremendous amount of opportunity of  opportunity both to provide financial, advice in financing.  And I think  this is -- what were seeing here is that, for us to try to recreate the  kind of financial advice that Skip McGee and Chris Winchenbaugh team can do  is just -- it would be really hard for us to do that.  They're excellent at  it.</p><p>And we're excellent into capital raising and financing and resurge and  sales and trading.  And you're not going to create that infrastructure.  So  for us, there's a national place where we can align with them, to really  address the total needs of client in that space.</p><p>And it's a great cultural fit because Skip and Chris teams spent a lot of  time with Larry Wieseneck who's our Co-President.  There's a great  cultural.  Today, there so were co-pitching and doing things where we can  work collectively to solve problems for clients across financing and  strategic advice.  So, it just makes sense to do that.</p><p>STEEL:  Is that mean that you see more M&amp;A going forward for the space?   Debt is still a concern for a lot of them.  Is it M&amp;A?</p><p>SOLOMON:  Yes, I think it could be M&amp;A and I think it can be refinancing.   I think this is -- like a lot of businesses that are capital intention,  there's always capital raising going on.  And I think if you're a manager  in that business, you go to look at strategic as well as financing  concurrently.</p><p>And so, we'll leave it right a full range of services collectively between  both of our organization and of course, most of those folks want research  coverage and sales and trading and support the after market if you're  public.</p><p>And that something that we have an excellent footprint in already and we  can bring that to bear for a lot of clients.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>WESTIN:  So Jeffrey, as we're resetting our economic relationship, China on  its own is resetting its economy.  I mean, you see a slow down in GDP  growth.  They were trying to deleverage.  They can't quite afford to do  that.  What is the risk to global growth overall?</p><p>SOLOMON:  I actually think it's pretty significant.  When you got the two  large economist at odds at one another, that's generally not good for  global GDP growth.  I actually think, China is struggling with meeting  domestically and it's one belt one road strategy.</p><p>If you think about the amount of capital that it spent in Eastern Europe  for example, I don't know how that sustainable if the home economy is  really working that well.  It turns out that whether you're a sort of plan  capital economy or market capital economy, either one.</p><p>It's hard to spend money both domestically to fix domestic problems and  invest globally to protect your interest.  So, that's what the U.S. has  been facing over the last view decades, certainly after the financial  crisis.  It's harder for us to spend money abroad to do Pax Americana when  we've got fundamental issues here.</p><p>I think China has the same issues because at the end of the day you got to  take care of the home front first before you can think about the rest of  the world.</p><p>WESTIN:  At the same time China again and again has over performed, I mean  done better than what we thought they would do.</p><p>SOLOMON:  Or so they like you to think.  I mean I think it's really hard to  know.</p><p>STEEL:  But they do come in and do back stopping.  I mean, they made money  available to small and medium size businesses.  I mean, they use to pop up  SOEs like there in there.</p><p>SOLOMON:  They are in there, just like we're in there with our government  propping up our businesses.  We do this.  It's funny to me, when we had a  financial crisis.  We propped up steel.  We propped up autos.  We propped  up the financial system like we did it because we needed to.</p><p>And they will do it because they may need to.  So, I actually don't think  there's a tremendous amount of out difference between the way that we  approach our businesses in times of stress and the way that they approach  their businesses in times of economic stress.</p><p>I actually I think it's actually pretty similar.</p><p>STEEL:  So what does mean for actually business.  Like if you ask anyone  two years ago in investment banking.  They would say cross board or M&amp;A,  China buying companies elsewhere whether in Europe and the U.S. was the  thing.</p><p>SOLOMON:  Yes.  I was.  So we have personal -- first hand experiences as we  have a deal to have sell 20 percent of our company to a Chinese private  investors, a private company and it was one of the largest oil importers in  refiners.</p><p>We did it not because we needed the money.  We did it because we really  thought it was going to give us a window and in doing cross boarder  transaction of financing in China with the strategic partner.  Today, we  can't even find that guy just to be really clear.</p><p>Like, they're literally dismantling that his empire, which is huge amounts  of money was spent in Eastern Europe with a big, all the old Eastern Bloc  nations that part of the one belt, one road strategy.  There's a lot of  capital was spent there like, I just will say like what we heard 18 months  ago and what's actually happening are two very different things.</p><p>And we're super thankful that ultimately we didn't do that deal.  Because I  guess I'm not sure how we would have been able to approach doing business  in China given really the bipolar nature of it.</p><p>CANTRILL:  So it's not to say that they necessarily won't boycott American  companies but at this point it's been interesting that they have necessary  pulled on that lever yet.</p><p>SOLOMON:  Yes.  I don't disagree with that.  I think it's better if we have  a more friendly engagement with China, particularly given our current  account deficit, right.  I think we have to figure out how to create the  new balance.</p><p>And I've always said that I think tariff is a blunt force instrument to  bring people to the table.  I think if you're the Trump administration,  you're trying to reset the table for global trade.  Tariff is a way to  bring everybody to the table.</p><p>WESTIN:  Yes.</p><p>SOLOMON:  That is a strategy in and of itself.  But let's face it.  If we  can figure out what the new normal looks like and create better trade and  balance between the two countries, everybody wins.  How do we get from here  to there?  That's the big question.</p><p>WESTIN:  If we can, as (INAUDIBLE) phrase there.  OK.  Libby Cantrill of  PIMCO and Jeffrey Solomon of Cowen, thank so much for being with us.</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

The Sessions announcement appears to be a response to the Senate Intel Committee's hearing today with officials from Twitter and Facebook. </p><p>Much of the conversation gravitated around foreign disinformation campaigns across social media, as well as big tech's alleged bias against right-wing viewpoints.

This is a whoa - DOJ says they're planning to convene state attorney generals to talk about whether social media companies are 'hurting competition' and 'intentionally stifling the free exchange of ideas' \u2014 pic.twitter.com/SakDDmW0Ef[1] \u2014 Hadas Gold (@Hadas_Gold) September 5, 2018[2] In the last few days, President Donald Trump occasionally took breaks from bashing Sessions in order to decry Google[3] and other websites for their supposed censorship of conservative viewpoints and positive news about himself. Members of his administration previously hinted[4] that they might be looking at ways to regulate certain websites because of these claims.

Can you account for your sentience? Are you able to find the three matching stoplights in this grid of grainy images? Fulfilling these requests has become so routine that we barely reckon with the underlying question: Are you even a human?</p><p>The Internet's persistent and growing sense of <url normalizedValue=\"http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/12/how-much-of-the-internet-is-fake.html\">fakeness</url> is nothing new. In 2013, after noticing the potential for site traffic to be dominated by bots, engineers at YouTube coined a term for the moment when they would no longer be able to distinguish human from nonhuman activity: \"the Inversion.\" Maybe we've already reached that threshold, and maybe we don't care that much. Every day we are faced with a mirage of fast-moving feeds, and the constant effort to make money off the Internet's users (us) has only amplified the confusion as an increasing number of stakeholders attempt to capture and define our wants, creating more and more automated activities and algorithmic interactions. It has also produced a ton of crap-in our minds, on the Web, and in our world.</p><p>Jenny Odell, a visual artist, writer, and Stanford design lecturer, is a spelunker of this massive, ever-growing dump. Her projects, ranging from investigative journalism to performance art, are driven by what she calls her \"strange fascination with the utter garbage of the internet.\" For example, her <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.topic.com/there-s-no-such-thing-as-a-free-watch\">2017 photo essay</url> \"There's No Such Thing as a Free Watch\" examines the strange junk and scams that proliferate in social-media marketplaces, following the clues left behind, from North America to Asia, by an Instagram ad offering a free luxury timepiece. We find ourselves traversing vast spaces, real and imagined: retail websites stitched together from pilfered images, factories in China supplying a legion of wristwatch peddlers, direct-message threads with unrepentant Instagram hustlers. Fake brands, identities, and products are in constant gestation. The watch, Odell tells us, is just a \"physical witness\" to all the machinations and \"shifting winds\" of the various economic interests in pursuit of our eyeballs and wallets. These snake-oil salesmen are as real and integral to the global economy today as the people who make money in more traditional ways.</p><p>Odell's new book, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">How to Do Nothing: Resisting the Attention Economy</emphasis>, describes itself as a \"field guide\" for navigating this spiderweb of digital commerce. But it is also about finding a way to escape from it, to create more meaningful forms of work, relationships, and selves in the face of such an onslaught of fabrication. The book expands on a talk she gave at the art and technology conference Eyeo; in it, she weaves stories about her family, her love of bird-watching, Gilles Deleuze's idea of the \"right to say nothing,\" and the importance of public space into lessons about how to live \"in a world where our value is determined by our productivity.\" Tying all these ideas together is Odell's notion that in the face of capitalist optimization, \"doing nothing\" is \"an act of political resistance.\" Through our inactivity, she insists, we will be able to recover a more humane world in an accelerating age of commodification.</p><p>Grounding her argument in the environment, Odell sidesteps the familiar advice, \"Just turn your smartphone off.\" She doesn't want us to escape from the world of sociability but rather make new communities or at least restore old ones. For her, it's not about abandoning communication and technology but about using it for our own ends. Despite such bold prescriptions, she doesn't tell us exactly how we might go about doing this so much as offer up a meditation on why we should. Unlike her art, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">How to Do Nothing</emphasis> is less a work of social criticism than of personal discovery. It succeeds in detailing how one can willingly become addicted to the Internet's attention economy and calls on us to move away from it, but it doesn't fully confront those structures and forms of domination-24/7 surveillance, Big Tech's grip on basic services, the proliferation of monopolies-that hinder so many of us from doing just that.</p><p>dell grew up in Cupertino, California, a Bay Area suburb that's home to dozens of tech companies, the largest of which is Apple. She has, from an early age, been able to observe Silicon Valley's changing fortunes, from the dot-com bubble to the start-up explosion. At the University of California, Berkeley, she studied literature and art and wrote her thesis on Emily Dickinson's fascicles, the hand-sewn booklets in which the poet kept her work. After graduation, Odell entered an MFA program in design at the San Francisco Art Institute, where she started to develop her investigative-art style, which she compares to gathering \"open source intelligence,\" or the sleuthing that one can do using the archives of publicly available information.</p><p>One of Odell's earlier projects, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Satellite Landscapes</emphasis>, mined the archives of Google Maps' satellite images. Using photographs of power plants and waste-processing sites, she captured how the infrastructure necessary to meet human needs can seem monstrous and inhumane, even as its operations sustain life. As an artist in residence at the San Francisco dump, she continued to hone her Internet sleuthing skills in an epic dumpster dive, resulting in a collection of salvaged items that showed how even the most disparate pieces of trash are linked. In her 2014 <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Pipe Dream</emphasis>, she mined Google Maps once again; this time, she used its street views to illustrate how a crude-oil pipeline connected Portland, Maine, with Montreal.</p><p>One of Odell's most recent projects, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Excavating Calabazas Creek</emphasis>, used public records obtained from Valley Water, Silicon Valley's water-management agency, to examine how the modifications to a creek in Cupertino explained her hometown's evolving history, from farm town to sleepy suburb to tech incubator. As she puts it in her new book, \"The creek is a reminder that we do not live in a simulation-a streamlined world of products, results, experiences, reviews-but rather on a giant rock\" that is full of \"a deep weirdness, a world of flowerings, decompositions, and seepages, of a million crawling things, of spores and lacy fungal filaments.\"</p><p>Lately, Odell has also turned her sleuthing skills to reporting, including her 2018 <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">New York Times</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/27/style/what-is-inside-this-internet-rabbit-hole.html\">feature</url> \"A Business With No End.\" In it, she tries to solve a mystery that one of her students at Stanford brought to her: Unwanted packages from a company called Valley Fountain keep arriving at his parents' doorstep in Palo Alto. Odell traces the origin of this mail to a building in downtown San Francisco that turns out to be home to 140 other companies (with names like Bropastures and Your Friend Bart) connected to Amazon storefronts that peddle an amazing variety of items-\"fake facial wounds,\" lamps, makeup, hemorrhoid creams-at a high markup.</p><p>At first, Odell thinks the whole scheme can be chalked up to drop shippers, online retailers advertising items on social media that, if purchased, can be bought cheaply from a warehouse and then shipped to the customer. But she soon learns that many of these drop shippers are people employed by a network of companies affiliated with Olivet University, a religious school operated by the Korean pastor David Jang. The leader of an international Christian group known as the Community, Jang reportedly has a close financial relationship with religious publications like <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Christian Today</emphasis> and secular ones like the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">International Business Times</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Newsweek</emphasis>.</p><p>Following a bread-crumb trail of LLCs, Odell manages to link the strange packages to this network of companies, describing a dizzying series of events that culminates with investigators from the Manhattan district attorney's office raiding the offices of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Newsweek</emphasis> as well as a planned satellite campus that Olivet was building on the site of an abandoned psychiatric hospital. \"Trying to map the connections between all these entities opens a gaping wormhole,\" Odell writes. \"I couldn't get over the idea that a church might be behind a network of used business books, hair straighteners, and suspiciously priced compression stockings-sold on Amazon...all while running a once-venerable American news publication into the ground.\"</p><p>While the reporting in the piece is breathtaking, the experience of scrolling through \"A Business With No End\"-with its uncanny article design (made in collaboration with the artist Tracy Ma) filled with screenshots from weird websites and frenetic animations that pop off the screen-has its own power, mimicking the hallucinatory feeling of Odell discovering and yet not fully pinning down all of these connections. \"At some point I began to feel like I was in a dream. Or that I was half-awake, unable to distinguish the virtual from the real,\" she writes. The same is true for anyone who reads it. \"A Business With No End\" leaves its readers, purposefully, with more questions than answers.</p><p>Odell cites Frederic Jameson as an inspiration, and as she explained to me in an interview, she's trying to do something that Jameson knew was almost futile: to tell the story of objects caught in the often confounding space of \"the great global multinational and decentered communications network.\" She hopes to dispel, if only for a moment, the confusion that comes from this space or at least to re-create its discombobulating feeling so that we, too, are forced to ask ourselves if we are indeed human.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">ow to Do Nothing</emphasis> marks an important turn in Odell's work: the attempt to find some peace and quiet in the midst of the Internet's chaos by imagining a new mind-set and new ways of living.</p><p>As with her art and reporting, Odell finds herself covering a lot of terrain in that attempt. She jumps from the lessons we can learn from the 19th-century struggle for an eight-hour workday to an analysis of the 1960s commune movement, explaining that its apolitical nature led to failure but that its basic principle of retreat is integral to any resistance to today's attention economy. She also offers several tours of the locales in which her book was written and where she finds peace herself, bringing readers from the Rose Gardens of Oakland to the hills and hidden creeks that cut across the Bay Area.</p><p>While none of these things have much to do with the tech world or the Internet, Odell gathers them into a larger theory about how we might detach ourselves from the compulsive sense of productivity demanded by digitization. This is not to say that she doesn't devote plenty of space to withering criticism of Mark Zuckerberg, Peter Thiel, tech libertarianism, or Silicon Valley's design fetish; she does, and all of it is sharply composed, including an illuminating lesson on \"persuasive design\"-the constantly evolving strategies that tech companies use to grab our attention. Despite these moments of critical insight, Odell often proves to be more interested in the solution than in the problems that face us today: By \"doing nothing,\" she insists, we can replant ourselves in a \"public, physical realm.\"</p><p>Odell focuses on two ways to achieve this. The first is by reorienting more of our lives around bioregionalism. We need a better understanding of how human activity is part of a \"complex web of relationships\" among the many life-forms in a given community. She also urges us to recognize the importance of the nonhuman perspectives that coexist in this web. Drawing from the environmentalist writings of Peter Berg, she argues that knowing the details of a particular bioregion creates the conditions of mutual respect among the creatures-some human, many not-that live there. Through a better sense of our immediate homes, we can also create more geographically bounded social networks, free of regulated interactions and the involvement of large corporations. We can also understand the ways in which animals live alongside us, which for Odell leads to bird-watching but could be any form of interaction with another species. The crows of her neighborhood, she tells us, \"don't see progress-they just see recurrence, day after day, week after week.\" Borrowing from Donna Haraway and Martin Buber, she urges that we need to focus on where we are now, to meet the world as it currently stands, not impose our will and subjectivity on it.</p><p>While Odell's work has always been interested in how technology rewires our conception of the built environment, the belief in the natural world she espouses in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">How to Do Nothing</emphasis> illustrates a shift in her interests. Junk and ephemera-the Internet's trash-were a route to understanding the bizarre mechanics of the digital economy. They revealed the larger and often unseen structures of capitalism, mostly facilitated by social media, as it transformed individuals into consumers. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">How to Do Nothing </emphasis>is aware of these imposing structures, but Odell imagines we can cope with their deleterious effects by denying them our attention and retraining our focus. As a result, her book is less concerned with confronting these structures head-on.</p><p>One sympathizes with the impulse. Shutting off is a form of resistance, and refusing to allow the shadowy structures that define almost all of our everyday digital interactions to define our lives as well is a political act. Yet the vested interest of social-media platforms in constant user engagement and data is not simply going to vanish if we embark on an \"I and Thou\" relationship with nature and spend more of our time outside. As Odell's art and multimedia investigations have shown, tech's push for optimization and growth can easily be molded to new human desires. They may currently proceed \"from a false view of life as atomized,\" one that \"fails to recognize the ecosystem as a living whole that in fact needs all of its parts to function,\" but what would stop an Amazon or Apple from trying to colonize those human desires that proceed from a truer, more collective view of life? Odell writes about her concern that unfettered capitalism \"turn[ed] what was once a dense and thriving landscape of individual and communal thought into a Monsanto farm whose 'production' slowly destroys the soil until nothing more can grow.\" But without challenging these institutions directly, can we really resist what they're feeding us?</p><p>Odell's critique that commercial social media is destroying our shared mental ecosystem leads to a compelling, if somewhat predictable, argument: If you hate your job and really hate how Twitter makes you feel, nature is just waiting for you to discover and care for it. But her recommendations for making our way back to nature can feel a touch too mystical. Pauline Oliveros's idea of \"deep listening\"-the almost meditative practice of appreciating particular sounds in the immediate environment-may help develop a respect for our shared space, but can it really power collective action? Citing Cicero, William James, and Melville's \"Bartleby the Scrivener,\" Odell also argues that we can find a \"third space\" of social interaction in which to employ the tactics of \"refusal, boycott, and sabotage\" against the \"cycle[s] where both financially driven platforms and overall precarity close down the space of attention.\" But again, it's easy to wonder: What will prevent these acts of resistance from themselves becoming another monetizable sector?</p><p>dell knows that we can't escape the Internet, no matter how much we may want to, but she does ask us to direct our attention and energies elsewhere. The problem is that, in today's world, we might need to direct more time and attention <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">toward</emphasis> the Internet if we are to liberate ourselves from its exploitation and excesses.</p><p>Many are beginning to realize this. Google workers have marched out of their offices around the world in response to sexual misconduct at the company; Amazon employees are demanding fair wages and insisting that it refuse to work with oil companies. Consumers, too, have begun to boycott companies like Amazon and Uber for their abusive workplace practices. Odell acknowledges that \"doing nothing\" is a provisionary concept, a \"way station\" to practical organizing. (She looks at the history of the 1934 San Francisco general strike in her section on a \"third space.\") But the kernel of truth it's founded on is that the economic system as we know it does more harm than good, and thus we need to create new terms of engagement that lead us not toward individual acts of resistance but toward collective action.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">How to Do Nothing</emphasis> accomplishes something that neither the recent wave of Internet histories (Shoshana Zuboff's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</emphasis>, Tim Wu's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Attention Merchants</emphasis>) nor the popular self-help books on digital detox have achieved. Odell helps readers discover ways of living outside the Web that are still richly alive. They are her particular ways of living outside the Web, but they are nonetheless imaginative and restorative. A marvelous box of wonders, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">How to Do Nothing</emphasis> is worth reading on these terms alone. Odell dives into the archives; she makes familiar landscapes seem rare and exhilarating; she extracts from familiar phrases new pearls of wisdom. Her encyclopedic impulse-she cites a wide range of thinkers, from Walter Benjamin and Hannah Arendt to Franco Berardi, Rebecca Solnit, and Jedediah Purdy-can make the book feel stitched together at times, but her profusion of quotes also often works. The jumps and connections can feel like a staggering, surprisingly hyperlinked Web page. Her book is also worth reading for the ways in which it follows one person's path toward liberation: As a deeply connected subject of the Internet, she shows us how she has found some peace.</p><p>Whereas Odell's visual and multimedia work drills down into the weirdness of networked life, illustrating for its viewers or readers what they weren't seeing before, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">How to Do Nothing</emphasis> invests its energy in mindfulness and argues that directing attention away from the network could lead to a better life. She is well aware of all the structural, economic, material, and emotional conflicts that the Internet has generated: the \"profitable state of anxiety, envy, and distraction\" that social media keep us in, and \"the cult of individuality and personal branding that grow out of such platforms and affect the way we think about our offline selves and the places where we actually live.\" But her idea of what resistance entails-sharpened focus, a more caring outlook, taking our time-makes it seem more like an individual choice rather than something that requires organized, concerted effort with others.</p><p>Even so, Odell's wide-ranging intelligence and curiosity make reading this book an escape of its own. One moment she's learning about the phenomenon of atmospheric rivers, which allows her to trace its trail of rain to the Philippines; the next she's ruminating on her biracial identity as a Filipina American. Following her along these trains of thought can be invigorating, even if the results can sometimes be unfocused. Odell might not offer answers to some of the larger questions that loom over her book, but she does provide us with a captivating portrait of someone struggling to formulate them on her own, and perhaps that is all she is after. Through her thinking and questioning, she helps us see how one might begin to reconnect with the world. If you do more of nothing, you might find time to indulge everything-in nature, in deep listening, in the communities already around you.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NATMAG-313853</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NATMAG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W54-V9J1-DXR3-2006-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">465017</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3263\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Nation Company, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Nation Magazine</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"7718\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 20, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008X7D</classCode><className>MANUFACTURING FACILITIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DFHJ</classCode><className>PHOTO &amp;

condition of being logged on is to submit yourself to a confusing line of questioning how do we know you \u2019 re real can you account for your sentience are you able to find the three matching stoplights in this grid of grainy images fulfilling these requests has become so routine that we barely reckon with the underlying question are you even a human the internet \u2019 s persistent and growing sense of fakeness is nothing new in 2013 after noticing the potential for site traffic to be dominated by bots engineers at youtube coined a term for the moment when they would no longer be able to distinguish human from nonhuman activity \u201c the inversion \u201d maybe we \u2019 ve already reached that threshold and maybe we don \u2019 t care that much every day we are faced with a mirage of fast moving feeds and the constant effort to make money off the internet \u2019 s users us has only amplified the confusion as an increasing number of stakeholders attempt to capture and define our wants creating more and more automated activities and algorithmic interactions it has also produced a ton of crap \u2014 in our minds on the web and in our world jenny odell a visual artist writer and stanford design lecturer is a spelunker of this massive ever growing dump her projects ranging from investigative journalism to performance art are driven by what she calls her \u201c strange fascination with the utter garbage of the internet \u201d for example her 2017 photo essay \u201c there \u2019 s no such thing as a free watch \u201d examines the strange junk and scams that proliferate in social media marketplaces following the clues left behind from north america to asia by an instagram ad offering a free luxury timepiece we find ourselves traversing vast spaces real and imagined retail websites stitched together from pilfered images factories in china supplying a legion of wristwatch peddlers direct message threads with unrepentant instagram hustlers fake brands identities and products are in constant gestation the watch odell tells us is just a \u201c physical witness \u201d to all the machinations and \u201c shifting winds \u201d of the various economic interests in pursuit of our eyeballs and wallets these snake oil salesmen are as real and integral to the global economy today as the people who make money in more traditional ways odell \u2019 s new book how to do nothing resisting the attention economy describes itself as a \u201c field guide \u201d for navigating this spiderweb of digital commerce but it is also about finding a way to escape from it to create more meaningful forms of work relationships and selves in the face of such an onslaught of fabrication the book expands on a talk she gave at the art and technology conference eyeo in it she weaves stories about her family her love of bird watching gilles deleuze \u2019 s idea of the \u201c right to say nothing \u201d and the importance of public space into lessons about how to live \u201c in a world where our value is determined by our productivity \u201d tying all these ideas together is odell \u2019 s notion that in the face of capitalist optimization \u201c doing nothing \u201d is \u201c an act of political resistance \u201d through our inactivity she insists we will be able to recover a more humane world in an accelerating age of commodification grounding her argument in the environment odell sidesteps the familiar advice \u201c just turn your smartphone off \u201d she doesn \u2019 t want us to escape from the world of sociability but rather make new communities or at least restore old ones for her it \u2019 s not about abandoning communication and technology but about using it for our own ends despite such bold prescriptions she doesn \u2019 t tell us exactly how we might go about doing this so much as offer up a meditation on why we should unlike her art how to do nothing is less a work of social criticism than of personal discovery it succeeds in detailing how one can willingly become addicted to the internet \u2019 s attention economy and calls on us to move away from it but it doesn \u2019 t fully confront those structures and forms of domination \u2014 24 7 surveillance big tech \u2019 s grip on basic services the proliferation of monopolies \u2014 that hinder so many of us from doing just that odell grew up in cupertino california a bay area suburb that \u2019 s home to dozens of tech companies the largest of which is apple she has from an early age been able to observe silicon valley \u2019 s changing fortunes from the dot com bubble to the start up explosion at the university of california berkeley she studied literature and art and wrote her thesis on emily dickinson \u2019 s fascicles the hand sewn booklets in which the poet kept her work after graduation odell entered an mfa program in design at the san francisco art institute where she started to develop her investigative art style which she compares to gathering \u201c open source intelligence \u201d or the sleuthing that one can do using the archives of publicly available information one of odell \u2019 s earlier projects satellite landscapes mined the archives of google maps \u2019 satellite images using photographs of power plants and waste processing sites she captured how the infrastructure necessary to meet human needs can seem monstrous and inhumane even as its operations sustain life as an artist in residence at the san francisco dump she continued to hone her internet sleuthing skills in an epic dumpster dive resulting in a collection of salvaged items that showed how even the most disparate pieces of trash are linked in her 2014 pipe dream she mined google maps once again this time she used its street views to illustrate how a crude oil pipeline connected portland maine with montreal one of odell \u2019 s most recent projects excavating calabazas creek used public records obtained from valley water silicon valley \u2019 s water management agency to examine how the modifications to a creek in cupertino explained her hometown \u2019 s evolving history from farm town to sleepy suburb to tech incubator as she puts it in her new book \u201c the creek is a reminder that we do not live in a simulation \u2014 a streamlined world of products results experiences reviews \u2014 but rather on a giant rock \u201d that is full of \u201c a deep weirdness a world of flowerings decompositions and seepages of a million crawling things of spores and lacy fungal filaments \u201d lately odell has also turned her sleuthing skills to reporting including her 2018 new york times feature \u201c a business with no end \u201d in it she tries to solve a mystery that one of her students at stanford brought to her unwanted packages from a company called valley fountain keep arriving at his parents \u2019 doorstep in palo alto odell traces the origin of this mail to a building in downtown san francisco that turns out to be home to 140 other companies with names like bropastures and your friend bart connected to amazon storefronts that peddle an amazing variety of items \u2014 \u201c fake facial wounds \u201d lamps makeup hemorrhoid creams \u2014 at a high markup at first odell thinks the whole scheme can be chalked up to drop shippers online retailers advertising items on social media that if purchased can be bought cheaply from a warehouse and then shipped to the customer but she soon learns that many of these drop shippers are people employed by a network of companies affiliated with olivet university a religious school operated by the korean pastor david jang the leader of an international christian group known as the community jang reportedly has a close financial relationship with religious publications like christian today and secular ones like the international business times and newsweek following a bread crumb trail of llcs odell manages to link the strange packages to this network of companies describing a dizzying series of events that culminates with investigators from the manhattan district attorney \u2019 s office raiding the offices of newsweek as well as a planned satellite campus that olivet was building on the site of an abandoned psychiatric hospital \u201c trying to map the connections between all these entities opens a gaping wormhole \u201d odell writes \u201c i couldn \u2019 t get over the idea that a church might be behind a network of used business books hair straighteners and suspiciously priced compression stockings \u2014 sold on amazon hellip all while running a once venerable american news publication into the ground \u201d while the reporting in the piece is breathtaking the experience of scrolling through \u201c a business with no end \u201d \u2014 with its uncanny article design made in collaboration with the artist tracy ma filled with screenshots from weird websites and frenetic animations that pop off the screen \u2014 has its own power mimicking the hallucinatory feeling of odell discovering and yet not fully pinning down all of these connections \u201c at some point i began to feel like i was in a dream or that i was half awake unable to distinguish the virtual from the real \u201d she writes the same is true for anyone who reads it \u201c a business with no end \u201d leaves its readers purposefully with more questions than answers odell cites frederic jameson as an inspiration and as she explained to me in an interview she \u2019 s trying to do something that jameson knew was almost futile to tell the story of objects caught in the often confounding space of \u201c the great global multinational and decentered communications network \u201d she hopes to dispel if only for a moment the confusion that comes from this space or at least to re create its discombobulating feeling so that we too are forced to ask ourselves if we are indeed human how to do nothing marks an important turn in odell \u2019 s work the attempt to find some peace and quiet in the midst of the internet \u2019 s chaos by imagining a new mind set and new ways of living as with her art and reporting odell finds herself covering a lot of terrain in that attempt she jumps from the lessons we can learn from the 19th century struggle for an eight hour workday to an analysis of the 1960s commune movement explaining that its apolitical nature led to failure but that its basic principle of retreat is integral to any resistance to today \u2019 s attention economy she also offers several tours of the locales in which her book was written and where she finds peace herself bringing readers from the rose gardens of oakland to the hills and hidden creeks that cut across the bay area while none of these things have much to do with the tech world or the internet odell gathers them into a larger theory about how we might detach ourselves from the compulsive sense of productivity demanded by digitization this is not to say that she doesn \u2019 t devote plenty of space to withering criticism of mark zuckerberg peter thiel tech libertarianism or silicon valley \u2019 s design fetish she does and all of it is sharply composed including an illuminating lesson on \u201c persuasive design \u201d \u2014 the constantly evolving strategies that tech companies use to grab our attention despite these moments of critical insight odell often proves to be more interested in the solution than in the problems that face us today by \u201c doing nothing \u201d she insists we can replant ourselves in a \u201c public physical realm \u201d odell focuses on two ways to achieve this the first is by reorienting more of our lives around bioregionalism we need a better understanding of how human activity is part of a \u201c complex web of relationships \u201d among the many life forms in a given community she also urges us to recognize the importance of the nonhuman perspectives that coexist in this web drawing from the environmentalist writings of peter berg she argues that knowing the details of a particular bioregion creates the conditions of mutual respect among the creatures \u2014 some human many not \u2014 that live there through a better sense of our immediate homes we can also create more geographically bounded social networks free of regulated interactions and the involvement of large corporations we can also understand the ways in which animals live alongside us which for odell leads to bird watching but could be any form of interaction with another species the crows of her neighborhood she tells us \u201c don \u2019 t see progress \u2014 they just see recurrence day after day week after week \u201d borrowing from donna haraway and martin buber she urges that we need to focus on where we are now to meet the world as it currently stands not impose our will and subjectivity on it while odell \u2019 s work has always been interested in how technology rewires our conception of the built environment the belief in the natural world she espouses in how to do nothing illustrates a shift in her interests junk and ephemera \u2014 the internet \u2019 s trash \u2014 were a route to understanding the bizarre mechanics of the digital economy they revealed the larger and often unseen structures of capitalism mostly facilitated by social media as it transformed individuals into consumers how to do nothing is aware of these imposing structures but odell imagines we can cope with their deleterious effects by denying them our attention and retraining our focus as a result her book is less concerned with confronting these structures head on one sympathizes with the impulse shutting off is a form of resistance and refusing to allow the shadowy structures that define almost all of our everyday digital interactions to define our lives as well is a political act yet the vested interest of social media platforms in constant user engagement and data is not simply going to vanish if we embark on an \u201c i and thou \u201d relationship with nature and spend more of our time outside as odell \u2019 s art and multimedia investigations have shown tech \u2019 s push for optimization and growth can easily be molded to new human desires they may currently proceed \u201c from a false view of life as atomized \u201d one that \u201c fails to recognize the ecosystem as a living whole that in fact needs all of its parts to function \u201d but what would stop an amazon or apple from trying to colonize those human desires that proceed from a truer more collective view of life odell writes about her concern that unfettered capitalism \u201c turn what was once a dense and thriving landscape of individual and communal thought into a monsanto farm whose lsquo production \u2019 slowly destroys the soil until nothing more can grow \u201d but without challenging these institutions directly can we really resist what they \u2019 re feeding us odell \u2019 s critique that commercial social media is destroying our shared mental ecosystem leads to a compelling if somewhat predictable argument if you hate your job and really hate how twitter makes you feel nature is just waiting for you to discover and care for it but her recommendations for making our way back to nature can feel a touch too mystical pauline oliveros \u2019 s idea of \u201c deep listening \u201d \u2014 the almost meditative practice of appreciating particular sounds in the immediate environment \u2014 may help develop a respect for our shared space but can it really power collective action citing cicero william james and melville \u2019 s \u201c bartleby the scrivener \u201d odell also argues that we can find a \u201c third space \u201d of social interaction in which to employ the tactics of \u201c refusal boycott and sabotage \u201d against the \u201c cycle where both financially driven platforms and overall precarity close down the space of attention \u201d but again it \u2019 s easy to wonder what will prevent these acts of resistance from themselves becoming another monetizable sector odell knows that we can \u2019 t escape the internet no matter how much we may want to but she does ask us to direct our attention and energies elsewhere the problem is that in today \u2019 s world we might need to direct more time and attention toward the internet if we are to liberate ourselves from its exploitation and excesses many are beginning to realize this google workers have marched out of their offices around the world in response to sexual misconduct at the company amazon employees are demanding fair wages and insisting that it refuse to work with oil companies consumers too have begun to boycott companies like amazon and uber for their abusive workplace practices odell acknowledges that \u201c doing nothing \u201d is a provisionary concept a \u201c way station \u201d to practical organizing she looks at the history of the 1934 san francisco general strike in her section on a \u201c third space \u201d but the kernel of truth it \u2019 s founded on is that the economic system as we know it does more harm than good and thus we need to create new terms of engagement that lead us not toward individual acts of resistance but toward collective action how to do nothing accomplishes something that neither the recent wave of internet histories shoshana zuboff \u2019 s the age of surveillance capitalism tim wu \u2019 s the attention merchants nor the popular self help books on digital detox have achieved odell helps readers discover ways of living outside the web that are still richly alive they are her particular ways of living outside the web but they are nonetheless imaginative and restorative a marvelous box of wonders how to do nothing is worth reading on these terms alone odell dives into the archives she makes familiar landscapes seem rare and exhilarating she extracts from familiar phrases new pearls of wisdom her encyclopedic impulse \u2014 she cites a wide range of thinkers from walter benjamin and hannah arendt to franco berardi rebecca solnit and jedediah purdy \u2014 can make the book feel stitched together at times but her profusion of quotes also often works the jumps and connections can feel like a staggering surprisingly hyperlinked web page her book is also worth reading for the ways in which it follows one person \u2019 s path toward liberation as a deeply connected subject of the internet she shows us how she has found some peace whereas odell \u2019 s visual and multimedia work drills down into the weirdness of networked life illustrating for its viewers or readers what they weren \u2019 t seeing before how to do nothing invests its energy in mindfulness and argues that directing attention away from the network could lead to a better life she is well aware of all the structural economic material and emotional conflicts that the internet has generated the \u201c profitable state of anxiety envy and distraction \u201d that social media keep us in and \u201c the cult of individuality and personal branding that grow out of such platforms and affect the way we think about our offline selves and the places where we actually live \u201d but her idea of what resistance entails \u2014 sharpened focus a more caring outlook taking our time \u2014 makes it seem more like an individual choice rather than something that requires organized concerted effort with others even so odell \u2019 s wide ranging intelligence and curiosity make reading this book an escape of its own one moment she \u2019 s learning about the phenomenon of atmospheric rivers which allows her to trace its trail of rain to the philippines the next she \u2019 s ruminating on her biracial identity as a filipina american following her along these trains of thought can be invigorating even if the results can sometimes be unfocused odell might not offer answers to some of the larger questions that loom over her book but she does provide us with a captivating portrait of someone struggling to formulate them on her own and perhaps that is all she is after through her thinking and questioning she helps us see how one might begin to reconnect with the world if you do more of nothing you might find time to indulge everything \u2014 in nature in deep listening in the communities already around youKeep on reading: Jenny Odell and the Quest to Log Off[1] [ 1]: </p><p><url

One proposal would see companies involved in the online media industry being judged by their market share.</p><p>Other radical proposals include allowing the British public and BBC staff to elect members of the BBC's governing board, the organisation that is responsible for setting strategy and ensuring the corporation fulfils its mission and public purpose. Similar arrangements could then be made for control of regional parts of the BBC.</p><p>Licence fee-payers would then choose individuals to represent their interests on the board, providing potential candidates met certain qualifying criteria. Online voting could be possible using the BBC accounts used to log in to services such as iPlayer.</p><p>Corbyn will also raise the prospect of charitable status for organisations that pursue not-for-profit investigative journalism, in addition to a new fund which would subsidise news outlets using money from the tech companies.</p><p>\"Google and news publishers in France and Belgium were able to agree a settlement,\" Corbyn is expected to say. \"If we can't do something similar here but on a more ambitious scale, we'll need to look at the option of a windfall tax on the digital monopolies to create a public interest media fund.\"</p><p>Other funds could be redirected to local, community and investigative news co-ops that pledged to hold local institutions to account.</p><p>Corbyn's team have been influenced on this point by <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/jul/02/grenfell-tower-local-newspapers-authority-journalism\">complaints from Grenfell Tower survivors</url> that an absence of local journalists due to newspaper cutbacks could have contributed to unsafe conditions at the west London tower block. Some residents suggested there was no press to campaign and speak on behalf of the community when concerns were first raised about the safety of new cladding.</p><p>The BBC declined to comment on Corbyn's suggestions, saying it did not talk about political parties' proposals for its future outside of licence fee and royal charter negotiations. </p><p>Facebook and Google also declined to comment on the proposals, though tech lobby groups pointed out that some firms, especially Google, had invested hundreds of millions in new journalistic projects.</p><p>Labour has already proposed extending Freedom of Information requests to cover outsourcing companies that take government contracts. Corbyn is now proposing to remove the veto that government ministers have on requests, which was used to block the publication of documents relating to the Iraq war.</p><p>Corbyn was one of the first MPs to get a personal website, has regularly backed alternative media, and has been a long-term user of social media from his days as a backbench MP.</p><p>He has had a testy relationship with the British media since becoming Labour's leader, despite often citing his brief spell in the 1960s as a reporter on the Newport and Market Drayton Advertiser.

Equity prices have swooned then recovered many times, and whether the economy collapses depends mostly on Washington policymakers wrecking things.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Americans emerged from World War II with worn-out cars and appliances, and the rush to replace sent the economy surging. Once consumers were satiated, the collapse in demand that followed precipitated a slowdown, and such boom-bust cycles repeated for several decades.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Beginning in the 1980s, an economy more based on services and technology became less vulnerable to such cyclical swings. And nascent artificial intelligence and logistics software helped businesses better anticipate demand to avoid overproduction and layoffs.</p><p> Until the financial crisis  which was precipitated by the disastrous government policy decisions to repeal Glass Steagall and ignore reckless mortgage lending and securities trading by banks, insurance companies and other, shadowy financial institutions  growth and unemployment became much less variable. Economists call these decades the Great Moderation.</p><p> Now with the financial crisis behind us, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is optimistic the economy can continue expanding and unemployment in check, but both the Fed chairman and president are giving stock investors a bad case of nerves.</p><p> Trade with China and our allies needs fixing. Everything from WTO rules to international postal rates has been rigged to give America a whopping trade deficit. Despite being the most competitive economy on the planet, we are racking up foreign debt to finance our deficits like pre-crisis Greece.</p><p> The broad tariffs on Chinese imports may be essential to resetting our trading relationship, but the administration has them substantially wrong.</p><p> From bicycles to pleasure boats, the administration has levied tariffs on imported components but not on the final products. That is driving manufacturers to move production or source more outside the United States  and basic product design, software, logistics and a multitude of other supporting service activities will follow.</p><p> The Fed is correct to gradually move up interest rates, because permanently low interest rates overinflate land and other asset values. However, Fed policy statements indicate its target federal funds rate is about 3.4 percent by early 2020, and that's well above what economists estimate is the neutral rate of interest that neither slows nor overheats the economy.</p><p> Mr. Powell, a lawyer and untrained and inexperienced at managing market expectations, is rattling equity investors by displaying agnosticism about our knowledge of such limits. If he doesn't change his tune  or perhaps get better advisers to write his score  he could literally scare the recent adjustment in stocks into a bull stampede and precipitate a recession.</p><p> The boom for big tech appears over as Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google are nearing market saturation and all face tough regulatory challenges. But where technology takes away, it also gives.</p><p> Artificial intelligence and robotics are spreading through the economy. Businesses are investing heavily in these and worker training, and investors need to seek out the next round of stars. Some will be among old line, dull companies like Walmart, which is learning to use the web to compete effectively with Amazon but mostly it's companies that are developing technologies like drones and driverless vehicles and those that build the robots and write the software that multiply the productivity of ordinary workers.</p><p> The rotation out of big tech and the difficulty of finding these new stars  especially, when startups are staying private longer  makes stocks more volatile and equity investing more difficult.

Bob Iger is a Democrat who had previously weighed running for president. He didn't explicitly link his company's move to the tax bill, but it's hard not to read the initatives that way.</p><p>Verizon</p><p>  Announced on CNBC as part of the telecom giant's fourth-quarter earnings rollout (emphasis added):</p><p>Verizonsays employees, other than top management, will receive 50 shares of restricted stock, the price of which will be set on February 1.</p><p>  About 155,000 employees will be affected, VerizonCEO <person><nameText>Lowell McAdam </nameText></person>told CNBC's ''Fast Money: Halftime Report'' on Tuesday. The award could total over $400 million, based on Verizon's current share price.</p><p>  The company said that it expects to reap an additional $3.5 billion to $4 billion in operating cash flow from the tax code change.</p><p>  JPMorgan</p><p>  Here's what the bank, whose C.E.O. has been a vocal proponent of the tax overhaul, is doing:</p><p>   Raising wages by about 10 percent on average, to between $15 and $18 an hour, and improving benefits</p><p>   Expanding branches, at a time when other banks are scaling back</p><p>   Raising philanthropic giving by 40 percent, to $1.75 billion, over five years</p><p>   Increasing lending to small businesses by $4 billion</p><p>   Improving lending to low- to -moderate-income communities and to affordable housing projects</p><p>  All that will cost an estimated $20 billion.</p><p>  The comparison to other corporate titans</p><p>Walmart is raising minimum hourly wage to $11, from $9; handing out bonuses; and improving parental benefits. The wage rise and bonuses will cost about $700 million.</p><p>AT&amp;T is handing out $1,000 bonuses to more than 200,000 employees and increasing capital spending by $1 billion. That's somewhere north of $1.2 bilion.</p><p>Boeing is committing about $300 million to corporate giving, ''training and education'' for its employees and ''workplace of the future'' initiatives.</p><p>  Worth remembering: Arguably the wage raises have as much to do with tight labor markets and the desire of companies to keep existing employees or attract new ones as they do with the tax code change.</p><p>  -- Michael J. de la Merced</p><p>  Mick Mulvaney to C.F.P.B. staff: No more envelope-pushing</p><p>  From a memo that Mr. Mulvaney, who is the acting chief (or one of two, depending on whom you ask) of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, sent to the agency's staffers today:</p><p>  Indeed, I think it is fair to say that the previous governing philosophy here was to aggressively ''push the envelope'' in pursuit of the ''mission;'' that we were the ''good guys'' and the ''new sheriff in town,'' out to fight the ''bad guys.''</p><p>  Simply put: that is what is going to be different. In fact, that entire governing philosophy of pushing the envelope frightens me a little. I would hope it would bother you as well.</p><p>  And:</p><p>  Writ large, I intend to exercise our statutory authority to enforce the laws of this nation. I intend to execute the statutory mandate of the Bureau to protect consumers. But we will no longer go beyond that mandate. If Congress wants us to do more than is set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act, they can change the law. Until then, we will enforce the law as currently written.</p><p>  The context: Mr. Mulvaney, a longtime critic of the C.F.P.B., has been working to rein in the bureau, a longtime target of Republican ire.</p><p>  -- Michael J. de la Merced</p><p>  Tension at the top of Airbnb</p><p>  The home rental company's C.E.O., Brian Chesky, isn't always seeing eye to eye with his C.F.O., Laurence Tosi, according to an article in The Information.</p><p>  In one instance, Mr. Chesky thought about starting an airline as Airbnb weighed a move into the air travel business. Mr. Tosi insisted on a lower-key approach of partnering with an existing app, according to the news site.</p><p>  The context: Mr. Tosi was brought in from Blackstone to help professionalize one of Silicon Valley's biggest unicorn darlings, much as Ruth Porat joined Alphabet from Morgan Stanley. That was more than likely to foster a clash between Silicon Valley idealism and Wall Street pragmatism.</p><p>  More from Cory Weinberg of The Information:</p><p>  Mr. Tosi, who moved with his wife and two young children to the Bay Area for the Airbnb job, has tried to fit in, swapping Wall Street suits for jeans and vests. But his arrival also was a shock to Airbnb's culture, with its emphasis on an idealistic brand. Mr. Tosi sent marching orders across the company in 2016 that it had to get profitable. Before Airbnb could go public, it would have to have a better handle on predicting its earnings. ''I believe we have built this path but can do more,'' he wrote to employees.</p><p>  Mr. Tosi initiated cost-cutting efforts, including cuts to customer service and food staff, that longtime Airbnb employees saw as hurting the culture. But Airbnb's cost per customer service ''ticket'' fell by 30% to 40% between 2016 and mid-2017 last year, an Airbnb official said, thanks largely to Mr. Tosi.</p><p>  Why it matters: Airbnb is expected to pursue an I.P.O. as soon as next year. Which vision for the company will win out?</p><p>  -- Michael J. de la Merced</p><p>  Was there fraud at KPMG?</p><p>  The charges against five former employees of KPMG and a former government accountant show the lengths an accounting firm will go to get a good report from the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.</p><p>  The indictment is a bit odd, though, because the defendants are accused of defrauding both the S.E.C. and the accounting board. They used confidential information to help deal with potential problems in KPMG's audits. But did getting a sneak peek at how they would be evaluated constitute theft, or just a form of cheating?</p><p>  Fraud is a type of larceny, and normally the perpetrator obtains something from the victim, who suffers a loss. But in this case, the scheme was to help KPMG clean up its act to get a better grade in pending reviews.</p><p>  In the world of white-collar crime, most fraud prosecutions involve at least some form of tangible gain to the defendants, and not a better report card. Courts have also required prosecutors to show there was at least some harm to the victim from the misuse of their property.</p><p>  One way around this issue would be to charge a breach of the honest services statute, but that's not in the indictment. Nor did the Justice Department charged them under a law prohibiting the theft of government records. The S.E.C. did not accuse the accountants of securities fraud, only that they engaged in unethical or improper professional conduct.</p><p>  A statement by Steven Peikin, the co-director of the S.E.C.'s enforcement division, said that the defendants were ''literally stealing the exam.'' I'm not sure that's quite accurate, however, as it was more like learning when the teacher would give a pop quiz.</p><p>  Is that a fraud?</p><p>  -- Peter J. Henning</p><p>  What will Twitter do now that Anthony Noto has flown the coop?</p><p>  At Twitter, Mr. Noto -- former Goldman Sachs banker, former N.F.L. finance chief -- was the highest-ranking full-time employee. (Jack Dorsey splits his time with Square, remember.)</p><p>  Now he will finally get to be a C.E.O. He'll have his hands full at SoFi.</p><p>  The social media network made clear that it has a contingency plan:</p><p>  Noto's responsibilities for the company's business operations and revenue generating operations will be assumed by other members of Twitter's leadership team. Matt Derella, Twitter's Vice President of Global Revenue and Operations, will continue to lead the company's advertising sales efforts.</p><p>  Mr. Dorsey offered his own statement on Mr. Noto's departure:</p><p>  -- Michael J. de la Merced</p><p>  Elon Musk swings for the fences</p><p>  He'll earn billions of dollars for leading Tesla over the next decade -- or nothing.</p><p>  That's under a new compensation plan that Andrew reported first today. Critics, and there are many, may regard it as yet another publicity stunt by the electric car marker, which has struggled to meet production targets for its Model 3.</p><p>  But Mr. Musk and the head of the Tesla board's compensation committee said the arrangement would benefit shareholders, since it's directly linked to company performance.</p><p>  Here's what Mr. Musk told Andrew:</p><p>  ''If all that happens over the next 10 years is that Tesla's value grows by 80 or 90 percent, then my amount of compensation would be zero,'' he said.

It seems as though investors are hopeful that the Fed will be cutting rates in the fall.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It is the final hour of trading on Wall Street, a brief stop earlier in the day, the Dow is now finally higher as we head to the close. Let me show you what investors are watching.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Jerome Powell says he doesn't -- doesn't see a recession looming, that in spite of new data that shows the risk of a downturn is rising.</p><p>And big tech under fire. Facebook and Google are facing antitrust investigations.</p><p>And aid arrives in the Bahamas. You'll hear how companies are helping.</p><p>Coming to you live here at the New York -- world financial capital -- New York City. It is Friday, September 6th, I am Zain Asher in for Richard Quest, and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p>A warm welcome, everyone. I am Zain Asher, no cause for alarm. The U.S. Fed Chairman says he is not expecting a recession anytime soon. That's despite a U.S. jobs report that showed the economy is losing some of its momentum -- 130,000 jobs were added last month, a solid number, but low expectations. Unemployment remained unchanged at 3.7 percent. The pace of hiring is slowing. The August number would have been worse without 25,000 temporary employees hired to help out with next year's U.S. Census. That's not denting Jerome Powell's outlook on the U.S. or global economy. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEROME POWELL, U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIRMAN: The consumer is in good shape, and really there's -- our main expectation is not at all that there'll be a recession. I did mention, though, that there are these risks, and we're monitoring them very carefully. And we're conducting policy in a way that will address them.</p><p>But no, I wouldn't see the recession as the most likely outcome for the United States or for the world economy for that matter.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASHER: Interesting. Our Matt Egan is here to dissect that. So Jerome Powell is saying that he doesn't see a recession looming, despite what we've talked about, about inverted yield curves et cetera et cetera. What do you think the analysis is based on in terms of economic evidence?</p><p>MATT EGAN, CNN BUSINESS LEAD WRITER: Well, you know, it's worth noting that Central Bankers are not going to actually just come out and say they see a recession coming, even if they do. So I guess it's not shocking that Jerome Powell said that. But he does have some reason to be optimistic here.</p><p>I mean, he pointed out that consumer spending has been strong. The labor market, yes, it's softening, but it still remains pretty solid. And so as long as that continues, consumers, you know, they make up the vast majority of the economy, so that can really overshadow some of the manufacturing problems being caused by the trade war. So that's why he's optimistic.</p><p>But listen, I mean, Powell did say the outlook is murky. He said there are significant risks. And he did acknowledge that the trade war is causing problems as far as business investment goes.</p><p>ASHER: One question that Jerome Powell seems to get asked quite a bit is about, you know, obviously, his relationship with Donald Trump and Donald Trump continuing to put pressure on the Fed in terms of cutting interest rates.</p><p>He was asked today, listen, is 2020 affecting any kind of calculation when it comes to cutting interest rates? His answer was, \"No, absolutely not.\" Obviously, his job is to make sure that the public knows that he isn't affected politically, despite Donald Trump continuing to influence him.</p><p>EGAN: Right. It's so interesting that this question keeps coming up. But I guess we should not be shocked by it. I mean, we had President Trump just tweeting again this week, I think it was today really kind of questioning Jerome Powell again.</p><p>And so the fact that you know, Powell just has to keep answering this question just shows how there is a lot of concern over, you know, the political impact here.</p><p>Also, in the background, there's that Bill Dudley op-ed that really got a lot of attention last week. And I think he was trying to sort of dispel any sort of notion that the Fed is playing politics. He said it really, really strongly. It was really the strongest thing he said all day, \"The Fed is completely focused on the economy.\"</p><p>ASHER: All right Matt Egan live for us there. Thank you so much. As you heard, the Fed Chairman did acknowledge, quote, \"significant risks ahead,\" namely, trade uncertainty and a global slowdown. The U.S. manufacturing is also struggling, too.</p><p>According to the Institute of Supply Management, the sector contracted for the first time in three years in August. The New York Federal Reserve appears less optimistic than Jerome Powell, it sees a 38 percent chance of a recession over the next 12 months and political tax on the Fed remain a constant feature.</p><p>A few hours ago, the U.S. President tweeted, \"Jerome Powell, where did I find this guy?\" Austan Goolsbee, is a former Chairman of the U.S. Council of Economic Advisers. He is now an Economics Professor at the University of Chicago Business School, and joins us live now from Chicago.</p><p>[15:05:14]</p><p>ASHER: So Austan, let's talk about the Jobs Report specifically, 130,000 jobs added. There was particular weakness in retail and energy. Manufacturing also showed a slowdown as well. Just give us your analysis.</p><p>AUSTAN GOOLSBEE, FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE U.S. COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS: I thought it was pretty weak, you know, and I liked that you highlighted that there was this temporary increase in employment from the hiring Census workers, which happens once every 10 years.</p><p>If you take out the government employment, the private sector employment was down under 100,000, which is okay. It's not like it was a terrible month. But it's just not very impressive and it was not what we were expecting.</p><p>And I think it just is another thing to throw into the bucket. There's two buckets. One bucket says recession is coming. And one bucket says no, no, we can inch this thing out a bit longer.</p><p>This one is somewhere between those two, but for the people who think that things are slowing down, this is kind of evidence of it slowing down.</p><p>ASHER: You had Jerome Powell there say that, you know, he is not factoring a recession in terms of the immediate future. What do you make of those comments? Would you agree with him? Does he have a point?</p><p>GOOLSBEE: I don't know that I would totally agree with him. But you know, as your previous guest described, you're very circumscribed in what you can say.</p><p>If he thought a recession was coming, he can't get up and say, \"Well, I'd say we've got a 90 percent chance of recession.\" So you've got to take the signals as they are given and they sometimes are subtle.</p><p>I think Chairman Powell clearly left it open for himself that he said, \"I don't foresee this as the most likely outcome that we would have a recession. But there are definitely risks. And we're going to keep our eye on those risks.\"</p><p>The irony here, of course, is that with the President of the United States, so actively hounding the Fed in an inappropriate manner, you know, both insulting but also trying to pressure the Fed. He is one of the things that is keeping the Fed from being more dovish than I think they would otherwise be.</p><p>Because if they just start doing what the President asks, there are going to be a lot of people who will say, \"Do we no longer have an independent Fed?\" So I kind of think the President is shooting himself in the foot a little bit here.</p><p>ASHER: That's a very interesting analysis. But you mentioned two buckets. One is sort of the good bucket in terms of what bodes well for us economic outlook. And obviously, the other bucket is the opposite. Wage growth in the U.S. coming in at 3.2 percent increase. What do you make of that?</p><p>GOOLSBEE: Yes, pretty strong. That's, you know, the strongest thing in the economy that if you are not nervous about recession, the two things you'd point to would be consumer confidence remains strong, and consumer spending is strong, and tied to that the labor market is very tight.</p><p>We're seeing wage growth finally. You know, the last two or three years, we've started to see wages kick up, where they were flat for a very long time. Those are our strongest components.</p><p>And then the weaker components are, we never really got anything like the increase in business investment from the tax cut that was promised that remains relatively weak.</p><p>The rate of change is kind of going the wrong way. The University of Michigan's consumer confidence numbers came out, and they had that. They showed the biggest drop in six years. So hopefully that's a blip and doesn't spread over, but confidence is -- you know, it's a shallow pool, and you've got to be careful diving in too fast in the shallow pool and you bang -- you knock your teeth out or something.</p><p>If you're counting on consumers to remain confident, even in the face of escalating trade wars, slowdowns around the world, and if we start getting some mediocre jobs numbers, I think that that might be overconfident in the consumer's ability to keep us above the fray.</p><p>ASHER: Austan Goolsbee, live for us. Thank you so much. Okay, let me give you a quick look at how U.S. markets are doing as we get into the last 55 minutes or so of trade. The Dow is continuing its winning streak, about 80 points or so despite that relatively lukewarm jobs report that Austan Goolsbee was just talking about there.</p><p>It looks set to end the week on a high, on optimism over renewed trade talks between the U.S. and China and most companies on the Dow, let's take a look, up firmly in the green. Intel, Boeing and Home Depot, the retailer among some of the best performers there.</p><p>All right, let's look across Europe now. European stocks finished the week with modest gains. All eyes will be on the ECB meeting next Thursday when the Central Bank is expected to turn out some new form of stimulus as well.</p><p>[15:10:11]</p><p>ASHER: And as you know, it has certainly been a stormy week in British politics and the Brexit turbulence is expected to continue. The latest is that the House of Lords has approved a bill to block a no deal Brexit delivering a second body blow today for the embattled Prime Minister.</p><p>Earlier, the country's opposition party said they intend to vote against a snap election when it is put to them on Monday. On the other hand, the U.K. High Court ruled that Mr. Johnson's government can prorogue or suspend Parliament next week.</p><p>All of that chaos has thrown British manufacturing into uncertainty. Businesses stockpiled in the first quarter, but output fell off sharply in the second quarter. Make U.K. represents the interests of British manufacturers. It's CEO, Stephen Phipson told me earlier that investment is down and the sector needs a deal with the Europe. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEPHEN PHIPSON, CEO, MAKE U.K.: People are unable to stockpile to the same extent. We're coming up for the Christmas period. Warehousing space is short. It is presenting quite a lot of changes to the manufacturing sector.</p><p>And in the meantime, what we're seeing is European orders are reducing, because obviously, people are uncertain of the terms of trade if we leave the E.U. without an orderly Brexit. And of course, that means investments has virtually come to a grinding halt.</p><p>So we need to see an end to this uncertainty. I think that's the critical message for our sector at the moment.</p><p>ASHER: So in terms of an end to uncertainly, there's really no end at this point in sight. What sort of reassurance do you need from the British government at this point?</p><p>PHIPSON: Well, we need to see a deal. The Prime Minister is constantly reassuring us that despite all the debate we see in public, they are working hard to get a deal. We are firmly behind that with the government. We absolutely need an orderly Brexit here to maintain confidence, and to really start the investment cycle back in the sector in this country.</p><p>So as soon as we can see some lights at the end of the tunnel of that, we will have a lot more certainty about the way forwards. But we've got to get through this very, very unstable situation that we're in politically at the moment, obviously.</p><p>ASHER: And so British manufacturing represents about 10 percent -- 10 percent of the U.K. economy overall. If the manufacturing sector there in the U.K. starts to really, really hurt more than it already is, what sort of wider implications will that have on the British economy as a whole, do you think?</p><p>PHIPSON: Well, I mean, 10 percent of GDP, that's the official number, but we are 45 percent of the exports of the country. And we're plus 600 billion in exports in total, 45 percent of that are manufactured goods. So it's a really important part of the economy of the country.</p><p>We have 2.7 million people employed. And obviously, if you look at investments, and particularly in R&amp;D investment, the manufacturing sector accounts for a very large part of that.</p><p>So it's an important sector and government is absolutely focused on making sure that we are fit for the future here. But we need an orderly Brexit to get us through this uncertain period. We need a deal with the E.U. to make sure as we leave the E.U., we do so in a way that doesn't damage this sector and restores confidence. And I think that's the clear message that we are making sure that government is hearing and they are hearing it and they're assuring us that they are going to work hard to get this deal across the line.</p><p>ASHER: And how has the fluctuations in the pound that we're seeing, how is that affecting the manufacturing sector? Because there is always this tug of war between, you know, obviously, how it benefits and hurts importers versus exporters.</p><p>PHIPSON: That's right. So you would have thought that there would have been a big benefit for our exporters with a weakening Sterling. And in some cases, that's happened. But if you combine really what's happening with the global trade difficulties with Brexit uncertainty, what we're seeing is a sharp decline in export orders, which means that effectively, some of that has been eroded by price reductions.</p><p>And of course, in this country, a lot of our work is buying materials in from overseas. And of course, they cost more money and then we transform those into finished products. And then they get shipped as export.</p><p>So really, it's at -- we've still seen a depressing set of numbers in terms of margins of businesses as those pressures have taken hold. So it hasn't benefited the exports of the country a great deal in terms of the reduction of Sterling.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASHER: And we're seeing more and more incredible scenes of devastation in the Bahamas as international aid begins to arrive there. We'll check what companies are doing to help.</p><p>[15:17:03]</p><p>ASHER: As international aid has started to arrive in the Bahamas, we're getting a clearer picture of the utter devastation Hurricane Dorian has caused. The death toll now stands at 30. But officials unfortunately expect that number to soar to what they call unimaginable levels.</p><p>Fears that some residents have made their way to heavily damaged Abaco Airport to wait for the aid and relief that is trickling in. Paula Newton has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PAULA NEWTON, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): It is so much worse than they had feared. The Abaco Islands forever scarred now by mass destruction. Home after home, entire rooftops blown away, debris scattered in unrecognizable heaps, boats tossed like confetti. The images belie the obvious question: How could anyone survive this?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Okay, okay, okay, okay. You're okay. It's going to be okay. We're going to be okay.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON (voice over): We arrived by helicopter in Man-o-War in Abaco with Billy Aubrey (ph), embracing his wife Shauna (ph) after days of not knowing if she was dead or alive.</p><p>Shauna (ph) hunkered down with friends in their Seaside home until the roof blew off and they all scrambled to find anything still standing.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON (on camera): So Nancy, this is what kept you guys alive. This little --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This little room kept us alive. This is it. We came in and hunkered down, and Shauna (ph) was on the ground crying, and we were just trying to --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I was hysterical.</p><p>NEWTON: What did it sound like in here at the time?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It was loud.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Well, there was a lot of crashing and banging and whirling.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Stuff, we thought, was coming through this wall.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON (voice-over): So many in the Abaco Islands lived through hours that resembled a horror movie, exposed to winds that topped 250 miles an hour like tornadoes touching down every minute.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHERRIE ROBERTS, SURVIVOR: Words can't describe it. I don't wish it on nobody. Nobody, words can't describe it. Because they could never categorize -- categorize this, never.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: My grandfather ran out in the middle --</p><p>ROBERTS: It was like an atomic bomb went off.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON (voice over): Residents here tell me their little island paradise is unrecognizable, even to them. They are resourceful and self-reliant, they say, but they could have never imagined a storm as powerful as Dorian.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON (on camera): You know, there's no better way to describe to you the force of Hurricane Dorian to be right here where people rode out the storm in their living rooms, in their dining rooms.</p><p>I mean, look at this. The roof blew off the house here. The entire kitchen came down. Their refrigerator ended up here on the ground. Their living room and dining room furniture is strewn all over. People describe these things being tossed around the island like projectiles. They all cowered, hovered in their bathrooms and closets, anything they could find to take shelter.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[15:20:12]</p><p>NEWTON (voice-over): There are now the beginnings of recovery but only the basics: medical attention, private helicopters to take out those who are sick, the elderly, young families.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEREMY SWEETING, ABACO ISLAND COUNCILOR: I'm sure it will never be the same again. But I mean, the people are strong here, and we're going to try to do our best to rebuild the best way we can. But we know it will never be the same.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON (voice over): This was a storm of biblical proportions, Abaconians tell me, and yes, they worry, it will take a miracle to recover from it all.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ASHER: Absolutely jaw dropping what those islands are experiencing right now. Last night we spoke to the CEO of Royal Caribbean International which is delivering meals and other aid to the Bahamas. It something we're seeing across the cruise ship industry. Carnival, Paradise, Disney as well and Norwegian Cruise Lines are also donating money and resources as well.</p><p>And with such mammoth effort needed to help the islands, DHL is deploying its Disaster Response Team to the islands helping with cargo and logistics.</p><p>Christine Nashick is the DHL Chief Executive for the Caribbean. She joins us live now from Florida. Christine, thank you so much for being with us. So just walk us through what DHL's role in terms of facilitating aid to the Bahamas right now.</p><p>CHRISTINE NASHICK, CHIEF EXECUTIVE FOR THE CARIBBEAN, DHL: Sure, I'm happy to. Our Disaster Response Team, as you mentioned, went in several days ago, and our Disaster Response Team is made up of a group of individuals with core competencies of logistics, and they go in and first and foremost, remove the bottlenecks that you can imagine exist in logistics at the airport.</p><p>So we make sure that we clear up and are able to take in goods and make sure that they get as quickly as possible to impacted communities.</p><p>ASHER: So when you think about just how some of the infrastructure on the ground there in the Bahamas is completely decimated and ruined, how much harder does that make it actually get aid to where it's needed?</p><p>NASHICK: Sure, it makes it very complex, certainly the Bahamas are known for tourism. So they're used to taking people into the airports and not cargo. So now there's an influx of many cargo planes that are coming in and making sure that we can quickly get the goods off of the planes and into people's hands who are impacted is most important.</p><p>But one of the biggest complex issues is the fact of getting to the islands that are truly impacted. And right now Freeport, for instance, we need to open up so making sure that we can get our planes there are important.</p><p>ASHER: How do you train your volunteers for these types of disasters?</p><p>NASHICK: So we have about 500 volunteers across all of our 222 countries in our network, and they come together and they go through very extensive training that really is compared to almost like a boot camp. So that once they go into a disaster area, they can be accustomed to anything because as you can imagine there normally is -- there's lack of connectivity, there's lack of telecommunications, et cetera, maybe not even ideal places to stay.</p><p>So they're very used to going in and making do and making sure that they can add immediate impact.</p><p>ASHER: It's been less than a week since the eye of the storm hit the Bahamas and the storm moved so slowly that it hovered around the Bahamas for quite a while. How quickly can you mobilize teams on the ground after a disaster hits and after the storm passes?</p><p>NASHICK: Sure, within 72 hours. So we were watching Dorian very closely to see where we might need to go in, so a team was automatically formed from several countries in the Americas. And it was just a matter of knowing when and where we were going to deploy them.</p><p>So as soon as Monday came and we realized it was definitely the Bahamas where we needed to deploy, we made sure that our people got there by Wednesday. So we currently have a team of six individuals there who are working closely with the local team in Bahamas.</p><p>ASHER: So what is an airport like, just in terms of logistics, just in terms of the overall sort of backlog, et cetera? What is it like after experiencing a hurricane of this proportion?</p><p>NASHICK: Sure. I think just like a lot of the Bahamas, it's a bit of a daze. They're not used to dealing with something that's truly as chaotic as what a disaster creates.</p><p>So a lot of people looking for knowledge and know-how, how do I get in goods? Do I pay duties? What paperwork do I need? Et cetera. So really helping streamline the whole process is what is being done currently at the airport because a lot of people with very good intentions and we want to make sure all of the great stuff that's been donated gets to the impacted communities.</p><p>ASHER: Thank you for all the work that you're doing, Christine Nashick, live for us. Thank you.</p><p>Okay, so we told you what company are doing to help and if you would like to help the victims of Hurricane Dorian, head to our special Impact Your World website. On that website, you're going to find list of several aid organizations. All of these organizations are working to help those in the Bahamas and elsewhere who have been devastated by this storm.

Schultz says not enough people are willing to back an independent candidate.</p><p>As we just told you, long-time Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe has died in Singapore, age 95. His successor President Emmerson Mnangagwa has declared national days of mourning until his burial. David McKenzie is joining us from Harare. So, David, as we've been saying time and time again, Mugabe had an extremely complicated relationship with the people of Zimbabwe. What are people saying in Harare about his passing?</p><p>DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, it's quite striking when these liberation icons like Robert Mugabe dies, it's a huge deal. And I think back to when Nelson Mandela died in South Africa and the outpouring of emotion on to the streets and celebration of his life that happened spontaneously.</p><p>[15:35:00]</p><p>Barely a ripple here in Harare, the capital. People going along their daily routines, just trying to survive in an economy that is barely struggling to survive itself. And I think that speaks to the legacy of Robert Mugabe, which it is one of a liberation icon, but also someone who really ruled this country into the ground. Here's some people that we spoke to on the ground that speak to that complicated legacy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Africa, we have lost an icon. We have lost a liberator. A man who stood for the African skin, a man who stood for us. President Mugabe, his legacy will remain forever. And I doubt that even here in Zimbabwe, we'll get a man like Robert Mugabe.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: My name is Robert Isyetz(ph), I was named after him, I was born in 1982, soon after our independence. Then as time goes on, we begin to see the true colors, his true colors. I was here in 2008 when he forced people, when he forced us on -- when he forced himself on us. People were raped, killed just because of him.</p><p>MCKENZIE: Because of the election?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Because of the election which he had lost.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCKENZIE: Well, the real emotion on the streets here was of course when Robert Mugabe was ousted in that apparent coup. You had people celebrating all night because of that eventual demise of his political career. And so right now, the reaction is muted.</p><p>You had Emmerson Mnangagwa coming back from Cape Town, the World Economic Forum, calling Robert Mugabe a teacher and icon, someone who led this country into a democratic space. Really glossing over, not even mentioning some of the more sensitive parts of his legacy, and that's being the case with most leaders and liberation movements across the country.</p><p>You know, recently, I got off the phone with a leading human rights lawyer here, he says he's tired of this way of glossing over the legacy of someone like Robert Mugabe and focusing only on the positives. This is a Zimbabwean and he said, well, people should learn to call a spade a spade in his words.</p><p>ASHER: And David, just give us more, tell us more a bit more about the reaction from Emmerson Mnangagwa because he sort of helped bring Mugabe down, but at the same time, he was a close political ally. What was their relationship like?</p><p>MCKENZIE: Well, certainly, he was instrumental in bringing Mugabe down, he was working closely with the military behind the scenes before that apparent coup that pushed Mugabe out of power. Emmerson Mnangagwa felt that he should have been the chosen successor of Mugabe, but when it became clear through the actions and words of Mugabe, and when he pushed out Emmerson as his deputy, that Grace Mugabe, the then first lady would potentially have a very key role after Mugabe died.</p><p>That was really the catalyst for this coup that pushed out Robert Mugabe. So, there was an interesting moment I felt when Mnangagwa praised Grace Mugabe fulsomely towards the end of that statement to the nation and really tried to perhaps repair some of those broken bonds between himself and the family of Robert Mugabe.</p><p>Perhaps trying to pave the way for a state funeral. They did say that ZANU-PF, the party which had really been made in Mugabe's image has given them -- him, the status of a national hero. As though Mugabe himself quite recently reportedly said he didn't want to be buried in the Heroes Acre close to Harare where all those liberation struggle icons have been buried. Zain.</p><p>ASHER: All right, David McKenzie live for us there, thank you so much. Robert Mugabe leaves behind a difficult economic legacy as well. In 2008, Mugabe won a highly controversial election. The economy shrank by 18 percent and inflation soared. The Zimbabwean dollar became so weak, the country started using the U.S. dollar the following year.</p><p>At the height of the crisis, prices doubled every 24 hours. Inflation peaked at a staggering 7. 9 billion percent. Today, Zimbabwe's national currency is back, inflation is at its highest point in a decade and people are struggling to buy basic goods. Tendai Biti is leading figure for the opposition in Zimbabwe, he also served as Zimbabwe's Finance Minister from 2009 to 2013. Mr. Biti joins us live now from Harare.</p><p>So, Mr. Biti, thank you so much for being with us, just walk us through how you are coming to terms with the death of Mr. Mugabe?</p><p>[15:40:00]</p><p>TENDAI BITI, FORMER ZIMBABWEAN FINANCE MINISTER: Well, it's a coalition of contradictions. On one hand, you've got the undisputed legacy of a liberator, and that no one can take away from Mr. Mugabe. On the other hand, you have the challenge, and a new challenge all for the way Mugabe governed our country.</p><p>The history of close-up, the history of human rights that include Gukurahundi where 30,000 people were killed between 1982 and 1987. Yes, of course, the challenges of economic mismanagement, a hyper inflation that rose to 500 percent. You've got the challenge of a leader who never transformed from being a liberator to unifier, liberator to a transformer.</p><p>And regrettably, we're still paying the price today. Twenty two months after his departure, the country is in the worst position, the country is in a terrible position, and that's the legacy of President Mugabe.</p><p>ASHER: And so what should Mnangagwa be doing differently? Because a lot of people had hoped that when Mugabe was ousted, that it would herald a new era in Zimbabwe economic. But as I mentioned, people are still struggling, there's an issue with food shortages. Just walk us through what Mnangagwa should be doing.</p><p>BITI: Well, the problem -- the problem is Mnangagwa himself. The reality is that the thousands of people who marched in November of 2017, the thousands of people who celebrated the departure of President Mugabe in November of 2017. Many of them if they could, they would actually withdraw their much and their support because 22 months after the coup of November, 2017, the reality is there are the people that it was not OK to remove Mugabe the man without addressing Mugabe the system.</p><p>Now, Mugabe the system is in full operation in Zimbabwe. And Mnangagwa has been so bad that it has made Mugabe look like a saint, and President Mugabe certainly was not a saint. With the situations of massive violence, people were shot in August of 2018, people were shot in January of 2019. Inflation is now around 700 percent, GDP growth rate will be about -7 percent in 2019.</p><p>So, people are beginning to appreciate that there was some value, some decency in Robert Mugabe which is sadly lacking with Mnangagwa and the president, rulers of Zimbabwe.</p><p>ASHER: All right, Tendai Biti, we have to leave it there, thank you so much for sharing your thoughts with us. All right, when we come back, is big tech heading for big trouble again? Another wave of anti-trust probes hits Silicon Valley. That's next.</p><p>[15:45:00]</p><p>ASHER: A group of American states are going after Facebook, accusing it of stifling competition and putting users at risk. The coalition of eight states is launching an anti-trust investigation into the social network, and it's not the only target for regulators. CNN has also learned that dozens of states led by Texas are investigating whether Google is in breach of anti-trust laws as well. Brian Fung joins us live now.</p><p>So, Brian, I just want to start with Facebook, what's been investigated here?</p><p>BRIAN FUNG, CNN TECHNOLOGY REPORTER: Yes, well, this is a big new risk for Facebook here. You have a number of states looking at Google -- I'm sorry, for Facebook and whether or not it has harmed consumers in terms of the way it's handled user data, in terms of the way that it's purchased a potential competitor, and in terms of the way that it has had an impact on the advertising market.</p><p>Now, the New York Attorney General's office has a lot of powerful tools here that it can use. And I spoke to Tim Woo, who say Columbia University law professor who has called for the break-up of Facebook and who has previously worked for the New York Attorney General's office.</p><p>He told me that the AG's can use federal anti-trust law against Facebook, they can depose witnesses, potentially including Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook, they could subpoena documents in e-mails from companies like Facebook, but also potentially other companies that may have had communications with Facebook as well.</p><p>You know, this obviously comes as Texas, meanwhile, on Monday is expected to announce a major anti-trust investigation of Google along with several other U.S. states and attorneys general. We're hearing that as many as two dozen or perhaps three dozen states may be involved in that effort. And it will be looking at a lot of the same issues, and whether Google has been potentially acting anti-competitively in the advertising market.</p><p>So, all in all, Zain, this is a very big risk for Silicon Valley here as, you know, state and federal officials increase their scrutiny of the tech industry.</p><p>ASHER: And what has Facebook specifically said in response to this investigational probe?</p><p>FUNG: Well, Facebook hasn't responded to our request for comment, but it has, you know, maintained all along that it is seeking out interactions with regulators around the world looking to develop policies to move forward on things like how to share data equitably, how to ensure that consumers information is protected and so on and so forth.</p><p>And also maintains that, you know, Facebook is part of a vibrant competitive eco-system of social media companies, and that's reflected in the enormous amount of interest that users have in going, you know, to Twitter, for example and other alternative social networks.</p><p>ASHER: And beyond, I guess, the break-up of Facebook, what specifically, what else specifically are these attorney generals looking for?</p><p>FUNG: Well, typically, when these investigations begin, they're looking at specific types of conduct or behaviors that the companies may be engaged in, that may violate the nation's anti-trust laws. And typically, you know, what they look for is evidence that perhaps, maybe prices have been affected, particularly in advertising or whether or not consumers have experienced an increase in price or a harm to competition and the choices that they have in the marketplace.</p><p>ASHER: Brian Fung, live for us, enjoy your weekend, thank you. When we come back, a case of sky high sabotage. An American Airlines mechanic is accused of tinkering with vital aircraft data systems. That's next.</p><p>[15:50:00]</p><p>ASHER: An American Airlines mechanic appeared in court earlier today after being arrested for allegedly trying to sabotage an airliner. Investigators say he attempted to disable part of the plane's navigation system shortly before it took off from Miami International Airport in July with 150 people on board. The mechanic is expected back in court on Wednesday.</p><p>CNN's Rene Marsh joins us live now. So, Rene, apparently, he had tried to sabotage this airliner. Just walk us through specifically what he's accused of doing.</p><p>RENE MARSH, CNN AVIATION &amp; GOVERNMENT REGULATION CORRESPONDENT: Right, so the official charge, Zain, is that he willfully damaged, destroyed, disabled and he's also accused of wrecking an aircraft or attempting to do so. As you mentioned, he was in court, he didn't enter a plea, he'll be back in court on Wednesday.</p><p>But the focus is on this part of the plane, it's a part of the plane's navigation system where he essentially -- he put a piece of styrofoam and super glue to block a part of this navigation system which is essential in providing pilots with critical information like the speed of the plane, the altitude of the plane, all pieces of data that pilots certainly need to safely fly a plane or even take off.</p><p>And when he spoke to investigators about why he did this, mind you, there were 150 people on board this plane and this plane was already rolling down the runway, ready for takeoff when the pilots actually realized what was going on and aborted that takeoff.</p><p>So, everyone was safe, but still scary moments. He told investigators, this airline mechanic that he did this because, you know, he was upset about the union dispute with American Airlines, they've been in back and forth, a bitter dispute here between the workers union and the airline.</p><p>And he thought that by making that issue with the plane's systems, that would essentially delay the flight. He said he didn't intend on harming anyone, but he wanted to delay the flight so that he would then be called in to fix that issue that he created and then gain himself some overtime.</p><p>So, this was his plot, and this was his scheme to get some overtime, certainly, not an issue that is making both authorities, the airline happy at all. We know that the airline has suspended him as this makes its way through the court, Zain.</p><p>ASHER: So, could passengers have actually been harmed because of this?</p><p>MARSH: Look, I will say this. Aircraft like this, they're extremely complex, they have a lot of redundancies. However, it has the capability of creating confusion, busying the pilots at a point that is a critical point, take off and landings are the most crucial part of flight.</p><p>[15:55:00]</p><p>So, what you don't want is a situation where they are not receiving the correct reading from their instrument or they're busying themselves trying to figure out what is going on and becoming distracted at a critical point of flight. So things worked out well here, yes, there are redundancies on these planes to prevent something catastrophic.</p><p>However, you know, you don't want to introduce a situation where the pilots are just getting bad readings on their instruments. We don't know. Could it have led to a larger issue? It's possible, but again, there are redundancies on the plane.</p><p>ASHER: So, can airlines do anything to prevent this sort of thing from happening?</p><p>MARSH: So, the insider threat, and this would certainly fall in that category as an insider threat. It's a tougher thing to battle. Congress has said, and it is on the record saying as recently as about two years ago that airlines and airports, they do need to do a better job at assessing this insider threat and preventing it.</p><p>One way to do that is keeping close tabs on people who might have grudges, who also might perform acts like this, criminal acts like this, not necessarily tied to terrorism, but more of a criminal act. Just paying closer attention to the vetting of people who have access to the aircraft. So, there certainly needs to be some work done in this area, this proves that there's this vulnerability.</p><p>ASHER: Right, Rene Marsh live for us there, thank you so much. And now there are just moments left to trade on Wall Street, about four minutes, in fact, we'll have the final numbers in the closing bell after this.</p><p>ASHER: All right, there are just moments left to trade on Wall Street. The major U.S. indices are set to close flat, the Dow is up ever so slightly about 70 points or so, even jobs report disappointed, there's optimism over trade talks with China.</p><p>Let's look at the Dow components. Specifically, most of the companies here you can see are ending the day in the green, top performers, thank you. Intel, Home Depot and Cisco. OK, that is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, it's been a pleasure, I am Zain Asher in New York, \"THE LEAD\" with Jake Tapper\" starts right now.</p><p>(BELL RINGING)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2019090601cbk27</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X0J-R7N1-DXH2-6385-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7453\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 6, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The investigation, which is seeking confidential information from Canadian businesses, will include a particular focus on \u201cpotential abuse of dominance,\u201d the watchdog said.     \u201cThe bureau is examining whether Amazon is engaging in conduct on its Canadian marketplace, Amazon.ca, that is impacting competition to the detriment of consumers and companies that do business in Canada,\u201d the agency said in a release Friday.   Specifically, it is reviewing whether Amazon policies impact sellers\u2019 willingness to offer their products at a lower price on other retail channels, such as their own websites or rival online marketplaces.     jetcityimage via    The bureau is also looking into any efforts by Amazon to tilt consumers toward its own products over those offered by competing vendors, as well as any disadvantage that sellers incur by opting out of Amazon\u2019s shipping, customer relations and advertising services.   Amazon said it is co-operating with the bureau\u2019s probe and will continue working to support small businesses that sell products on Amazon.ca.   The investigation is ongoing and there is no conclusion of wrongdoing at this point, the bureau said.   The agency\u2019s request for public input comes amid rising concerns of monopoly power in the tech world and questions around the use of sellers\u2019 data to create rival products.   Last month, CEOs from some of the biggest U.S. tech titans faced tough questions from congressional lawmakers over market dominance and whether they need to be regulated more heavily, or even broken up.   The potential conflict of interest between Amazon\u2019s role as both a platform to sell goods and a seller of goods itself remains a key area of concern.   \u201cThe main issue, which came up at the congressional hearing in July, is that Amazon can collect data on its \u2018competitors\u2019 \u2014 i.e. sellers who use Amazon \u2014 and then develop products that compete with those sellers,\u201d said Kean Birch, who heads York University\u2019s graduate program in science and technology studies, in an email.  Cautionary tale  Birch pointed to the cautionary tale of Diapers.com, which Amazon elbowed out of the market by discounting rival brands on Amazon.com in 2009 before buying up the depleted online retailer the following year.   Restrictive contractual provisions between Amazon and the sellers in its online marketplace may also be under the Competition Bureau microscope.   \u201cIf I\u2019m some kind of competitor to Amazon \u2014 Adidas or Nike, say \u2014 one way I could compete would be to say, \u2018Hey, because of my lower cost structure, I\u2019ll be able to sell products to consumers at lower prices,\u2019\u201d said John Newman, a former Justice Department antitrust lawyer who now teaches law at the University of Miami.   \u201cBut if Adidas can\u2019t sell any products on its website or elsewhere at a lower price than it sells on Amazon (due to contractual terms), then it makes it harder to do that.\u201d   The outcome may be to drive prices down in the near term \u2014 the opposite of traditional monopolistic goals \u2014 but they could rise down the road as power concentrates in the hands of a dominant player.   \u201cThis kind of thing could suppress competition, prevent some innovative new company from entering the market and deprive us of all the wonderful but intangible benefits of innovation,\u201d Newman said in an interview.   In July 2019, the European Commission launched a formal antitrust investigation into Amazon to examine whether its data use violates competition rules. The U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission have also opened investigations into the four Big Tech companies \u2014 Google, FacebookApple and Amazon \u2014 to suss out whether they were engaging in monopolistic activities.   The Competition Bureau probe, which kicked off quietly early this year, could result in a negotiated settlement or a case before the Competition Tribunal \u2014 if the investigation uncovers any contravention of Competition Act provisions.   \u201cRemedies under these provisions are primarily behavioural, including ordering an action to be taken or prohibiting an action from being taken, but can also include administrative monetary penalties,\u201d spokesman Jayme Albert said in an email.   It declined to confirm whether a broader investigation of other Big Tech companies is ongoing, \u201cas the bureau is required by law to conduct its work confidentially.\u201d   This report by The

Rand Paul expected to try to limit the amount of aid to Israel</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sheryl Sandberg, Chief Operating Officer, Facebook. (CC BY-SA Scanlan, Wikimedia Commons)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tell your friends to sign up for the Daily Kickoff here or for early 7AM access via Debut Inbox</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">THE CONVERSATION CONTINUES \u2014 Michael Koplow writes\u2026 \"Jewish Insider now reports that Sen. Rand Paul is expected to try and limit the amount of aid to Israel under the MOU legislation. AIPAC, CUFI, and other lobbying groups are naturally trying to get Paul to relent given the importance of support for Israel as a critical military ally of the U.S. But the real story here, which is not evident from the headlines, is not about Paul's stance on Israel but about his stance toward the Palestinians, and demonstrates why the general lack of public forthrightness from the pro-Israel community regarding the Palestinians is hurting Israel in tangible ways.\"</p><p>\"If you are Rand Paul, a staunchly conservative Republican senator, it is not surprising that you view the Palestinian Authority as Israel's mortal enemy, or that you view security assistance to the Palestinians as eroding Israel's security. The discourse in the pro-Israel community, and particularly on the right, supports that point of view. In that telling, all Palestinians reject Israel's right to exist, the Palestinian Authority is a terrorist organization led by terrorist mastermind Mahmoud Abbas.\"</p><p>\"Those with a more nuanced understanding, including nearly all mainstream American Jewish organizations and the Israeli government, know this narrative is a caricature. Sophisticated observers know that not only is the PA not carrying out terrorist attacks \u2013 although it is certainly abetting them through its martyrs fund \u2013 but that it is a vital and cooperative security partner of Israel\u2026 But in the current environment\u2026 where many American politicians and Jewish groups do not want to be caught on the record as defending aid to the Palestinians in any way while the Trump administration wages diplomatic war on Abbas, the caricatured narrative spreads unopposed like wildfire.\"</p><p>\"And thus you have Paul making the critical error of thinking that eliminating security assistance to the PA will somehow benefit Israel's security, and insisting that doing so will create the conditions in which Israel will need less security assistance rather than more. In fact, eliminating the relatively paltry $35 million in security assistance to the PA security forces will end up costing Israel orders of magnitude more if the result is that the PA security apparatus disappears or stops its coordination with Israel, forcing Israel to assume the enormous costs of policing the entire West Bank.\" [IsraelPolicyForum]</p><p>Sander Gerber, architect of the Taylor Force Act, emails: \"Koplow is right that many of the leading pro-Israel organizations avoid an honest assessment of the Palestinian Authority and he raises what was the critical stumbling block to the Taylor Force Act: the benefit of security cooperation with Israel. There is a diversity of opinions. But Generals Bogie Yaalon and Amos Yadlin, amongst Israel's very most respected senior military strategists, concluded that Israel should no longer allow herself to be blackmailed by the PA.\"</p><p>\"And the Knesset overwhelming passed the Stern/Dichter Law, two more highly respected security leaders, to drastically cut money transfers to the PA \u2014 without allowing for a security waiver. Thus, says the Israeli government: PA security assistance is great, but there should be zero tolerance for Pay-for-Slay. Besides limited security assistance, the PA continues to institutionally radicalize its population to officially hate and kill Israelis (as well as Palestinians who sell land to Jews). Polls show that the Palestinians distrust the PA, for good reason, the rampant self-dealing corruption is inimical to peace for the Palestinian people. An open conversation about the PA must evaluate whether the PA itself is a barrier to peace.\"</p><p>TOP TALKER \u2014 CNN fired political commentator Marc Lamont Hill on Thursday following comments he made a day earlier at the United Nations about Israel and his call for a \"free Palestine from the river to the sea.\" Hill's remarks coincided with a special weeklong CNN series on the rise of anti-Semitism across Europe.</p><p>Hill attempted to push back against criticism of his remarks: \"I do not support anti-Semitism, killing Jewish people, or any of the other things attributed to my speech. I have spent my life fighting these things.\"</p><p>CNN's decision to fire Hill drew mixed reactions. Israeli officials and Jewish organizations welcomed the move, but some conservatives said the network's statement didn't go far enough. In a statement, ZOA's Mort Klein said he was \"disappointed\" that CNN didn't announce the reason for Hill's termination. \"In light of recent alarming, hateful violent attacks on Jews\u2026 it is vital for major national news outlets such as CNN to make it clear that calling for violence against Jews is beyond repugnant, wholly unacceptable and intolerable,\" Klein said.</p><p>Glenn Greenwald writes: \"Hill's firing from CNN is a major victory for the growing so-called \"online call-out culture\" in which people who express controversial political views are not merely critiqued but demonized online and then formally and institutionally punished after a mob consolidates in outrage\u2026 Some on the pro-Israel right who agitated for Hill's firing have previously mocked what they call \"outrage culture,\" in which people are fired for controversial comments.\"</p><p>In his piece, Greenwald references Daniella Greenbaum Davis, the former Business Insider columnist who resigned after the site deleted her column defending actress Scarlett Johansson's role as a transgender man.</p><p>In an email this morning, Greenbaum Davis tells us: \"I'm very much of two minds about Marc Lamont Hill and the recent brouhaha in which he finds himself embroiled. Two things are clear to me. The first is that Hill is an anti-Semite who badly hides his Jew-hatred behind the veil of a progressively-inspired criticism of certain Israeli policies. The second is that nothing has changed about his views in the last week. CNN knew exactly what views and perspectives and beliefs they were showcasing when they chose to put him on the air.\"</p><p>\"I might cheer Hill's downfall in another situation if I truly believed we were putting his asinine and morally repugnant views to bed. But I can't cheer at the thought of yet another victim of the Twitter outrage machine. To be perfectly clear: people have the right to be outraged at his remarks, and outraged that CNN deemed them so worthy of highlighting.\"</p><p>\"But, and this is the big but, we can't defeat bad speech or bad ideas by trying to regulate or silence them out of existence. The only way to defeat bad thoughts is with good ones. Sunshine is the best disinfectant. I would have much preferred for CNN to invite Hill to explain the full-range of his ideas in a debate against an articulate and passionate Zionist. And, I would have much preferred that if CNN did decide they could no longer, in good conscience, put Hill on the air, that they would make that decision freely and on their own. Editorial decisions should not be made by people on Twitter.\"</p><p>Rep.-elect Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) jumps in and tweets: \"Calling out the oppressive policies in Israel, advocating for Palestinians to be respected, and for Israelis and Palestinians alike to have peace and freedom is not anti-Semitic. CNN, we all have a right to speak up about injustice any and everywhere.\"</p><p>DRIVING THE DAY \u2014 Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer, pleads guilty to lying to Congress about Moscow project \u2014 by Rosalind S. Helderman: \"President Trump's former personal attorney Michael Cohen pleaded guilty Thursday in New York to lying to Congress about a Moscow real estate project that Trump and his company pursued at the same time he was running for president.\" [WashPost] \u2022 The Trump Organization Planned To Give Vladimir Putin The $50 Million Penthouse In Trump Tower Moscow [Buzzfeed]</p><p>IN THE SPOTLIGHT \u2014 Sheryl Sandberg Is Said to Have Asked Facebook Staff to Research George Soros \u2014 by Nicholas Confessore and Matthew Rosenberg: \"Sheryl Sandberg asked Facebook's communications staff to research George Soros's financial interests in the wake of his high-profile attacks on tech companies\u2026 at the World Economic Forum\u2026 Ms. Sandberg \u2014 who was at the forum, but was not present for Mr. Soros's speech, according to a person who attended it \u2014 requested an examination into why Mr. Soros had criticized the tech companies and whether he stood to gain financially from the attacks\u2026 In a statement, Facebook said that the company had already begun researching Mr. Soros when Ms. Sandberg made her request.\"</p><p>\"In a private meeting on Thursday, Ms. Sandberg again distanced herself from Definers and its research into Mr. Soros, according to Rashad Robinson, head of the racial-justice group Color of Change, which was named in a Definers memo about Mr. Soros. Mr. Robinson said that while meeting with Ms. Sandberg, she denied hiring Definers or directing the firm's research.\" [NYTimes; BuzzFeed]</p><p>Dylan Byers writes in his Byers Market newsletter: \"Neither the Times or BuzzFeed report showed that Sandberg had ordered Facebook's opposition research on Soros. Nor did her emails contradict her earlier statements, in which she claimed ignorance of Facebook's decision to hire an opposition research firm. All last night's reporting showed was that Sandberg wanted to know if there was any financial motive for a high-profile investor's attacks on her company.\"</p><p>\"Nevertheless, the revelation fit very neatly into the new conventional wisdom about Facebook, which casts Mark Zuckerberg as the hapless and helpless chief executive and Sandberg as the duplicitous and malevolent deputy who seeks to undermine the company's critics while refusing to come to terms with its deep, structural problems (of which she is a part). In the end, the evidence may show that Sandberg is indeed such a person. But that evidence wasn't in last night's reporting, and the verve with which some news organizations trumpeted the harmless revelation suggests there is a not-exactly-dispassionate thirst among some reporters to take Sandberg down.\"</p><p>\u2014 Sandberg's co-author Adam Grant defends her character on Facebook: \"The Sheryl I know speaks out against injustice. Most people first came to know Sheryl as the author of Lean In, but what's often overlooked is that she went out on a limb to write it\u2026 The Sheryl I know doesn't ignore criticism. She acknowledges her shortcomings and works to overcome them\u2026 The Sheryl I know cares deeply about people\u2026 You can object to how Facebook has handled a series of crises. You can object to the decisions that Sheryl has made. But when I see strangers vilifying her character, I have to object.\"</p><p>APOLOGY DEPT. \u2014 U.S. agency apologizes to George Soros after broadcast called him 'multimillionaire Jew' \u2014 by Felicia Sonmez: \"In letters sent earlier this month, John F.

Macron's mission, according to The New Yorker, was to get Rouhani to come out of his suite at the Millenium Hilton Hotel and enter a secure room where Trump would join the conversation via speaker phone.</p><p>HEARD THE OTHER DAY \u2014 During an annual conference call with rabbis and Jewish community leaders ahead of the High Holidays on Friday, Trump said that his actions against Iran were \u2014 according to \"a friend of mine\" \u2014 the most significant measures affecting the Jewish state that his administration has taken since coming into office.</p><p>Addressing the situation with Iran, Trump said, \"It will work out. I can't tell you exactly how and why, but it will work out because it always does. I have a tendency to make things work out, one way or the other. Sometimes it's not pretty but it happens.\" [JewishInsider]</p><p>Narrow escape: Qassem Soleimani, the commander of the elite Quds Force of Iran's Revolutionary Guards, said on Tuesday that Israel came very close to killing him and Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah during the Second Lebanon War in 2007.</p><p>BUZZ ON BALFOUR \u2014 Marking a first in Israeli history, criminal proceedings began against a sitting prime minister on Wednesday morning. The first of four days of pre-indictment hearings against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu kicked off \u2014 without Netanyahu present. Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit and lawyers for the prime minister sat down together at the Justice Ministry in Jerusalem.</p><p>Coalition stalemate: A meeting between delegations from Likud and Blue and White that was scheduled for today was canceled after Benny Gantz said there was no path forward for negotiations. Likud blamed Yair Lapid for not backing down from his rotation agreement with Gantz, while Blue and White blamed Netanyahu for refusing to compromise.</p><p>Friendly meet: Instead of attending the pre-indictment hearing, Netanyahu met with leaders of the right-wing bloc in Jerusalem on Wednesday morning and pledged to continue to work together. Analysts are speculating that Netanyahu will return the mandate to form the government to President Reuven Rivlin this week.</p><p>Festive day: All 120 members of the 22nd Knesset are slated to be sworn in tomorrow during what is normally a celebratory event. But a pall is expected to hang over the proceedings, with a government looking unlikely and the prospect of a third election looming on the horizon.</p><p>Ultimate deal watch: U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman said in an interview with The Jerusalem Post that the Trump administration will only release the peace plan once a new government is formed. \"We want to roll it out in an environment where there is a government that can respond to it,\" Friedman explained. \"We would like to deal with a formed government, so they are in a position to react and respond and talk to us about it.\"</p><p>Jake Walles, who served as U.S. consul general in Jerusalem from 2005 to 2009, tells CNBC that the impact of the Israeli political situation on the Trump peace plan \"is unclear\" at this point. \"Certainly, the administration can't move forward until there is a new Israeli government in place. Then it will have to brief the new PM (presumably Gantz) about what's in the plan and get his approval to publish it,\" Walles, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, explained. \"At that point, it will be close to the end of the year; will Trump still want to proceed? Who knows.\"</p><p>Fresh take: Author Micah Goodman suggests that if a national unity government is formed it will give Israel a golden opportunity to take a centrist approach to \"shrink\" the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. That would include a plan to broaden the Palestinians' freedom of movement within the West Bank and give the Palestinian Authority more land for development around the major towns. \"A national unity government could liberate Israel and the Palestinians from the rigid ideologies that have perpetuated the unsustainable status quo,\" Goodman writes.</p><p>TALK OF THE REGION \u2014 In recent months, Israel has quietly allowed thousands of Palestinians to enter Israel and the West Bank from the Gaza Strip to conduct business and work menial jobs, The Associated Press reported on Tuesday. The move is said to be the result of an unofficial Egyptian-brokered truce between Hamas and Israel in exchange for reduced rocket fire and the scaling back of weekly protests on the border.</p><p>Palestinians protested in Jerusalem and Ramallah after a detainee, Samer al-Arbid \u2014 suspected of killing 17-year-old Israeli Rina Shnerb in a terror attack in August \u2014 was hospitalized during interrogation by Israeli forces. Arbid's lawyer, Mahmoud Hassan, told Reuters that the suspect was in critical condition \"as a result of the severe torture he endured during a lengthy interrogation.\"</p><p>FRIENDLY GREETINGS \u2014 In a first, the Saudi Embassy in Washington reportedly sent a Rosh Hashanah greeting to American Jews, reading \"Her Highness The Ambassador Reema Bandar Al Saud sends her wishes for a happy and sweet new year.\" The card was adorned with images of a pomegranate, apples and honey.</p><p>CONFERENCE CIRCUIT \u2014 Michael Bloomberg's answer to the U.N. General Assembly \u2014 by Evan Osnos: \"Between handshakes, a billionaire investor said, 'The world is becoming a world of conferences. I go to about fifty each year, and I kind of wonder, How many of these can we go to? You always see the same people, and you always say, 'Let's have lunch, let's have dinner.' And, of course, you never have lunch, never have dinner.' Today's masters of the universe jet around the globe on the conference circuit, like Presidential candidates touching down at state fairs.\" [NewYorker]</p><p>HAPPENING TODAY \u2014 New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio will meet with Palestinian-American leaders, City Hall said in an advisory. The meeting is closed to press. The mayor's office didn't respond to JI's inquiry about the nature of the meeting by Wednesday morning.</p><p>NEW BOOK \u2014  In new book, Seth Siegel takes a look at how America treats its water \u2014 by JI's Melissa Weiss: If you know anything about Israeli water technology, then you've almost certainly heard the name Seth Siegel. If you've heard of Siegel, there's a very good chance you've read his 2015 bestseller, Let There Be Water: Israel's Solution for a Water-Starved World. In his first book, Siegel talks about how Israeli technologies and government actions have propelled the Jewish state to the forefront of fighting the looming water crisis. In his second book, Troubled Water: What's Wrong with What We Drink, released on Tuesday, Siegel flips the lens: Instead of looking at how Israeli water innovation could help to solve crises around the world, Siegel focuses on how people and communities in the United States are affected by the water they consume and what can be done to alleviate the growing public health challenges associated with contaminated water.</p><p>In Troubled Water, Siegel focuses on the myriad issues that contribute to water contamination issues across the country \u2014 from local leaders to the Environmental Protection Agency to bottled water companies \u2014 and suggests the reforms necessary to shift the tide and provide quality drinking water to American homes and businesses. The issues, he says, are wide-ranging: from confusing regulations surrounding state and federal oversight (for example, according to the most recent Government Accountability Office report, more than two-thirds of the bottled water sold in the U.S. is not subject to Food and Drug Administration regulation) to geographic and population issues \u2014 particularly in areas like the American southwest and other desert climates, where population growth has exceeded the water supply and communities are having to reuse and recycle water. [JewishInsider]</p><p>ON THE TRAIL \u2014 Ahead of Warren-Zuckerberg spat, Buttigieg criticized Massachusetts senator on big tech \u2014 by JI's Ben Jacobs: South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg offered veiled criticism of presidential rival Elizabeth Warren's views on regulating big tech companies while speaking to reporters in Iowa last week, days before the Massachusetts senator engaged in a back-and-forth exchange with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg over regulating the social media giant. Zuckerberg was recorded on audio leaked Tuesday suggesting a legal battle with the federal government if Warren is elected.</p><p>In Iowa, Buttigieg told reporters, \"There's an interesting conversation to be had about the kind of the neo-Brandeisian way of dealing with tech regulation, which I think is fairly convincing.\" The Indiana Democrat then took a veiled shot at Warren: \"That's one of the reasons I choke a little bit on the idea that's coming from at least one candidate [that] if a company reaches a certain scale, just break them up.\" In his view, \"I think a lot of it has to do with what is actually happening and how it affects markets \u2014 especially when there are a lot of natural monopolies in tech.\" As an example, Buttigieg suggested that if \"you take Twitter, and cut it in half, you'll just get two Twitters \u2014 one will be good and the other will go away.\" [JewishInsider]</p><p>DEM IN DISARRAY \u2014 Two top staffers on John Delaney's presidential campaign have officially cut ties with the former Maryland congressman, JI's Ben Jacobs reports. The two departures \u2014 of campaign manager John Davis and communications director Will McDonald \u2014 come only days after Monica Biddix, Delaney's Iowa state director, left the campaign.</p><p>No payoff: Though he launched his campaign more than two years ago, Delaney has been unable to gain momentum, despite extensive barnstorming in both Iowa and New Hampshire. The former three-term Maryland congressman, who has run as the most moderate Democrat in the field, has yet to see a payoff from his years of campaigning. He did not qualify for the September presidential debate and will not appear in October's debate.

That's nearly 35% more than what was agreed on in 2018, when both sides signed a 10-year deal valued at $15 billion. The Israeli gas will start flowing to Egypt at the beginning of next year, with the aim to gradually reach an annual capacity of almost 7 billion cubic meters from both pools by the summer of 2022.\" [Bloomberg]</p><p>LONG READ \u2014 Bruce Springsteen is Jew-ish \u2014 by Eric Alterman: \"Jews are an essential part of Springsteen's entourage. His drummer, 'Mighty' Max Weinberg, is so Jewish, his parents ran a Jewish summer camp in the Poconos. Bruce's first sound engineer, Louis Lahav, was an Israeli. Bruce's two managers, Mike Appel and Jon Landau, hail from the Hebraic faith. So does the record-company exec who originally signed him, Clive Davis\u2026 Springsteen is not at all Jewish\u2026 And the 'Jew or Not Jew' website somehow gives Springsteen a 6 out of 10 on its Jewish scale, even with its inevitable 'verdict: Not a Jew.' Springsteen himself has dropped hints of his affinity for the Chosen People. At the wedding of his former sound man Marc Brickman, in 1979, he led the band in an abbreviated 'Hava Nagila.' He credited a sermon on the importance of shared love, given by Rabbi Harold Schulweis of Valley Beth Shalom, with inspiring 'a lot of songs' on The River.\" [TheAtlantic]</p><p>A war over the future of Judaism rages in this small Long Island community \u2014 by Danielle Ziri: \"Although locals describe West Hempstead's Jewish community as 'live and let live,' some residents told Haaretz that they feel the local rabbinical leadership is pushing a hard-line that does not reflect how open the Orthodox community is and actually runs counter to it. The rabbis 'have such a hold over the businesses,' says B., a longtime West Hempstead resident who spoke on condition of anonymity, explaining that the local religious leaders are in control of some restaurants' kosher certifications.\" [Haaretz]</p><p>TALK OF THE NATION \u2014 Rosh Hashanah descended on the United States on Sunday evening for the first time since the deadliest attack on Jews ever on American soil. Eleven months after a gunman opened fire at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, the congregation gathered off-site \u2014 they haven't held services at the site of the massacre since it happened \u2014 to mark the High Holidays. The man who blew the shofar last year at the New Light congregation which met at Tree of Life was Richard Gottfried, a dentist who was killed in the shooting, reported the Associated Press. Instead, AP said, the congregation's rabbi, Jonathan Perlman, blew the shofar this year. The three congregations housed in the Tree of Life building are planning a series of commemorations for the one-year anniversary of the attack on October 27.</p><p>The Atlantic reported that members of the three congregations have disagreed in their reactions and approaches to the aftermath of the massacre. According to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Dor Hadash, one of the three congregations, declined to take part in Trump's pre-Rosh Hashanah call with Jewish community leaders. Tree of Life Rabbi Jeffrey Myer's decision to meet with Trump and welcome the president's visit was deeply upsetting to many in New Light and Dor Hadash, The Atlantic said. Members of the three congregations have turned to different forms of activism, including one group pursuing gun control efforts.</p><p>TALK OF THE TOWN \u2014 Benjamin Schaeffer, a New York MTA transit worker, was initially denied permission to take off for Rosh Hashanah, according to Transport Workers Union Local 100. A supervisor then granted Schaeffer the holiday, but told TWU Local 100 veep Eric Loegel that he would need to submit documentation within 5 days to prove he'd actually observed the holiday or else he'd be marked as \"AWOL.\"</p><p>Latkes first: On Friday, Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Robin Vos \"respectfully demanded\" that Governor Tony Evers reschedule a congressional special election \"because the primary would fall during the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah.\" The primary election to replace the vacant seat of former Rep. Sean Duffy (R-WI-07) is on December 30th, which is the final day of Hanukkah. It's worth noting that there are no work restrictions for religious Jews on Hanukkah.</p><p>Right of return: Spain's Justice Ministry said on Tuesday that the four-year period for the descendants of Sephardic Jews to apply for Spanish citizenship has closed.

Managing nearly $1.2 billion in customer assets, Litnsky, in a July 27 letter to investors reviewed by ValueWalk[2], pointed to insight from JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon regarding the US Federal Reserve unwinding its nearly $4 trillion balance sheet headlined the core causation for a 'tide change.' But the 'tell' to the forthcoming volatility regime might be seen in stocks such as Amazon and Facebook, which are priced beyond any apparent logic[3].

But despite this historic strategy shift where negative interest rates and unusual asset purchases bent economic textbooks beyond recognition, 'all three economic zones have had lackluster growth.' US GDP, for instance, grew only 2.1% per year on average since 2010, while Japan grew at 1.4% and Europe grew at 1.1% -- well below historical averages during periods preceding quantitative easing. This experimentation is ending and it will result in 'a big change in the tide,' JPMorgan chief Jamie Dimon\u00a0told [5]a conference in Paris July 11. 'The tide is going out.' Other analysts[6] have been watching for a slower reduction and a gentle transition. Dimon said that central banks 'don't know how this is going to play out' but speculated the process to withdraw quantitative easing is going to be 'more disruptive than people think.' From Litnsky's standpoint, this is a likely volatility trigger[7]. 'The Federal Reserve's transition marks a real regime change,' he told investors. 'This change is being well-telegraphed and expectations are that it will be very gradual. Yet, with equity markets at record highs, markets may not be fully appreciating the set of probabilities around what might happen now that one of the biggest financial asset buyers is officially selling.' JHL Capital Group: \"No doubt\" central banks have inflated asset prices, tech stocks likely first hitJHL Capital Group says there is 'no doubt' central bank asset purchases have 'helped bid up global prices for stocks, bonds, real estate and even collectibles, like art, in recent years.' From his standpoint, the delicate surgery the Fed is currently performing with a September reduction in its balance sheet scheduled likely to readjust asset prices to various degrees. 'What rate of reduced Central Bank purchases will be enough to raise the overall cost of capital? When will risk premia reprice across all asset classes?' That 'repricing' could first be seen in technology stocks[8], which he places into two categories. There are tech stocks achieving growth at a reasonable multiple, such as Facebook, Apple, Google and Microsoft. Even her, the market price assumption is based on perfection: GOOGL and FB are priced on the assumption that they will retain virtually unimpeded monopolies on global digital advertising for many years to come. Compounding their current revenues at the growth rates implied by the market generates very large numbers a few years out. This implies that there will be no further competitive reactions, changes in the media landscape, new entrant technologies or regulatory intervention. These are difficult assumptions to make. Stocks that could see a significant 'repricing' during a downturn are what Litnsky calls 'collectibles,' tech stocks that 'are valued based on future, and difficult-to-quantify profit prospects, rather than on foreseeable cash flow. They are valued more like en vogue art work because price is simply a function of a limited supply meeting a large and growing demand.' But these stocks are likely to hit some turbulence. Amazon, in particular, could be on regulator radars[9] as they are beginning to threaten powerful business interests in a number of realms, not just retail. It is the combination of central banks withdrawing a stimulative matter that has gripped markets like a drug and a technical value readjustment in stocks such as Amazon, which is boasting a 250.8 price earnings multiple this morning. JHL on the catalyst to break the levee- Angst over Amazon JHL Capital Group is concerned that anti-trust and protectionist moves could hurt Amazon which could be the catalyst for the collapse of FAMGA and the entire market. 'Global Central Banks may turn[10] from large buyers in the market to sellers,' Litnsky wrote, pointing to one of two major market risks. 'Simultaneously, governments may increasingly scrutinize these technology behemoths. We will be following these developments closely [11]as they unfold.' The hedge fund thinks that big tech could be the battle of the 2020 elections just as big pharma and banks were themes in prior elections. Specifically with regards to Amazon, JHL notes that not only is their bipartisan anger, but AMZN is viewed lately by some as being too aggressive in IP and services, which could help garner support for anti-trust action. JHL Capital Group notes some prominent politicians are weighing in on the Bezos giant. The letter states: Senator Cory Booker gave an interview last week questioning where antitrust enforcement is with respect to AMZN and GOOGL. President Trump recently tweeted about the 'Amazon Washington Post' in reference to the company's monopolistic power and tax avoidance maneuvers. JHL Capital Group is long The New York Times, Indian based companies - MakeMyTrip Limited, DLF Limited, and has become the largest shareholder in Secure National Resources, and MP Mine Operations, related Operation Despite being basically flat for the year, the hedge fund [12]called 2017, the most difficult year in the ~$1.2B hedge fund firm's 11 year history. Eric Rosenberg, an analyst, left the firm to join JHL's seeder, Ranger. The post JHL: Amazon Anti-Trust Scrutiny Could Be The Straw To Break The Bull's Back[13] appeared first on ValueWalk[14].

Maxx) committed to purchase solar power over 15 years. With the three large anchors onboard, an agreement followed to purchase solar power and renewable energy credits (RECs) from Skipjack Solar Center, a new plant being developed in Charles City County, Virginia, thats expected to come online in 2021.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The power will be purchased through a product known as Constellations Offsite Renewables (CORe).</p><p>Corporations are eager to do their part to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and transition to cleaner forms of energy, and Constellation is committed to providing clean energy solutions that help them meet their goals, said Jim McHugh, CEO of Constellation. This major CORe agreement helps to remove the barriers that stand between companies and their sustainability goals, for the sake of good business  and for the benefit of our environment.</p><p>CORe is designed to allow corporations to tap into renewable energy thats coming from large solar sites, said Benjamin Chadwick, Constellations executive director of CORe. A big company or institution has power needs that go beyond what rooftop solar could provide. But they cant take title to a whole solar farm, per federal regulations. And most institutions arent big enough to need an entire farm anyway.</p><p>These projects are located on large plots of land offsite where the economics for building those projects are more attractive, and I think weve created a transactional structure and a contract structure that allows us to make those large offsite utilities scale available to a collection or aggregate of users through a retail power agreement, Chadwick said.</p><p>In this case, three of these entities are involved, but they didnt make an agreement all together. Instead, they worked directly with Constellation. With a number of companies willing to make a commitment, Constellation then reached an agreement for 175 megawatts from Skipjack that will allow the companies to purchase energy via the solar sites.</p><p>When JHU and the companies are billed for power, they will be buying retail power supplied to their meter just like they would any other day, Chadwick said.</p><p>This is distinct from a tool that is commonly used, called a virtual power purchase agreement, which is effectively a financial transaction that represents the purchase of renewable power. It was developed for use by big tech companies who made solar commitments.</p><p>Weve created a product offering that simplifies the process with a view towards bringing it to everyone else, he said.</p><p>With the approach being used by Constellation, called a physical power purchase agreement, its billed as though the energy were delivered directly. This doesnt mean that theres a direct line between JHUs campus and Virginia supplying the power, as such an arrangement doesnt typically exist in the world of offsite solar power generation, but its still billed that way.</p><p>Per U.S. Environmental Protection Agency projections, the combined greenhouse gas emissions that will not happen as a result of the deal is equivalent to removing 34,000 passenger cars from the road.</p><p>Johns Hopkins had previously announced its commitment as it looks to halve carbon emissions by 2025. The energy will power campuses in Baltimore, including Homewood in North Baltimore, Peabody Institute in Mt. Vernon, Keswick in Hampden and Mount Washington. JHU Applied Physics Lab, located in Laurel, will also purchase project-specific RECs as part of the deal.</p><p>McCormick, the Baltimore-founded spicemaker, will power facilities in Maryland, including its Hunt Valley-based corporate headquarters, four manufacturing plants and two distribution centers.</p><p>McCormick is honored to be a part of the Skipjack solar agreement, which represents a significant move forward in our goal to reduce our carbon footprint across the company, Lawrence Kurzius, CEO of McCormick &amp; Company, said in a statement. We acknowledge that climate change is a real and pressing problem and were committed to doing our part to use renewable energy to combat it. 2019 Global Data Point.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ERGMWW-154679417</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ERGMWW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X40-42G1-JDJN-655V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">417292</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"686\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Global Data Point Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"ro\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://syndigate.info\">(Syndigate.info)</url></emphasis></emphasis> All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Energy Monitor Worldwide</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35453\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 23, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC00027GJ</classCode><className>MCCORMICK &amp;

Brenton Tarrant, the right-wing extremist who carried out the attack, was deeply influenced by digital hate culture[1]\u2014the loose coalitions that researchers[2] have identified among white power activists, anti-Muslim activists, neo-Nazis, alt-right trolls, and men's rights activists (as well as other groups) that use websites, forums, social media platforms, and encrypted messaging apps such as WhatsApp, Signal, and Telegram. Digital hate culture is not a new phenomenon; white supremacists in the United States have been using digital communications technology for three decades[3]. Nor is this culture unique to social media; blogs and websites have long been[4] part of its networks. Digital hate culture\u2014at least in North America and Western Europe\u2014has one core premise: that the 'white race' is being replaced as a consequence of mass immigration, Islam, and liberals who have embraced cosmopolitanism and multiculturalism. </p><p>This is better known as the 'white genocide' myth[5], which took center stage in Tarrant's manifesto[6]. It's true, of course, that demographic shifts in Europe are occurring, but it is the trenchant belief\u2014expressed by Tarrant and white supremacists across the web\u2014that these arrivals are in collusion with liberal multiculturalists and globalists (an anti-Semitic code for Jews) and are bent on the destruction of European culture itself.Unlike the rigorous online policing of jihadi groups and their potential recruits, there has been a reticence on the part of social media companies to challenge right-wing extremism. Jihad has no mainstream political support in any liberal democracy\u2014and the views and online networks of jihadis are rightly countered, disrupted[7], and even shut down with government and private sector cooperation. There is a widespread consensus that the free speech implications of such shutdowns are dwarfed by the need to keep jihadi ideology out of the public sphere. When it comes to right-wing extremism, white supremacy, and white nationalism, however, there is no such consensus. Instead, right-wing views are defended on free speech grounds, giving extremists space to spread their ideologies. The latest example of this double standard comes from the White House[8], which refused on Tuesday to join an international effort to clamp down on online hate speech. And it is not only the Trump administration; tech companies have thus far refused to treat violent white supremacist rhetoric the same way as violent jihadist rhetoric. Indeed, in a discussion on white supremacists on Twitter, a Twitter employee admitted that using the tools that Twitter deploys against the Islamic State on white supremacists would involve banning Republican politicians[9] from the app. With the ascendance of white identity politics in Western conservative parties and the rise of the populist radical right, right-wing extremism has been shielded from the full force of private sector and government responses to disrupt their online communications. It is not simply U.S. President Donald Trump's dog whistles and retweets of exponents of digital hate culture such as Lauren Southern[10] and Jayda Fransen[11]. His administration has also reduced resources[12] to counter right-wing extremism.Southern is a Canadian activist who joined the 'Defend Europe' action group, organized by Generation Identity (a pan-European, extreme right-wing street movement), which sought to disrupt rescue vessels saving migrants from drowning during the journey across the Mediterranean Sea in 2016. In 2018, Southern was banned from entering Britain on the grounds that she may incite racial hatred. Fransen, the deputy director of Britain First, an anti-Muslim political party that amassed over a million likes on Facebook, has antagonized Muslim communities in the U.K. and was jailed in 2018 for racially aggravated harassment. These are just two examples of influential figures in digital hate culture, which now exists in a gray area between legitimacy and extremism, an ambivalence afforded by popular conservative outlets including Breitbart[13] and Fox News[14] and tacit and overt support from Republican politicians in the United States, including Reps. Paul Gosar and Steve King and Trump himself. In Europe, Geert Wilders, a Dutch member of parliament and leader of the far-right Party for Freedom, and Gerard Batten, a member of the European Parliament and leader of the UK Independence Party, have expressed support[15] for Tommy Robinson, the founder of the English Defence League. He is currently campaigning[16] as an independent to represent the North West England constituency in the European Parliament. The notion that Twitter and others cannot shut down white supremacists without affecting conservative politicians illustrates that fears of a backlash from politicians and right-wing media outlets that weaponize hate outweigh the principled application of community guidelines to which all users of these platforms are bound. The platforms, of course, have the choice of how to enforce their guidelines, and it is unconscionable that they have failed to use them when politicians, pundits, columnists, and media outlets violate these rules and exploit their platforms to stoke hatred to win votes and attract the attention of audiences. Social media companies have dithered when it comes to fighting right-wing extremists because they are more concerned with their public perception and their revenue streams. Facebook, for example, gave different treatment[17] to Robinson and Britain First a few years ago, on the grounds that their anti-Muslim hate was legitimate political speech, before their recent about-face. The company's trepidation in banning known conspiracy theorist Alex Jones[18] of Infowars is another example. Of course, these individuals all cried 'censorship' when their accounts were taken down. Jihadis do the same thing when their accounts are banned. The difference is that politicians in the United States and Western Europe are grilling executives[19] of these platforms about their purported censorship of conservative voices, and companies are concerned about the political risks this may present to their continued operation and their user base. No jihadi leader has complained to the U.S. Congress and had these executives hauled before a committee to discuss charges of censorship. This has led to an evident double standard: Corporate executives and political elites are more troubled by the free speech implications of taking down a far-right activist's account than with protecting the dignity, freedom, and security of minorities. To their credit, social media companies have significantly changed their approaches and have become more decisive in countering white supremacist hate culture on their platforms. This has led to a backlash[20] by activists on the far-right, whose rallies increasingly focus on the notion that they are being unfairly censored. Tarrant's livestream of his massacre in a Christchurch mosque may be one of the most brutal examples of how these platforms are used. But there are more complex ways in which they have supported digital hate culture. YouTube's algorithms[21], for example, have been shown to recommend extremist content[22]. The company has been reticent[23] at best to take down white supremacist content. This appears to be changing. Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, and YouTube are increasing their efforts to disrupt white supremacist users on its platforms, but they must do more.Before these companies began taking decisive measures after the Christchurch attack, the guiding framework relied on countermessaging, in which content that aims to contradict extremist narratives is pushed to those who are embedded in these networks with the hope of changing their minds. This approach has had limited effects[24]. Stronger approaches such as account bans would have much more of an effect in limiting extremist recruitment. The reliance on countermessaging is not only expedient for social media companies whose microtargeted advertising tools play a key a role in this. Facebook, for example, offers advertising credit to nongovernmental organizations to target supporters of jihad or the far-right on its platforms to expose them to counternarratives. It now links users[25] who search for white supremacist content to the NGO Life After Hate. Moonshot CVE's Redirect Method[26], incubated by Google's Jigsaw division, targets viewers of extremist videos with contradictory content. While such efforts are valuable and should not be abandoned, this is not a viable solution that will protect those threatened by digital hate culture. And it fails to even reach the darker corners of the internet. The countermessaging approach reinforces the double standard: Instead of disrupting key influencers in digital hate culture, which might raise concerns about freedom of speech, the goal is to dissuade their audiences. Indeed, at the same time that mainstream social media platforms were being exploited by white supremacists, an army of anonymous keyboard warriors was also gaining prominence on sites such as 4chan[27], 8chan, Voat, and many others. Alt-tech platforms like Gab.ai[28] cater specifically to those who have been kicked off the mainstream platforms. Just like jihadis, far-right activists have also moved to Telegram, a mobile application that affords users full encryption. These are important sites for creating content[29] that is then disseminated on mainstream platforms\u2014often under the radar of their content moderation teams. Many recent right-wing terrorists have been influenced by these communities. Anders Behring Breivik, the perpetrator of the July 2011 attacks in Norway, was an avid reader of counterjihad blogs[30] and a contributor to the neo-Nazi, U.S.-based web forum Stormfront[31]. Darren Osborne[32], before he attempted a vehicular attack on Finsbury Park Mosque in London that killed one person, was found to have been rapidly radicalized by anti-Muslim discourse online about Muslim grooming gangs in Britain. Robert Bowers[33], who was charged with the murder of 11 Jews in Pittsburgh, was an active user of Gab.ai and worked[34] with alt-right extremists to dox a left-wing blogger. The Christchurch killer, Tarrant, used 8chan to post his manifesto and covered his rifle in slogans referencing historical massacres of Muslims and digital hate culture. John T. Earnest[35], the prime suspect in a shooting at a synagogue in southern California and who also claimed to have set fire to a mosque in the region, may have followed suit, as a user identifying himself as Earnest posted an open letter[36] on 8chan a few hours before the attack. The online experiences of white supremacist terrorists suggest that there is a decentralized process by which individuals find so-called truth in the white genocide conspiracy and other mythologies and act on them on their own. It is not a form of lone-wolf terrorism; such acts are fostered and approved by a culture of hate online. Surveillance of these spaces resembling the monitoring of spaces used by jihadis is necessary, but the political will to establish such surveillance with the resources and tools needed to make it work is unlikely, given that politicians and CEOs continue to prioritize the free speech rights of white supremacists over the security of their potential victims. And in an online culture that reveres nihilistic irony and ambivalence, it is sometimes difficult to discern the actual threats. Surveillance itself might help prevent a few cases of violence, but it is unlikely to eliminate the problem. The real problem is how to police digital hate culture as a whole and to develop the political consensus needed to disrupt it.On Wednesday, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and French President Emmanuel Macron hosted a meeting for ministers from G-7 nations to discuss a plan named the Christchurch Call[37]. While the plan under consideration primarily focuses on the responsibilities of social media platforms, these leaders need to have a broader moral and ethical discussion. The dignity of minorities\u2014whether Jews in the United States, Muslims in New Zealand, or Rohingyas in Myanmar\u2014and the harms that digital hate culture has on their communities must become the center of this debate. The Ardern-Macron meeting presents an opportunity to develop real consensus, and it must start with the following question: Does the entitlement to free speech outweigh the harms that hateful speech and extreme ideologies cause on their targets? Starting with this question is not a radical proposition. In fact, it resembles Section 130 of the German Criminal Code[38], which covers incitement to hatred and Holocaust denial. The law criminalizes those who '[assault] the human dignity of others by insulting, maliciously maligning, or defaming segments of the population' or publicly '[violate] the dignity' of victims of Nazism. The European Union has also passed laws[39] outlawing Holocaust denial, though it allows national laws to take precedence. The passage of such laws recognizes that incitement to hate and violation of dignity can have violent consequences. These threats are not abstract. The recent spate of terrorist attacks for which there was a clear online trail makes abundantly clear the deadly risk of permitting these online communities to operate without law enforcement monitoring. Platforms that serve as hubs for digital hate culture frequently host death threats and incitement to violence, and there is no excuse for law enforcement not acting on such expressions just as they would if a jihadi behaved similarly on an extremist site. However, there are many less visible ways that digital hate culture harms citizens. Indeed, allowing such dehumanization of whole communities forces innocent people to face insecurity and fear. Hate crimes against minorities\u2014particularly Jews and Muslims\u2014have increased significantly in recent years. Veiled women have been spat on as they board buses, and there have been assaults on busy streets. The political philosopher Jeremy Waldron has argued that hate speech laws do not protect groups from offense but rather their dignity: A 'person's basic entitlement to be regarded as a member of society in good standing, as someone whose membership of a minority group does not disqualify him or her from ordinary social interaction. That is what hate speech attacks,' he wrote[40].Attacking the dignity of minorities is what digital hate culture is designed to do. Taking dignity as a starting point can drive regulations that do not infringe on the freedom of speech while sharpening governments' tools to punish those who denigrate and threaten minorities through digital platforms. Recognizing attacks on dignity can also help drive how social media platforms regulate content and guide investigatory and monitoring efforts of websites like 8chan. It provides a moral and ethical framework for the disruption and limitation of access to such places and affirms the dignity of people online and offline to live as equals. While such recognition may not stop the next attack planned online, it is a useful complement to aggressive and decisive intelligence gathering and policing aimed at intercepting and punishing those planning to engage in premeditated violence. Attacks on dignity online have been tacitly endorsed by a political debate that affirms free speech without balancing this entitlement against the harms that these attacks may cause. Challenging the claim that digital hate culture ought to be protected on the grounds of free speech would drive much-needed changes to the current anemic approach to right-wing extremism online.

And which is really real, I mean, earnings-per-share real? When Big Tech goes to Washington, you have to worry about what's headline risk and what's EPS risk -- and the gulf between the two is huge.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So let's go over the U.S. vs. Facebook  , Amazon  , and Alphabet  -- and assess the potential damages.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I want to start with a very critical quote from the head of the antitrust subcommittee, David Cicilline, a Democrat from Rhode Island that I heard yesterday: \"In an effort to promote and continue this new economy, Congress and antitrust enforcers allowed these firms to regulate themselves with little oversight. But as a result, the internet has become increasingly concentrated, less open and growingly concentrated hostile to innovation and entrepreneurship. \"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Not good.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Because regulated businesses tend not to make as much money as non-regulated businesses. I used to joke about the irrelevance of extraneous events to some stocks -- the \"what does that have to do with the price-to-earnings ratio of Bristol-Myers Squibb  \" theorem.</p><p>These have potential  implications and are most certainly P/E multiple shrinkers.</p><p>Also not good?</p><p>Cicilline is a Democrat. The Republicans are already predisposed to dislike these internet titans because they are perceived as one giant, liberal squid choking off discourse and making profits for their CEOs who then give to Democratic candidates. They are under assault by both parties as we saw from the ill-advised Libra foray by Facebook. They are uniters, uniters against themselves.</p><p>Second negative? The media. News narratives are set by the New York Times -- which has done amazing reporting on Facebook, admittedly amazingly negative, and by Fox News, which is anything but a friend of the web.</p><p>Third negative? Age. Many of these politicians are so old and out of it that they seem to be from the flip phone days. Others need their kids sitting with them at these hearings. I would like to ask these people if they have ever heard of Roku  or Pinterest  .</p><p>Yeah, the internet is no place for old men -- or women, either.</p><p>Next negative? Bought friends. What is it about this industry that it doesn't know you need to have some congressional mindshare. Not only does every district have people who have livelihoods wiped out by these companies, but none of them is paying the freight that say, the managed care industry does, or the pharmaceuticals. Most of the web companies -- with the exception of Amazon -- are concentrated in California. They have way too little influence elsewhere. Amazon's brilliant move to have a bunch of headquarters would have blunted this. But Queens blocked Bezos and he only picked up Virginia. Not enough voters. Not enough money.</p><p>Final negative: lack of public, well-known and well-respected grown-ups at the top that actually CAN'T BE BOUGHT. These internet companies have systematically refused to get senior hands in from the outside who are trusted by Washington. To me, the smartest thing that CEO Dara Khosrowshahi did when he joined Uber  was hire Tony West as general counsel. West was the former general counsel of Pepsico  and before that the Associate Attorney General of the United States, where he went after the big banks for their sins during the Great Recession. Best resume ever for these matters and anything but an empty suit. A real enforcer.</p><p>Like it or not, Uber had been considered a \"dirty\" company by many authorities because of the reckless ways of Dara's predecessor, Travis Kalanick. Don't hear much of that anymore, do you? Uber's still an aggressive company, but West has given the company bearing and is known in Washington as someone who would not trade his reputation for money.</p><p>Now when I look at these firms, I always think, \"does anyone know you need a West at the top, someone with a regulator's mentality, to be sure that you don't run afoul of the regulators?\" These places need more political operatives, more ex-congresspeople, more sports heroes for heavens sake! Even the banks know that. What do these firms not get that Uber did?</p><p>With that important backdrop, let's do some quick handicapping.</p><p>First, Alphabet? While my charitable trust, <url normalizedValue=\"http://secure2.thestreet.com/cap/prm.do?OID=031628\">Action Alerts Plus</url> , owns Alphabet, as well as the other two, and we've made great money for the trust doing so, I think Alphabet has real EPS risk here. Alphabet, in many ways, reminds me of Microsoft  of old: You can't get away from it. Google determines what you read first and often what you buy first and what you learn first. It's also what you might see first, if it is on Youtube. That means it -- I think unintentionally, for the most part -- intrudes into free speech and that gets them in the crosshairs of both sides.</p><p>One of the reasons why I like the stock of Alphabet so much is that almost-monopoly-like power earned by its own ingenuity. But as long as the company doesn't have someone at the top policing all the cases where Alphabet may be seen as being too powerful, I think these guys have real earnings risk, as they will be urged to rein in power or be broken up. The good news? The stock has a low multiple. The bad news? While Peter Thiel's call for a McCarthy-like investigation into their ties to China seem off-base, I don't think it is so off-base to wonder how the queue works, how coercive and powerful Alphabet can be and whether it can change its ways. I, personally, love everything about Google, from its search to its maps to its operating system. They haven't put me out of business. They haven't exposed me. They haven't done anything to me.</p><p>But I am not your grieving constituent. I think there's real EPS risk here. The company has to find a way to self-examine -- not by cheap AI but by expensive, harsh humans, and that's expensive. They have the money. I know they don't want to slow down the innovation. But they lack a powerful, well-known outside counsel who can tell them what's right or what's wrong or we will need sum-of-the-parts analysis here. I couldn't believe that some no-name Alphabet guy was answering questions on the Hill about Chinese Communist infiltration. Can they be that tone deaf? They need hitters to get them out of this jam.</p><p>Fortunately, it has a low multiple.</p><p>Amazon? Oh brother. These guys have big brother in Alexa. They have wiped out many a small retailer. They have the power to steer to their own goods.</p><p>But they also have some friends. I bet every single congressperson knows and loves Amazon and many have Amazon facilities in their districts -- the political advantage of nation-wide scale! They also have Amazon web services, which has got to be the single greatest empowerment tool for small business around. Plus, Bezos owns the Washington Post. How brilliant is that? Amazingly, given how Amazon's been like Walmart  in crushing smaller retailers, I think this one's in the best shape in America. It's being investigated by the EU, but it just made a brilliant settlement with German authorities to change its terms of business to appease aggrieved sellers and I think that those changes will immunize the company. Worse that happens? Check please!</p><p>Finally, the most ironic of all, Facebook. It sure didn't buy much for that $5 billion to the FTC. It decided to go from the FTC frying pan into the Treasury fire with Libra. Talk about self-inflicted forced error. Once again I have to insist that they bring in an unassailable outside figure with some credibility -- can't they find a retired Federal Judge to become something like a court-ordered monitor before the government does it for them.</p><p>Why aren't I more fearful, other than the fact that their Instagram business is on fire? Because I have a plan for them. Drop Libra -- even as I liked the concept. Go buy Square  for $70 billion -- hundred percent premiums do not get rejected -- and blow it out worldwide. Square takes bitcoins. That's a start. Why not tinker with bitcoin once you have bought Square, talk about how Square Cash is great at empowering beloved small business and away you go!</p><p>I am not being glib here. Washington is a P/E-lowering event for all of these companies. What I am saying is if you impact free speech, as Alphabet does, you are going to have to have an earnings' hit if not break-up risk. If you impact commerce and lower prices -- Amazon -- you are going to have a small earnings hit -- a fine -- but new relatively painless rules, like those agreed to in Germany, And if you are Facebook? Come on guys, drop Libra, go buy Square, get a distinguished former jurist in the house and the rest could be history.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSCSRM-15022298</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSCSRM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKN-R5N1-JCHV-V21B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">420101</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1422\"/><timeReceived>7:01 PM EDT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TheStreet.com, Inc.
