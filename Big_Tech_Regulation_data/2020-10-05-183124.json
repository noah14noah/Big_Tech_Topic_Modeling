But stay with me here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It\u2019s true that this was a horrible year for many of the tech industry\u2019s biggest companies. Amazon held a nationwide beauty pageant for its new headquarters, raising hopes that the company would help transform a struggling city, then <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/05/technology/amazon-second-headquarters-split.html\">picked</url> the two places that needed it the least. Executives from Facebook, Google and Twitter got hauled before Congress to apologize for *gestures wildly in all directions*. One of Uber\u2019s self-driving cars       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/03/20/us/self-driving-uber-pedestrian-killed.html\">killed someone</url>. And then there was       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/16/business/elon-musk-interview-tesla.html?module=inline\">Elon Musk</url>.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the tech sector is more than its giants.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Last year, I <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/27/technology/tech-roundup-2017.html\">handed out</url> \u201cgood tech\u201d awards to a handful of companies, nonprofit organizations and people who used technology to help others in real, tangible ways. The goal was to shine a spotlight on a few less-heralded projects that may not get front-page headlines or billions of dollars in funding, but are actually trying to fulfill the tech industry\u2019s stated goal of improving the world.</p><p>I\u2019m continuing that tradition this year, in the spirit of reminding us that although scandals and wrongdoing in tech rightly get a lot of attention, there\u2019s good happening elsewhere.</p><p>To Zipline and Swoop Aero, for using drones to heal the sick.</p><p>For years, consumer drones were hyped as a new technology that would soon fill the skies over America\u2019s cities, delivering packages and surveilling the populace. Luckily, that hasn\u2019t happened yet, but elsewhere, drone companies are doing real work.</p><p>One of these efforts is <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.flyzipline.com/\">Zipline</url>, a start-up that uses drones to deliver blood and medicine to medical facilities in remote areas that can\u2019t be easily reached by traditional vehicles. The company began operating in Rwanda, where it says it has made more than 8,000 deliveries, and this year expanded to Ghana.</p><p>Another is <url normalizedValue=\"https://swoop.aero/\">Swoop Aero</url>, an Australian drone-delivery company that partnered with Unicef this year to deliver vaccines to the remote South Pacific nation of Vanuatu, where roughly 20 percent of children do not get properly vaccinated. One nurse in the country       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/17/health/vanuatu-vaccines-drones.html\">told The New York Times</url> that the drone deliveries \u201cwill change my life.\u201d</p><p>To Upsolve, for helping people go bankrupt.</p><p>For many low-income Americans, declaring personal bankruptcy can be a painful but necessary way to get rid of exorbitant medical bills or predatory lenders. But it\u2019s often expensive to hire a bankruptcy lawyer, and hard to navigate the maze of paperwork.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://upsolve.org/\">Upsolve</url>, a nonprofit organization founded by a Harvard graduate and a lawyer, built a tool that has been referred to as the \u201cTurboTax of bankruptcy.\u201d The software collects financial information from users, automatically fills out their forms and passes them to a lawyer who reviews them before the user submits a bankruptcy claim. In 2018, it helped users in 47 states discharge a total of more than $13 million in debt, according to Rohan Pavuluri, the company\u2019s chief executive.</p><p>To Joy Buolamwini, Timnit Gebru and Anima Anandkumar, for calling out A.I. bias.</p><p>Artificial intelligence will be one of the most important areas of computer science in the coming years. It\u2019s also one of the least diverse. Just <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.com/story/artificial-intelligence-researchers-gender-imbalance/\">12 percent</url> of A.I. researchers are women, and the number of black and Latino executives in the field is vanishingly small. Three leading A.I. researchers are trying to change that.</p><p>Ms. Buolamwini, a researcher at the M.I.T. Media Lab, is the founder of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ajlunited.org/\">Algorithmic Justice League</url>, an organization trying to fight what it calls the \u201ccoded gaze\u201d of biased algorithms. This year, she and Ms. Gebru \u2014 a Google researcher and co-founder of a group called Black in A.I. \u2014       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://gendershades.org/\">released a study</url> that showed that three leading facial recognition algorithms were substantially worse at classifying darker faces than lighter faces, and worse at classifying women\u2019s faces than men\u2019s faces. The study set off alarm bells at leading tech companies, and was widely cited as evidence of the need for more diversity in the field.</p><p>Separately, Ms. Anandkumar, Nvidia\u2019s director of machine learning research and a professor at Caltech, saw that the name of the A.I. field\u2019s marquee annual event \u2014 the Neural Information Processing Systems conference, or NIPS \u2014 had been used as fodder for sexist jokes. So she <url normalizedValue=\"https://gizmodo.com/nips-ai-conference-changes-name-following-protests-ov-1830548185\">started a #ProtestNIPS campaign</url> to change the name, and drew up a petition that gathered more than 2,000 signatures. Eventually, the conference\u2019s board relented, and the event is now abbreviated as \u201cNeurIPS.\u201d It was a small gesture of inclusion that could go a long way toward making women feel more welcome in the field for years to come.</p><p>To Promise, Uptrust and Clear My Record, for helping solve our prison problem.</p><p>Ending mass incarceration has long been seen as a political challenge. But these three companies are trying to show that technology can help.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://joinpromise.com/\">Promise</url> is an app built to keep people out of jail. Aimed at pretrial defendants who cannot afford to post cash bail, it creates customized care plans for each user, sends them reminders of court dates and other critical appointments and allows courts to monitor their progress. The company, which participated in the YCombinator start-up program,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/19/jay-zs-roc-nation-and-first-round-capital-invest-3-million-in-bail-reform-startup-promise/\">recently raised</url> $3 million from investors including Jay-Z\u2019s Roc Nation fund and First Round Capital.</p><p>Another start-up, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.uptrust.co/\">Uptrust</url>, offers a similar text message-based system that sends personalized appointment reminders to low-income clients, and can connect them to services that make getting to court easier, such as rides or child care. The service is already       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.govtech.com/biz/As-California-Ends-Money-Bail-Tech-Startup-Aims-to-Help-People-Make-Their-Court-Dates.html\">up and running</url> in a handful of states, including Baltimore County, Md., and Palm Beach County, Fla.</p><p>Code for America, a nonprofit organization modeled after Teach for America, built <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.clearmyrecord.org/\">Clear My Record,</url> a tool that helps people with old criminal convictions get them reduced or expunged, which makes it easier for them to find housing and get jobs. This year, the team formed a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/code-for-america/restoring-opportunity-delivering-on-the-promise-voters-intended-66879494cf51\">partnership</url> with George Gasc\u00f3n, the San Francisco district attorney, to work on a new program that automates the process of expunging marijuana-related convictions under the state\u2019s legalization laws.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://mashable.com/2018/05/26/code-for-america-clear-my-record-marijuana-convictions-california/#N4INEsbwsaq0\">The group aims</url> to remove 250,000 convictions by the end of 2019.</p><p>To workers at big tech companies, for holding their employers accountable.</p><p>The most heartening trend to come out of large tech companies in 2018 was a surge in employee-led activism. Protests by regulators, shareholders and users have thus far failed to stop the worst excesses of the industry, leaving these companies\u2019 own employees \u2014 who are expensive and hard to replace, and therefore have lots of leverage \u2014 to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/07/technology/tech-workers-ask-censorship-surveillance.html\">agitate for change</url> from within.</p><p>At Google, a group of employees <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/16/technology/google-employees-protest-search-censored-china.html\">went public with concerns</url> about Project Dragonfly, a secret Google project to create a censored version of its search engine for China. Their activism       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://slate.com/technology/2018/11/google-employees-sign-petition-to-end-project-dragonfly.html\">resulted in a petition</url>, which was signed by hundreds of Google employees, to demand that the company cease work on the project.</p><p>Another group of employees <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/26/technology/sexual-harassment-google.html\">spoke up</url> after       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/technology/google-sexual-harassment-andy-rubin.html\">The Times reported</url> on the $90 million payout made to the former Google executive Andy Rubin, who was accused of sexual misconduct. Their efforts       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/01/technology/google-walkout-sexual-harassment.html\">culminated</url> in a 20,000-employee protest walkout.</p><p>Workers at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/16/technology/tech-workers-company-stock-shareholder-activism.html\">Amazon</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/19/technology/tech-companies-immigration-border.html\">Microsoft</url> have also spoken up for change within their companies, on issues ranging from climate change to surveillance, A.I. ethics and the decision to work with federal immigration agencies.</p><p>These workers didn\u2019t solve every problem in tech overnight, but they have created a playbook for other employee activists to follow.

But stay with me here. It's true that this was a horrible year for many of the tech industry's biggest companies. Amazon held a nationwide beauty pageant for its new headquarters, raising hopes that the company would help transform a struggling city, then picked the two places[1] that needed it the least. </p><p>Executives from Facebook, Google and Twitter got hauled before Congress to apologize for *gestures wildly in all directions*. One of Uber's self-driving cars killed someone.[2] And then there was Elon Musk[3].But the tech sector is more than its giants. Last year, I handed out[4] 'good tech' awards to a handful of companies, nonprofit organizations and people who used technology to help others in real, tangible ways. The goal was to shine a spotlight on a few less-heralded projects that may not get front-page headlines or billions of dollars in funding, but are actually trying to fulfill the tech industry's stated goal of improving the world.I'm continuing that tradition this year, in the spirit of reminding us that although scandals and wrongdoing in tech rightly get a lot of attention, there's good happening elsewhere. To Zipline and Swoop Aero, for using drones to heal the sick. For years, consumer drones were hyped as a new technology that would soon fill the skies over America's cities, delivering packages and surveilling the populace. Luckily, that hasn't happened yet, but elsewhere, drone companies are doing real work.One of these efforts is Zipline[5], a startup that uses drones to deliver blood and medicine to medical facilities in remote areas that can't be easily reached by traditional vehicles. The company began operating in Rwanda, where it says it has made more than 8,000 deliveries, and this year expanded to Ghana. Another is Swoop Aero,[6] an Australian drone-delivery company that partnered with UNICEF this year to deliver vaccines to the remote South Pacific nation of Vanuatu, where roughly 20 percent of children do not get properly vaccinated. One nurse in the country told The New York Times[7] that the drone deliveries 'will change my life.' To Upsolve, for helping people go bankrupt.For many low-income Americans, declaring personal bankruptcy can be a painful but necessary way to get rid of exorbitant medical bills or predatory lenders. But it's often expensive to hire a bankruptcy lawyer and hard to navigate the maze of paperwork.Upsolve[8], a nonprofit organization founded by a Harvard graduate and a lawyer, built a tool that has been referred to as the 'TurboTax of bankruptcy.' The software collects financial information from users, automatically fills out their forms and passes them to a lawyer who reviews them before the user submits a bankruptcy claim. In 2018, it helped users in 47 states discharge a total of more than $13 million in debt, according to Rohan Pavuluri, the company's chief executive.To Joy Buolamwini, Timnit Gebru and Anima Anandkumar, for calling out AI bias. Artificial intelligence will be one of the most important areas of computer science in the coming years. It's also one of the least diverse. Just 12 percent of AI researchers are women, and the number of black and Latino executives in the field is vanishingly small. Three leading AI researchers are trying to change that.Buolamwini, a researcher at the MIT Media Lab, is the founder of the Algorithmic Justice League[9], an organization trying to fight what it calls the 'coded gaze' of biased algorithms. This year, she and Gebru \u2014 a Google researcher and co-founder of a group called Black in AI \u2014 released a study[10] that showed that three leading facial recognition algorithms were substantially worse at classifying darker faces than lighter faces, and worse at classifying women's faces than men's faces. The study set off alarm bells at leading tech companies, and was widely cited as evidence of the need for more diversity in the field. Separately, Anandkumar, Nvidia's director of machine learning research and a professor at Caltech, saw that the name of the AI field's marquee annual event \u2014 the Neural Information Processing Systems conference, or NIPS \u2014 had been used as fodder for sexist jokes. So she started a #ProtestNIPS campaign to change the name and drew up a petition that gathered more than 2,000 signatures. Eventually, the conference's board relented, and the event is now abbreviated as 'NeurIPS.' It was a small gesture of inclusion that could go a long way toward making women feel more welcome in the field for years to come.To Promise, Uptrust and Clear My Record, for helping solve our prison problem. Ending mass incarceration has long been seen as a political challenge. But these three companies are trying to show that technology can help. Promise[11] is an app built to keep people out of jail. Aimed at pretrial defendants who cannot afford to post cash bail, it creates customized care plans for each user, sends them reminders of court dates and other critical appointments and allows courts to monitor their progress. The company, which participated in the YCombinator startup program, recently raised $3 million from investors including Jay-Z's Roc Nation fund and First Round Capital. Another startup, Uptrust[12], offers a similar text message-based system that sends personalized appointment reminders to low-income clients, and can connect them to services that make getting to court easier, such as rides or child care. The service is already up and running in a handful of states, including Baltimore County, Maryland, and Palm Beach County, Florida.Code for America, a nonprofit organization modeled after Teach for America, built Clear My Record[13], a tool that helps people with old criminal convictions get them reduced or expunged, which makes it easier for them to find housing and get jobs. This year, the team formed a partnership with George Gasc\u00f3n, the San Francisco district attorney, to work on a new program that automates the process of expunging marijuana-related convictions under the state's legalization laws. The group aims to remove 250,000 convictions by the end of 2019. To workers at big tech companies, for holding their employers accountable.The most heartening trend to come out of large tech companies in 2018 was a surge in employee-led activism. Protests by regulators, shareholders and users have thus far failed to stop the worst excesses of the industry, leaving these companies' own employees \u2014 who are expensive and hard to replace, and therefore have lots of leverage \u2014 to agitate for change from within. At Google, a group of employees went public[14] with concerns about Project Dragonfly, a secret Google project to create a censored version of its search engine for China. Their activism resulted in a petition, which was signed by hundreds of Google employees, to demand that the company cease work on the project. Another group of employees spoke up after The Times reported[15] on the $90 million payout made to the former Google executive Andy Rubin, who was accused of sexual misconduct. Their efforts culminated in a 20,000-employee protest walkout. Workers at Amazon[16] and Microsoft[17] have also spoken up for change within their companies, on issues ranging from climate change to surveillance, AI ethics and the decision to work with federal immigration agencies. These workers didn't solve every problem in tech overnight, but they have created a playbook for other employee activists to follow. More important, they have finally given their executives a measure of accountability \u2014 something they proved they will badly need in 2019.

The company began operating in Rwanda, where it says it has made more than 8,000 deliveries, and this year expanded to Ghana.</p><p>Another is Swoop Aero, an Australian drone-delivery company that partnered with Unicef this year to deliver vaccines to the remote South Pacific nation of Vanuatu, where roughly 20 percent of children do not get properly vaccinated. One nurse in the country told The New York Times that the drone deliveries \"will change my life.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">To Upsolve, for helping people go bankrupt.</emphasis></p><p>For many low-income Americans, declaring personal bankruptcy can be a painful but necessary way to get rid of exorbitant medical bills or predatory lenders. But it's often expensive to hire a bankruptcy lawyer, and hard to navigate the maze of paperwork.</p><p>Upsolve, a nonprofit organization founded by a Harvard graduate and a lawyer, built a tool that has been referred to as the \"TurboTax of bankruptcy.\" The software collects financial information from users, automatically fills out their forms and passes them to a lawyer who reviews them before the user submits a bankruptcy claim. In 2018, it helped users in 47 states discharge a total of more than $13 million in debt, according to Rohan Pavuluri, the company's chief executive.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">To Joy Buolamwini, Timnit Gebru and Anima Anandkumar, for calling out A.I. bias.</emphasis></p><p>Artificial intelligence will be one of the most important areas of computer science in the coming years. It's also one of the least diverse. Just 12 percent of A.I. researchers are women, and the number of black and Latino executives in the field is vanishingly small. Three leading A.I. researchers are trying to change that.</p><p>Ms. Buolamwini, a researcher at the M.I.T. Media Lab, is the founder of the Algorithmic Justice League, an organization trying to fight what it calls the \"coded gaze\" of biased algorithms. This year, she and Ms. Gebru - a Google researcher and co-founder of a group called Black in A.I. - released a study that showed that three leading facial recognition algorithms were substantially worse at classifying darker faces than lighter faces, and worse at classifying women's faces than men's faces. The study set off alarm bells at leading tech companies, and was widely cited as evidence of the need for more diversity in the field.</p><p>Separately, Ms. Anandkumar, Nvidia's director of machine learning research and a professor at Caltech, saw that the name of the A.I. field's marquee annual event - the Neural Information Processing Systems conference, or NIPS - had been used as fodder for sexist jokes. So she started a #ProtestNIPS campaign to change the name, and drew up a petition that gathered more than 2,000 signatures. Eventually, the conference's board relented, and the event is now abbreviated as \"NeurIPS.\" It was a small gesture of inclusion that could go a long way toward making women feel more welcome in the field for years to come.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">To Promise, Uptrust and Clear My Record, for helping solve our prison problem.</emphasis></p><p>Ending mass incarceration has long been seen as a political challenge. But these three companies are trying to show that technology can help.</p><p>Promise is an app built to keep people out of jail. Aimed at pretrial defendants who cannot afford to post cash bail, it creates customized care plans for each user, sends them reminders of court dates and other critical appointments and allows courts to monitor their progress. The company, which participated in the YCombinator start-up program, recently raised $3 million from investors including Jay-Z's Roc Nation fund and First Round Capital.</p><p>Another start-up, Uptrust, offers a similar text message-based system that sends personalized appointment reminders to low-income clients, and can connect them to services that make getting to court easier, such as rides or child care. The service is already up and running in a handful of states, including Baltimore County, Md., and Palm Beach County, Fla.</p><p>Code for America, a nonprofit organization modeled after Teach for America, built Clear My Record, a tool that helps people with old criminal convictions get them reduced or expunged, which makes it easier for them to find housing and get jobs. This year, the team formed a partnership with George Gasc\u00f3n, the San Francisco district attorney, to work on a new program that automates the process of expunging marijuana-related convictions under the state's legalization laws. The group aims to remove 250,000 convictions by the end of 2019.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">To workers at big tech companies, for holding their employers accountable.</emphasis></p><p>The most heartening trend to come out of large tech companies in 2018 was a surge in employee-led activism. Protests by regulators, shareholders and users have thus far failed to stop the worst excesses of the industry, leaving these companies' own employees - who are expensive and hard to replace, and therefore have lots of leverage - to agitate for change from within.</p><p>At Google, a group of employees went public with concerns about Project Dragonfly, a secret Google project to create a censored version of its search engine for China. Their activism resulted in a petition, which was signed by hundreds of Google employees, to demand that the company cease work on the project.</p><p>Another group of employees spoke up after The Times reported on the $90 million payout made to the former Google executive Andy Rubin, who was accused of sexual misconduct. Their efforts culminated in a 20,000-employee protest walkout.</p><p>Workers at Amazon and Microsoft have also spoken up for change within their companies, on issues ranging from climate change to surveillance, A.I. ethics and the decision to work with federal immigration agencies.</p><p>These workers didn't solve every problem in tech overnight, but they have created a playbook for other employee activists to follow. More important, they have finally given their executives a measure of accountability - something they proved they will badly need in 2019.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Kevin Roose is a columnist for Business Day and a writer-at-large for The New York Times Magazine.

Neoliberalism is an economic model that lowers trade barriers, deregulates capital markets and allows money to flow wherever it will - usually to where labor is cheapest. Over the past generation, both parties have given neoliberalism their support.</p><p>In fact, the system has underpinned the past 40 years or so of globalization.</p><p>To be fair, it has lifted billions of people out of poverty, particularly overseas, mainly by opening global trade. </p><p>As emerging markets have joined in the free-market system, a new global middle class has been born, and at a global level, inequality has decreased.</p><p>But it's also allowed for huge inequalities within individual countries and created bigger and more damaging financial crises around the world. What happens in one economy affects what happens in another thousands of miles away. </p><p>When capital can flow in and out of countries at will, financial speculation can imperil economies half a world away.</p><p>The two biggest beneficiaries of globalization since 2000 have been, research shows, China and big companies. China benefited from the inflow of global capital looking for cheap labor. This contributed to growth and rising wages there, particularly in the manufacturing sector, which suffered by comparison in many other countries. (As a state-run system, China could manage some of the downsides of globalization more easily, ring-fencing strategic sectors or limiting capital inflows when necessary.)</p><p>The other winners are big companies that, thanks to their global footprints, are able to fly miles over the problems - and the laws - of any particular nation. They can move jobs, capital and profits wherever they like, which allows them to leverage all the benefits of the current system, without dealing with the downsides - in the form of growing inequality, skill shortages or rising populism - with which nations themselves have to wrestle.</p><p>Tech companies have enjoyed this neoliberal benefit - only on steroids. </p><p>If capital can flow more easily across borders than either labor or goods, data - which is Big Tech's real currency - is like quicksilver: It moves even more freely. </p><p>According to McKinsey Global Institute figures, about 80 percent of all corporate wealth is now living in 10 percent of companies, which are richest in data and intellectual property. Those assets can be located anywhere - which is why tech firms typically pay even less in taxes as a percentage of revenue than other types of multinational companies.</p><p>It's no surprise that public trust in the elites who run such firms is at record lows. </p><p>The anti-elite sentiment was a powerful driver in producing the phenomenon of Trump and remains potent, in the United States and overseas. And yet the tech giants seem oblivious to this fact. </p><p>That's partly because they came of age when the private sector was ascendant, when greed was good and when government showed little interest in regulation. Which might help explain why so many tech companies' PR is tin-eared: They simply don't remember a time when things were any different or have any idea of why they should be.</p><p>Warren is a logical tribune for this moment. She may have worked as a bankruptcy lawyer, but at heart, she's an economic nationalist. </p><p>Her policies would empower the public sector to redistribute some of the wealth hoarded by multinational companies in recent years to a broader group of stakeholders - labor, yes, but also small and midsize businesses and local communities. </p><p>A Warren administration would likely push to in-source some supply chains and connect the dots between educators and job creators with new vocational programs. Her health-care plan, which might be a step too far for many Americans, at least has the intellectual coherency of her convictions - it's a top-down, nationalized approach designed to give the entire population basic coverage.</p><p>Warren is not the only politician espousing a more-regulated capitalist system, one that would owe a lot, ironically, to what unfolded in the United States in the 1960s: a consciously regulated economy at the federal level. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., has made similar-sounding suggestions, a sign that Republicans will try to go back to the future, too, whenever Trump departs the stage.</p><p>Over time, all manner of companies might be reined in - and in particularly the supranational tech firms that represent the apex of the old, neoliberal order. </p><p>Their days as unregulated global behemoths - like those of the economic system that bred it - are numbered.</p><p>Foroohar is global business columnist and associate editor at the Financial Times, and author of \"Don't Be Evil: How Big Tech Betrayed Its Founding Principles - and All of Us.\" She is on Twitter, @RanaForoohar.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SDUT-LA0105835261</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SDUT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XHY-8Y31-JBM5-R1HK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11811</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"909\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The San Diego Union-Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The San Diego Union Tribune</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 18, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>econ-comment</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000797</classCode><className>GLOBALIZATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001342</classCode><className>POLITICAL CANDIDATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001346</classCode><className>POLITICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DF5U</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DNV7</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DLA3</classCode><className>ECONOMICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp;

Scott Olson / Getty Images / AFP</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Two social media tech titans sparred last week in Washington. The chief executive of Twitter Jack Dorsey said his company would no longer accept political ads, placing democratic interest over profit. It was a thinly disguised right hook at his counterpart Mark Zuckerberg, the founder and chief of Facebook. Twitter is by far the most political social media platform. Choosing to take down political advertising is a naked declaration of war against Facebook.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mr Zuckerberg, a Harvard dropout who went on to popularise the social media frenzy, has in recent years had an identity crisis. After a series of scandals involving breaches of data privacy \u2013 not to mention his portrayal as eccentric and controlling in the critically acclaimed film The Social Network \u2013 he has been widely perceived as someone who cares about little but money and success. Most recently, he has been criticised for not regulating his platform to control hate speech, bullying and government-led misinformation campaigns. There have been calls for him to resign, or at least reign in his domain.</p><p>Most people do not take time anymore to develop opinions. They are satisfied with the short, edited and subjective snippets on their social media feeds</p><p>With election fever starting to grip America, and Democratic debates being watched by millions, Facebook and Twitter are becoming even more important. The pinnacle of this madness came earlier this month when Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat hoping to win the bid in next year's presidential election, deliberately placed an ad on Facebook with misleading information \u2013 as a goad to the social media platform.</p><p>In the ad, Ms Warren wrote that Mr Zuckerberg had decided to back US President Donald Trump in the 2020 election. In reality, neither Facebook nor Mr Zuckerberg had announced their intentions. Then Ms Warren delivered the kicker: \"You're probably shocked and you might be thinking: 'How could this possibly be true?' Well, it's not,\" Ms Warren said in the ad, effectively digitally spitting in Facebook's face.</p><p>Deciphering the world of political disinformation and social media is a complicated and scattered puzzle. Joe Biden, for instance, is aiming his ads at voters born before 1975. Two-thirds of Mr Biden's targets are women while Bernie Sanders has an audience of about 50 per cent men. According to an investigation by the New York Times: \"Collectively, the 19 current Democratic candidates for president have poured nearly $32 million into Facebook ads this year \u2013 more money than they have spent so far on television ads, a striking measure of the social network's ever-rising influence in politics.\" These ads are geared towards vulnerable or shifting voters who are not yet decided or are not firmly rooted in their political choices. Facebook stores data about which political party you belong to, although this feature can be turned off.</p><p>This means the richer the candidate, the more time they can commandeer on Facebook. This heavy spending continues despite party officials raising alarms about the social network's role in American democracy. Ms Warren, for example, spent about $172,000 (Dh631,670) on Facebook ads. And Mr Biden in October alone spent $12,000 (more than Dh44,000) trying to target younger voters. But while US politicians are happy to embrace the positive effects of online campaigning, they are not averse to hitting out when it doesn't work for them. Both Ms Warren and Democratic congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard have called for big tech companies such as Google, Amazon and Facebook to be broken up. Ms Gabbard, an Iraq war veteran who often appears on the Russian state television channel RT, launched a $50 million lawsuit against Google earlier this year for allegedly impinging on her free speech.

Scott Olson / Getty Images / AFP</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Two social media tech titans sparred last week in Washington. The chief executive of Twitter Jack Dorsey said his company would no longer accept political ads, placing democratic interest over profit. It was a thinly disguised right hook at his counterpart Mark Zuckerberg, the founder and chief of Facebook. Twitter is by far the most political social media platform. Choosing to take down political advertising is a naked declaration of war against Facebook.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mr Zuckerberg, a Harvard dropout who went on to popularise the social media frenzy, has in recent years had an identity crisis. After a series of scandals involving breaches of data privacy \u2013 not to mention his portrayal as eccentric and controlling in the critically acclaimed film The Social Network \u2013 he has been widely perceived as someone who cares about little but money and success. Most recently, he has been criticised for not regulating his platform to control hate speech, bullying and government-led misinformation campaigns. There have been calls for him to resign, or at least reign in his domain.</p><p>Most people do not take time anymore to develop opinions. They are satisfied with the short, edited and subjective snippets on their social media feeds</p><p>With election fever starting to grip America, and Democratic debates being watched by millions, Facebook and Twitter are becoming even more important. The pinnacle of this madness came earlier this month when Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat hoping to win the bid in next year's presidential election, deliberately placed an ad on Facebook with misleading information \u2013 as a goad to the social media platform.</p><p>In the ad, Ms Warren wrote that Mr Zuckerberg had decided to back US President Donald Trump in the 2020 election. In reality, neither Facebook nor Mr Zuckerberg had announced their intentions. Then Ms Warren delivered the kicker: \"You're probably shocked and you might be thinking: 'How could this possibly be true?' Well, it's not,\" Ms Warren said in the ad, effectively digitally spitting in Facebook's face.</p><p>Deciphering the world of political disinformation and social media is a complicated and scattered puzzle. Joe Biden, for instance, is aiming his ads at voters born before 1975. Two-thirds of Mr Biden's targets are women while Bernie Sanders has an audience of about 50 per cent men. According to an investigation by the New York Times: \"Collectively, the 19 current Democratic candidates for president have poured nearly $32 million into Facebook ads this year \u2013 more money than they have spent so far on television ads, a striking measure of the social network's ever-rising influence in politics.\" These ads are geared towards vulnerable or shifting voters who are not yet decided or are not firmly rooted in their political choices. Facebook stores data about which political party you belong to, although this feature can be turned off.</p><p>This means the richer the candidate, the more time they can commandeer on Facebook. This heavy spending continues despite party officials raising alarms about the social network's role in American democracy. Ms Warren, for example, spent about $172,000 (Dh631,670) on Facebook ads. And Mr Biden in October alone spent $12,000 (more than Dh44,000) trying to target younger voters. But while US politicians are happy to embrace the positive effects of online campaigning, they are not averse to hitting out when it doesn't work for them. Both Ms Warren and Democratic congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard have called for big tech companies such as Google, Amazon and Facebook to be broken up. Ms Gabbard, an Iraq war veteran who often appears on the Russian state television channel RT, launched a $50 million lawsuit against Google earlier this year for allegedly impinging on her free speech. She accused the tech giant of suspending her campaign's ad account for six hours after the first presidential debate in June. The suspension, Ms Gabbard stated, prevented her campaign from raising money and spreading its message to potential voters. Her lawsuit also complained that emails from her campaign were being sent to spam folders at \"a disproportionately high rate\" compared to emails from other Democratic candidates.</p><p>I rarely use Facebook and as an American who is deeply concerned about the possibility of Mr Trump being re-elected in 2020, I wonder if I am making a mistake by not paying more attention to how people are being influenced for political gain. Does it no longer make sense to read their platforms, follow their policies and watch the debates? It seems as though most people do not take time anymore to develop their own opinions.

But Mr Dorsey also says: \"If someone pays us to target and force people to see their political ad \u2013 well, they can say whatever they want.\"</p><p>This concept is of course terrifying.

Is this different from flyers that people used to send through the mail, ads in newspapers or people going from door to door in swing states, trying to convince citizens to vote one way or another?</p><p>What makes me hesitant about social media specifically is the rapid evolution in technology. From the ubiquity of screens to the advances in virtual reality, the boundary between our lived lives and our virtual lives is blurry at best.

Rowe Price said in a report outlining its outlook at the year's halfway mark. The upcoming US corporate earnings season is unlikely to serve as a catalyst that drives stock prices meaningfully higher, T. Rowe's top investment officers said. Visit Markets Insider's homepage for more stories[1].In the world of investing, sometimes playing the hero and taking a risk can pay off. Now probably isn't one of those times, according to one of the world's largest asset managers. </p><p>Escalating trade tensions[2] between the US and China have created an unpredictable stock market environment, and investors would be prudent to take mounting geopolitical risks into consideration, top T. Rowe Price investment officers said in a report. \"Markets are near highs and risks are rising, so it's not time to be a hero,\" Rob Sharps, the firm's head of investments and group chief investment officer, said. \"It's a good time to be diversified, invest strategically, and have your shopping list ready in case stocks pull back and go on sale.\" Slowing global economic growth could improve if trade relations between the US and China don't deteriorate further, the firm said. While T. Rowe \u2014 which oversees $1.07 trillion in assets \u2014is \"generally constructive\" on the market through year-end, \"risks are building.\" A bonus just for you:Click here to claim 30 days of access to Business Insider PRIME[3] Those risks include expectations for a sluggish US corporate earnings season, earnings momentum turning negative in Europe and in Japan, and the potential for federal anti-trust regulation looming over big tech[4]. \"The trade war between the US and China is metastasizing into a technology war,\" Justin Thomson, the firm's chief investment officer of equities, said in the report. \"This could make settlement harder, as both countries may believe that critical technology advantages are at stake.\" More granularly, the firm made note of the trade war's \"corrosive\" effect on business confidence and capital spending[5], notably in export-heavy economies like Germany and Taiwan. Investors may find some clarity[6] on the international trade situation later this week when President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are set to convene at the G20 summit in Osaka, Japan[7].

Especially on sports, which generates 70% of global gaming revenue: more than lotteries, poker, casinos, and any other form of gaming - combined. In 2017, the global sports betting market was around $104.31 billion. Worldwide sports wagering according to some sources is expected to reach $155.49 billion by 2024[2].Today, the coronavirus pandemic has locked-down countless casinos and other live venues for wagering. </p><p>For instance, wagers on sports at bookmakers in New Jersey fell 68% in April alone. But there is a flip side: a huge boom in online gaming and gambling. And among the companies poised to benefit from this digital trend is FansUnite (CSE:FANS;[3] OTCMKTS:FUNFF[4]) - an online sports betting company that has tremendous upside but is currently a small-cap early stage entry point. The Economist says[5], 'COVID-19 has driven American gamblers online with casinos shut and sports disrupted, gamblers have still gotten their fix.' And in these unprecedented times, it's esports that is garnering the attention from all sports fans who can't go to stadium games or even watch them on TV. The Economist adds that esports have attracted 'a rocketing number of viewers' during the pandemic, noting that 'gamblers still wary of lingering in crowded casinos may turn to sports betting as an accessible form of socially distant gambling.' Streetwise Reports says online sports is 'an elixir for fun-starved fans.' 'The stay-at-home lifestyle we now face in 2020 could result in a massive shift in the habits of players,' said FansUnite CEO Darius Eghdami. 'Players that are used to going to the physical casino or the horse track may now shift their habits to online and FansUnite (CSE:FANS;[6] OTCMKTS:FUNFF[7]) with its sophisticated online betting platforms, is one of several industry leaders positioning themselves to benefit from this change in consumer behavior triggered by the coronavirus pandemic. In 2019, the global online gambling market was $53.7 billion. But in the age of COVID-19, online gambling is expected by some analysts to increase at a compound annual growth rate of 11.5% from 2020 to 2027.Source: Gambling Compliance Report, 5/13/19. With stay-at-home and lockdowns remaining in force in so many states, the quarantine-fueled explosion in online gambling, mergers and acquisitions in the internet gaming space are on the upswing. And M&amp;#38;A, especially in the gambling sector, recently has had an impressive track record of generating handsome profits for investors who got in early. For instance \uf0a7 When LeoVegas acquired Italian gambling operator Winga[8], Leo's share price rose 183% in just 11 months. \uf0a7 GVC acquired ben.party[9], and its stock more than doubled, gaining 138% in 2.5 years. \uf0a7 A year later, Flutter Entertainment merged with the Stars Group[10], forming the largest gaming group on the planet \u2014 and share prices jumped 48.5% in only 8 months. A paper in the Journal of Financial Economics tracked the results of acquisition attempts made by 30 active acquirers. The study[11] found that 'For a sample of thirty active acquirers, the evidence indicates that acquisition attempts were profitable investment projects.' For example, DraftKings went public and acquired SB Tech. The result? DraftKings stock almost doubled since its April 2020 IPO \u2014 elevating the market cap to $20 billion.The next big play in Canadian gamingNow, a similar play - one with enormous potential for the companies involved - is unfolding even as we speak: FansUnite Entertainment Inc. (CCSE:FANS;[12] OTCMKTS:FUNFF[13]) FansUnite is a sports and entertainment company focusing on technology for regulated and lawful online sports betting. The consumer platform offers a wide choice of payment methods, including PayPal, credit cards, and even cryptocurrencies. FansUnite will make money on the consumer side by taking a small fee for all bets placed on the platform, which is set to launch later this year. In June 2020, FansUnite and Askott Entertainment Inc. entered into an amalgamation agreement. FansUnite will acquire all outstanding secure of Askott to create one of Canada's leading online gaming companies focused on sports betting, esports wagering, and casino games. Askott focuses on esports betting with multiple B2C platforms and several B2B contracts signed. Two are live and generating revenue; the other two are expected to go live this year. A new sales team, upon completion of the acquisition, will be responsible for bringing in 10 or more additional clients quickly. This could cause B2B revenues to grow and compound at a rapid rate. Plus, FansUnite wholly owns McBookie, which operates solely in the UK with a focus on casinos, virtual sports, and sports betting. McBookie has around 10,000 active players and has approximately $350M CAD of betting volume since inception. FansUnite's shareholders are supportive of the company's aggressive M&amp;#38;A strategy. The company has shown an ability to complete financing if required. Their first deals were heavily stock-based acquisitions, with the leadership team leveraging their experience and the opportunity to share in future growth as a key aspect of the deals. Another plus is that FansUnite's board and executive team have decades of experience in strategy, M&amp;#38;A, esports, sports betting, launching and growing new brands in the gaming space, and licensing government relationships and transactions to develop shareholder value. CEO and co-founder Darius Eghdami has been in the sports betting and handicapping industries for over a decade, and some industry experts have been keeping their eye on him. Darius was named to the TMX Group's Top 150 Entrepreneurs, a distinction he is showing was well deserved. FansUnite also boasts an experienced technical development team. Their programmers and systems analysts have built all of FansUnite platforms with innovative and scalable technology. The newly acquired Askott team was nominated for esports platform provider of the year by EGR Virtual Awards.Cutting edge technology in a burgeoning industry.The float for FansUnite (CSE:FANS;[14] OTCMKTS:FUNFF[15]) is small. All insiders are locked up for 12 months, showing confidence in their long-term vision for the company. Experience shows that the lion's share of the opportunities and synergies are identified within the first 6 to 12 months of the merger. Once you read about the deal on the front page of the Wall Street Journal or Financial Times, the company has probably made it. Which means investors should watch this company carefully between now and when the merger is completed or right after that. Second, the duration and eventual end of the coronavirus pandemic is unpredictable. FansUnite has demonstrated its ability in these unprecedented times not only survive but also thrive. Since the NBA and then the rest of the sporting world, shut down in mid-March, FansUnite has completed a $3m+ financing, closed the acquisition of McBookie, listed their stock and successfully negotiated their merger with Askott Entertainment. Once lockdown is lifted, it will no doubt change the online/in-person mix of betting opportunities, but one thing this company has done in recent months is show its ability to adapt, and flourish in rapidly shifting circumstances. As mentioned, global online gambling is already a huge market with $53.7 billion in annual revenues. And online gambling is forecast to increase at a compound annual growth rate of 11.5% from 2020 to 2027[16]. FansUnite has been operating independently since 2013. But now that FansUnite is about to merge with Askott Entertainment, it's a whole new ball game. The new FansUnite will have the technology, subscriber base, and management team to achieve its primary mission: to become one of the big players that dominate this niche - and become the largest iGaming provider in Canada. When and if that happens, there's no telling where the company could go. But investors who invest now can take a position in FansUnite at an early stage company price\u2014currently around 50 cents a share. That means you can own a block of 10,000 shares for around $5,000. Conclusion: If you want to gamble for some of the big gains being made in online sports betting without paying through the nose FansUnite (CSE:FANS;[17] OTCMKTS:FUNFF[18]) could be a smart way to do it, while the online sports betting market is on fire.

For example, Google uses location data to work out demographic information, target advertising, and offer advertising services to other businesses. </p><p>Digital platforms increasingly track consumers online and offline to create highly detailed personal profiles on each of us. These profiles are then used to sell advertising services. These data practices create risks of criminal data breaches, discrimination, exclusion and manipulation.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: Here's how tech giants profit from invading our privacy, and how we can start taking it back</emphasis></p><h>Concealed data practices under fire around the world</h><p>The ACCC joins a number of other regulators and consumer organisations taking aim at the <url normalizedValue=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3432769\">concealed data practices</url> of the \"tech giants\".</p><p>This year, the Norwegian Consumer Council published a report - <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.forbrukerradet.no/undersokelse/no-undersokelsekategori/deceived-by-design\">Deceived by Design</url> - which analysed a sample of Google, Facebook and Microsoft Windows privacy settings. The conclusion: \"service providers employ numerous tactics in order to nudge or push consumers toward sharing as much data as possible\".  </p><p>The report said some aspects of privacy policies can be seen as \"dark patterns\", or \"features of interface design crafted to trick users into doing things that they might not want to do\". </p><p>In Canada, an investigation into how Facebook gets consent for certain data practices by the Office of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/opc-actions-and-decisions/investigations/investigations-into-businesses/2019/pipeda-2019-002/\">Privacy Commissioner of Canada</url> was highly critical. </p><p>It found that the relevant data use policy \"contained blanket statements referencing potential disclosures of a broad range of personal information, to a broad range of individuals or organisations, for a broad range of purposes\". The result was that Facebook users \"had no way of truly knowing what personal information would be disclosed to which app and for what purposes\". </p><h>Is Facebook next?</h><p>The ACCC was highly critical of the data practices of a number of large digital platforms when the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.accc.gov.au/publications/digital-platforms-inquiry-final-report\">Final Report</url> of the Digital Platforms Inquiry was published in July this year. The platforms included included Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter and Google. </p><p>The report was particularly scathing about privacy policies which were long, complex, difficult to navigate and low on real choices for consumers. In its words, certain common features of digital platforms' consent processes </p><p>leverage digital platforms' bargaining power and deepen information asymmetries, preventing consumers from providing meaningful consents to digital platforms' collection, use and disclosure of their user data. </p><p>The report also stated the ACCC was investigating whether various representations by Google and Facebook respectively would \"raise issues under the ACL\". </p><p>The investigations concerning Facebook related to representations concerning its sharing of user data with third parties and potential unfair contract terms. So far no proceedings against Facebook have been announced.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: 94% of Australians do not read all privacy policies that apply to them - and that's rational behaviour</emphasis></p><h>Will this change anything?</h><p>While penalties of up to A$10 million or 10% of annual turnover (in Australia) may sound significant, last year Google made US$116 <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">billion</emphasis> in advertising revenue globally.</p><p>In July, the US Federal Trade Commission settled with Facebook on a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/blogs/business-blog/2019/07/ftcs-5-billion-facebook-settlement-record-breaking-history\">US$5 billion fine</url> for repeatedly misleading users about the fact that personal information could be accessed by third-party apps without the user's consent, if a user's Facebook \"friend\" gave consent.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/facebook-stock-hits-highest-price-in-nearly-a-year-after-reports-of-5-billion-ftc-fine-2019-07-12\">Facebook's share price went up</url> after the FTC approved the settlement.</p><p>But this does not mean the ACCC's proceedings against Google are a pointless exercise.

The case is the consumer watchdog's first move against a major digital platform following the publication of theDigital Platforms Inquiry Final Reportin July. The ACCC follows regulators in countries including the US and Germany in taking action against the way 'tech giants' such as Google and Facebook harvest and exploit their users' data.</p><p><br/>What did Google do?ACCC Chair Rod Sims said Google 'collected, kept and used highly sensitive and valuable personal information about consumers' location without them making an informed choice'. The ACCC alleges that Google breached the Australian Consumer Law (ACL) by misleading its users in the course of 2017 and 2018, including by:<br/>&lt;ul&gt;<br/><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>not properly disclosing that two different settings needed to be switched off if consumers did not want Google to collect, keep and use their location data</p></bodyText></listItem></list><br/><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>not disclosing on those pages that personal location data could be used for a number of purposes unrelated to the consumer's use of Google services.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><br/>&lt;/ul&gt; Some of the alleged breaches can carry penalties of up to A$10 million or 10% of annual turnover.A spokesperson for Google isreportedto have said the company is reviewing the allegations and engaging with the ACCC.<br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2019-10/29/TC_128a08ea-9_Image_In_Body.png\"/><br/><br/>The two separate settings that users needed to change to disable location tracking.<br/>Android screenshots, Author provided<br/><br/>Turning off 'Location History' did not turn off location historyAccording to the ACCC, Google's account settings on Android phones and tablets would have led consumers to thinkchanging a setting on the 'Location History' page would stop Google from collecting, keeping and using their location data. The ACCC says Google failed to make clear to consumers that they would actually need to change their choices on a separate setting titled 'Web &amp; App Activity' to prevent this location tracking.<br/>Location data is used for much more than Google MapsGoogle collects and uses consumers' personal location data for purposes other than providing Google services to consumers. For example, Google uses location data to work out demographic information, target advertising, and offer advertising services to other businesses. Digital platforms increasingly track consumers online and offline to create highly detailed personal profiles on each of us. These profiles are then used to sell advertising services. These data practices create risks of criminal data breaches, discrimination, exclusion and manipulation.<br/><br/>Read more:<br/>Here's how tech giants profit from invading our privacy, and how we can start taking it back<br/><br/><br/>Concealed data practices under fire around the worldThe ACCC joins a number of other regulators and consumer organisations taking aim at theconcealed data practicesof the 'tech giants'.This year, the Norwegian Consumer Council published a report -Deceived by Design- which analysed a sample of Google, Facebook and Microsoft Windows privacy settings. The conclusion: 'service providers employ numerous tactics in order to nudge or push consumers toward sharing as much data as possible'.The report said some aspects of privacy policies can be seen as 'dark patterns', or 'features of interface design crafted to trick users into doing things that they might not want to do'. In Canada, an investigation into how Facebook gets consent for certain data practices by the Office of thePrivacy Commissioner of Canadawas highly critical. It found that the relevant data use policy 'contained blanket statements referencing potential disclosures of a broad range of personal information, to a broad range of individuals or organisations, for a broad range of purposes'. The result was that Facebook users 'had no way of truly knowing what personal information would be disclosed to which app and for what purposes'.<br/>Is Facebook next?The ACCC was highly critical of the data practices of a number of large digital platforms when theFinal Reportof the Digital Platforms Inquiry was published in July this year. The platforms included included Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter and Google. The report was particularly scathing about privacy policies which were long, complex, difficult to navigate and low on real choices for consumers. In its words, certain common features of digital platforms' consent processes The report also stated the ACCC was investigating whether various representations by Google and Facebook respectively would 'raise issues under the ACL'. The investigations concerning Facebook related to representations concerning its sharing of user data with third parties and potential unfair contract terms. So far no proceedings against Facebook have been announced.<br/><br/>Read more:<br/>94% of Australians do not read all privacy policies that apply to them - and that's rational behaviour<br/><br/><br/>Will this change anything?While penalties of up to A$10 million or 10% of annual turnover (in Australia) may sound significant, last year Google made US$116 billion in advertising revenue globally.In July, the US Federal Trade Commission settled with Facebook on aUS$5 billion finefor repeatedly misleading users about the fact that personal information could be accessed by third-party apps without the user's consent, if a user's Facebook 'friend' gave consent.Facebook's share price went upafter the FTC approved the settlement.But this does not mean the ACCC's proceedings against Google are a pointless exercise. Aside from the impact on Google's reputation, these proceedings may highlight for consumers the difference between platforms which have incentives to hide data practices from consumers and other platforms - like the search engine DuckDuckGo - which offer privacy-respecting alternatives.<br/>&lt;ul&gt;<br/><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Privacy</p></bodyText></listItem></list><br/><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Google</p></bodyText></listItem></list><br/><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Big tech</p></bodyText></listItem></list><br/><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Surveillance capitalism</p></bodyText></listItem></list><br/>&lt;/ul&gt;<br/><br/>MENAFN2910201901990000ID1099192361</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOENG-1099192361</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOENG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XCP-1V31-JCNX-30N6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">300986</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"984\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MENAFN.COM All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Global English (Middle East and North Africa Financial Network)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"38987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 29, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

In October, Senators Mark R. Warner (D-VA) and Josh Hawley (R-MO)\u2014who are particularly well-known for their critiques of big tech and companies that deal in consumer data\u2014teamed up with Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) to introduce S.2658[1], the Augmenting Compatibility and Competition by Enabling Service Switching (ACCESS) Act, which Senator Hawley says will 'boost competition and give consumers the power to move their data from one service to another.'Specifically, the ACCESS Act would enable consumers to obtain their user data from the largest online communications and information providers and transfer it to competitor platforms by mandating data portability from the dominant platforms and interoperability with competitor services. However, there are several reasons to question whether the solutions offered under the Act are likely to be effective. </p><p>The Access Act Mandates Data Portability and Interoperability By mandating data portability, lawmakers hope to increase competition in the online communications and information market by empowering users to exert control over their personal data by taking it to a competitor. The ACCESS Act would require consumer-facing communications and information services providers with a product or service that (a) has more than 100 million monthly active U.S. users and (b) generates income from personal data it collects about individual users ('large communications platform providers') to establish external interfaces that would allow users to safely download their own data or directly port it to a competing communications provider.To facilitate consumers' transfer rights, the ACCESS Act would also require large communications platform providers to establish and maintain external interoperability interfaces by which competitors can securely receive ported consumer data. The Act also includes a non-discrimination provision that obligates the large communications platform providers to operate the interface 'based on fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory terms.'The Act assigns responsibility for oversight and enforcement to the Federal Trade Commission. Statements by Senator Blumenthal indicate the Act is specifically intended to apply to tech giants like Facebook and Google, but the broad scope of the term 'communications provider' on its face would also encompass telecommunication companies like AT...nd Verizon\u2014which are already regulated by the Federal Communications Commission (at least with respect to their telecommunications services although not their Internet access services, and 'communications service' is not defined in the bill). Existing Data Portability and Interoperability Options It is not clear that the Act would achieve its purported aims. Advocates argue it is needed to 'restore competition' in the online communications and information market 'without burdensome regulation,' and that the portability and interoperability requirements have broad parallels in the requirements imposed on former monopoly landline phone companies under the Telecommunications Act of 1996 - requirements that significantly contributed to the development of competition in the phone industry.Even so, these requirements may be unnecessary\u2014many companies with platforms likely to be the intended targets of the Act already offer programs and tools providing for user data portability and interoperability. Google, Facebook, and Instagram already offer functionalities that allow users to download a local copy of their complete account data to use as they see fit. And in 2018, Google and Microsoft launched the Data Transfer Project to develop an open-source platform that will enable data transfers between participating service providers, including companies such as Apple, Facebook, and Twitter.Moreover, there is reason to doubt that these requirements would increase competition within the targeted industries. It does not appear that users of popular social media platforms already offering data portability actually take advantage of that function in the manner envisioned by ACCESS Act proponents.In contrast with many reports about social media users who, after downloading a copy of their data, decided to change their account usage or delete it altogether, for example, there are few reports of users who then decided to re-upload their content to an alternative platform. This suggests the Act's proposed mandates are unlikely to spur consumers to transfer their data from an existing platform to a smaller competitor.On the other hand, the obligation on large platforms to establish interfaces from which competitors could automatically transfer information without burdening the consumer would be new and, at least in theory, could make a difference. Platforms Continue Call for Comprehensive Federal Legislation Irrespective of whether data portability and interoperability promote competition, there is a clear trend towards imposing such obligations on consumer-facing online platforms more generally. Both the GDPR and the CCPA already grant individuals a specific right to data portability without regard to industry (although the CCPA does exempt businesses that do not meet its threshold size or revenue criteria).While the proposed ACCESS Act\u2014which narrowly focuses only on the largest communications platform providers\u2014is clearly on trend, it would further entrench the United States' patchwork approach to consumer and personal data protection laws.Indeed, many large communications platform providers have called for federal legislation[2] that comprehensively addresses the collection and use of consumer data across all industries and assert that such an approach would be most beneficial for both companies and consumers. Federal privacy bills were recently introduced in the House[3] and Senate[4].[View source.[5]] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/2658?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22Augmenting+Compatibility+and+Competition+by+Enabling+Service+Switching+%28ACCESS%29+Act%22%5D%7D\">https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/2658?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22Augmenting+Compatibility+and+Competition+by+Enabling+Service+Switching+%28ACCESS%29+Act%22%5D%7D</url>......

While the test doesn't affect all Yahoo users and may not be permanent,\u00a0it points to\u00a0how threatening ad blocking technology has become to Internet companies that rely heavily on online advertising revenue.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ab blockers have been around for years but gained new prominence and popularity this year when Apple officially opened its App Store to ad blocking apps in September. Compounding the list of big tech names in the fray, earlier this month Firefox broke new ground by introducing an\u00a0ad-blocking feature\u00a0for the private-mode on its browser.</p><p>That kind of built-in support for blocking isn't sitting well with\u00a0major Web publishers, who have\u00a0gone to court\u00a0in an effort to blunt the development of technology designed to make the Internet a more ad-free environment.\u00a0</p><p>But the issues around ad blockers are much more nuanced than the tug-of-war between\u00a0impatient consumers who don't want to see pop-ups and publishers that want to hold onto profits. It's also about privacy, security, and the continued ability to access free content on the Web.</p><p>What's an ad blocker?</p><p>An ad blocker is software, such as an application or extension, that prevents Web browsers from displaying advertisements. Some of the most popular ad blockers are AdBlock, Adblock Plus, Ghostery, and Disconnect.</p><p>Privacy nonprofit Electronic Frontier Foundation developed Privacy Badger, a browser extension that gives users control over which specific third-parties - thus ad companies - are allowed to track them across websites.</p><p>There are varying estimates for how widespread ad blocker use is, but AdBlock boasts 200 million downloads from the Google Chrome Web Store.</p><p>Native advertising is where blocking get a little less clear. Native ads are presented in a similar format as a publisher's original content in a bid to be less intrusive. Depending on whether the ad is published through the site's platform or served through the ad company, the native ad could be affected by ad blockers.</p><p>What are the key issues?</p><p>At its most basic level, the debate consists of two camps. One side believes it's wrong for consumers to block ads because it deprives publishers and advertisers of ad revenue. The other side argues that ad blockers are necessary to combat ads that intrude on their browsing experience.</p><p>Many ad blocking proponents use the software to opt-out of the pervasive tracking that advertisers rely on to target ads and model consumer behavior.</p><p>What's at stake?</p><p>For those against ad blockers, the stakes are monetary.</p><p>Online advertising totaled $49.5 billion in 2014, according to the Interactive Advertising Bureau. A report by PageFair and Adobe estimates that ad blockers will deprive advertisers of $22 billion in 2015, more than 40 percent more than in 2014.</p><p>That could hit smaller sites and blogs, which can rely heavily on online advertising to turn a profit. Those on the publishers' side argue that adapting to the world of ad blockers by creating less-intrusive ads puts an unfair and expensive burden on publishers. Some publishers are even opting for anti-ad blocking software.</p><p>Making the issue even more complex, some big companies could stand to gain by offering ad blockers to limit their competitors' ads.</p><p>Google controls a lion's share of the online advertising market, dominating desktop browser-generated revenue. But on mobile, Apple's Safari is the most-used Web browser. That, some argue, means Apple has a good amount to gain from undercutting Google's profit from online ads by introducing ad blockers for mobile.</p><p>For-profit ad blockers, too, complicate the issue. Adblock Plus, which is free to download, works by creating a \"white list\"\u00a0of companies whose ads will not be blocked by the application, charging companies to be on the list as long as their ads pass AdBlock Plus' criteria. The creator of the most popular ad blocker in Apple's App Store pulled his paid blocker from the store, saying he felt wrong profiting from squashing others' content.</p><p>For those in favor of ad blocking, speed and privacy are at stake.</p><p>Many sites with ads are slow to load because the ads are coming from multiple sources. Ad blockers can help speed up a site by blocking the elements that slow down the page from loading. Some people in this camp argue that ad blocking is ethical because the methods publishers use for delivering ads is \"hostile.\"\u00a0Many also argue that online ad tracking has become too invasive.\u00a0</p><p>For instance, some privacy advocates argue that ad tracking can use information collected to create a detailed profile of a person, which can be difficult for consumers to change. Edward Snowden recently weighed in, arguing that if online ads are served over an insecure connection, that can be a way to infect someone's personal device with malware.</p><p>Is there an alternative way?</p><p>Right now, there are few ways to prevent Internet tracking without ad blockers. Vigilant users can try the anonymizing Web browser Tor for an added layer of privacy, as one woman did to hide her pregnancy from targeted advertising. \u00a0</p><p>Many browsers support a feature called \"Do Not Track,\" which, if enabled, requests that any websites visited do not track the user. But not every website will comply with the request. The feature is part of a larger Do Not Track movement by companies and privacy organizations that seek to get websites to honor the requests.</p><p>The EFF\u00a0proposed a compromise for Do Not Track earlier this summer - if publishers adhere to Do Not Track requests and compel the advertisers they use to do so as well, the publishers get verified by the EFF. \u00a0So far, no advertising agencies have taken the EFF up on it.</p><p>The\u00a0Federal Communications Commission recently opted not to establish regulations that would force providers like Google and Mozilla to honor Do Not Track requests.</p><p>As a result, privacy advocates will press state regulators to enforce Do Not Track. According to\u00a0John Simpson of Consumer Watchdog, \"Requiring that Do Not Track requests be honored is a simple way to give people necessary control of their information and is in no way an attempt to regulate the content of the Internet.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CSM-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CSM2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5HFP-0Y11-DYRK-B0KV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7945</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1074\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Christian Science Publishing Society All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Christian Science Monitor</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"11\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>November 24, 2015 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0001T6V</classCode><className>YAHOO!

ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION II. CALIFORNIA III. NORTH DAKOTA IV. OKLAHOMA A. Which approach should Oklahoma follow? CONCLUSION</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">INTRODUCTION</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In many business practices, a common form of protection for the business is implementing a non-compete agreement in the business' employment contracts. Black's Law Dictionary defines non-competes as clauses in an agreement that would deny an employee from conducting a similar business in a specific area for a specific period of time. (1) The common law of England first recognized a non-compete agreement as early as 1414, but did not strictly enforce it. (2) However, a few centuries later, a shift finally seemed to occur; in 1711, Mitchel v. Reynolds arose as a landmark decision where an English court first recognized the possible need for reasonable restraint on trade. (3) The trend continued spiraling toward permitting the use of non-competes and even touched the United States. </p><p>In 1889, the Supreme Court of South Carolina first stated that a non-compete agreement is enforceable and may be appropriate depending on location and circumstances. (4) Since then, many American courts have continued to form and develop the evolution of non-compete agreements in today's society. (5) Currently, a majority of states have shifted over and now permit the use of non-compete agreements. (6) However, the following select states strongly regulate or prohibit them altogether: (1) California; (2) Oklahoma; and (3) North Dakota. (7)</p><p>As evidenced by custom business practices, non-compete agreements are typically included in employment contracts. (8) Non-compete agreements in an employment contract are a means for employers to affirmatively protect trade secrets and to prevent competitors from stealing such trade secrets. (9) Non-compete agreements in employment matters are more recently treated in a restrictive manner as a form of public protection. (10) From the aforementioned restrictive states, California offers, by far, the most restrictive reading of non-compete agreements due to public policy concerns. (11) The Supreme Court of California stated that the inclusion of a non-compete agreement creates a significant public policy harm insofar as:</p><p>Every individual possesses as a form of property, the right to pursue any calling, business, or profession he may choose. A former employee has the right to engage in a competitive business for him-self and to enter into competition with his former employer, even for the business of those who had formerly been the customers of his former employer, provided that such competition is fairly and legally conducted. (12)</p><p>States like California, which adopt a restrictive reading of non-compete agreements, skeptically view a non-compete agreement that prohibits a former employee from working with a similar company within a certain distance from the employer's company. (13)</p><p>This Comment considers a key question: do employers have a strategy to protect themselves if these restrictive states are restricting corporations from protecting their self-developed trade secrets? In doing so, Part II will discuss an approach that may allow employers to potentially circumvent the restrictive states. This can be achieved by requiring an employee to undergo private arbitration in a dispute with an employer--a strategy that has gained validity in light of the United States Supreme Court's holding that upholds arbitration clauses even where significant public policy concerns exist. (14) Specifically, an employer in a restrictive state could potentially enforce an arbitration through a choice of law clause that would provide the employer an opportunity to follow another state's more lenient approach for non-compete agreements.</p><p>Then, this Comment will discuss two competing approaches to this problem of strict prohibition of non-compete agreements and a possible guideline for the third state to follow since no Legislative or Judicial action has addressed this maneuver. Accordingly, in Part III, this Comment will delve into the first approach based on California's non-compete policy. California, pursuant to its Business and Professional Code [section] 16600, states that \"[e]xcept as provided in this chapter, every contract by which anyone is restrained from engaging in a lawful profession, trade, or business of any kind is to that extent void.\" (15) Consequently, any non-compete agreement that restricts an employee to work with a rival business would be void and any employee will be permitted to work for a competitor or even begin a similar practice of his or her own. Previously, employers attempted to be crafty in attempting to evade these restrictions through an arbitration clause in a non-compete agreement; however, legislatures caught on to their sly circumvention. As of December 1, 2017, the legislature enacted a Labor Code that would prevent potential employers from attempting to circumvent these restrictive clauses. (16)</p><p>Next, in Part IV, this Comment will discuss North Dakota's approach to a non-compete agreement. While North Dakota, like California, restricts non-compete agreements, its approach includes two exceptions where non competes are valid. (17) Chapter 9-08 Section 6 of the North Dakota Century Code states that:</p><p>Every contract by which anyone is restrained from exercising a lawful profession, trade, or business of any kind is to that extent void, except:</p><p>1. One who sells the goodwill of a business may agree with the buyer to refrain from carrying on a similar business within a specified county, city, or a part of either, so long as the buyer or any person deriving title to the goodwill from the buyer carries on a like business therein.</p><p>2. Partners, upon or in anticipation of a dissolution of the partnership, may agree that all or any number of them will not carry on a similar business within the same city where the partnership business has been transacted, or within a specified part thereof. (18)</p><p>Of the two exceptions, the first arises when a person sells his or her business. (19) The seller may agree not to start another similar business within the respective area. (20) This agreement is voluntary and understanding, but the agreement is strictly limited to competing within a specific location. (21) The second exception arises when partners dissolve their preexisting partnership. (22) A defecting partner is then no longer permitted to carry on a similar business in the same area. (23) In reading the North Dakota Century Code, it appears that the North Dakota legislature strategically permitted some protection for employers by enforcing the use of non-compete agreements. This Comment will consider whether, given these exceptions, an arbitration clause could potentially assist in circumventing a state's prohibition on non-compete agreements, other than the two exceptions listed in the Code. (24)</p><p>Then, in Part V, this Comment will analyze Oklahoma's restrictive non-compete statute and determine if the legislature, or the courts, have discouraged any attempt to circumvent the restrictions on these clauses. (25) Title 15, Chapter 5 Section 219A of Oklahoma's non-compete statute states that:</p><p>A. A person who makes an agreement with an employer, whether in writing or verbally, not to compete with the employer after the employment relationship has been terminated, shall be permitted to engage in the same business as that conducted by the former employer or in a similar business as that conducted by the former employer as long as the former employee does not directly solicit the sale of goods, services or a combination of goods and services from the established customers of the former employer.</p><p>B. Any provision in a contract between an employer and an employee in conflict with the provisions of this section shall be void and unenforceable. (26)</p><p>Like California, Oklahoma provides no exceptions and claims that any non-compete agreement signed into a contract is unenforceable. (27) The Oklahoma statute states that even if an employee agrees not to engage in the similar business as the employer, once the relationship has been terminated, the employee is permitted to conduct similar business as long as her or she does not directly solicit clients from the employer's business. (28) Although Oklahoma proves to be another strict non-compete state, no case law or legislation exists that deters employers from circumventing these clauses--as opposed to North Dakota and California. Accordingly, this Comment will suggest which approach Oklahoma should take for employers to protect their business and their respective trade secrets.</p><p>Finally, in Part VI, this Comment will conclude by assessing what is the best balance between protecting the rights of workers to seek work freely and for the business owners to properly protect their business.</p><p>I. ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION</p><p>All hope is not lost for employers who are faced with the risk of losing some of their trade secrets because a restrictive state does not permit the use of non-compete agreements. Specifically, this section considers whether an alternative dispute clause is a route an employer may take to attempt to circumvent the law of a state that has imposed significant restrictions on a non-compete agreement. Alternative dispute resolution is the use of methods to resolve disputes outside of litigation. (29) Providing employers and companies with alternatives outside of litigation is beneficial because of the ability to save time, money, and stress; as opposed to the angst of dealing with a courtroom. (30)</p><p>There are numerous methods of alternative dispute resolution; however, the most familiar forms are widely known as negotiation, mediation, and arbitration. (31) Negotiation is the process in which two parties go back and forth, presenting offers with each other until both parties are satisfied. (32) As one can imagine, negotiation is the most common method of alternative dispute resolution that people encounter on a regular basis. (33) On the other hand, mediation is the process where a neutral third-party assists two opposing parties in reaching a mutually acceptable position. (34) Unlike a judge, the neutral third-party does not make a decision as to who is wrong or right but, simply facilitates the conversation until the parties agree on settling the matter. (35) This provides parties an opportunity to shape and form their resolution into whatever they please, as opposed to only a monetary resolution that is never guaranteed. (36) Lastly, there is the process of arbitration. In arbitration, the parties select a third-party as the decision maker, like a judge. (37) This form of alternative dispute resolution is the most similar to litigation and the final decision by the arbitrator can potentially be binding. (38) Most times, depending on the party who is drafting the arbitration clause, these decisions are binding without an opportunity to appeal. (39)</p><p>The procedure of arbitration is the method which employers could use to avoid the prohibition of the application of non-compete agreements. (40) In states where non-compete agreements are prohibited, employers may skirt these restrictions by including an arbitration clause in their employee contract, making arbitration agreements binding. (41) Therefore, an employer could potentially include a choice of law clause that would determine which jurisdiction's law the agreement must follow when considering the dispute between the employer and the employee. (42) This choice of law clause would permit the parties to arbitrate the case under whichever state law they agree upon, including states that permit non-compete agreements. (43)</p><p>For example, if an employer's principle place of business is located in California, in their arbitration clause the employer can include a choice of law provision that would follow Wisconsin's labor laws. Accordingly, if a dispute were to arise, the California employer would be permitted to enforce the non-compete since the law they are following--Wisconsin's labor laws--do permit the use of non-competes, (44) and the arbitration would then follow the applicable Wisconsin rules. However, implementing a choice of law provision connecting it to another state in an attempt to circumvent restrictive forum state laws: the business must have some connection to the state chosen in the choice of law provision. (45) A court can decline to follow the chosen state if the \"forum state's interests would be more seriously impaired by enforcement of [the chosen law] than would the interests of the chosen state by application of the forum state['s law].\" (46)</p><p>Finally, this Comment will dive into the most restrictive states in America and discuss how the approach on non-compete agreements has recently changed. Given that this is a live issue, both Legislatures and the Judiciaries have taken action to prevent any possibility to circumvent the restrictions, for the most part. There is one remaining state that is restrictive however, which has not spoken on the method of circumventing the restriction, as the two other restrictive states have. Accordingly, this Comment will also provide insight as to what the best approach for the remaining state is.</p><p>II. CALIFORNIA</p><p>Turning to the most restrictive state, an employer in California is presented with a very difficult situation. If an employer was to attempt to circumvent these restrictive non-compete requirements, it would be quickly deterred. As of 2017, California legislatures have begun cracking down on employers' attempts to circumvent their restrictions and have implemented a new statute prohibiting any such maneuver. (47) Pursuant to California's Labor Code Section 925, the following restrictions apply:</p><p>(a) An employer shall not require an employee who primarily resides and works in California, as a condition of employment, to agree to a provision that would do either of the following:</p><p>(1) Require the employee to adjudicate outside of California a claim arising in California.</p><p>(2) Deprive the employee of the substantive protection of California law with respect to a controversy arising in California.</p><p>(b) Any provision of a contract that violates subdivision (a) is voidable by the employee, and if a provision is rendered void at the request of the employee, the matter shall be adjudicated in California and California law shall govern the dispute....</p><p>(d) For purposes of this section, adjudication includes litigation and arbitration.</p><p>(e) This section shall not apply to a contract with an employee who is in fact individually represented by legal counsel in negotiating the terms of an agreement to designate either the venue or forum in which a controversy arising from the employment contract may be adjudicated or the choice of law to be applied.</p><p>(f) This section shall apply to a contract entered into, modified, or extended on or after January 1, 2017. (48)</p><p>Working through California's Labor Code Section 925, we first encounter subsection (a) where it is apparent that the legislature intends to protect California employees by prohibiting certain conditions to employment. Under (a)(1), if an employee lives and works in California, they cannot be required to adjudicate outside the state when the case arises in California. Under subsection (a)(2), the legislature prohibits an employer from depriving an employee of California laws. (49) Therefore, using a choice of law clause under an arbitration provision seems to be strictly prohibited given the original restrictive California's Business and Professional Code Section 16600. The legislature went as far as to include that litigation and arbitration fall under this scope of the Code. The choice of law clause would no longer be permitted as of January 2017 and any attempt to maneuver out of the restrictions imposed is effectively terminated. (50)</p><p>However, the legislature seemed to have provided employers one potential exception to permit their non-compete agreements. Under subsection (e), the code may permit a choice of law maneuver if the employees were represented by their own attorney when they were negotiating the terms of their employment agreement. (51) If the employee's attorney negotiate the choice of law provision out of the employment contract, then that employee would be subject to following another state's law and the non-compete agreement may be valid. Therefore, although the California legislature seems to be averse to non-compete clauses and has attempted to eliminate any attempt to circumvent restrictions on non-competes, the legislature seemed to instill a possibility to include a choice of law provision to follow the majority of the states and their less restrictive approach to non-competes.</p><p>III. NORTH DAKOTA</p><p>Another state that is sternly opposed to non-compete agreements and tries to strictly limit them, is North Dakota. This Comment will explore the opportunity to circumvent and attempt to apply a choice of law clause in an arbitration provision. While Chapter 9-08 Section 6 of the North Dakota Century Code clearly states that non-competes will not be permitted, an employer may still have an opportunity to circumvent this restriction through arbitration clauses and choice of law provisions. However, as recent as December 7, 2017, North Dakota's Supreme Court specifically prohibited this approach, too. (52) Although the North Dakota legislature did not enact a statute to forbid this approach, the judicial branch was clear in its intent. (53)</p><p>In Osborne v. Brown &amp; Saenger, Inc., the Supreme Court of North Dakota determined that a choice of law clause and a forum selection clause in an employment contract are not enforceable because of the strong public policy that prohibits the use of non-compete agreements. (54) There, the defendant hired the plaintiff as a representative of its sales office to sell office supplies to other businesses. (55) The defendant company was headquartered in South Dakota, but it \"operate[d] as a foreign business corporation in North Dakota.\" (56) The contract the plaintiff signed included two clauses that included non-compete agreements and a choice of law clause. (57) The non-compete agreement prohibited the employee from engaging in business with a competitor, or soliciting customers during their employment and for two years after within a 100-mile radius. (58) Additionally, the choice of law clause provided that South Dakota laws would govern the employment even though the defendant business was located in North Dakota. (59)</p><p>In January 2017, the defendant terminated the plaintiff's employment. (60) After being terminated, the plaintiff sued, claiming \"retaliation, improper deductions, and breach of contract ... [and the plaintiff] also sought a declaratory judgment declaring the non-compete agreement to be void.\" (61) The lower court granted a motion to dismiss in favor of the defendant company. On appeal, the court noted that the motion to dismiss was an error because \"the forum-selection clause in her employment agreement is unenforceable under North Dakota law and selection of a foreign forum would be unreasonable.\" (62) Eventually, the court sided with the plaintiff and agreed that \"one may not contract for application of another state's law or forum if the natural result is to allow enforcement of a non-compete agreement in violation of ... longstanding and strong public policy against non-compete agreements.\" (63) The court alluded to a few cases that agree with its conclusion and acknowledge that South Dakota permits non-competes which proves to be unfair to a party who contracted in state that has a strong public policy against such agreements. (64) Therefore, the court concluded that allowing this choice of law clause to be permitted would be detrimental and unfair to the plaintiff. (65)</p><p>Although this is a fairly recent case and there have been no other statutes enacted to restrict this sort of maneuver, trying to circumvent the restrictions on non-compete agreements is now likely to fail in the state of North Dakota. The court seems to leave some openness and vagueness with what can and cannot be done with a choice of law clause and leaves some questions: Are choice of law provisions never permitted in North Dakota? Or are they permitted unless they violate public policy? If, like California, an employee had his or her own attorney do the negotiations, there may be no reason why it should be forbidden to include a choice of law provision. However, the court failed to address this issue and left numerous unanswered questions.</p><p>IV. OKLAHOMA</p><p>Finally, the last state that has a very restrictive approach when considering permissibility of non-compete agreements is Oklahoma. (66) Unlike California and North Dakota, Oklahoma has not yet enacted a statute that nor has the state supreme court prohibited a maneuver in which applying an alternative dispute resolution approach with a choice of law provision will circumvent these restrictions. Oklahoma provides the greatest opportunity to try and evade their restrictive non-competes by using this technique of including a choice of law provision in an arbitration clause. However, when considering precedent, it can be inferred that such a maneuver may be looked down upon. (67)</p><p>In Sw. Stainless, L.P. v. Sappington, the defendants sold their interests in a corporation. (68) As a condition to this sale, the defendants agreed to execute and deliver certain agreements including future employment agreements and future noncompetition agreements. (69) The non-compete provisions stated:</p><p>During the ... Noncompetition Period ... the [former owner] specifically agrees that [he] shall not ... either directly or indirectly ... engage in any business within the States of Missouri, Texas, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Louisiana, Alabama and Florida ... which competes in any manner with any business conducted by [Southwest] or [HD Supply] immediately prior to the Closing or during the term of [the former owner]'s employment with [Southwest].... [T]he term \"Noncompetition Period\" shall mean the later of three (3) years after the Closing Date, or one (1) year after the [former owner] no longer receives any compensation from [Southwest], or any affiliate of [Southwest]. (70)</p><p>Southwest Stainless and HD Supply alleged that the defendants breached both the employment agreement and the noncompetition agreement by interfering with their business relations. (71) The court began its analysis by considering the parties' choice of law clause. (72) Although this was executed in Oklahoma, the parties still disagreed about whether Florida or Oklahoma law would govern. (73) The court here followed the Tenth Circuit approach where \"federal courts must look to the forum state's choice-of-law rules to determine the effect of a contractual choice-of-law clause.\" (74) The agreement between the parties stated that Florida law would govern; however, the court needed to first see if Oklahoma law would permit the parties' attempt to follow Florida law. (75)</p><p>Under Oklahoma law, the contract would typically follow the state where the contract was entered into, with an exception if the parties agreed to follow the law of another state and as long as it is not against the law or against public policy. (76) When determining what public policy actually means, the Oklahoma courts have defined it as \"synonymous with the policy of the law, expressed by the manifest will of the state which may be found in the constitution, the statutory provisions, and judicial records.\" (77) Since the parties agreed to follow Florida law, the court had to first determine whether the application of Florida law would violate the public policy of Oklahoma. (78) After analyzing Florida law, the court concluded that the non-compete agreement did not conflict with Florida law since the duration was proper, there was proper interest in need of protection, and the location restricted is necessary for protecting their business interest. (79) However, when reviewing Oklahoma law, the court refused to follow Florida law because the choice of law clause violated Oklahoma law with contracts that would restrain people from trade. (80) According to Oklahoma law: \"[N]on-compete agreements may not restrict competition beyond 'a specified county and any county or counties contiguous thereto, or a specified city or town or any part thereof.'\" (81) Because Oklahoma makes businesses restrict competition in a more specific area, whereas Florida allows businesses to have a larger span of territory to not compete, Florida law is violating the public policy by restricting competition in seven states. (82) The problem with the non-compete agreements in the case was that they were restricting competition in seven states, but the duration was valid. (83) Eventually, the court concluded that Oklahoma law would apply and the non-compete agreement would be enforceable with the modification of the geographic restriction being limited to \"those counties surrounding Tulsa county.\" (84)</p><p>In Sappington, it was clearly illustrated that Oklahoma, though containing some restrictive language regarding non-competes, have been shown to have some leniency. Additionally, it was observed that even a choice of law clause could have been permitted pursuant to the lack of geographical limitation. It seems likely that this attempt to circumvent the restrictive non-compete agreements could be permitted in Oklahoma if the case law is closely followed. Although public policy is clearly in the precedent, if an employer was certain that no public policy violations would occur and that the geographical restriction would not be overly oppressive, an employer may likely be able to circumvent the non-compete prohibition.</p><p>A. Which approach should Oklahoma follow?</p><p>In an attempt to balance whether it is more important to protect a business' interest with respect to its trade secrets or whether the public interest at large is more important, Oklahoma has an opportunity to determine its future outlook on this issue. Looking at the legislative history, the legislature seems to be slowly veering in the favor of the employers. (85) In the twelve years between the initial enacting of Oklahoma Statute Annotated title 15 section 219 to the amendment in 2013, it seems as though the legislature has slowly begun to recognize the need to protect employers' interests. However, acknowledging the power that a lot of corporations hold, this Comment is of the belief that by permitting employers this potential loophole, citizens will be subject to disadvantages when it comes to making their own future employment decisions.</p><p>In the most recent case discussing the use of non-compete agreements, the Court of Civil Appeals of Oklahoma reversed a ruling because the non-compete agreement violated Oklahoma's law and public policy. (86) This case established that those in Oklahoma with non-compete agreements that violate Oklahoma law can void the agreement. (87) Additionally, Autry spoke on the availability for employers' ability to restrict employees to try and solicit former coworkers, if drafted appropriately. (88) Finally, the decision in this case will likely permit employees to argue that following another state's law will violate public policy. (89)</p><p>Following Autry, it seems that although the legislature has leaned towards protecting employers, the judicial branch seems to be leaning in the direction of North Dakota. Once the State Supreme Court speaks on this matter firsthand, it seems that such circumvention will be challenged, and the courts will agree that this is a violation of public policy. For those applying non-compete agreements in their business, this may be the best, and final time, to enforce the protection against competition. Given the few restrictive states speaking on this matter within the past two years, it is likely that the Oklahoma courts are likely to over-turn this circumvention, preventing such a maneuver and following both California and North Dakota's recent changes.</p><p>CONCLUSION</p><p>In summation, California, North Dakota, and Oklahoma still remain the most restrictive states in this country. Although other states may follow, for now, most states permit non-compete agreements more-so than the aforementioned states. One must ask if this is a good or bad thing. However, the answer truly depends on what perspective one is taking. When considering why these states are so reluctant to allow non-competes, the public interest is a compelling explanation. However, should that outweigh the protection of business and employers and their respective trade secrets? Employers have trade secrets that make their business unique and helps make the business an accomplishment. Should that be taken lightly because some employees would have some partial restrictions? The legislatures and the courts in California, North Dakota, and Oklahoma seem to think that public policy still should outweigh these interests; backing the David verse Goliath metaphor in favor of the little guy. However, what damage could the prohibition of non-competes do to the public in the long run? This could potentially have a domino-effect especially in a big tech-industry state like California. A shift in industries could occur and drive business out of the state to ensure proper protection against competition. California may be on to something by providing an opportunity for employers to implement a non-compete clause but only enforcing it if the employee had representation. This not only protects the public interest at large, but also protects businesses and their trade secrets. By encouraging employees to retain counsel in the midst of negotiations, both parties are likely to be content with the outcome. These are the types of considerations courts and legislatures should take into account before prohibiting non-compete agreements.</p><p>(1.)

View original post here[2]. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has found himself with few friends in Silicon Valley in the wake of the massive data harvesting scandal. Tim Cook and Elon Musk are perhaps the highest profile tech leaders to criticize Facebook for playing fast and loose with user data - along with Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff and Whatspp founder Brian Acton, whose company Facebook bought for $22 billion. Other tech leaders have remained quiet as the scandal has unfolded - which asBloomberg      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-02/facebook-data-scandal-has-left-zuckerberg-isolated-in-big-technotes\">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-02/facebook-data-scandal-has-left-zuckerberg-isolated-in-big-technotes</url>, is unusual forSilicon Valley execs who traditionally circle the wagon when a peer is having a crisis.Facebook has sought to repair its public image and trust with more than 2 billion users after reports surfaced that Cambridge Analytica obtained data on as many 50 million of those U.S. accounts. </p><p>As Zuckerberg, 33, faces calls to testify before Congress and lawmakers raise the idea of new regulations on tech, his peers have either stayed quiet or publicly criticized his company. In times of crisis, tech companies have sometimes huddled together to defend the industry, such as when Apple fought the FBI to protect an encrypted iPhone and during President Donald Trump's proposed immigration ban last year against mostly Muslim countries.When James Comey's FBI came banging on Apple's door asking them to decrypt an iPhone linked to the 2015 San Bernardino attack in which married couple Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik shot up a San Bernardino County Christmas party, killing 14 and injuring 22 -Facebook, Google, Microsoft and other big tech firms rallied around Tim Cook after the Apple CEO refused to comply. The FBI was eventually able to unlock Farook's phone after a 'mysterious third party[3]' showed them how to bypass Apple security protocols. 'Protecting privacy is good for business now,' said Gennie Gebhart, a researcher at the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), a digital privacy rights group. 'Users are looking for other big tech personalities like Tim Cook, like Elon Musk, to be reassured that they're not doing what Facebook did.'Cook was asked about Facebook's privacy crisis last month and called for stronger regulation of user data. Then, in an interview with Recode and MSNBC, Cook said he 'wouldn't be in this situation' if he were in Zuckerberg's shoes. While Facebook makes money selling targeted advertisements based on user data, Apple's profit comes from hardware products like the iPhone, iPad, and Mac.Zuckerberg slapped back at Cook, telling Vox[4]'I find that argument \u2014 that if you're not paying, that somehow we can't care about you \u2014 to be extremely glib and not at all aligned with the truth.' 'There are a lot of people who can't afford to pay'for a service, while having an 'advertising-supported model is the only rational model that can support building this service to reach people,' Zuckerberg said. 'If you want to build a service which is not just serving rich people, then you need to have something that people can afford.' No word if Cook has recovered from Zuck's epic burn, though 'rich people' have propelled Apple torevenues of nearly $230 billion in 2017 vs. Facebook's $40 billion generated almost entirelyfrom advertising[5]- and as we have come to learn, letting app developers have their way with our personal data and helping candidates they favor[6]. Meanwhile, Zuck's been Sabo'd While Facebook stock has been kneecapped to the tune of around 16% since the Cambridge Analytica story broke - and down 20% since February all-time highs,Mark Zuckerberg has been given 'the treatment' by notorious conservative street artist, Sabo. Banners reading 'You can't watch your kids 24/7, but we can' were put up in Times Square and several other public locations on Monday night - along with fake street signs warning 'Caution, Facebook sells your data.' Several of the signs feature a grotesque graphic of Zuckerberg's face melting into Chuck Schumer's (D-NY)- along with other mentions of the Senate Minority Leaderwhose daughter works for Facebook.

They'll be expected to monitor phenomena such as the fast-growing footprint of companies such as Amazon.com\u00a0and the security practices of the entire tech industry.</p><p>Already they face their first high-profile test - an investigation into Facebook's recent privacy mishaps. In March, the FTC announced\u00a0it would scrutinize Facebook's entanglement with Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy that improperly accessed names, \"likes\" and other personal information about up to 87 million of the social site's users. If the FTC finds that Facebook erred, it could result in massive fines - penalties that some experts say the agency must levy to send an early message that it is able and willing to police the country's tech behemoths.</p><p>\"Will the new FTC have the will to take on today's challenges aggressively?\" asked Jessica Rich, the former director of the agency's Bureau of Consumer Protection. \"The FTC really is under-resourced. So if it steps up and takes on the challenges, it still will have a limited amount of resources to do that.\"</p><p>The FTC's purview is vast. It reviews hospital mergers, responds to consumer reports about robo-calls and ensures that products labeled as \"Made in the USA\" are manufactured here. That stems from its more-than-century-old mandate to promote competition and penalize those who engage in unfair or deceptive practices.</p><p>In recent years, though, the FTC has evolved into the U.S. government's primary regulator of the tech industry. While the country may lack a single, federal online privacy law, the agency still has managed to tap its powers to punish tech giants such as Facebook, Google, Twitter and Uber for failing to protect the sensitive information they amass about their users.</p><p>Despite an expanding workload, the FTC's authorities and resources haven't changed much. Its budget this fiscal year is $306 million -- or about a third of 1 percent of the revenue that Google earned in 2017. With those limited funds the agency maintains a workforce of about 1,140 -- roughly 300 fewer workers than it had almost four decades earlier, according to FTC records, well before it had to police the Internet.</p><p>\"One of the issues is the ability to hire technologists,\"\u00a0said Rich, who is now the vice president of consumer policy and mobilization at Consumer Reports. \"The FTC simply can't pay what many technologists make in not-even-the-top echelons of companies.\"</p><p>During an interview before she departed, McSweeny praised the agency for its track record, saying it has\u00a0achieved a \"terrific return on taxpayer investment.\" That includes major settlements with companies such as\u00a0Volkswagen for allegedly defrauding drivers.</p><p>Still,\u00a0Rich said the FTC faces major structural challenges -- issues that she and her predecessors long have highlighted without much success. The FTC is generally hamstrung in its ability to write new rules, for example, and it isn't always able to fine tech companies\u00a0for their first privacy or security offenses.</p><p>\"It would be helpful to have Congress clarify the FTC's authority around privacy and data security,\" she said. \"It would be helpful to have civil penalty authority. I think it would be helpful for the agency to have regulatory authority.\"</p><p>Those strictures now fall to Simons, who officially assumed the title of FTC chairman Tuesday after serving as an antitrust litigator at the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison for clients such as Microsoft and Sony. It's not his first tour of duty in the federal government: Simons worked at the agency as director of the Bureau of Competition from 2001 to 2003. His office declined to make him available for an interview.</p><p>He'll be aided by two fellow Republicans: Noah Phillips, who is a former top aide to Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.), and Christine Wilson, who was a top executive at Delta Air Lines. Opposite them will be two new Democratic commissioners: Rohit Chopra, a former regulator at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and Rebecca Slaughter, previously a top adviser to Senate\u00a0Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.). All but Wilson had been sworn in by this week.</p><p>To start, the agency is under pressure to penalize not only Facebook but also other tech companies that mishandle consumers' data.</p><p>\"The FTC largely failed during the Obama years to address the most pressing challenges,\" said Marc Rotenberg, the executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, which brought the complaint that led to the FTC's settlement with Facebook in 2011. \"The evidence of that is made clear every day.\"</p><p>Others would like to see the FTC under its new leaders take a closer look at companies such as Amazon, Facebook and Google for potential antitrust concerns. Regulators around the world increasingly are fearful that big tech is too big -- especially in Europe, which is still probing Google's business practices. In the United States, the FTC hasn't brought such a major case since its own probe of Google - an investigation it closed in 2013 by leaving the company intact.</p><p>\"We're in an era in which we have massive consolidation happening throughout virtually every sector of the economy, and we've had over the last two decades the rise of the tech industry,\" said Ganesh Sitaraman, co-founder of the nonprofit Great Democracy Initiative, a new policy\u00a0group founded by two former aides to Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). \"And in large part the FTC has not been doing its job sufficiently to enforce our antitrust laws.\" The organization published research this week that calls for regulating the algorithms that power platforms such as Facebook's News Feed to ensure they aren't used in ways that may harm rival services.</p><p>In perhaps a sign of his approach, Simons\u00a0told Congress earlier this year that the U.S. government may have been \"too permissive in dealing with mergers and acquisitions.\" He said the FTC needed to \"devote substantial resources to determining whether its merger enforcement has been too lax.\"</p><p>Yet the evolving nature of digital challenges could make it hard for the FTC to keep up. McSweeny pointed recently to the rise of online \"disinformation\" and \"deepfakes\" -- videos, in some cases, where politicians are edited to say things they never uttered. Both now register on the radar of\u00a0an agency that is supposed to focus on deception.</p><p>\"I think this is a very important moment,\" McSweeny said. \"People not just in America but around the world are engaging in a real moment of consideration around how these technologies work.\"</p><p>                       Correction: McSweeny served four years as FTC commissioner. An earlier version of this report mistakenly said\u00a0she had served three years.       </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-d5598a0aacd14540a1451e84d311e8ff</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S7X-1WY1-JB4M-V1MB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1252\"/><timeReceived>3:46 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"05\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>May 4, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

On Monday, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-s-secret-project-nightingale-gathers-personal-health-data-on-millions-of-americans-11573496790\"> Wall Street Journal reported on</url>\u00a0a Google secret project to collect and analyse millions of Americans\u2019 personal health data through a deal with Ascension, the second-largest hospital system in the US.</p><p>Today, Apple has intensified the competition\u00a0to collect healthcare data from users, launching a new research app that it claims will \u201cadvance science\u201d by harvesting information from its massive base of iPhone users and Apple Watch wearers. It hopes people will opt in to its new \u201cResearch App\u201d and participate in an array of medical studies that rely on its electrocardiogram sensor, decibel meter and menstrual cycle-tracking functions.\u00a0 Those studies \u00a0could, in turn, generate outcomes that Apple would then use to build new products.</p><p>Clearly\u00a0consent and anonymity should be\u00a0key requirements before anyone parts with sensitive personal health information to help companies understand medical conditions and develop treatments and services for the greater good. At least Apple seems to be going about it the right way.<br/></p><p>Advertising is another contentious area of cookies and consent and Google today\u00a0announced a major change to its online advertising business that it said would enhance user privacy but which advertisers warned would give the search giant even more power. From next February, Google will no longer allow advertisers to see key information known as \u201ccontextual content\u201d about web pages when they bid for display adverts. The change would stop advertisers from tying sensitive categories such as health, religion, politics and sexual orientation to any individual user.</p><p>Europe has\u00a0not been impressed by the data protection standards of the US and its companies. The latest Trade Secrets newsletter looks at the motives behind German chancellor Angela Merkel's speech this week on \u201cdigital sovereignty\u201d for the EU \u2014 the idea of keeping Europeans' data out of the cloud systems of American giants Google, Amazon and Microsoft. The FT View is that rather than building a European cloud network as envisaged by\u00a0the Gaia-X project, the bloc could simply promote the development of new privacy-focused technologies and services, and use regulation to encourage their adoption by private providers.</p><p>The Internet of (Five) Things</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1.

Writing was on the slides for WeWork\u00a0</emphasis>WeWork revealed its\u00a0 losses more than doubled \u00a0to $1.3bn in the third quarter in a slide deck for creditors seen by the FT, which helps explain the group\u2019s cash crunch after its listing collapsed in September. The chief executive of WeWork\u2019s India franchise is seeking to\u00a0 raise $200m, claiming the business is \u201cisolated\u201d from the IPO debacle.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">4. The streaming mouse that roared</emphasis><br/>Walt Disney said on Wednesday that more than 10m people signed up to its new video streaming service, only a day after its launch, wowing investors and sending its shares sharply higher. The media company did not specify how many of the 10m were signing up to free trials for its Disney+ service, but the number was higher than Wall Street analysts had expected. By comparison, it took more than two years for Netflix to reach 10m subscribers.<br/></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">5.

Many of the owners of these fast-selling internet-connected gadgets, with 78 million bought worldwide last year, have wondered.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Last week, we discovered the answer - quite possibly. And not by any accident. Because Alexa's owner, the giant retailer and tech firm Amazon, has thousands of staff who do nothing else.</p><p>Thanks to a Bloomberg news story, we now know \"a mix of contractors and full-time Amazon employees who work in outposts from Boston to Costa Rica, India and Romania\" each work through as many as 1000 voice recordings taken from homes and offices every day.</p><p>Most are banal. People ask Alexa for recipes, jokes, trivia, and \"she\" will reply. Or they ask Alexa to do things, like play music or operate connected devices to perform functions like turning off the lights, locking the door, adjusting the air conditioning and so on.</p><p>And Alexa only activates when you call \"her\" name, or speak some other designated trigger word. So an Echo device would never record anything you didn't address to it directly, right? Not so. Those listening for Amazon transcribe about 100 conversations a day where the Echo recorder switched itself on by mistake or for some other unknown reason, reported Bloomberg.</p><p>And sometimes it picks up conversations that are anything but banal. Two of the staff said they heard what they believed to be a sexual assault in progress for instance. Amazon's policy in such cases is to not interfere.</p><p>Amazon says it needs all this monitoring to help improve its service. In a job ad it posted, seeking a quality assurance manager: \"This is big data handling like you've never seen it. We're creating, labelling, curating and analysing vast quantities of speech on a daily basis.\"</p><p>Of course, the human intercepts are in addition to the computerised monitoring and data extraction applied to all of these conversations.</p><p>And it's not just Amazon. Other virtual assistants, Google's Assistant speaking through its Home devices and Apple's Siri delivered through HomePod, also have staff listening in to their customers. Those firms also say that they carefully guard the privacy of customers. Trust us.</p><p>But make no mistake. The primary reason these digital assistants exist is not to assist you. They exist to make money for Amazon, Google and Apple. The big Japanese investment bank Mizuho predicts that these digital assistants will generate $US11 billion a year by next year.</p><p>And they are, in turn, just part of the enormous industry of extracting customers' personal data, the most valuable commodity in the world today.</p><p>\"Human experience,\" writes Shoshana Zuboff in her new book The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, is the \"free raw material for hidden commercial practices of extraction, prediction and sales\". It's free for the tech, advertising and other industries because, in our naivete, we feed it to them that way - for free and freely.</p><p>Already, the extraction of personal data from Americans alone is yielding $US76 billion annually, up by 45 per cent over two years, according to a new study by the strategy group Future Majority. In three years it will yield more revenue than the entire US farm sector, on the current trend.</p><p>The world's most valuable companies, based on market capitalisation at the end of March, were Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Google's owner, Alphabet. Further down the top 10 were Facebook and China's biggest two web-based businesses, Tencent and Alibaba. And oil? Only one oil company made it into the 10 - Exxon Mobil came in at last place.</p><p>As we know from the bitter evidence of one outrage after another, these tech firms cannot be trusted to control themselves. Even when they try.</p><p>In the past few months Google has abandoned two efforts to set guidelines for itself on how to exploit artificial intelligence responsibly. The Wall Street Journal reports that they collapsed in disagreement.</p><p>But how do companies like Apple and Google and Amazon make money from the harmless speakers that sit on your living room table and answer your questions like helpful assistants? Every clue you give your device is seized and processed by corporate HQ and while some is used to refine the service on offer, \"the rest are declared as proprietary 'behavioural surplus',\" writes Zuboff, of the Harvard Business School. This is \"fed into machine intelligence and fabricated into prediction products that anticipate what you will do now, soon and later. Finally, these prediction products are are traded in a new kind of marketplace for behavioural predictions.\"</p><p>The aim is no longer merely to suck out data about us, says Zuboff, but to \"shape our behaviour at scale\" towards, naturally, \"profitable outcomes\". Many companies and groups are active buyers in this market. And we will never know exactly who is buying what in this marketplace, or how it will be used to shape our behaviour.</p><p>Unless, of course, government and regulators decide to take an active interest. On the current outlook, any such move will not be led by Australia, a country still trying to figure out an electric power policy and how to hook up a national broadband.</p><p>Unfortunately, here in the land</p><p>of the Luddites, we are still struggling with the problems of the last century while Big Tech invisibly decides how we will live in the next. Alexa might know the answer, but \"she's\" not telling.</p><p>Peter Hartcher is international editor.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-doc74xibvyplmqvcg3v54x</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VWN-29R1-F0J6-J55Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"926\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sydney Morning Herald (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

Large numbers of people see these organisations as far too powerful, lacking accountability and insufficiently regulated. There is plenty of justification for such opinions, too.</p><p>For instance, Russian-backed \"fake news\" has been read by an estimated 126 million people. The world is still reeling from the effects of Facebook's mechanisms allowing the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica to harvest user data without consent. Meanwhile, the ride-hailing app Uber has battled legal action by drivers who say they are entitled to employee benefits, despite the company's insistence that they are independent contractors.</p><p>After a spate of deadly attacks, motivated by racism and religious prejudice, it has become increasingly clear that the internet has become, as the New York Times put it, \"a theatre for unspeakable acts \u2014 and an amplification system for an ideology of white supremacy that only recently was relegated to the shadows\".</p><p>In a broader sense, automation, artificial intelligence and blockchain have become associated with an impending digital shift that many people believe will cost them their jobs, push down wages and force them into lives of poverty.</p><p>In light of all this, it is hardly surprising that we are becoming more suspicious of various aspects of our increasingly digital lives. Now, instead of waiting with breathless excitement for the latest iPhone launch, we are worrying about the privacy implications of its latest software updates.</p><p>Now, instead of waiting with breathless excitement for the latest iPhone, we are worrying about the privacy implications of its software updates</p><p>It is also possible that we are reaching the limits of our understanding of what technology can do for us. The past decade or so has been a period of colossal social, cultural and economic change. Maybe we just need a little while to work out how to best manage the innovations we have already made, before rushing headlong into the next great disruption. As many people now feel threatened by technology they believe to have run out of control, that could take a while.</p><p>Still, it is worth remembering that we have had a good run. For a while, it seemed as if technology would always be for us, not against us. There was good reason for that optimism, too. From the early days of the internet to the introduction of the smartphone and the still-rocketing speed of connectivity, technology has provided an incredible level of social and economic liberation for many people across the globe.</p><p>Now that the backlash is in full effect, Silicon Valley is listening. Facebook, for example, is working hard to be more transparent about how it manages content, and Uber has shown a more compromising side since the replacement of Travis Kalanick as its CEO.</p><p>They are also dealing with questions that are arguably bigger and more complex than businesses have ever faced before. After all, if Facebook were a country, its 2.3 billion \"citizens\" would make it the largest in the world. Brent C Harris, its director for global affairs and governance told me in Dubai recently: \"We are a company that wrestles with and talks about the deep societal questions and thinks about the ethical issues, the philosophical questions.\"</p><p>There will be no one-size-fits-all solution to those problems, either. China's approach to technology, for instance, is vastly different to that of many other places in the world. This means that an enormous part of the world's population is having an experience that is significantly different even to that of their nearest national neighbours.</p><p>In the Middle East, the effect of technology is \u2013 fortunately \u2013 still overwhelmingly positive. For example, the introduction of ride-hailing services to Baghdad, by the Dubai-based company Careem, has had a significant impact. The service has given people a new way to earn money, and more freedom to move around safely, affordably and efficiently \u2013 these latter benefits have proved especially relevant to women living in the city.</p><p>In an interesting reversal of the usual form, emerging economies may also offer a chance for tech companies to put into practice the lessons they have learned from earlier mistakes made in developed nations. They have a customer base that is far from naive \u2013 after all, people everywhere have access information from the rest of the world \u2013 but that is still eager for and open to the many benefits that technology can bring.</p><p>Mustafa Alrawi is an assistant editor-in-chief at The National</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NATION-144071739</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NATION2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W2S-3SP1-JDJN-62DK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">381176</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"867\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Abu Dhabi Media Company Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.

(NasdaqGS:BIDU[11]) beat both Microsoft (NasdaqGS:MSFT[12]) and Google (NasdaqGS:GOOG[13]) in \"an ongoing natural language processing competition\". Baidu's model is called ERNIE, which stands for \"Enhanced Representation through kNowledge IntEgration\". An excerpt from the article reads: As the Baidu algorithm started to understand meaningful words instead of individual characters, it performed better in both English and Chinese. The company has since adopted ERNIE for real-world applications by using the AI model to deliver better search results.Global AI Hardware Market to Reach $87.68 Billion by 2026A report from Verified Market Research[14] finds that the global AI Hardware market will grow from $7.1 billion in 2018 to $87.68 billion by 2026 with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37.6 percent in the forecast period. An excerpt from the article outlines the market and its key drivers: AI Hardware stems from the need for making perfect hardware in order to accelerate artificial intelligence applications. There are three main parts of hardware infrastructure: compute, storage and networking. In the last few years, the computer has made the most significant progress. The other two areas, storage, and networking are not as advanced have yet to see major innovations regarding AI applications. The growth in big data and advancement in computing is expected to drive the market. The advances that occur in the field of computing tend to focus on software. These advances include applications and programs that can perform various tasks that facilitate humans. One of the major advancements in computing deals with the ability to store as well as analyze big data. The hardware of computing, therefore, has undergone big changes in order to support innovation.

It's true that Taylor and his team at Ofqual faced a tough task being forced to rapidly craft an effective exam-marking system during the pandemic, after the cancellation of tests.</p><p>But given the huge importance of these results to the future prospects of millions of young people, how rigorous was the effort to ensure the system was fair? What sort of external oversight existed to monitor the process? And above all, who was regulating the algorithms that were being applied?</p><p>Perhaps this is the time to ask whether, instead of trying to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/08/16/top-figures-ofqual-want-government-u-turn-award-students-predicted/\">regulate the big tech companies</url>, it may be more useful to regulate the algorithms being applied to decision-making? In other words-and for want of a better phrase-do we need an \"algorithm czar\" to help prevent this kind of thing happening again?</p><p>The person or agency would be responsible for ensuring algorithms were fair and free of bias, laying down ground-rules and empowered to approve or reject poorly-designed schemes before they were used.</p><p>After all, this is a highly specialist field of knowledge. Within the government, only limited expertise exists, often forcing civil servants to rely on third party providers who may have little vested interest in the consequences of their work. </p><p>It's no secret that there is a chronic shortage of skilled professionals in AI. Tencent, the Chinese technology giant, says there are only 300,000 skilled AI engineers globally where millions are needed.</p><p>That means salaries for skilled workers have surged in recent years, often placing them outside the pool of people government departments can realistically seek to recruit. </p><p>Taylor really should have known better than to preside over this fiasco.</p><p>As well as being the chair of Ofqual, he is also the chairman of the Centre for Ethics and Data Innovation, an independent advisory body to the UK government addressing the benefits and risks of AI.</p><p>If any organisation was qualified to kick the tyres of Ofqual's algorithms, this was it. Yet so far, perhaps unsurprisingly, the CDEI has been silent on the exam shambles.</p><p>In fact, Taylor himself was strangely prescient about the kind of threat posed by algorithmic decisions of this kind.</p><p>In a CDEI report last year he wrote: \"Artificial intelligence and algorithmic systems can now operate vehicles, decide on loan applications and screen candidates for jobs. The technology has the potential to improve lives and benefit society, but it also brings ethical challenges which need to be carefully navigated if we are to make full use of it.'</p><p>Quite so.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-65268872</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60M4-PFX1-JCJY-G2R1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"819\"/><timeReceived>2:08 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 17, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper; Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000006</classCode><className>ACADEMIC TESTING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000654</classCode><className>ETHICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009FJK</classCode><className>NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000CTIZ</classCode><className>SCANDALS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009JZD</classCode><className>GRADES &amp; GRADING</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RjI4QjlDNzM3NzBCNDJGRDhBQTUwQkIxQUEyMTVCOTI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTRGMkI4ODIzRjgxNEE2RkE2OEE5MTU0MDdFM0Y5RjI</classCode><className>Academic Grading</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009JYE</classCode><className>DISCRIMINATION IN EDUCATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST0009HPZ</classCode><className>STUDENTS &amp; STUDENT LIFE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX000290</classCode><className>CHILDREN</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000DP5E</classCode><className>ECONOMIC DISCRIMINATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>N722211SS</classCode><className>FAST FOOD RESTAURANTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>ST0009ESX</classCode><className>INSURANCE PREMIUMS</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkE5N0U0RkQwM0VENDRCRjkzN0M3RjA1Qjg4OEJERDA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDQ0MzAyMTAyNjY5NDRENEFDMzkyRjFDRUE4ODVGQjg</classCode><className>Premiums</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>GC329</classCode><className>UNITED KINGDOM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

The sudden transition to working and studying from home presented many challenges to employers, employees, teachers, and students, as all in-person meetings and classes were abruptly replaced by online video conferencing. People have had to adjust to the new reality in which all decision making and communication are conducted on a purely virtual basis. Usually, change is hard to bring about, and its introduction is frequently met with resistance. But a pandemic forced us to quickly adapt to many drastic changes out of necessity.</p><p>The need to change quickly and deeply is often brought up in the context of technology, where the words \"change\" and \"disruption\" have become synonymous with innovation and progress. Many managers lament that their workers are falling behind in digital skills and technical know-how. To generate more profit, technology startup entrepreneurs present a vision in which their products alter people's behavior. Many nonprofit organizations and institutions, including libraries, museums, schools, and universities, have been reciting the mantra of change and disruption for some time.</p><p>Technology seems to have become the reason itself for change. If technology means innovation and progress, wouldn't it be only appropriate to ask people to change to make technology work? Shouldn't we all \"move fast and break things,\" as the old motto of Facebook says? Shouldn't we embrace charismatic technologies?</p><p>CHARISMATIC TECHNOLOGIES</p><p>In 2005, Nicholas Negroponte, one of the co-founders of the MIT Media Lab, started a nonprofit project called One Laptop per Child (OLPC; one.laptop.org). The goal was to distribute a large number of low-cost laptops to children in the developing world. It drew a lot of attention in the tech industry and received highly positive media coverage. The OLPC project eventually succeeded in creating a laptop that costs approximately $200 and raised enough money to produce more titan 3 million laptops (xogiving.org). Those laptops were sold to governments to be given to children overseas, mostly in Latin America.</p><p>The appeal of the OLPC project in its beginning stage provides an excellent example of the allure of technology as a means to achieve innovation and progress. Negroponte and other founders of the OLPC project believed that giving children laptops would transform their entire learning experience. They argued that with XO laptops, children would start to explore the world of programming on their own, learn to code, and even fix their own laptops. The OLPC founders assumed that the biggest barrier to world-class education for children in the developing world was simply the lack of technology. To them, this revolutionary change in education, and more broadly in society, would take place effortlessly, naturally, and even inevitably as soon as the laptops were handed out.</p><p>However, the OLPC project went through multiple setbacks (Jeffrey R. Young, \"What Happened to the '$100 Laptop?'\" EdSurge, Nov. 5, 2019; edsurge.com/news/2019-ll-05-what-happened-to-the-100-laptop). The OLPC's XO laptops weren't durable enough and broke easily. Teachers struggled to incorporate them into classroom instruction due to the lack of time for preparation and support. Often, there weren't enough power outlets or internet connectivity for the laptops to function. Most importantly, the laptops did not transform children into self-motivated learners and competent coders. Some children were not interested in using their laptops at all. Others used them only to a limited extent. Very few learned to code.</p><p>The OLPC project ultimately failed at delivering its Utopian vision of transforming children's learning with laptops alone. How the promises and failures of the OLPC project played out in the real world is described in detail by Morgan G. Ames (The Charisma Machine: The Life, Death, and Legacy of One Laptop per Child, The MIT Press, 2019). In her book, Ames shows how the OLPC project in Paraguay, where 10,000 XO laptops were introduced to children through the local nonprofit organization Paraguay Educa, proceeded with many challenges along the way--ranging from drained laptop batteries to language barriers.</p><p>Particularly interesting is the high-profile visit of Walter Bender, one of the founders of OLPC and its former VP of content. Ames notes with surprise that during the visit, Bender showed little interest in looking into the true state of the OLPC project; furthermore, Paraguay Educa also painted the project as a great success in spite of the project's mediocre results, while obscuring and minimizing the ongoing work at the same time.</p><p>In Ames' view, the visit \"performed\" the success of the project, which it failed to achieve in reality. She points out that the enactment of success reinforces the project's vision and strengthens participants' commitment to a collective ideological framework that makes social transformation seem easy in order to mobilize support. However, those performances run the risk of detaching a given technology solution from the dayto-day reality in which it operates. They hide the need for the more intensive and long-term investments that are necessary to realize in full the Utopian vision of charismatic technologies.</p><p>In hindsight, it is not difficult to see the flaws in the OLPC project, which should have been apparent from the beginning. Laptops are simply tools, but education is a human-involved and community-driven process. The idea that technology can bring about a transformative or even revolutionary social and cultural change in one fell swoop is highly seductive. A transformative change in children's learning requires significant social and cultural changes. Low-cost, low-power laptops alone cannot bring about such changes.</p><p>The OLPC project illustrates how technology can command our attention with its attractive, but unrealistic, claim of being the agent of a change that is not only easy to implement, but also quickly delivers its benefits. In reality, however, no type of significant social or cultural change is quick, easy, and simple. Technology does not give us a shortcut. More often than not, progress toward a social change is made incrementally only through long-term efforts.</p><p>IDEOLOGIES BEHIND CHARISMATIC TECHNOLOGIES</p><p>Much of the original appeal of the OLPC project has now faded away. But there has been no shortage of charismatic technologies since then. The COVID-19 pandemic is further accelerating the normalization of charismatic technologies. For example, some technologists advocate the use of AI to identify people's emotions, claiming that emotion AI will help with so-called \"Zoom fatigue\" from web conference meetings, which have significantly increased during the COVID-19 outbreak (Rana el Kaliouby, \"Emotionally Aware Technology Could Help Us Beat Zoom Fatigue,\" Fast Company, June 15, 2020, fastcompany.com/90515714/emotionally-aware-tech nology-could-help-us-beat-zoom-fatigue). These advocates propose detecting and capturing human emotions and other mental states from people's facial and vocal expressions and using them as additional datapoints. They promise that such information will enable virtual event organizers to increase attendees' engagement and allow businesses to better monitor how motivated their employees are during virtual team meetings. They also suggest that education and healthcare should adopt emotion AI to improve online learning and telemedicine practices.</p><p>The proponents of emotion AI rely on the idea of charismatic technology--that technology can produce social and cultural change without addressing underlying problems in their full complexity. Instead of asking why students are having difficulty in an online class and looking into multiple factors--such as poor planning, lack of support for teachers, and the pandemic situation forcing many parents to simultaneously take care of their children and work from home--the supporters of charismatic technology simply point to technology as a quick and definitive solution. As with the OLPC project, emotion AI fails to critically assess what technology can realistically achieve. As long as related socioeconomic and political issues remain unaddressed, equipping a web conferencing platform with emotion AI will not automatically and independently raise students' engagement in online classes.</p><p>Extracting information about people's emotions from their facial and vocal expressions is also highly controversial--it violates people's privacy and can lead to unwarranted surveillance. It is not something to be implemented society-wide in a rush under the guise of user consent, which is practically meaningless, just so that event organizers can get their virtual attendees more engaged and businesses can measure the motivation level of their employees. There is no good evidence that AI algorithms for emotion recognition perform reliably or accurately (Angela Chen and Karen Ho, \"Emotion AI Researchers Say Overblown Claims Give Their Work a Bad Name.\" MLT Technology Review, Feb. 14, 2020; technologyreviewcom/2020/02/14/844765/ai-emotion-recognition-affective-computing-hirevue-regulation-ethics).</p><p>AI-driven algorithms for face recognition are also notorious for their ability to inflict great harm due to their poor performance when applied to people of color, particularly women of color. In their Gender Shades project (gendershades. org/overview.html), researchers Joy Buolamwini and Timnit Gebru show that the error rates of widely used face recognition algorithms range from 21% to 35% when applied to women of color.</p><p>It is certainly tempting for event organizers, teachers, business owners, and healthcare professionals to enlist one particular technology that claims to measure the level of emotional engagement in their clients, students, employees, and patients, rather than going through a more laborious and time-consuming process of speaking to those people for input and feedback, examining and discussing the issues in detail, and coming up with a long-term solution that takes account of many related factors. But without going through such a process, a change will not be effective.</p><p>Technology should not be used as an excuse to skip over die difficult but necessary process of collective deliberation and decision making. It should not be used as a ploy to establish and present a society-wide change as a fait accompli. Given the serious risk that emotion AI poses to our society, how much importance should be given to driving digital engagement in the first place? Facial recognition alone has already been criticized for its use in discriminatory policing and digital surveillance (Geoffrey A. Fowler, \"Black Lives Matter Could Change Facial Recognition Forever--If Big Tech Doesn't Stand in the Way,\" Washington Post, June 12, 2020; washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/06/12/facial-recog nition-ban; and Sidney Fussell, \"How Surveillance Has Always Reinforced Racism,\" Wired, June 19, 2020; wired.com/story/how-surveillance-reinforced-racism).</p><p>In addressing why so many so enthusiastically accepted OLPC's charismatic promises, The Charisma Machine author Ames writes: \"When people imbue technologies with charisma, it is because they expect technologies not only to be able to solve what they see as problems in the world but to do it in the way that agrees with and amplifies their deeply held core beliefs--their ideological frames--about how the world works.\" According to Ames, the ideological frame for the OLPC project was the American notion of the technically precocious boy. The ideological frame for emotion AI is dataism, the belief that everything that can be measured should be measured, and that extraction of data and information is justified at any cost solely due to the potential of a technological breakthrough.</p><p>Lurking behind both is the ideology of techno-libertarianism, whose main strands consist of technological determinism, categorical individualism that verges on egoism due to its disproportionate emphasis on individual rights over social responsibility, and free-market capitalism (Langdon Winner, \"Cyberlibertarian Myths and the Prospects for Community,\" ACM SIGCAS Computers and Society 27(3): 14-19, September 1997; doi.org/10.1145/270858.270864). These ideological frames must be unearthed and examined in order to accurately evaluate the Utopian promises of charismatic technologies.</p><p>THE ROLE OF TECHNOLOGY FOR TRUE PROGRESS</p><p>The pandemic added a sense of urgency and inevitability to the mandate for rapid and broad adoption of digital technologies. But a rushed adoption and implementation, while disregarding the overall technological impacts on individuals and society, can cause more harm than good. Not all changes bring progress or improvement. We should not let the allure of charismatic technologies blind us to this fact.</p><p>Certain social and cultural changes are hard to revert once they get rolled out, no matter how harmful they turn out to be. This is particularly true when such a change benefits those in positions of power. For example, our digital footprints are now constantly tracked and collected by online businesses and social media companies for targeted advertising. Data brokerage firms such as Acxiom and Experian collect information about individuals, compile them into a profile that includes thousands of datapoints, and sell them to other businesses and government agencies. Entities that profit from this business model actively resist any attempt to rectify this current state, even though people having no ownership of their own digital footprints is deeply problematic.</p><p>There are many positive social and cultural changes that we should work toward, such as making AI fair and nondiscriminating, preserving people's privacy in both the digital and the physical realm, and restoring people's right to own their digital footprints. Technology alone won't make these true progresses magically materialize. It is people's collective will, not technology itself, that determines how technology is utilized. American mathematician and the author of Weapons of Math Destruction Cathy O'Neil, for example, suggests repurposing the crime-risk-scoring AI algorithm as a tool to help with defunding the police (\"Here's an Algorithm for Defunding the Police,\" Bloomberg, June 18, 2020, bloom berg.com/opinion/articles/2020-06-18/here-s-an-algorithm-for-defunding-the-police).</p><p>Those AI algorithms predict how likely it is for offenders to be re-arrested within 2 years of leaving custody, based upon their attributes compared against a large database of past offenders' attributes. For the purpose of predicting the chance of re-arrest, the algorithms have been shown to have deep flaws (Julia Angwin, et al., \"Machine Bias,\" ProPublica, May 23, 2016; propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing). However, used as an aid to racial justice, those algorithms can highlight the socio-economic factors that contribute most to institutionalized racism and help identify high-priority areas for funding.</p><p>We can use the same technology for expanding social justice or for racial profiling. What matters is whether we will commit ourselves to fully examining the complexity of the problems and working out a sustainable, long-term solution that benefits both individuals and society through a collective deliberation and decision-making process or will shun the responsibility and subscribe to the false promises of charismatic technologies. Technology should be enlisted as additional help to society-wide efforts toward achieving positive social and cultural changes, not as their substitute.</p><p>Bohyun Kim</p><p>University of Rhode Island</p><p>Bohyun Kim (<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:bohyun.kim@gmail.com\">bohyun.kim@gmail.com</email>) is the chief technology officer and an associate professor at the University of Rhode Island Libraries.

A new coalition and a report unveiled on Tuesday make clear that era is over.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The coalition, Athena, comprises three dozen grass-roots groups involved in issues like digital surveillance, antitrust and working conditions in warehouses. The goal is to encourage and unify the resistance to Amazon that is now beginning to form. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  The report, from the Economic Roundtable, a nonprofit research group that focuses on social and economic issues in Southern California, delves into the largely unexplored topic of what Amazon is costing the communities where it has warehouses. The short answer: a lot.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  While the simultaneous arrival of Athena and the report are a coincidence, they are linked by their attempts to understand and ultimately influence Amazon's push into almost every aspect of modern life. The internet conglomerate hired 97,000 employees over the summer, nearly the total employment of Google. The report is bluntly titled ''Too Big to Govern.''</p><p>  ''This is a company functioning at a scale that was previously left to government,'' said Tom Perriello of the Open Society Foundations. Founded by the billionaire George Soros, Open Society is providing some of the seed funding for Athena. The coalition is raising $15 million to cover its first three years.</p><p>  ''It has incredible impact,'' Mr. Perriello said of Amazon. ''Who could possibly shape its future and direction?''</p><p>  Amazon, like Facebook, Apple and Google, has drawn the attention of Washington regulators, state attorneys general and at least a few politicians in the last year. The central question being asked about all of the companies: When does a tech platform become too big and powerful, ultimately hurting the society it once dazzled? </p><p>  In Amazon's case, the situation is particularly complicated. Its aspirations long ago exceeded online retail to encompass fresh groceries, devices that connect your home to the internet, front-door and neighborhood surveillance, professional services like plumbing and contracting, health care, government procurement, internet infrastructure and Hollywood entertainment. Just about everything, really. </p><p>  Amazon declined to comment for this article.</p><p>  Athena springs out of several unexpectedly successful grass-roots efforts to rein in Amazon's power. </p><p>  Last fall, the retailer was forced to begin paying a $15 hourly minimum wage nationwide. In February, it abandoned plans to establish a new headquarters in New York after opponents mobilized against Amazon and the politicians who had approved the deal. This month, an attempt to stack the City Council in Seattle, the company's hometown, with members more acceptable to Amazon backfired with voters. </p><p>  These setbacks could be attributed to many factors, but one of them was the influence of labor and immigrant organizations. Now some of those groups are joining together under Athena.</p><p>  ''We're learning from what makes Amazon back down, and looking to replicate that as much as possible with as many people as possible,'' said Dania Rajendra, the Athena director.</p><p>  Athena will be run from New York, but the real work will be done out in the field where most of the member organizations are. They include the Awood Center, a Minneapolis nonprofit that has organized Amazon workers from East Africa; Warehouse Workers for Justice, which is based in Chicago; and Fight for the Future, a group that focuses on digital issues, in Massachusetts.</p><p>  In a separate move on Monday, Fight for the Future and other groups called on Congress to investigate Amazon's surveillance products, including the Ring front-door monitor and Rekognition facial tracking software. The products threaten ''our privacy and civil liberties, especially in brown and black communities,'' the groups said.</p><p>  The effort against Amazon will not be easy, said Lauren Jacobs of the Partnership for Working Families, a coalition member in Oakland. Amazon is projected to have $238 billion in sales this year with 750,000 employees.</p><p>  ''This is a David and Goliath story,'' she said. ''David took what he had and turned it into a winning strategy. We're taking what we have -- the voices of the members of our various organizations, our collective knowledge and experience and deep understanding of the economy around Big Tech, and the experience we've had with making this company shift its behavior -- and trying to build a more humane economy.''</p><p>  Athena's $15 million budget is modest for the scale of change it hopes to bring about . ''This is grass-roots democracy,'' said Barry Lynn of Open Markets Institute, a Washington think tank and coalition member focused on antitrust issues. ''There's no money in it. Just people.''</p><p>  Mr. Perriello of the Open Society Foundations said updating protest movements for the digital era was an interesting challenge.</p><p>  ''Uncertainty is now baked into the model,'' he said. ''You don't know where the fight is going to be two months from now or two years from now. So you need the ability to organize citizens of very different political stripes across geographies and across demographics, where traditionally you had to organize in place.''</p><p>  The name Athena is associated with democracy, freedom and wisdom. But it has another advantage for the coalition.</p><p>  ''We didn't want to have Amazon in the name -- People Against Amazon or whatever -- because part of the strategy is to offer a better vision for how the economy could work,'' said Stacy Mitchell of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a nonprofit in Maine that opposes corporate concentration and advocates local community development. ''To be for something, not just against.''</p><p>  Sheheryar Kaoosji of another coalition member, the Warehouse Worker Resource Center in Ontario, east of Los Angeles, said Athena was not planning a boycott of Amazon but more interested in trying to sway it -- including its employees and customers.</p><p>  ''Half the households in America have an Amazon Prime account,'' Mr. Kaoosji said. ''That gives them a huge amount of power to change the company.'' His group is dedicated to improving conditions in what is sometimes called ''the goods movement sector.'' </p><p>  The resource center is in California's Inland Empire, where the work gets done to process those packages that appear on porches in Santa Monica and Newport Beach as if by magic. </p><p>  Amazon workers and Amazon customers exist in two different worlds, the Economic Roundtable said. The report calculates that a little over half of Amazon warehouse workers in Southern California live in substandard housing. And for every $1 in wages, they receive 24 cents in public assistance.</p><p>  ''Every day, ships, trucks, trains and airplanes bring an estimated 21,500 diesel truckloads of merchandise to 21 Amazon warehouses in the four-county region,'' the Economic Roundtable report said. It calculated that Amazon trucks last year created $642 million in ''uncompensated public costs'' for noise, road wear, accidents and harmful emissions.</p><p>  Almost as an aside, the report indicated how adept Amazon, with a stock market value of nearly $900 billion, is at getting funding from California and local communities. This included $25 million from the California Film Commission to subsidize six productions, including the third season of ''Sneaky Pete,'' an Amazon crime drama, and $1.2 million from the California Office of Business and Economic Development toward an office building in Irvine for programmers.</p><p>  The report noted on its title page that it was underwritten by the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, which represents more than 800,000 members of 300 unions. The Economic Roundtable said that did not affect the results. </p><p>  Among the report's suggestions: that Amazon raise its minimum wage to $20 an hour, that it require its logistics subcontractors to do the same, that it provide child care at its warehouses and that it build affordable housing in its logistics communities.</p><p>  The report draws on California Public Records Act requests filed with communities with Amazon facilities. Many of them nevertheless came up empty. The report noted that very little of Amazon's business was known to anyone but Amazon. Communities are in the dark.</p><p>  ''Our conclusion is that it's time for Amazon to come of age and pay its own way,'' said Daniel Flaming, a co-author of the report. ''This means paying its full costs to the communities that host it and the workers who create its profits.''</p><p/><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTOS: A report said that a little more than half of Amazon warehouse workers in Southern California lived in substandard housing.

The internet conglomerate hired 97,000 employees over the summer, nearly the total employment of Google. The report is bluntly titled \"Too Big to Govern.\"</p><p> \"This is a company functioning at a scale that was previously left to government,\" said Tom Perriello of the Open Society Foundations. Founded by billionaire George Soros, Open Society is providing some of the seed funding for Athena. The coalition is raising $15 million to cover its first three years.</p><p> \"It has incredible impact,\" Perriello said of Amazon. \"Who could possibly shape its future and direction?\"</p><p>Amazon, like Facebook, Apple and Google, has drawn the attention of Washington regulators, state attorneys general and at least a few politicians in the past year. The central question being asked about all of the companies: When does a tech platform become too big and powerful, ultimately hurting the society it once dazzled?</p><p> In Amazon's case, the situation is particularly complicated. Its aspirations long ago exceeded online retail to encompass fresh groceries, devices that connect your home to the internet, front-door and neighborhood surveillance, professional services like plumbing and contracting, health care, government procurement, internet infrastructure and Hollywood entertainment. Just about everything, really.</p><p>Amazon declined to comment for this article.</p><p> Athena springs out of several unexpectedly successful grassroots efforts to rein in Amazon's power.</p><p> Last fall, the retailer was forced to begin paying a $15 hourly minimum wage nationwide. In February, it abandoned plans to establish a new headquarters in New York after opponents mobilized against Amazon and the politicians who had approved the deal. This month, an attempt to stack the City Council in Seattle, the company's hometown, with members more acceptable to Amazon backfired with voters.</p><p> These setbacks could be attributed to many factors, but one of them was the influence of labor and immigrant organizations. Now some of those groups are joining together under Athena.</p><p> \"We're learning from what makes Amazon back down, and looking to replicate that as much as possible with as many people as possible,\" said Dania Rajendra, the Athena director.</p><p> Athena will be run from New York, but the real work will be done out in the field where most of the member organizations are. They include the Awood Center, a Minneapolis nonprofit that has organized Amazon workers from East Africa; Warehouse Workers for Justice, which is based in Chicago; and Fight for the Future, a group that focuses on digital issues, in Massachusetts.</p><p> In a separate move on Monday, Fight for the Future and other groups called on Congress to investigate Amazon's surveillance products, including the Ring front-door monitor and Rekognition facial tracking software. The products threaten \"our privacy and civil liberties, especially in Brown and Black communities,\" the groups said.</p><p> The effort against Amazon will not be easy, said Lauren Jacobs of the Partnership for Working Families, a coalition member in Oakland. Amazon is projected to have $238 billion in sales this year with 750,000 employees.</p><p> \"This is a David and Goliath story,\" she said. \"David took what he had and turned it into a winning strategy. We're taking what we have \u2014 the voices of the members of our various organizations, our collective knowledge and experience and deep understanding of the economy around Big Tech, and the experience we've had with making this company shift its behavior \u2014 and trying to build a more humane economy.\"</p><p> Athena's $15 million budget is modest for the scale of change it hopes to bring about. \"This is grassroots democracy,\" said Barry Lynn of Open Markets Institute, a Washington think tank and coalition member focused on antitrust issues. \"There's no money in it. Just people.\"</p><p> The name Athena is associated with democracy, freedom and wisdom. But it has another advantage for the coalition.</p><p> \"We didn't want to have Amazon in the name \u2014 People Against Amazon or whatever \u2014 because part of the strategy is to offer a better vision for how the economy could work,\" said Stacy Mitchell of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a nonprofit in Maine that opposes corporate concentration and advocates local community development. \"To be for something, not just against.\"</p><p> Sheheryar Kaoosji of another coalition member, the Warehouse Worker Resource Center in Ontario, east of Los Angeles, said Athena was not planning a boycott of Amazon but was more interested in trying to sway it \u2014 including its employees and customers.</p><p> \"Half the households in America have an Amazon Prime account,\" Kaoosji said. \"That gives them a huge amount of power to change the company.\"</p><p> His group is dedicated to improving conditions in what is sometimes called \"the goods movement sector.\"</p><p> The resource center is in California's Inland Empire, where the work is done to process those packages that appear on porches in Santa Monica and Newport Beach as if by magic.</p><p>Amazon workers and Amazon customers exist in two different worlds, the Economic Roundtable said. The report calculates that a little more than half of Amazon warehouse workers in Southern California live in substandard housing. And for every $1 in wages, they receive 24 cents in public assistance.</p><p> \"Every day, ships, trucks, trains and airplanes bring an estimated 21,500 diesel truckloads of merchandise to 21 Amazon warehouses in the four-county region,\" the Economic Roundtable report said. It calculated that Amazon trucks last year created $642 million in \"uncompensated public costs\" for noise, road wear, accidents and harmful emissions.</p><p> Among the report's suggestions: that Amazon raise its minimum wage to $20 an hour, that it require its logistics subcontractors to do the same, that it provide child care at its warehouses and that it build affordable housing in its logistics communities.</p><p> The report draws on California Public Records Act requests filed with communities with Amazon facilities. Many of them nevertheless came up empty. The report noted that very little of Amazon's business was known to anyone but Amazon. Communities are in the dark.</p><p> \"Our conclusion is that it's time for Amazon to come of age and pay its own way,\" said Daniel Flaming, a co-author of the report. \"This means paying its full costs to the communities that host it and the workers who create its profits.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKPA-de5cc6de4288b9274ffc84d2634b02d34baefff</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2899D9772552F0 NWBKPA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XM3-GV71-JBCN-41G8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401977</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1211\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Philadelphia Tribune<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

In the article, the term \"Amazoning\" was defined in the following way: At a recent healthcare conference I attended, it sure sounded like it. I heard healthcare professionals using 'Amazoning' as a verb referring to the rapid delivery of products and services, relentless focus on customer experience and cost optimization, and threat to various industries like retail, computing and entertainment.  There is no question that Big Tech companies like Amazon, Google, and Apple are aggressively pursuing healthcare projects (see, for example: What Are the Consequences of Big Tech Entering the Healthcare Market?</p><p>[2]; Big Tech Is Knocking on Hospital Doors; It's All About the Data[3]; Healthcare Will Contribute a Sizable Portion of Future Earnings for Apple[4]). The key question with regard to Amazon and its competitors is what component of healthcare is most appealing to them for business ventures. I feel certain that they are not interested in competing in the area of inpatient care. Health systems already have invested huge amount of money in infrastructure. The field is also too regulated and health systems lag considerably in their expertise and foresight in IT deployment. Moreover, Big Tech companies have had little difficulty incentivizing large health systems to share their clinical data with them (see: In a 'Wild West' environment, hospitals differ sharply in what patient data they give Google[5]). No, the focus of Big Tech will inexorably be on wellness and primary care. This lends itself well to (1) rapid delivery of products and services, (2) relentless focus on customer experience and (3) cost optimization. I have recently blogged extensively about the increasing sophistication of health wearables and their integration into what I have called wearable health ecosystems (WHEs) (see: The Evolution of \"Wearable Health Ecosystems\" and Associated Partnerships[6]. In my opinion, a large percentage of health-oriented consumers in a few years will have many of their health diagnostics monitored by home-based smart phones, smart watches, and integrated diagnostic devices (see: Digital Health Wearables Can Be Used to Detect Gait Disorders, Undiagnosed Diseases[7]). I have suggested that WHEs in the future will generate specific referrals to health system specialists, bypassing one of the primary roles of PCPs (Status Reports and Hospital Referrals from Wearable Health Ecosystems[8]; Fitbit to Be Acquired by Google[9]). It has been estimated that hospital PCPs are responsible for accounting for about 90% of hospital costs on the basis of clinical referrals. If my prediction about WHE-generated referrals is correct, Big Tech will have a significant grip on a large percentage of hospital referrals and thus revenue.

Last month, Margrethe Vestager dropped a competition bombshell[1]: the European watchdog is looking into the behavior of Amazon. Should the Commission decide to move further with the investigation, Amazon will likely join other US tech firms such as Microsoft, Intel, Qualcomm and, of course, Google, who have all been on the receiving end of European competition enforcement.  The Commission's move - though informal at this stage - is not surprising. </p><p>Over the last couples of years, Amazon has become one of the world's largest and most controversial companies. The animosity against it is exemplified in a paper by Lina Khan[2], which uses the example of Amazon to highlight the numerous ills that allegedly plague modern antitrust law. The paper is widely regarded as the starting point of the so-called 'hipster antitrust[3]' movement. But is there anything particularly noxious about Amazon's behavior, or is it just the latest victim of a European crusade against American tech companies?Where things stand so farAs is often the case in such matters, publicly available information regarding the Commission's 'probe' (the European watchdog is yet to open a formal investigation) is particularly thin. What we know so far comes from a number of declarations made by Margrethe Vestager (here[4] and here[5]) and a leaked questionnaire[6] that was sent to Amazon's rivals. Going on this limited information, it appears that the Commission is preoccupied about the manner in which Amazon uses the data[7] that it gathers from its online merchants. In Vestager's own words: The question here is about the data, because if you as Amazon get the data from the smaller merchants that you host [] do you then also use this data to do your own calculations? What is the new big thing, what is it that people want, what kind of offers do they like to receive, what makes them buy things. These concerns relate to the fact that Amazon acts as both a retailer in its own right and a platform for other retailers, which allegedly constitutes a 'conflict of interest'. As a retailer, Amazon sells a wide range of goods directly to consumers. Meanwhile, its marketplace platform enables third party merchants to offer their goods in exchange for referral fees[8] when items are sold (these fees typically range from 8% to 15%, depending on the type of good). Merchants can either execute theses orders themselves or opt for fulfilment by Amazon[9], in which case it handles storage and shipping. In addition to its role as a platform operator, As of 2017[10], more than 50% of units sold on the Amazon marketplace where fulfilled by third-party sellers, although Amazon derived three times more revenue from its own sales than from those of third parties (note that Amazon Web Services is still by far its largest source of profits). Mirroring concerns raised by Khan, the Commission worries that Amazon uses the data it gathers from third party retailers on its platform to outcompete them. More specifically, the concern is that Amazon might use this data to identify and enter the most profitable segments of its online platform, excluding other retailers in the process (or deterring them from joining the platform in the first place). Although there is some empirical evidence[11] to support such claims, it is far from clear that this is in any way harmful to competition or consumers. Indeed, the authors of the paper that found evidence in support of the claims note: Amazon is less likely to enter product spaces that require greater seller efforts to grow, suggesting that complementors' platform\u2010specific investments influence platform owners' entry decisions. While Amazon's entry discourages affected third\u2010party sellers from subsequently pursuing growth on the platform, it increases product demand and reduces shipping costs for consumers.Thou shalt not punish efficient behaviorThe question is whether Amazon using data on rivals' sales to outcompete them should raise competition concerns? After all, this is a standard practice in the brick-and-mortar industry, where most large retailers use house brands to go after successful, high-margin third-party brands. Some, such as Costco[12], even eliminate some third-party products from their shelves once they have a successful own-brand product. Granted, as Khan observes, Amazon may be doing this more effectively because it has access to vastly superior data. But does that somehow make Amazon's practice harmful to social social welfare? Absent further evidence, I believe not.  The basic problem is the following. Assume that Amazon does indeed have a monopoly in the market for online retail platforms (or, in other words, that the Amazon marketplace is a bottleneck for online retailers). Why would it move into direct retail competition against its third party sellers if it is less efficient than them? Amazon would either have to sell at a loss or hope that consumers saw something in its products that warrants a higher price. A more profitable alternative would be to stay put and increase its fees. It could thereby capture all the profits of its independent retailers. Not that Amazon would necessarily want to do so, as this could potentially deter other retailers from joining its platform. The upshot is that Amazon has little incentive to exclude more efficient retailers.  Astute readers, will have observed that this is simply a restatement of the Chicago school's Single Monopoly Theory[13], which broadly holds that, absent efficiencies, a monopolist in one line of commerce cannot increase its profits by entering the competitive market for a complementary good. Although the theory has drawn some criticism[14], it remains a crucial starting point with which enforcers must contend before they conclude that a monopolist's behavior is anticompetitive. So why does Amazon move into retail segments that are already occupied by its rivals? The most likely explanation is simply that it can source and sell these goods more efficiently than them, and that these efficiencies cannot be achieved through contracts with the said rivals. Once we accept the possibility that Amazon is simply more efficient, the picture changes dramatically. The sooner it overthrows less efficient rivals the better. Doing so creates valuable surplus that can flow to either itself or its consumers. This is true regardless of whether Amazon has a marketplace monopoly or not. Even if it does have a monopoly (which is doubtful given competition from the likes of Zalando, AliExpress, Google Search and eBay[15]), at least some of these efficiencies will likely be passed on to consumers. Such a scenario is also perfectly compatible with increased profits for Amazon. The real test is whether output increases when Amazon enters segments that were previously occupied by rivals.  Of course, the usual critiques voiced against the 'Single Monopoly Profit' theory apply here. It is plausible that, by excluding its retail rivals, Amazon is simply seeking to protect its alleged platform monopoly[16]. However, the anecdotal evidence that has been raised thus far does not support this conclusion.But what about innovation?Possibly sensing the weakness of the 'inefficiency' line of arguments against Amazon, critics will likely put put forward a second theory of harm. The claim is that by capturing the rents of potentially innovative retailers, Amazon may hamper their incentives to innovate and will therefore harm consumer choice. Margrethe Vestager intimated this much in a Bloomberg interview[17]. Though this framing might seem tempting at first, it falters under close inspection. The effects of Amazon's behavior could first be framed in terms of appropriability[18] \u2014 that is: the extent to which an innovator captures the social benefits of its innovation. The higher its share of those benefits, the larger its incentives to innovate. By forcing out its retail rivals, it is plausible that Amazon is reducing the returns which they earn on their potential innovations.  Another potential framing is that of holdup theory[19]. Applied to this case, one could argue that rival retailers made sunk investments (potentially innovation-related) to join the Amazon platform, and that Amazon is behaving opportunistically by capturing their surplus. With hindsight, merchants might thus have opted to stay out of the Amazon marketplace.  Unfortunately for Amazon's critics, there are numerous objections to these two framings. For a start, the business implication of both the appropriability and holdup theories is that firms can and should take sensible steps to protect their investments. The recent empirical paper[20] mentioned above stresses that these actions are critical for the sake of Amazon's retailers.  Potential solutions abound. Retailers could in principle enter into long-term exclusivity agreements with their suppliers (which would keep Amazon out of the market if there are no alternative suppliers). Alternatively, they could sign non-compete clauses with Amazon, exchange assets[21], or even outright merge[22]. In fact, there is at least some evidence of this last possibility occurring, as Amazon has acquired[23] some of its online retailers. The fact that some retailers have not opted for these safety measures (or other methods of appropriability) suggests that they either don't perceive a threat or are unwilling to make the necessary investments. It might also be due to bad business judgement on their part).  Which brings us to the big question. Should competition law step into the breach in those cases where firms have refused to take even basic steps to protect their investments? The answer is probably no[24].  For a start, condoning this poor judgement encourages firms to rely on competition enforcement rather than private solutions to solve appropriability and holdup issues. This is best understood with reference to moral hazard[25]. By insuring firms against the capture of their profits, competition authorities disincentivize all forms of risk-mitigation on the part of those firms. This will ultimately raise enforcement costs (as firms become increasingly reliant on the antitrust system for protection).  It is also informationally much more burdensome, as authorities will systematically have to rule on the appropriate share of profits between parties to a case.  Finally, overprotecting these investments would go against the philosophy of the European Court of Justice's Huawei[26] ruling. Albeit in the specific context of injunctions relating to SEPs, the Court conditioned competition liability on firms showing that they have taken a series of reasonable steps to sort out their disputes privately. Concluding remarksThis is not to say that competition intervention should categorically be proscribed. But rather that the capture of a retailer's investments by Amazon is an insufficient condition for enforcement actions. Instead, the Commission should question whether Amazon's actions are truly detrimental to consumer welfare and output. Absent strong evidence that an excluded retailer offered superior products, or that Amazon's move was merely a strategic play to prevent entry[27], competition authorities should let the chips fall where they may.  As things stand, there is simply no evidence to indicate that anything out of the ordinary is occurring on the Amazon marketplace. By shining the spotlight on Amazon, the Commission is putting itself under tremendous political pressure to move forward with a formal investigation (all the more so, given the looming European Parliament elections). This is regrettable, as there are surely more pressing matters for the European regulator to deal with. The Commission would thus do well to recall the words of Shakespeare in the Merchant of Venice: 'All that glisters is not gold'. Applied in competition circles this translates to 'all that is big is not inefficient'.

Yet a\u00a0growing chorus of critics complain that Amazon and fellow internet giants Facebook (FB) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) are becoming too dominant, snuffing out competition, innovation and even freedom of expression.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Wall Street is starting to ponder a trillion-dollar question: Could the Whole Foods buyout mark\u00a0a turning point that leads to serious U.S. antitrust scrutiny for Amazon, <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>and Google?</p><p>\"In the face of bona fide threats of regulatory and political opposition to Amazon, we against all odds finally may be facing 'Peak Amazon,' \" hedge fund manager Doug Kass wrote on July 11.</p><p>His warning was premature. The Federal Trade Commission cleared the Whole Foods deal in barely two months.</p><p>When it comes to total sales, Wal-Mart's (WMT) $486 billion towers over Amazon's $136 billion in 2016, and its nearly 4,700 U.S. stores dwarf Whole Foods' 460. However, Amazon did grab 43% of U.S. online sales in 2016, as well as 53% of the growth in the fast-moving sector, according to .</p><h>Network Effects</h><p>Rather than unfair competition, Amazon, <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>and Alphabet's Google\u00a0are the beneficiaries of the internet's winner-take-all dynamics, says\u00a0Joachim Fels, managing director at Pimco.\u00a0These superstars \"benefit from network effects that are especially strong in social media and software platforms, where the value of the services increases with the number of users,\" Fels wrote. \"Size begets size, which in turn begets size.\"</p><p>If someone wants to connect with friends or customers via social media, <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>is the obvious choice: 85% of Americans who are online are members. Not even Google could compete with that. And if you want to shop, where else to start but Amazon.com, which lists hundreds of millions of items?</p><p>But natural or not, their advantages unnerve observers from\u00a0the far left to the White House and even at the pro-market University of Chicago, which spawned the big-isn't-necessarily-bad legal shift under <person><nameText>President Reagan.</nameText></person></p><h>Bipartisan Backlash</h><p>Before <person><nameText>Steve Bannon </nameText></person>was pushed out of the White House as President Trump's senior advisor and returned to the populist, right-wing news site Breitbart, he reportedly made the case that <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>and Google's dominance made them \"essential elements of 21st-century life (that) should be regulated as utilities.\" Could that be sour grapes?\u00a0 A majority of Americans now say they get their news from social media sites led by <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>and from Google's search.</p><p>[ibd-display-video id=2101053 width=50 float=left autostart=true]Yet many conservatives and even some libertarians with traditionally hands-off inclinations toward business are growing concerned over the internet giants' power. That's intensified after Google's recent firing of an engineer for politically incorrect views on women and the high-tech workforce, and moves by <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>and others to combat \"fake news\" and ban offensive speech.</p><p>Trump raised the possibility of\u00a0antitrust action against Amazon during the campaign. He still has\u00a0CEO Jeff Bezos' empire in his sights, even if his real beef is with the Bezos-owned Washington Post.\u00a0\"Amazon is doing great damage to taxpaying retailers. Towns, cities and states throughout the U.S. are being hurt \u2014 many jobs being lost!\" Trump\u00a0tweeted recently.</p><p>Worries about Amazon's impact on retail jobs and wages also risk making it a prime target on the left.\u00a0Democratic Party leaders called for an antitrust crackdown as part of their \"Better Deal\" economic platform in July. Although they\u00a0singled out the cable industry, rather than the Silicon Valley and Seattle tech giants, that could change. Rep. Keith Ellison, who represents Minneapolis and serves as deputy chair of the Democratic National Committee, recently retweeted a Bloomberg opinion column titled \"Should America's Tech Giants Be Broken Up?\" with a one-word response: \"YES!\"</p><h>Innovation Stifled</h><p>Economists and technologists worry that these internet companies' dominance will snuff out innovation. Consider\u00a0Snap (SNAP), which raised $3.4 billion in March in the biggest IPO in three years. Already hopes have faded that it might erode <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>position. Analysts say <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>has simply copied Snapchat's popular features and left it in the dust. With Snap shares lagging below its IPO price, funding may be harder to come by for the next David to challenge a Goliath.</p><p>Luigi Zingales, finance professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, is calling for a more-proactive antitrust approach that would have kept\u00a0Facebook from buying up Instagram and WhatsApp. He says the antitrust action against Microsoft (MSFT) in the 1990s and early 2000s helped create a climate in which <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>and Google could rise to the top. But he worries that the current crop of leaders are growing too powerful to cut into their advantage. \"A system where this does not change is a system that is fossilized and hurts everyone,\" he said.</p><p>Current antitrust policy focuses on preventing companies from consolidating power to raise prices, harming consumers. But Lina Khan, until recently a fellow at the New America Foundation's Open Markets program, argues that a new approach is needed to address companies like Amazon that operate online platforms.</p><p>\"The economics of platform markets create incentives for a company to pursue growth over profits, a strategy that investors have rewarded,\" Khan wrote in the Yale Law Review. \"Under these conditions, predatory pricing becomes highly rational \u2014 even as existing doctrine treats it as irrational and therefore implausible.\"</p><p>Khan may have a point: While shares of Amazon are off their recent all-time highs,\u00a0they are still up 33% so far this year, even as earnings are expected to sink more than 20% in 2017.</p><p>Amazon Prime may have started as a loss leader to gain customer loyalty, but Amazon has made the service so broad and attractive \u2014 offering free shipping, Amazon Prime Video, various special offers and now discounts at Whole Foods \u2014\u00a0that it is creating a world in which people make purchases only via the internet giant.</p><p>Already about half of U.S. households are Amazon Prime members. And 55% of all online shopping searches started on Amazon last year vs. 30% in 2012. In recent months, Nike (NKE) and Sears (SHLD) threw in the towel and agreed to begin selling their athletic shoes and Kenmore appliances on Amazon.</p><p>As for Google and <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>proving a price monopoly is a nonstarter since their services are free to consumers.</p><h>Confused Antitrust Goals</h><p>But if not by pricing control, how should a monopoly be defined?</p><p>Under the Democrats' \"Better Deal\" outline, regulators would use criteria to judge whether a merger would \"reduce wages, cut jobs, lower product quality, limit access to services, stifle innovation, or hinder the ability of small businesses and entrepreneurs to compete.\"</p><p>Those guidelines hearken back to \"the bad old days of antitrust, when it was used to protect inefficient small businesses and to pursue confused social goals,\" wrote\u00a0Elizabeth Popp Berman, associate professor of sociology at the University at Albany in New York. \"While no one thinks that low prices for consumers are the only thing worth pursuing in life, they are the appropriate goal for antitrust because they make it coherent and administrable.\"</p><p>That consensus\u00a0is entrenched in the antitrust enforcement agencies, codified into law through court decisions and resistant to change.</p><h>Platform Rules</h><p>Still, the EU's fine of Google for abusing its dominant position in internet search could hint at future U.S. policy.</p><p>In prioritizing its own comparison-shopping site in search results,\u00a0the European Commission said Google \"denied other companies the chance to compete on the merits and to innovate.\"</p><p>Online platforms, Khan noted, \"control the essential infrastructure on which their rivals depend.\"</p><p>In a reflection of the increasingly fragile embrace of Democrats and Big Tech, the Google-funded, left-of-center New America think tank last month cut loose the Open Markets group after it praised the European Union's fine vs. Google.</p><p>While Google disputes the EU's charge, noting Amazon's lead position in shopping searches, it agreed to make changes by Sept. 28.\u00a0The EU also is scrutinizing Google's bundling of its Google Play app store with its free Android app.</p><p>Luther Lowe, vice president of policy at Yelp (YELP), a crowdsourced review site, called the Google fine \"the most significant enforcement event in consumer tech antitrust in nearly 20 years,\" alluding to the Microsoft case.</p><p>Yet the Microsoft antitrust fight was expensive and dragged on for years, underscoring the limitations of traditional antitrust actions in a complex and fast-moving industry.</p><p>Tech journalist Walt Mossberg and economist Hal Singer have promoted addressing monopolistic and discriminatory competitive practices through a \"special, permanent, nonpartisan, independent commission \u2014 or even a special, narrowly focused court \u2014 to adjudicate disputes about internet issues.\"\u00a0The issues could run from network neutrality violations to heavy-handed behavior by Google or Amazon.</p><p>Singer notes that such a tribunal already exists to handle complaints that cable companies are giving preference to their own programming.</p><h>Common Carrier?</h><p>While Google is in the EU's line of fire now, Amazon is starting to come under the microscope.</p><p>Stacy Mitchell, co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance and co-author of the report, \"Amazon's Stranglehold,\" argued at a recent Forbes forum that Amazon's anticompetitive effect stems from its inherent conflict as both a direct seller and the operator of a platform that it invites other sellers to use.</p><p>Khan cites Amazon's big discounts from Federal Express (FDX) and UPS (UPS) as a high-volume customer. Amazon passes along those discounts to independent companies that use its fulfillment services.</p><p>Extending its empire to 460 Whole Foods stores substantially increases Amazon's logistics footprint, facilitating in-store pickup by customers and lowering the cost of last-mile delivery.

Along the Information Superhighway lay peace, progress, and prosperity. There were critics along the way, of course, but their warnings were for the most part dismissed or ignored. As late as 2011, journalists and technologists were praising social media\u00e2??s emancipatory power in light of the role of Facebook and Twitter in the Arab Spring revolts. But, as has been noted many times, after the U.S. presidential election in 2016, such optimism increasingly appeared na\u00c3\u00afve and misguided. Now Facebook and Twitter are seen as corrosive forces polluting the public sphere with misinformation, generating vitriol and outrage, and misusing user data for manipulative political ad targeting.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Americans from across the political spectrum have grown wary and weary of how digital technology is shaping political culture. Both Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Republican Senator Josh Hawley have been cheered for skewering Mark Zuckerberg, and calls to regulate Big Tech have taken on an increasingly bipartisan tenor. Global developments have contributed to this growing apprehension, as social media platforms have been implicated in the rise of authoritarian regimes, in the proliferation of massive disinformation operations, and even in genocidal campaigns against minority populations.</p><p>The heightened scrutiny of the political uses to which social media has been put is necessary and important. But it tends to miss a critical aspect of our situation. Much of the analysis tacitly assumes that our underlying political structures and values have remained relatively stable, that they will not fundamentally change -- even if they must be defended against the usual illiberal suspects, who deploy digital media in their efforts to undermine the legitimacy of democracies. If only Zuck would take more aggressive measures to purge Facebook of fake news, and if only Jack would ban all the Nazis from Twitter, then all would be well and we could proceed with business as usual. Much like the proverbial generals who always fight the last war, however, we will be undone in our efforts to make sense of our moment and to respond productively if we don\u00e2??t recognize that digital media is reconfiguring our politics at a more fundamental level.</p><p>The challenges we are facing are not merely the bad actors, whether they be foreign agents, big tech companies, or political extremists. We are in the middle of a deep transformation of our political culture, as digital technology is reshaping the human experience at both an individual and a social level. The Internet is not simply a tool with which we do politics well or badly; it has created a new environment that yields a different set of assumptions, principles, and habits from those that ordered American politics in the pre-digital age.</p><p>We are caught between two ages, as it were, and we are experiencing all of the attendant confusion, frustration, and exhaustion that such a liminal state involves. To borrow a line from the Marxist thinker Antonio Gramsci, \u00e2??The crisis consists precisely in the fact that the old is dying and the new cannot be born; in this interregnum a great variety of morbid symptoms appear.\u00e2?</p><p>Although it\u00e2??s not hard to see how the Internet, given its scope, ubiquity, and closeness to human life, radically reshapes human consciousness and social structures, that does not mean that the nature of that reshaping is altogether preordained or that it will unfold predictably and neatly. We must then avoid crassly deterministic just-so stories, and this essay is not an account of how digital media will necessarily change American politics irrespective of competing ideologies, economic forces, or already existing political and cultural realities. Rather, it is an account of how the ground on which these realities play out is shifting. Communication technologies are the material infrastructure on which so much of the work of human society is built. One cannot radically transform that infrastructure without radically altering the character of the culture built upon it. As Neil Postman once put it, \u00e2??In the year 1500, fifty years after the printing press was invented, we did not have old Europe plus the printing press. We had a different Europe.\u00e2? So, likewise, we may say that in the year 2020, fifty years after the Internet was invented, we do not have old America plus the Internet. We have a different America.</p><p>The Two Cities</p><p>A loose analogy might give us a better sense of our situation, or at least supply a useful bit of shorthand. We might say that our public sphere is now inhabited by the citizens of two \u00e2??cities,\u00e2? the Digital City and the Analog City. Much of the stress under which our body politic now labors, much of the strangeness of our moment, much of our apparent inability to move productively forward as a society, may be attributed in part to the emergence of the Digital City and its dramatic growth over the past two decades. To understand the political meaning of digital media, then, we should seek to understand the nature of the Digital City and how it is ordering the affections of its citizens and transforming public life.</p><p>The analogy, of course, draws on Saint Augustine, who in The City of God proposed the existence of two distinct cities, whose relationship structures the whole of human history. In Augustine\u00e2??s account, the City of God comprises the faithful throughout history, and the City of Man, or the earthly city, comprises the faithless. In Augustine\u00e2??s own time, the growing Church in the midst of the pagan empire was the most visible manifestation of the City of God. Critically, for the purpose of our analogy, the citizens of these two cities shared one common public sphere. They would pass each other on the same roads, trade in the same markets, and even fight alongside each other in the same army. But while they inhabited the same political space and played their parts in the same political institutions, they were formed by two different sets of affections and loyalties. The public sphere contained individuals with ultimately divergent fundamental beliefs about reality, the moral life, and civil society. Over time, as the citizens of the City of God grew in number, the character of the shared public realm was transformed.</p><p>We can borrow the basic structure of Augustine\u00e2??s vision as a way of thinking about digital media and American political culture. Let us play, then, with the idea of a Digital City and an Analog City, and consider how the tension between the two shapes our moment. Our political culture has been hitherto formed predominantly by the Analog City, which reflected to varying degrees both the inheritance of print culture and the conditions created by electronic media. What we are now witnessing is the ascendancy of the Digital City, which is characterized primarily by the advent of ubiquitous Internet connectivity, no longer just at home or work but also on mobile technology. Of course, the analogy to Augustine\u00e2??s two cities breaks down at a point -- the Digital City is in most respects unlike the City of God, nor are we considering eternal destinies. The key parallel is that our participation in the public sphere is shaped largely by our loyalties to one or the other city and that we are witnessing the emerging dominance of one of them. Some of us have inhabited both the Analog City and the Digital City, while an increasing number of us have known only the Digital City.</p><p>It is useful to remember where exactly we are in the history of the Digital City. The Internet has been around for a half century, but the World Wide Web -- the part of the Internet we access through web browsers -- is about thirty years old. The transition to what was dubbed Web 2.0, which made participation more widely accessible, and connected what we then quaintly thought of as our \u00e2??in real life\u00e2? identity more closely to our online presence, began just over fifteen years ago. The transition to smartphones and tablets, which made digital media a constant presence in our lives and our default media environment, has occurred only over the last decade. In other words, only recently has the Digital City begun to manifest itself in the public spaces that have been hitherto ordered by the priorities and sensibilities of the Analog City. Before then, the consequences of digital media, although much discussed, remained superficial, which allowed us to believe that the future would be business as usual, only faster and better and more inclusive.</p><p>If two distinct communities now reside within the same political space, the conflicts that characterize this space will increasingly reflect the tensions between these two communities. When some phenomenon perplexes our pundit class, when our time-worn political concepts seem incapable of making sense of it, we may be witnessing just such a clash between the Digital and Analog cities.</p><p>Take fact-checking, for example. As it became increasingly clear that all manner of deliberate lies, misinformation, and conspiracy theories were circulating widely through social media channels in connection with the 2016 election, many observers stressed the need for more aggressive fact-checking. The part of me that reflected the years I was formed within the Analog City nodded approvingly. The part of me that was beginning to recognize the significance of the Digital City shook its head in disbelief that anyone thought this an adequate solution. The part of me that was already being reshaped by the Digital City just thought to himself: \u00c2\u00af\\_(\u00e3??)_/\u00c2\u00af.</p><p>The anodyne insistence on fact-checking to bridge chasms in worldview misunderstands the nature of our new media environment; it fails to see the difference between the economics of information scarcity and the economics of information abundance. Information scarcity may lend itself to a measure of credulity: When facts are few, persuading the ignorant is relatively easy. But information abundance, already characteristic of early modern societies, engenders a degree of skepticism: The more there is to know, the more likely we feel that truth is elusive. Information super-abundance, or the condition of \u00e2??digital plenitude,\u00e2? as media scholar Jay David Bolter has called it, encourages the view that truth isn\u00e2??t real: Whatever view you want to validate, you\u00e2??ll find facts to support it. All information is also now potentially disinformation. Fact-checking, however well-intentioned, does not solve the problem; paradoxically, it may in some cases make it worse. It is an Analog City solution insufficient to the problems of the Digital City.</p><p>The Word Reanimated</p><p>How do we best understand the formative power of the Digital City? Why would the emergence of digital communication technologies radically alter our political culture?</p><p>We can begin by framing the advent of the Internet within a longer story about communication technologies. The broad outlines of this story are by now familiar. The invention of writing, especially the invention of the phonetic alphabet, \u00e2??restructured consciousness,\u00e2? in Walter Ong\u00e2??s memorable phrase, and so restructured societies as well. It did so, in part, by making new forms of expression, organization, and remembering possible. Writing, for instance, made it possible to detach the act of communication from the context of the face-to-face encounter, thereby tempering what Ong called the \u00e2??agonistic\u00e2? tendencies of such encounters -- their resemblance to combat -- particularly in the political realm. Writing also \u00e2??separates \u00e2??administration\u00e2?? -- civil, religious, commercial, and other -- from other types of social activities.\u00e2? And it externalized thought and memory, engendering the novel experience of the mediated self, marked by heightened self-awareness.</p><p>The consequences of writing disseminated gradually, as writing was, for much of its history, a practice limited to a few. Beginning in the sixteenth century, printing accelerated and distributed the effects of the written word, playing a critical role in the emergence of the modern world -- famously in the Protestant Reformation and the Scientific Revolution. Beginning in the mid-nineteenth century with the telegraph, electronic media began to reshape the order built on the foundation of print, a reordering that grew more pronounced with the appearance of radio and television. For the first time in history, a dispersed mass audience could be reached simultaneously, helping to produce a culture in which slow reflection on the printed word gave way to instantaneous reaction on a mass scale. Then digital media appeared on the scene, intensifying this transformation while at the same time reviving the volatility and drama of two-way, instant communication.</p><p>I paint this picture with admittedly broad strokes. A closer, more granular look at any of these developments will, as any historian of technology knows, reveal all manner of interesting twists and turns, unexpected developments and alternative paths that were abandoned or refused. However, the basic implication of the broad narrative remains. As Neil Postman puts it:</p><p>\u00e2??New technologies alter the structure of our interests: the things we think about. They alter the character of our symbols: the things we think with. And they alter the nature of community: the arena in which thoughts develop.\u00e2?</p><p>The first alteration -- in the things we think about -- can be described in terms of attention, which has so vexed our public discourse about technology in the last few years. (Although as early as 2008, Nicholas Carr had already raised lonely alarms and even warned against the dangers of micro-targeted advertising.) The structure of a medium of communication guides and directs our attention. Television, for example, directs our attention to the physical characteristics of a political figure in a way that print and radio don\u00e2??t. The telegraph made it possible to bring far away events to broad public attention on a daily basis, thereby altering the topics and pace of political discourse. Digital media now makes it possible to attend to an even wider array of phenomena, near and far, and often in so-called \u00e2??real time.\u00e2? And, insofar as our social media feeds are shaped by opaque algorithmic processes and engineered to maximize engagement, they play an especially obvious role in altering what we think about.</p><p>Postman\u00e2??s second alteration -- in the things we think with -- can be glossed as follows: It is one thing to think with a pamphlet, another to think with a newspaper, yet another to think with a televisual image, and still another to think with a meme. Writing encourages a heightened precision of expression and a sequential and systematic ordering of ideas and arguments. The television image does both more and less than what writing can accomplish, operating at a different emotional register. It can communicate wordlessly, directly to the heart, as it were, but it cannot easily support nor does it encourage sustained argumentation.</p><p>But let us think more about the last of these three alterations -- about how new technologies alter the nature of community. The human self, as philosophers have long noted, emerges in relation to others, or to the Other, if you like. The character of the self develops under the gaze of this Other, and is shaped by it. In the Digital City, we are under the gaze of an algorithmically constituted, collective Other. This audience, composed of friends, strangers, and non-human actors, is unlike anything we might have encountered in the Analog City. Like the gaze of God, it is a ubiquitous face looking down upon us, whose smile we dearly desire. We seek its approval, or, failing that, at least its notice, and we subtly bend our self-presentation to fit our expectations of what this audience desires of us.</p><p>As is now well known, social media platforms have been deliberately calibrated -- using likes, retweets, and other reward mechanisms -- to hijack our desire for attention and approval. This hybrid, cyborg audience, because of its ability to colonize every dimension of our experience, blurring the older distinctions between private and public life, heightens the power of the Digital City to shape our identities. Other peer groups remain, of course: family, school, colleagues, neighborhoods, religious communities, and so forth. But the formative power of these groups wanes in comparison to that of the digitally mediated audience, which lends the Digital City its Skinner-box quality of instant reinforcement.</p><p>The Digital City also shapes its citizens through its cultivation of habit and disposition. Online venues, whether social media platforms, messaging apps, or forums, are not simply places we go to express our political opinions; they are places where our political habits and sensibilities are formed. This formation includes how we speak. A platform\u00e2??s distinctive moderation policies, reward systems, and other affordances structure our experience on the platform, how we express ourselves and encounter the expressions of others, how we modify our speech and demand that others modify theirs.</p><p>Free-speech maximalists, who believe that there should be no limits to what you can say regardless of how odious the opinions may be, are distressed by the alacrity with which some are prepared to call for the speech of others to be curtailed or circumscribed. But free-speech maximalism flourishes in print culture; in the Digital City it appears less desirable, for two reasons. First, print culture sustained the belief that, given a modicum of good sense and education among people, truth would triumph in the marketplace of ideas. Writing and reading are slow and deliberate, encouraging the belief that false ideas will eventually be rejected by anyone trained to think. Second, we experience the written word as an inert reality -- it is the \u00e2??dead letter,\u00e2? it has lost the force and immediacy of the spoken word. Because writing is less volatile than speech, it makes freedom of expression seem relatively harmless.</p><p>But before we conceived of a word as a thing composed of markings on a surface, it was a living, effectual action. Words were not things; they did things. This, for example, is why people in print culture have a difficult time understanding why Isaac is unable simply to retract the blessing he has given to Jacob under false pretenses: The word is out and cannot be taken back. In the Digital City the word is reanimated, recovering from the written much of the vitality of the spoken word. Digital media reintegrates the word into a dynamic situation. The digital audience is not always visible, but it can be present with a degree of immediacy that is more like a face-to-face encounter than are print writing and reading. Discourse on digital media platforms, from comment boxes to social media, is infamously combative. Words are active, and any negative effects are not easily contained.</p><p>Moreover, digital plenitude no longer sustains the hope that the truth will win out in the marketplace of ideas. Information super-abundance renders implausible the traditional ideal of the citizen as well-informed, critical thinker. Instead, it fosters the desire for tools that give users the ability to selectively censor their feeds, and the instinct to rely on moderators to restrict speech so as to conform with their values.</p><p>Shattered Myths</p><p>Our political dispositions and beliefs emerge as much from our embodied engagement with the material order of the world as they do from our consciously held ideas about the world. But the beliefs newly fostered by the Digital City have turned out to be at odds with those of the modern Analog City. The myths, benign and otherwise, that sustained the modern world now fail to inspire or motivate. They have lost their purchase on our imaginations and affections. Their urgently repeated invocation -- more facts, more science, more experts; know your history; stand by your country -- now rings hollow.</p><p>To better understand the consequences of digital media, then, we need to look more closely at how it shapes human experiences that have especially salient political dimensions -- how, for example, it shapes the experience of the self, of place and time, and how it predisposes us to think about the socio-political order. Let us look at each of these in turn.</p><p>The Reenchanted Self</p><p>In his account of the nature of secular society, Charles Taylor argues that an important part of the emergence of the modern age was the disenchantment of the world and the rise of what he describes as the \u00e2??buffered self.\u00e2? Unlike the old \u00e2??porous self,\u00e2? the new buffered self no longer perceives and believes in sources of meaning outside the human mind. This new self feels unperturbed by powers beyond its control. We might say that in the Digital City the self becomes in some ways \u00e2??porous\u00e2? once again. It is subject to powers that we perceive as impinging on us, powers now algorithmic rather than spiritual.</p><p>Taylor\u00e2??s discussion of disenchantment begins with the question of meaning. In our disenchanted modern world, meaning arises only from minds, and the human mind is the only kind of mind there is. Nothing external to the human mind bears any meaning in itself. Moreover, there are no non-human agents, either made of matter or spirit. By contrast, in the enchanted world things and spirits have the \u00e2??power of exogenously inducing or imposing meaning,\u00e2? a meaning that is independent of the perceiver and that we may be forced to reckon with whether we would like to or not. Objects in the enchanted world can also have a causal power. These \u00e2??charged\u00e2? objects, Taylor explains, \u00e2??have what we usually call \u00e2??magic\u00e2?? powers,\u00e2? and they can be either benevolent or malevolent. They may bring blessing or trouble, cure or disease, rescue or danger. \u00e2??Thus in the enchanted world,\u00e2? Taylor writes, \u00e2??charged things can impose meanings, and bring about physical outcomes proportionate to their meanings.\u00e2? The vulnerable self sought refuge in a well-ordered society whose ritual life was designed to protect its members from malign forces. As Taylor explains, this is in part why heresy was so dangerous. The heretic was not only a source of intellectual error, he also compromised the security of the community by compromising its purity.</p><p>According to Taylor, the enchanted world \u00e2??shows a perplexing absence of certain boundaries which seem to us essential.\u00e2? In particular, \u00e2??the boundary between mind and world is porous.\u00e2? The \u00e2??porous self\u00e2? in an enchanted world is thus \u00e2??vulnerable, to spirits, demons, cosmic forces. And along with this go certain fears which can grip it in certain circumstances.\u00e2? By contrast, the \u00e2??buffered self,\u00e2? characteristic of the disenchanted world, is \u00e2??invulnerable\u00e2? and \u00e2??master of the meanings of things for it.\u00e2? It is also immune to the fears that may grip the porous self. The buffered self is sealed off from the world; its boundaries are less fuzzy; meaning resides neatly within its own mind; and it occupies a world of inert matter. It is autonomous and self-possessed, the ideal type of the modern individual.</p><p>Certain features of the self in an enchanted world are now reemerging in the Digital City. Digital technologies influence us and exert causal power over our affairs. In the Digital City, we are newly aware of operating within a field of inscrutable forces over which we have little to no control. Though these forces may be benevolent, they are just as often malevolent, undermining our efforts and derailing our projects. We often experience digital technologies as determining our weal and woe, acting upon us independently of our control and without our understanding. We are vulnerable, and our autonomy is compromised.</p><p>We are troubled not by spirits but by bots and opaque algorithmic processes, which alternately and capriciously curse or bless us. In the Digital City, individuals may be refused credit, passed over for job interviews, or denied welfare on the basis of systems built on digital data against which they have little to no recourse. The self that emerges out of this digitally mediated milieu more resembles the porous self of the old enchanted world than the buffered self of disenchanted modernity. Consequently, the self that emerges in the Digital City is more likely to seek refuge in a social body and to strive for the purity of that body.</p><p>The modern Analog City, particularly its print-based ecosystem of knowledge and the growing success of the techno-scientific project of mastery over nature, engendered the ideals of robust, confident, self-sufficient individualism. The Digital City disabuses its citizens of such notions. They know they are dependent and vulnerable, enmeshed in systems beyond their capacity to master.</p><p>The Perpetual Now</p><p>As embodied creatures, our experience is structured by time and place. Time and place are also critical dimensions of our political identities. Where and when are the people with whom I must relate, or to whom I feel a measure of loyalty? Identifying the communities to which we belong has traditionally been a matter of knowing our place. A characteristic of the modern nation is that it defines citizenship not along familial or tribal lines but along geographic lines. Our orientation to time likewise shapes our social and political lives, as do the form and content of our memories. Communities have always drawn on shared stories and memories. Our experience of place and time is not always direct, however, but is often mediated by technology. When technological change reorders our relationship to place and time, it also reorders our social and political sensibilities.</p><p>Like the City of God, the Digital City exists in no particular place and abides by its own rules of time. Digital communities emerge in shared time rather than in shared space; simultaneity is the coin of the realm. The Digital City orders the lives of its citizens in keeping with a perpetual present disassociated from both past and future, heightening a tendency already present in electronic mass media like television. Mass media audiences shared time, while smaller groups also shared spaces, gathering in front of the television, or by the radio, or in the theater. Mobile digital technology, however, has strained the link between presence and place, making it optional. We may now be in multiple places at once, here in my body, but there in speech or vision. The community to which I find myself most drawn may not exist in any one place, composed as it is of scattered kindred spirits brought together through digital technology.</p><p>The triumph of shared time and the demise of shared place in the Digital City changes the experience of social belonging. While the modern state is not going anywhere anytime soon, the relationship of citizens to the nation is evolving. Loyalty to the community that is the nation state, already detached to some degree from local communities, yields to the shifting loyalties of digital attachments.</p><p>It is not only our experience of the present that digital media refashions but also our relationship, through memory, to the past. \u00e2??What anthropologists distinguish as \u00e2??cultures,\u00e2??\u00e2? Ivan Illich wrote, \u00e2??the historian of mental spaces might distinguish as different \u00e2??memories.\u00e2?? The way to recall, to remember, has a history which is, to some degree, distinct from the history of the substance that is remembered.\u00e2? We are, at least in part, what we remember, both as individuals and as a society, and what we remember is a function of how we remember, of our tools for remembering -- texts, images, monuments, social media feeds. A change in tools is also a change of the self and its relation to society. There are few more important effects of digital technologies than their propensity to reorder how and what we remember.</p><p>Again, the consequences are most evident when seen in light of history. Oral societies, Walter Ong argued, were deeply conservative because knowledge was scarce and fragile. All memory was living memory, and knowledge would die with those who held it if they did not pass it on to another person. Language itself, especially in what we would think of as its more poetic manifestations, was focused on mnemonic efficiency: proverbs, parables, vivid images, rhythmic utterances, rituals, formulaic expressions, repetitions -- much of what became unpalatable to the literate sensibility.</p><p>Writing allowed for the durable storage of knowledge independently of human beings. Not only can written knowledge outlive a particular individual, it can outlive a whole culture. By outsourcing the task of remembrance to written texts, literate societies are relieved of the conservative and traditionalist pressures of orality. Thus, whereas premodern societies tended to look back to a distant and glorious past, many modern societies, with their imaginations liberated, were utopian in their expectations, assuming the best was still to come. However, for many centuries literacy remained unevenly distributed across the population, and communal, oral habits of mind and expression remained common through much of the modern era.</p><p>When writing was introduced into oral cultures it was typically deployed in the service of institutions and bureaucracies. It sustained the memory of the tribe, group, or nation, not of the individual. As the means of writing (and later photography) were democratized, the individual was able to create and sustain personal rather than collective memories and thus construct and maintain an identity that achieved a measure of independence from the group. This is also one of the many ways private life through the modern period became valorized and public life demoted.</p><p>Pursuing this line of development into the age of digital media, a paradox comes into focus. We have never been able to document our lives so thoroughly as we now can with the help of digital tools, yet we feel that time is out of joint and that we\u00e2??ve lost the thread of both our personal and collective histories. We appear to be both obsessive documenters of our experience, yet largely indifferent to or overwhelmed by the archives we create. We have ever more access to the past, but we are unable to bring it meaningfully to bear on the present.</p><p>This is not surprising. Plato identified similar dynamics when he offered his critique of writing in the Phaedrus: While writing would allow far more knowledge to be preserved and accessed, it would also relieve individuals of the burden of sustaining collective memory themselves. Like writing and print, our use of digital media ordinarily generates an archive (as well as a trail of data, often invisible to users but of great value to others). But although digital media appears to sustain memory, it is more like oral communication in its evanescence. The feed of our tweets and status updates recedes not as quickly and decisively as the spoken word, but with a similar effect. Under the guise of pervasive documentation, the architecture of digital platforms sanctions forgetting, while preoccupying us with instantaneity. It is not currently this era or this year, but rather this day or even this hour. To live on social media is to be sucked into a hyper-extended present, upon which the past only occasionally impinges.</p><p>Certain platforms and apps do periodically foreground portions of our archive, but they do so artificially -- like \u00e2??on this day\u00e2? alerts in photo apps or memory notifications on Facebook reminding you of when you became \u00e2??friends\u00e2? with someone. The narrative thread is lost. Distant and recent past blur; last year was another world.</p><p>The View from Everywhere</p><p>The Digital City disabuses its citizens of a key myth that structured our shared political space: that modern institutions are neutral, that they enjoy a god\u00e2??s-eye view of reality. The modern scientific enterprise, the press, the university, the justice system, the free market, the technological systems that ordered the modern world, even reason itself were understood as neutral instruments of the common good. In the Digital City, the neutrality of the common good, and so the very notion of the common good, are called into question. The clearest symptom of this may be the mounting challenges to the traditional liberal order and its key institutions, as well as the sudden and dramatic disrepute of the idea of centrism and political compromise.</p><p>In the Digital City, it is increasingly difficult to believe in the neutrality or objectivity of these institutions. This is not because arguments against the liberal order have won the day. Indeed, to believe as much would be to assume that the Analog City still rules. Rather, our trouble believing in neutrality is in part because of the new arrangement of social relations through digital media, which sustains the proliferation of niche identities and brings these into volatile proximity with one another. This new social order is hyper-pluralistic, a place of ceaseless and irresolvable conflict. Our identities take shape as we self-select into ever more narrow subcultures, and we are then drawn together in public forums lacking a sense of a greater whole to which we might all belong.</p><p>The effect is a deeper experience of plurality, without any countervailing centripetal forces. Sundered into multiplicity and without recourse to a common narrative thread, we are bereft of a view of the world held in common. Civility, consensus, and compromise take on the character of fantasies entertained by the na\u00c3\u00afve or foisted on the public by a self-interested elite.</p><p>The Self Does Not Compute</p><p>The new condition of the self in the Digital City may come into clearer view if we draw on Walter Benjamin\u00e2??s 1939 essay \u00e2??The Work of Art in the Age of Its Technological Reproducibility,\u00e2? as some of his ideas about art also apply now to our digitally crafted identities. The best known element of Benjamin\u00e2??s essay is his discussion of a work of art\u00e2??s \u00e2??aura\u00e2? -- its material and historical uniqueness, its authenticity and authority as the only original there is. \u00e2??In even the most perfect reproduction,\u00e2? Benjamin argues, \u00e2??one thing is lacking: the here and now of the work of art -- its unique existence in a particular place.\u00e2?</p><p>So it is with the experience of the self in the age of its digital reproducibility. When I encounter digital reproductions of the self, my own or that of others, their physical presence is neither here nor now.</p><p>There are at least two consequences. First, digital reproductions of the self do not elicit the moral recognition that attends the embodied self in the here and now. I can tear a reproduction of a Rembrandt without repercussion and without much hesitation; I cannot do so with an original. So I might feel myself at liberty to tear into a digital reproduction of a person in a way that I would not if he or she were present before me.</p><p>Second, in the age of digital reproducibility, the self no longer appears unique; the romantic idea of some ineffable essence that is me loses its power. The self that is rendered computable, and thus legible to the tools of computation, is an impoverished self, one whose aura has dissipated.</p><p>We can further draw on Benjamin\u00e2??s discussion of what he calls the \u00e2??optical unconscious,\u00e2? the capacity of cameras to reveal what the unaided eye cannot perceive:</p><p>\u00e2??With the close-up, space expands; with slow motion, movement is extended. And just as enlargement not merely clarifies what we see indistinctly \u00e2??in any case,\u00e2?? but brings to light entirely new structures of matter, slow motion not only reveals familiar aspects of movements, but discloses quite unknown aspects within them.\u00e2?</p><p>Just as what is uncovered by film was unknown but always there, so, too, does digital media reveal aspects of our social experience that were always there but not always perceived. But what digital media reveals about the character and quality of social life, it also transforms.</p><p>Take for instance the identity of those with whom I associate. When I moved to a new city to take my first job after college, there was no practical way for someone I met to peruse the names and interests of my high school and college friends. My analog social network, something I myself might not have been able to map well, was not immediately accessible to new acquaintances. Today, unless I take deliberate steps to prevent it, my social networks are easily accessible and searchable. My prior associations are no longer hidden from view, and their power to define me in a new setting is no longer entirely up to me. What is revealed of me also transforms me.</p><p>Consider, too, how we present ourselves online. As sociologist Erving Goffman observed in The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life (1959), we have always managed our impressions in keeping with the nature of our social settings. An attentive observer who followed me around from one such setting to another might be able to identify these often subtle modulations of my self-presentation, modulations to which I myself might have become oblivious. But now that social life has been digitized, I become keenly aware of myself engaging in the work of impression management, and I know, or at least I suspect, that everyone else is involved in the same activity. As a result, we experience the digital self as an artificial construct or, worse, as a self-interested manipulation of social relations.</p><p>The digitization of social life has also enabled us to trace the detailed movements of ideas and influences, making it difficult to think of ourselves as spontaneous, original actors in our own dramas. Again, keen observers might have always been able to trace such lines, but now we are all overtly conscious of the flows of social capital, and we have receipts. The social dynamics that were once shrouded in forgiving shadows of obscurity have now become transparent. Transparency itself has become a virtue. What do we have to hide, anyway? But this is misguided. Transparency of this sort can be unforgiving and unrelenting. It can exhaust and demoralize. It threatens intimacy and risks transforming our relationships into social-Darwinist struggles for survival. We have gained a heightened awareness and self-consciousness of the mechanics and machinations of social life.</p><p>The databases of memory, the revealed traces of social life, a view of the self not as a thing to be disclosed but rather marketed: together they generate an intolerable ironic load. They lend all social interactions the quality of a self-interested and inescapable game in which all participants are to some degree acting in bad faith. Under these conditions, to credit the Other\u00e2??s appeals to public-spiritedness as genuine rather than a guise for self-interest, to believe that he truly has the common good in view, requires a great leap of faith.</p><p>Chastened Expectations</p><p>One way to understand our moment is to recognize that digital technology is reconfiguring the nature of the self that enters into the political arena, even as it restructures the arena itself. The contrast between those who mainly inhabit the Digital City and those who still primarily inhabit the Analog City becomes increasingly stark. Simple appeals to conventions and solutions grounded in the Analog City now ring hollow. The old virtues and ideals, as well as the institutions they sustained, have lost their purchase on the imagination. They have lost their \u00e2??self-evident\u00e2? character. Like the early moderns, our reigning world picture has shattered and we are casting about for new ways of building consensus, new ways of coping with the challenges of pluralism, new ways of ordering society toward the common good. At the moment, however, it appears that digital media tends toward political and epistemic fragmentation, not consensus, and toward the implausibility of any substantive account of the common good. In other words, it may be that things will get worse before they get better.</p><p>In a 1982 talk on the cultural and political consequences of computation, Ivan Illich issued a warning that is even more urgent today:</p><p>\u00e2??The machine-like behavior of people chained to electronics constitutes a degradation of their well-being and of their dignity which, for most people in the long run, becomes intolerable. Observations of the sickening effect of programmed environments show that people in them become indolent, impotent, narcissistic and apolitical. The political process breaks down, because people cease to be able to govern themselves; they demand to be managed.\u00e2?</p><p>We have focused on how digital media transforms the subjective experience of individuals. The political corollary is that it enables and empowers regimes of algorithmic governance, predictive analytics, and social credit. The profound erosion of trust in the Digital City leaves a vacuum, and we look to our tools to fill it. We seem set upon interlocking trajectories: of ever greater swaths of the human experience being computationally managed, and of intractable human subjects increasingly breaking down or revolting against these conditions.</p><p>From another vantage point, however, we might see this as a hopeful moment, full of promise and opportunity. Another path also seems possible. Freed from certain unsustainable illusions about the nature of the self and the world, we may now be called back to reckon with reality in a new, more chastened and more responsible manner. It is possible that the Promethean aspirations that characterized the modern self and modern society may now yield to a more sober assessment of the limits within which genuine human flourishing might occur. It is possible, too, that we may learn once again the necessity of virtues, public and private -- that we will no longer, as T. S. Eliot put it, be \u00e2??dreaming of systems so perfect that no one will need to be good.\u00e2?</p><p>***</p><p>L. M.

If you have a few percentage points on imports pushing up prices, what matters is how much people are paid. And disruption to businesses and supply chains, and it is how we are supporting those businesses, which is all about government policy and not just the nature of the deal. The Economist's overview of this is absolutely right. </p><p>But this is about preventing civil disturbance. Is this just project fear? A lot of people argue that. A lot of people are talking about us leaving on the 29th of March, but I think there will be more likely to be civil disturbances if we don't leave on the 29th of March because a lot of people feel completely let down. I still think, and I hate to say it, that the most likely thing is that we will apply to extend Article 50. I don't want to do that. Adam Boulton has got a very interesting column. He thinks Theresa May's deal might make it through. He thinks it will go through and we leave on the 29th of March and I hope he is right. Lots of other stories to talk about. The big story in the United States, talking about blinking. President Trump has blinked and withdrawn the shutdown of Congress. Blinking is not really what you associate with Donald Trump and he has blinked twice this week, once with Nancy Pelosi on giving the state of the Union address on Tuesday, and now on the wall and whether the government should be reopened. This will cause him a lot of trouble with his base. If he loses it, he has no one else to go and nobody else will vote for him. And the right are already attacking him. Absolutely. There is a picture of that right-wing commentator there. A lot of people will wonder what he is playing at. And of course the arrest of Roger Stone, the Mellor inquiry, the evidence coming up, fascinating. The vast majority of people in the opinion polls blame Donald Trump for this, which is interesting. A lot of the blame is directed at Congress, draining the swamp, dissatisfaction, that this undermines Donald Trump's central claim which is that he speaks for ordinary people against inefficient Congress on Capitol Hill. The next words I must say in the paper review today are Molly Russell, the girl who killed herself, and the Sunday Times has a very strong story here and it is in the papers as well, and Matt Hancock has been involved as well, about the culpability of big tech companies feeding images and stories and suggestions to vulnerable young people about self-harm and ultimately suicide. And they are doing that. There is no doubt about it. They said how can we police it properly? I was listening to an interview with the head of Instagram the other day and he was uttering all the things you would expect, that there is no comprehension of the damage that this sort of thing is doing, particularly to young teenage girls. Not just girls actually, boys as well. I think there is a specific issue here, the issues around self-harm at the images presented online and a more general issue. Who has the power here? The nation state, which is able to legislate an impotent regulation on big tech companies, or is a multi national monopolies and we haven't really grappled with that yet. I will use present a's privilege to wrap this up. There is a lot of comment about Hugh McIlvanney, who wrote for The Observer and the Sunday Times, and this is just a taste of why people remember him. We should have known that Muhammad Ali would not settle after the Rumble in the jungle for any ordinary resurrection. He had to have an additional flourish. Having rolled away the rock, he hit George Foreman on the head with it. Much more to talk about there that we have run out of time. Thank you much indeed. Among the proposals likely to be voted on Tuesday is one from Yvette Cooper, the Labour MP and Chair of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee. It would allow time for a new law which would mean that if Theresa May hasn't got a deal by the end of February, she has to ask the EU to delay Brexit for up to nine months. For its supporters it puts off the nightmare of a no deal but other MPs think it makes things too easy for the EU and may result in no Brexit at all. Yvette Cooper is with me now. Yvette Cooper, good morning. A lot of your own constituents, in a Lead constituency, 69% voted to leave, feel you are betraying Brexit with this. I think we have got to get a workable deal and for me that includes a customs union but I do not want to see a no deal hit my constituents, in particular the manufacturing jobs that we have got in Harrah beau, in their very, Macintoshes sold all over the world. -- Haribo and Burberry. Manufacturers are telling me they want a good Brexit deal that they are really worried about no deal and that is what I am trying to avoid. I want the government to take responsibility and sort this out.

If you have a few percentage points on imports pushing up prices, what matters is how much people are paid. And disruption to businesses and supply chains, and it is how we are supporting those businesses, which is all about government policy and not just the nature of the deal. The Economist's overview of this is absolutely right. </p><p>But this is about preventing civil disturbance. Is this just project fear? A lot of people argue that. A lot of people are talking about us leaving on the 29th of March, but I think there will be more likely to be civil disturbances if we don't leave on the 29th of March because a lot of people feel completely let down. I still think, and I hate to say it, that the most likely thing is that we will apply to extend Article 50. I don't want to do that. Adam Boulton has got a very interesting column. He thinks Theresa May's deal might make it through. He thinks it will go through and we leave on the 29th of March and I hope he is right. Lots of other stories to talk about. The big story in the United States, talking about blinking. President Trump has blinked and withdrawn the shutdown of Congress. Blinking is not really what you associate with Donald Trump and he has blinked twice this week, once with Nancy Pelosi on giving the state of the Union address on Tuesday, and now on the wall and whether the government should be reopened. This will cause him a lot of trouble with his base. If he loses it, he has no one else to go and nobody else will vote for him. And the right are already attacking him. Absolutely. There is a picture of that right-wing commentator there. A lot of people will wonder what he is playing at. And of course the arrest of Roger Stone, the Mellor inquiry, the evidence coming up, fascinating. The vast majority of people in the opinion polls blame Donald Trump for this, which is interesting. A lot of the blame is directed at Congress, draining the swamp, dissatisfaction, that this undermines Donald Trump's central claim which is that he speaks for ordinary people against inefficient Congress on Capitol Hill. The next words I must say in the paper review today are Molly Russell, the girl who killed herself, and the Sunday Times has a very strong story here and it is in the papers as well, and Matt Hancock has been involved as well, about the culpability of big tech companies feeding images and stories and suggestions to vulnerable young people about self-harm and ultimately suicide. And they are doing that. There is no doubt about it. They said how can we police it properly? I was listening to an interview with the head of Instagram the other day and he was uttering all the things you would expect, that there is no comprehension of the damage that this sort of thing is doing, particularly to young teenage girls. Not just girls actually, boys as well. I think there is a specific issue here, the issues around self-harm at the images presented online and a more general issue. Who has the power here? The nation state, which is able to legislate an impotent regulation on big tech companies, or is a multi national monopolies and we haven't really grappled with that yet. I will use present a's privilege to wrap this up. There is a lot of comment about Hugh McIlvanney, who wrote for The Observer and the Sunday Times, and this is just a taste of why people remember him. We should have known that Muhammad Ali would not settle after the Rumble in the jungle for any ordinary resurrection. He had to have an additional flourish. Having rolled away the rock, he hit George Foreman on the head with it. Much more to talk about there that we have run out of time. Thank you much indeed. to be voted on Tuesday Among the proposals likely the Labour MP and Chair is one from Yvette Cooper, Affairs Select Committee. of the Commons Home which would mean that if Theresa May It would allow time for a new law of February, she has to ask hasn't got a deal by the end for up to nine months. the EU to delay Brexit the nightmare of a no deal but other For its supporters it puts off for the EU and may result MPs think it makes things too easy in no Brexit at all. Yvette Cooper is with me now. of your own constituents, in a Lead Yvette Cooper, good morning. A lot constituency, 69% voted to leave, feel you are betraying Brexit with this. I think we have got to get a workable deal and for me that includes a customs union but I do not want to see a no deal hit my constituents, in particular the manufacturing jobs that we have got in Harrah beau, in their very, Macintoshes sold all over the world. -- Haribo and Burberry. Manufacturers are telling me they want a good Brexit deal that they are really worried about no deal and that is what I am trying to avoid. I want the government to take responsibility and sort this out.

I still think, and I hate to say it, that the most likely thing is that we will apply to extend Article 50. I don't want to do that. Adam Boulton has got a very interesting column. He thinks Theresa May's deal might make it through. He thinks it will go through and we leave on the 29th of March and I hope he is right. Lots of other stories to talk about. The big story in the United States, talking about blinking. President Trump has blinked and withdrawn the shutdown of Congress. Blinking is not really what you associate with Donald Trump and he has blinked twice this week, once with Nancy Pelosi on giving the state of the Union address on Tuesday, and now on the wall and whether the government should be reopened. This will cause him a lot of trouble with his base. If he loses it, he has no one else to go and nobody else will vote for him. And the right are already attacking him. Absolutely. There is a picture of that right-wing commentator there. A lot of people will wonder what he is playing at. And of course the arrest of Roger Stone, the Mellor inquiry, the evidence coming up, fascinating. The vast majority of people in the opinion polls blame Donald Trump for this, which is interesting. A lot of the blame is directed at Congress, draining the swamp, dissatisfaction, that this undermines Donald Trump's central claim which is that he speaks for ordinary people against inefficient Congress on Capitol Hill. The next words I must say in the paper review today are Molly Russell, the girl who killed herself, and the Sunday Times has a very strong story here and it is in the papers as well, and Matt Hancock has been involved as well, about the culpability of big tech companies feeding images and stories and suggestions to vulnerable young people about self-harm and ultimately suicide. And they are doing that. There is no doubt about it. They said how can we police it properly? I was listening to an interview with the head of Instagram the other day and he was uttering all the things you would expect, that there is no comprehension of the damage that this sort of thing is doing, particularly to young teenage girls. Not just girls actually, boys as well. I think there is a specific issue here, the issues around self-harm at the images presented online and a more general issue. Who has the power here? The nation state, which is able to legislate an impotent regulation on big tech companies, or is a multi national monopolies and we haven't really grappled with that yet. I will use present a's privilege to wrap this up. There is a lot of comment about Hugh McIlvanney, who wrote for The Observer and the Sunday Times, and this is just a taste of why people remember him. We should have known that Muhammad Ali would not settle after the Rumble in the jungle for any ordinary resurrection. He had to have an additional flourish. Having rolled away the rock, he hit George Foreman on the head with it. Much more to talk about there that we have run out of time. Thank you much indeed. Among the proposals likely to be voted on Tuesday is one from Yvette Cooper, the Labour MP and Chair of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee. It would allow time for a new law which would mean that if Theresa May hasn't got a deal by the end of February, she has to ask the EU to delay Brexit for up to nine months. For its supporters it puts off the nightmare of a no deal but other MPs think it makes things too easy for the EU and may result in no Brexit at all. Yvette Cooper is with me now. Yvette Cooper, good morning. A lot of your own constituents, in a Lead constituency, 69% voted to leave, feel you are betraying Brexit with this. I think we have got to get a workable deal and for me that includes a customs union but I do not want to see a no deal hit my constituents, in particular the manufacturing jobs that we have got in Harrah beau, in their very, Macintoshes sold all over the world. -- Haribo and Burberry. Manufacturers are telling me they want a good Brexit deal that they are really worried about no deal and that is what I am trying to avoid. I want the government to take responsibility and sort this out.

If you have a few percentage points on imports pushing up prices, what matters is how much people are paid. And disruption to businesses and supply chains, and it is how we are supporting those businesses, which is all about government policy and not just the nature of the deal. The Economist's overview of this is absolutely right. </p><p>But this is about preventing civil disturbance. Is this just project fear? A lot of people argue that. A lot of people are talking about us leaving on the 29th of March, but I think there will be more likely to be civil disturbances if we don't leave on the 29th of March because a lot of people feel completely let down. I still think, and I hate to say it, that the most likely thing is that we will apply to extend Article 50. I don't want to do that. Adam Boulton has got a very interesting column. He thinks Theresa May's deal might make it through. He thinks it will go through and we leave on the 29th of March and I hope he is right. Lots of other stories to talk about. The big story in the United States, talking about blinking. President Trump has blinked and withdrawn the shutdown of Congress. Blinking is not really what you associate with Donald Trump and he has blinked twice this week, once with Nancy Pelosi on giving the state of the Union address on Tuesday, and now on the wall and whether the government should be reopened. This will cause him a lot of trouble with his base. If he loses it, he has no one else to go and nobody else will vote for him. And the right are already attacking him. Absolutely. There is a picture of that right-wing commentator there. A lot of people will wonder what he is playing at. And of course the arrest of Roger Stone, the Mellor inquiry, the evidence coming up, fascinating. The vast majority of people in the opinion polls blame Donald Trump for this, which is interesting. A lot of the blame is directed at Congress, draining the swamp, dissatisfaction, that this undermines Donald Trump's central claim which is that he speaks for ordinary people against inefficient Congress on Capitol Hill. The next words I must say in the paper review today are Molly Russell, the girl who killed herself, and the Sunday Times has a very strong story here and it is in the papers as well, and Matt Hancock has been involved as well, about the culpability of big tech companies feeding images and stories and suggestions to vulnerable young people about self-harm and ultimately suicide. And they are doing that. There is no doubt about it. They said how can we police it properly? I was listening to an interview with the head of Instagram the other day and he was uttering all the things you would expect, that there is no comprehension of the damage that this sort of thing is doing, particularly to young teenage girls. Not just girls actually, boys as well. I think there is a specific issue here, the issues around self-harm at the images presented online and a more general issue. Who has the power here? The nation state, which is able to legislate an impotent regulation on big tech companies, or is a multi national monopolies and we haven't really grappled with that yet. I will use present a's privilege to wrap this up. There is a lot of comment about Hugh McIlvanney, who wrote for The Observer and the Sunday Times, and this is just a taste of why people remember him. We should have known that Muhammad Ali would not settle after the Rumble in the jungle for any ordinary resurrection. He had to have an additional flourish.

For its supporters it puts off the nightmare of a no deal but other MPs think it makes things too easy for the EU and may result in no Brexit at all. Yvette Cooper is with me now.

We should have known that Muhammad Ali would not settle after the Rumble in the jungle for any ordinary resurrection. He had to have an additional flourish. Having rolled away the rock, he hit George Foreman on the head with it. Much more to talk about there that we have run out of time. Thank you much indeed. Among the proposals likely to be voted on Tuesday is one from Yvette Cooper, the Labour MP and Chair of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee. It would allow time for a new law which would mean that if Theresa May hasn't got a deal by the end of February, she has to ask the EU to delay Brexit for up to nine months. For its supporters it puts off the nightmare of a no deal but other MPs think it makes things too easy for the EU and may result in no Brexit at all. Yvette Cooper is with me now. Yvette Cooper, good morning. A lot of your own constituents, in a Lead constituency, 69% voted to leave, feel you are betraying Brexit with this. I think we have got to get a workable deal and for me that includes a customs union but I do not want to see a no deal hit my constituents, in particular the manufacturing jobs that we have got in Harrah beau, in their very, Macintoshes sold all over the world. -- Haribo and Burberry. Manufacturers are telling me they want a good Brexit deal that they are really worried about no deal and that is what I am trying to avoid. I want the government to take responsibility and sort this out.

If you have a few percentage points on imports pushing up prices, what matters is how much people are paid. And disruption to businesses and supply chains, and it is how we are supporting those businesses, which is all about government policy and not just the nature of the deal. The Economist's overview of this is absolutely right. </p><p>But this is about preventing civil disturbance. Is this just project fear? A lot of people argue that. A lot of people are talking about us leaving on the 29th of March, but I think there will be more likely to be civil disturbances if we don't leave on the 29th of March because a lot of people feel completely let down. I still think, and I hate to say it, that the most likely thing is that we will apply to extend Article 50. I don't want to do that. Adam Boulton has got a very interesting column. He thinks Theresa May's deal might make it through. He thinks it will go through and we leave on the 29th of March and I hope he is right. Lots of other stories to talk about. The big story in the United States, talking about blinking. President Trump has blinked and withdrawn the shutdown of Congress. Blinking is not really what you associate with Donald Trump and he has blinked twice this week, once with Nancy Pelosi on giving the state of the Union address on Tuesday, and now on the wall and whether the government should be reopened. This will cause him a lot of trouble with his base. If he loses it, he has no one else to go and nobody else will vote for him. And the right are already attacking him. Absolutely. There is a picture of that right-wing commentator there. A lot of people will wonder what he is playing at. And of course the arrest of Roger Stone, the Mellor inquiry, the evidence coming up, fascinating. The vast majority of people in the opinion polls blame Donald Trump for this, which is interesting. A lot of the blame is directed at Congress, draining the swamp, dissatisfaction, that this undermines Donald Trump's central claim which is that he speaks for ordinary people against inefficient Congress on Capitol Hill. The next words I must say in the paper review today are Molly Russell, the girl who killed herself, and the Sunday Times has a very strong story here and it is in the papers as well, and Matt Hancock has been involved as well, about the culpability of big tech companies feeding images and stories and suggestions to vulnerable young people about self-harm and ultimately suicide. And they are doing that. There is no doubt about it. They said how can we police it properly? I was listening to an interview with the head of Instagram the other day and he was uttering all the things you would expect, that there is no comprehension of the damage that this sort of thing is doing, particularly to young teenage girls. Not just girls actually, boys as well. I think there is a specific issue here, the issues around self-harm at the images presented online and a more general issue. Who has the power here? The nation state, which is able to legislate an impotent regulation on big tech companies, or is a multi national monopolies and we haven't really grappled with that yet. I will use present a's privilege to wrap this up. There is a lot of comment about Hugh McIlvanney, who wrote for The Observer and the Sunday Times, and this is just a taste of why people remember him. We should have known that Muhammad Ali would not settle after the Rumble in the jungle for any ordinary resurrection. He had to have an additional flourish. Having rolled away the rock, he hit George Foreman on the head with it. Much more to talk about there that we have run out of time. Thank you much indeed. Among the proposals likely to be voted on Tuesday is one from Yvette Cooper, the Labour MP and Chair of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee. It would allow time for a new law which would mean that if Theresa May hasn't got a deal by the end of February, she has to ask the EU to delay Brexit for up to nine months. For its supporters it puts off the nightmare of a no deal but other MPs think it makes things too easy for the EU and may result in no Brexit at all. Yvette Cooper is with me now. Yvette Cooper, good morning. A lot of your own constituents, in a Lead constituency, 69% voted to leave, feel you are betraying Brexit with this. I think we have got to get a workable deal and for me that includes a customs union but I do not want to see a no deal hit my constituents, in particular the manufacturing jobs that we have got in Harrah beau, in their very, Macintoshes sold all over the world. -- Haribo and Burberry.

If you have a few percentage points on imports pushing up prices, what matters is how much people are paid. And disruption to businesses and supply chains, and it is how we are supporting those businesses, which is all about government policy and not just the nature of the deal. The Economist's overview of this is absolutely right. </p><p>But this is about preventing civil disturbance. Is this just project fear? A lot of people argue that. A lot of people are talking about us leaving on the 29th of March, but I think there will be more likely to be civil disturbances if we don't leave on the 29th of March because a lot of people feel completely let down. I still think, and I hate to say it, that the most likely thing is that we will apply to extend Article 50. I don't want to do that. Adam Boulton has got a very interesting column. He thinks Theresa May's deal might make it through. He thinks it will go through and we leave on the 29th of March and I hope he is right. Lots of other stories to talk about. The big story in the United States, talking about blinking. President Trump has blinked and withdrawn the shutdown of Congress. Blinking is not really what you associate with Donald Trump and he has blinked twice this week, once with Nancy Pelosi on giving the state of the Union address on Tuesday, and now on the wall and whether the government should be reopened. This will cause him a lot of trouble with his base. If he loses it, he has no one else to go and nobody else will vote for him. And the right are already attacking him. Absolutely. There is a picture of that right-wing commentator there. A lot of people will wonder what he is playing at. And of course the arrest of Roger Stone, the Mellor inquiry, the evidence coming up, fascinating. The vast majority of people in the opinion polls blame Donald Trump for this, which is interesting. A lot of the blame is directed at Congress, draining the swamp, dissatisfaction, that this undermines Donald Trump's central claim which is that he speaks for ordinary people against inefficient Congress on Capitol Hill. The next words I must say in the paper review today are Molly Russell, the girl who killed herself, and the Sunday Times has a very strong story here and it is in the papers as well, and Matt Hancock has been involved as well, about the culpability of big tech companies feeding images and stories and suggestions to vulnerable young people about self-harm and ultimately suicide. And they are doing that. There is no doubt about it. They said how can we police it properly? I was listening to an interview with the head of Instagram the other day and he was uttering all the things you would expect, that there is no comprehension of the damage that this sort of thing is doing, particularly to young teenage girls. Not just girls actually, boys as well. I think there is a specific issue here, the issues around self-harm at the images presented online and a more general issue. Who has the power here? The nation state, which is able to legislate an impotent regulation on big tech companies, or is a multi national monopolies and we haven't really grappled with that yet. I will use present a's privilege to wrap this up. There is a lot of comment about Hugh McIlvanney, who wrote for The Observer and the Sunday Times, and this is just a taste of why people remember him. We should have known that Muhammad Ali would not settle after the Rumble in the jungle for any ordinary resurrection. He had to have an additional flourish. Having rolled away the rock, he hit George Foreman on the head with it. Much more to talk about there that we have run out of time. Thank you much indeed. Among the proposals likely to be voted on Tuesday is one from Yvette Cooper, the Labour MP and Chair of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee. It would allow time for a new law which would mean that if Theresa May hasn't got a deal by the end of February, she has to ask the EU to delay Brexit for up to nine months. For its supporters it puts off the nightmare of a no deal but other MPs think it makes things too easy for the EU and may result in no Brexit at all. Yvette Cooper is with me now. Yvette Cooper, good morning. A lot of your own constituents, in a Lead constituency, 69% voted to leave, feel you are betraying Brexit with this. I think we have got to get a workable deal and for me that includes a customs union but I do not want to see a no deal hit my constituents, in particular the manufacturing jobs that we have got in Harrah beau, in their very, Macintoshes sold all over the world. -- Haribo and Burberry. Manufacturers are telling me they want a good Brexit deal that they are really worried about no deal and that is what I am trying to avoid. I want the government to take responsibility and sort this out.

If you have a few percentage points on imports pushing up prices, what matters is how much people are paid. And disruption to businesses and supply chains, and it is how we are supporting those businesses, which is all about government policy and not just the nature of the deal. The Economist's overview of this is absolutely right. </p><p>But this is about preventing civil disturbance. Is this just project fear? A lot of people argue that. A lot of people are talking about us leaving on the 29th of March, but I think there will be more likely to be civil disturbances if we don't leave on the 29th of March because a lot of people feel completely let down. I still think, and I hate to say it, that the most likely thing is that we will apply to extend Article 50. I don't want to do that. Adam Boulton has got a very interesting column. He thinks Theresa May's deal might make it through. He thinks it will go through and we leave on the 29th of March and I hope he is right. Lots of other stories to talk about. The big story in the United States, talking about blinking. President Trump has blinked and withdrawn the shutdown of Congress. Blinking is not really what you associate with Donald Trump and he has blinked twice this week, once with Nancy Pelosi on giving the state of the Union address on Tuesday, and now on the wall and whether the government should be reopened. This will cause him a lot of trouble with his base. If he loses it, he has no one else to go and nobody else will vote for him. And the right are already attacking him. Absolutely. There is a picture of that right-wing commentator there. A lot of people will wonder what he is playing at. And of course the arrest of Roger Stone, the Mellor inquiry, the evidence coming up, fascinating. The vast majority of people in the opinion polls blame Donald Trump for this, which is interesting. A lot of the blame is directed at Congress, draining the swamp, dissatisfaction, that this undermines Donald Trump's central claim which is that he speaks for ordinary people against inefficient Congress on Capitol Hill. The next words I must say in the paper review today are Molly Russell, the girl who killed herself, and the Sunday Times has a very strong story here and it is in the papers as well, and Matt Hancock has been involved as well, about the culpability of big tech companies feeding images and stories and suggestions to vulnerable young people about self-harm and ultimately suicide. And they are doing that. There is no doubt about it. They said how can we police it properly? I was listening to an interview with the head of Instagram the other day and he was uttering all the things you would expect, that there is no comprehension of the damage that this sort of thing is doing, particularly to young teenage girls. Not just girls actually, boys as well. I think there is a specific issue here, the issues around self-harm at the images presented online and a more general issue. Who has the power here? The nation state, which is able to legislate an impotent regulation on big tech companies, or is a multi national monopolies and we haven't really grappled with that yet. I will use present a's privilege to wrap this up. There is a lot of comment about Hugh McIlvanney, who wrote for The Observer and the Sunday Times, and this is just a taste of why people remember him. We should have known that Muhammad Ali would not settle after the Rumble in the jungle for any ordinary resurrection. He had to have an additional flourish. Having rolled away the rock, he hit George Foreman on the head with it. Much more to talk about there that we have run out of time. Thank you much indeed. Among the proposals likely to be voted on Tuesday is one from Yvette Cooper, the Labour MP and Chair of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee. It would allow time for a new law which would mean that if Theresa May hasn't got a deal by the end of February, she has to ask the EU to delay Brexit for up to nine months. For its supporters it puts off the nightmare of a no deal but other MPs think it makes things too easy for the EU and may result in no Brexit at all. Yvette Cooper is with me now. Yvette Cooper, good morning. A lot of your own constituents, in a Lead constituency, 69% voted to leave, feel you are betraying Brexit with this. I think we have got to get a workable deal and for me that includes a customs union but I do not want to see a no deal hit my constituents, in particular the manufacturing jobs that we have got in Harrah beau, in their very, Macintoshes sold all over the world. -- Haribo and Burberry.

If you have a few percentage points on imports pushing up prices, what matters is how much people are paid. And disruption to businesses and supply chains, and it is how we are supporting those businesses, which is all about government policy and not just the nature of the deal. The Economist's overview of this is absolutely right. </p><p>But this is about preventing civil disturbance. Is this just project fear? A lot of people argue that. A lot of people are talking about us leaving on the 29th of March, but I think there will be more likely to be civil disturbances if we don't leave on the 29th of March because a lot of people feel completely let down. I still think, and I hate to say it, that the most likely thing is that we will apply to extend Article 50. I don't want to do that. Adam Boulton has got a very interesting column. He thinks Theresa May's deal might make it through. He thinks it will go through and we leave on the 29th of March and I hope he is right. Lots of other stories to talk about. The big story in the United States, talking about blinking. President Trump has blinked and withdrawn the shutdown of Congress. Blinking is not really what you associate with Donald Trump and he has blinked twice this week, once with Nancy Pelosi on giving the state of the Union address on Tuesday, and now on the wall and whether the government should be reopened. This will cause him a lot of trouble with his base. If he loses it, he has no one else to go and nobody else will vote for him. And the right are already attacking him. Absolutely. There is a picture of that right-wing commentator there. A lot of people will wonder what he is playing at. And of course the arrest of Roger Stone, the Mellor inquiry, the evidence coming up, fascinating. The vast majority of people in the opinion polls blame Donald Trump for this, which is interesting. A lot of the blame is directed at Congress, draining the swamp, dissatisfaction, that this undermines Donald Trump's central claim which is that he speaks for ordinary people against inefficient Congress on Capitol Hill. The next words I must say in the paper review today are Molly Russell, the girl who killed herself, and the Sunday Times has a very strong story here and it is in the papers as well, and Matt Hancock has been involved as well, about the culpability of big tech companies feeding images and stories and suggestions to vulnerable young people about self-harm and ultimately suicide. And they are doing that. There is no doubt about it. They said how can we police it properly? I was listening to an interview with the head of Instagram the other day and he was uttering all the things you would expect, that there is no comprehension of the damage that this sort of thing is doing, particularly to young teenage girls. Not just girls actually, boys as well. I think there is a specific issue here, the issues around self-harm at the images presented online and a more general issue. Who has the power here? The nation state, which is able to legislate an impotent regulation on big tech companies, or is a multi national monopolies and we haven't really grappled with that yet. I will use present a's privilege to wrap this up. There is a lot of comment about Hugh McIlvanney, who wrote for The Observer and the Sunday Times, and this is just a taste of why people remember him. We should have known that Muhammad Ali would not settle after the Rumble in the jungle for any ordinary resurrection. He had to have an additional flourish. Having rolled away the rock, he hit George Foreman on the head with it. Much more to talk about there that we have run out of time. Thank you much indeed. Among the proposals likely to be voted on Tuesday is one from Yvette Cooper, the Labour MP and Chair of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee. It would allow time for a new law which would mean that if Theresa May hasn't got a deal by the end of February, she has to ask the EU to delay Brexit for up to nine months. For its supporters it puts off the nightmare of a no deal but other MPs think it makes things too easy for the EU and may result in no Brexit at all. Yvette Cooper is with me now. Yvette Cooper, good morning. A lot of your own constituents, in a Lead constituency, 69% voted to leave, feel you are betraying Brexit with this. I think we have got to get a workable deal and for me that includes a customs union but I do not want to see a no deal hit my constituents, in particular the manufacturing jobs that we have got in Harrah beau, in their very, Macintoshes sold all over the world. -- Haribo and Burberry. Manufacturers are telling me they want a good Brexit deal that they are really worried about no deal and that is what I am trying to avoid. I want the government to take responsibility and sort this out. What do you say to people who say</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1SO-92d4bffbf26445e5ae02d338b423f563</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1SO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V91-3Y51-JBH6-C4Y6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400437</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"836\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

The Economist's overview of this is absolutely right. </p><p>But this is about preventing civil disturbance. Is this just project fear? A lot of people argue that. A lot of people are talking about us leaving on the 29th of March, but I think there will be more likely to be civil disturbances if we don't leave on the 29th of March because a lot of people feel completely let down. I still think, and I hate to say it, that the most likely thing is that we will apply to extend Article 50. I don't want to do that. Adam Boulton has got a very interesting column. He thinks Theresa May's deal might make it through. He thinks it will go through and we leave on the 29th of March and I hope he is right. Lots of other stories to talk about. The big story in the United States, talking about blinking. President Trump has blinked and withdrawn the shutdown of Congress. Blinking is not really what you associate with Donald Trump and he has blinked twice this week, once with Nancy Pelosi on giving the state of the Union address on Tuesday, and now on the wall and whether the government should be reopened. This will cause him a lot of trouble with his base. If he loses it, he has no one else to go and nobody else will vote for him. And the right are already attacking him. Absolutely. There is a picture of that right-wing commentator there. A lot of people will wonder what he is playing at. And of course the arrest of Roger Stone, the Mellor inquiry, the evidence coming up, fascinating. The vast majority of people in the opinion polls blame Donald Trump for this, which is interesting. A lot of the blame is directed at Congress, draining the swamp, dissatisfaction, that this undermines Donald Trump's central claim which is that he speaks for ordinary people against inefficient Congress on Capitol Hill. The next words I must say in the paper review today are Molly Russell, the girl who killed herself, and the Sunday Times has a very strong story here and it is in the papers as well, and Matt Hancock has been involved as well, about the culpability of big tech companies feeding images and stories and suggestions to vulnerable young people about self-harm and ultimately suicide. And they are doing that. There is no doubt about it. They said how can we police it properly? I was listening to an interview with the head of Instagram the other day and he was uttering all the things you would expect, that there is no comprehension of the damage that this sort of thing is doing, particularly to young teenage girls. Not just girls actually, boys as well. I think there is a specific issue here, the issues around self-harm at the images presented online and a more general issue. Who has the power here? The nation state, which is able to legislate an impotent regulation on big tech companies, or is a multi national monopolies and we haven't really grappled with that yet. I will use present a's privilege to wrap this up. There is a lot of comment about Hugh McIlvanney, who wrote for The Observer and the Sunday Times, and this is just a taste of why people remember him. We should have known that Muhammad Ali would not settle after the Rumble in the jungle for any ordinary resurrection. He had to have an additional flourish. Having rolled away the rock, he hit George Foreman on the head with it. Much more to talk about there that we have run out of time. Thank you much indeed. Among the proposals likely to be voted on Tuesday is one from Yvette Cooper, the Labour MP and Chair of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee. It would allow time for a new law which would mean that if Theresa May hasn't got a deal by the end of February, she has to ask the EU to delay Brexit for up to nine months. For its supporters it puts off the nightmare of a no deal but other MPs think it makes things too easy for the EU and may result in no Brexit at all. Yvette Cooper is with me now. Yvette Cooper, good morning. A lot of your own constituents, in a Lead constituency, 69% voted to leave, feel you are betraying Brexit with this. I think we have got to get a workable deal and for me that includes a customs union but I do not want to see a no deal hit my constituents, in particular the manufacturing jobs that we have got in Harrah beau, in their very, Macintoshes sold all over the world. -- Haribo and Burberry. Manufacturers are telling me they want a good Brexit deal that they are really worried about no deal and that is what I am trying to avoid. I want the government to take responsibility and sort this out. What do you say to people who say</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1WE-4cd0f21839b34669ba7bca1f8ab9a38d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1WE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V91-3Y51-JBH6-C4YB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402026</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"836\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Google hold a massive share of social media and video content consumers around the world, and they hold uniformly leftist views. Despite the fact that they theoretically want to provide services to all people, their pronounced left-wing bias has silenced many people, and believers in freedom and property rights ponder how to respond.</p><p><br/>These companies warned millions that, without Obama-era net neutrality regulations, providers may not treat all content equally. Yet on their platforms, they favor and disfavor some kinds of speech, and even deplatform other viewpoints.<br/>To their credit, the bias is hardly hidden. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey \"fully admits\" his employees' left-leaning political views, and some commentators speculate that Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg may be a 2020 Democratic Party presidential hopeful. But their perspectives appear to affect social media's products and services.<br/>In April YouTube, which is owned by Google, banned a Christian news and prophecy channel called TruNews, run by Rick Wiles. Their views may not align with those of every Christian or evangelical, but their fellow Christians' moral stances - based on their interpretation of the Word of God - can just as easily be found offensive and contrary to social media's \"community standards.\" Last year, Facebook removed Roman Catholic pages with millions of followers, including \"Father Rocky\" and \"Holy Mary Mother of God.\"<br/>The ban went beyond sectarianism. YouTube censored PragerU videos about Islamic extremism, European cultural suicide, and the chaos in socialist Venezuela. Twitter suspended Alex Jones' \"Infowars,\" but also the account of Peter Van Buren, executive director of the libertarian think-tank the Ron Paul Institute.<br/>How should Christians deal with their potential exclusion from this medium?<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\"Economic democracy\"</emphasis><br/>No one who opposes government intervention believes we should interfere in private companies' decisions. But it is important to differentiate between government intervention and what Ludwig von Mises, in his book Socialism, called \"economic democracy.\"<br/>First, users who expected those platforms to provide a useful way to share their thoughts and beliefs with their communities freely have every right to denounce these actions - and withhold their finances until service is restored.<br/>Second, entrepreneurship is never the wrong answer. We are \"called to provide\" new alternatives - instead of just complaining. We can and should develop social networks, app stores, and search engines that guarantee free speech instead of banning Christian, conservative and libertarian messages. \u00a0Moreover, leaving aside the political discussion, competition is always good. The user may demand a greater range of services that better fit their needs and interests. Whole new technological features, such as greater login security, could be the result.<br/>The answer is not complaint but entrepreneurship. As Pope John Paul II stressed in his encyclical Centessimus Annus:<br/>Man fulfils himself by using his intelligence and freedom. In so doing he utilizes the things of this world as objects and instruments and makes them his own. The foundation of the right to private initiative and ownership is to be found in this activity. By means of his work man commits himself, not only for his own sake but also for others and with others. Each person collaborates in the work of others and for their good. Man works in order to provide for the needs of his family, his community, his nation, and ultimately all humanity.<br/>In seeking to create a service to allow ourselves to be heard, we may find our true calling came in serving others. The medium may become the message.<br/>(Photo credit: Ibrahim.ID. This photo has been cropped and altered for size.
